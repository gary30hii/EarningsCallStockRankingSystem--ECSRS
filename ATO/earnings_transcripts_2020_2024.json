[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.\n I will now turn the conference over to our host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of IR and Treasurer. Thank you, sir. You may begin. \nDaniel Meziere: Thank you, Diego. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me this morning are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.\n As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 43 and are more fully described in our SEC filings.\n I will now turn the call over to Chris Forsythe. \nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and are happy that you can join us this morning. \n Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share of $4.89, compared to diluted earnings per share of $4.35 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 results included a onetime noncash income tax benefit, $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share that we recognized during the third fiscal quarter related to a legislative change in Kansas that reduced our state deferred tax rate. Excluding this nonrecurring benefit, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 was $4.72. This represents the 18th consecutive year of rising earnings per share.\n In summarizing the year, the pandemic began to impact the economies of the states we serve at the end of our winter heating season. By that time, we had earned 70% of our distribution revenue for fiscal '20. Given the economic uncertainty at that time, we were conservative about the anticipated nonresidential load loss for the third and fourth quarter. And we plan to reduce O&M activities during the third and fourth quarters to keep our employees healthy and to align spending with anticipated revenues.\n Our residential load loss during the last 6 months in the fiscal year was less severe than we had originally anticipated. And we maintained our O&M spending in the back half of the fiscal year in line with the revised guidance we issued after our second fiscal quarter. As a result, our fiscal 2020 EPS came in at the higher end of our earnings guidance range of $4.58 to $4.73.\n Taking a closer look, consolidated operating income rose over 10% to $824 million. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.\n Rate increases in both of our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $140 million. We also experienced a $14 million increase in distribution operating income, primarily due to customer growth in our Mid-Tex division. During the 12 months ended September 30, our Mid-Tex division experienced net customer growth of 1.5%. On a consolidated basis, we experienced net customer growth of 1.2% over the same period.\n We did experience a $6 million reduction in operating income, primarily due to a 13% decline in commercial consumption in our Distribution segment during the last 6 months of the year. We also experienced a $6 million decline in service order revenue, primarily due to the suspension of collection activities since March of this year.\n In our Pipeline and Storage segment, we experienced a net $14 million decrease through system revenue. Volumes declined 17% and prices declined 13% due to reduced associated gas production in the Permian Basin. Consolidated O&M expense for fiscal 2020 was flat compared to 2019, in line with our expectations. O&M in our Distribution segment was about $8 million lower than the prior year, reflecting lower employee, travel and training costs, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense.\n Lower spending in our Distribution segment was offset by higher spending for system maintenance activities in our Pipeline and Storage segment, most of which was completed during the first half of the fiscal year. Consolidated capital spending increased 14% to $1.94 billion, with 88% of our spending directed towards investments to modernize the safety, reliability and environmental performance of our system. With this spending, our team replaced approximately 845 miles in distribution and transmission pipe and 55,000 service lines across the 8 states in which we operate.\n In fiscal 2020, over 90% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $160 million in annualized operating income increases. And since the end of the fiscal year, we reached agreement with our regulators to implement an additional $106 million of annualized operating income during our fiscal 2021 first quarter.\n As of today, we have 3 filings pending seeking about $12.5 million. Slides 30 to 42 summarize our regulatory activities. During fiscal 2020, we successfully executed our long-term financing strategy while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and further enhancing our liquidity position. We completed over $1.6 billion of long-term debt and equity financing. We fully satisfied our fiscal '20 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. Under the program, we issued 4.8 million shares under forward agreements for $523 million and settled 6.1 million shares for net proceeds of $624 million.\n As of September 30, we had about $345 million remaining under equity forward arrangements. This equity financing complemented the $800 million in long-term debt financing we issued last fall and the $200 million term loan we executed in April. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization was 60% as of September 30. Additionally, due in part of the additional -- addition of $700 million of new credit facility capacity, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $2.6 billion of liquidity, including cash held in escrow under equity forward arrangements. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity leaves us well positioned as we move into fiscal 2021. Details of our financing activities, including our equity forward arrangements as well as our financial profile can be found on Slides 9 through 12.\n Looking forward, fiscal '21 will represent the tenth year of executing our operating plan to modernize our distribution, transmission and storage systems. The fundamentals of our operating plan remain the same. Yesterday, we initiated our fiscal '21 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10. Consistent with prior years, we expect about 2/3 of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate earnings per share will grow 6% to 8% per year. By fiscal '25, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.70.\n From a revenue perspective, we have assumed no material changes to our residential revenue as a result of COVID-19. However, we continue to remain cautious about our nonresidential revenue due to the continued economic uncertainty and the fact that we are now heading into the winter heating season. Although it is difficult to precisely estimate the potential load loss that we might experience, we performed multiple sensitivity scenarios as we considered our fiscal '21 earnings per share guidance.\n Slide 18 summarizes our key Distribution segment revenue attributes and provides EPS sensitivities for the full fiscal year for each 1% change in sales volumes by customer class. And as you're aware, the performance of our Pipeline and Storage segment is predominantly driven by APT. As a reminder, over 80% of APT's revenues are earned from delivery services to LDCs, including our Mid-Tex division, under a straight fixed variable rate design. The remainder of APT's revenues relates to a 3-system business and other ancillary pipeline services.\n APT only keeps 25% of the difference between actual revenues earned from these activities and the approved $69 million benchmark in its straight design. Our fiscal '21 guidance reflects current market conditions for the small portion of APT's business.\n From an O&M perspective, we have assumed that we'll execute our normal O&M program as we continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety. These activities include enhanced leak surveys, pipeline integrity work, work to address PHMSA's new integrity management rules that became effective July 1, 2020, and continued record establishment and retention.\n Similar to fiscal '20, we do have some flexibility around the timing of this O&M spending, which could help us align spending with potential changes to revenue. As we continue to focus on safely operating our system, we continue to assume O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal '25. Additional details can be found on Slides 16 and 17.\n Fiscal '21 capital spending is expected to rise about 7.5% and is expected to range from $2 billion to $2.2 billion. Approximately 85% of the spending will be dedicated to safety and reliability spending, which will also reduce methane emissions from our system. Approximately 73% of the spending will be allocated to our Distribution segment. Over 90% of our consolidated capital spending is expected to begin earning a return within 6 months of the test period end.\n Continued spending, persistent replacement and modernization will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal '25. As you can see on Slide 21, we anticipate capital spending to increase about 7% to 8% per year off of fiscal 2020 spend levels for a total of $11 billion to $12 billion over the next 5 years. This should support rate base growth of about 12% to 14% per year. This translates into an estimated rate base of $19 billion to $20 billion in fiscal '25, up from about $11 billion at the end of fiscal 2020, as you can see on Slide 22.\n Annual filing mechanisms will be the primary means through which we recover our capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy capital and generate the returns necessary to attract the capital we need to finance our investments. And these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our ongoing system modernization efforts. We have assumed no material changes to these mechanisms through fiscal '25.\n In fiscal 2021, we anticipate completing filings from $195 million to $215 million in annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years 2021 and 2022.\n Moving to Slide 24. In light of our financial performance of fiscal 2020, yesterday Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 148th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated dividend for fiscal 2021 is $2.50, an 8.7% increase over fiscal 2020. We continue to expect dividends per share to grow in line with earnings per share over the next 5 years. And we will continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 50% as it strikes the right balance between using funds to invest in the modernization of our system and providing a reasonable return to our shareholders who support our operating plans with their investments. \n This 5-year plan also continues the financing strategy that we've been executing over the last few years. It balances the interest of our customers and our investors while preserving strong credit metrics that minimize the cost of financing.  Based upon our spending assumptions, we anticipate the need to raise between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion in incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to continue to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity in order to maintain a balanced capital structure, with the targeted equity to total capitalization ratio ranging from 50% to 60%, inclusive of short-term debt. This strategy is summarized on Slide 25. And consistent with prior year plans, our financing plan has fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal 2025.\n In October, we completed a $600 million 10-year senior note issuance with a coupon of 1.5%. As a result, our overall weighted average cost of debt, as of October 1, 2020, stands at 3.94%. And our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 19 years.\n From an equity perspective, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal '20 will set us a significant portion of our expected equity needs for fiscal '21. We expect to raise the remaining equity needs for fiscal '21 through our ATM program.\n To recap, the execution of this plan to modernize our system through disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms and balanced long-term financing all support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends at 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2025.  And as you can see on Slide 26, the execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable, which will help us sustain this plan for the long-term.\n Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his remarks. Kevin? \nJohn Akers: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Atmos Energy.\n Our success in fiscal 2020 reflects the talent and dedication of our 4,700 employees. I've said it before and I will say it again today that they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. I'm extremely proud of their commitment to keep our 3.2 million customers, our 1,400 communities themselves and their families healthy and safe.\n I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank our state regulatory commissions, our many peer companies, our state gas associations as well as the American Gas Association for their assistance and support during these challenging times.\n Our robust risk management process has served us extremely well during this pandemic and will continue to guide us as we navigate our way forward. As I've shared previously, through the outstanding work of our risk management and compliance committee and our senior leadership team, all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees were well prepared when we transitioned to a digital work environment.\n As you can see in our fiscal year operating and financial performance, our team has proven their ability to execute at the highest levels in all facets of our business. \n Our move to digital work environment in March provided opportunities for us to leverage new tools to virtually connect with one another. One of the areas I want to highlight today is technical training. To date, we have trained over 900 employees, utilizing a virtual format designed by our workforce development and curriculum design teams. This has created exciting possibilities for us as this training is a critical part of our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services.\n We play a vital role in every community we serve through our safe delivery natural gas service. Also important is our time, our talent and our resources, invested in bringing out the best in our communities so they can thrive.\n For example, during September, that's Hunger Action Month, we joined forces with hundreds of local school districts, food banks and other essential organizations that provide breakfast, lunch, snacks and healthy meals that all children need to grow, develop and succeed. Additionally, we provided resources that help students read on level by third grade.\n Furthermore, during our annual week of giving in September, our employees generously pledged nearly $900,000 in donations to benefit No Kid Hungry, United Way and The Salvation Army. Atmos Energy will match our employee pledges to further support the important work these agencies do every day.\n We also donated $1 million to more than 100 local energy assistant agency and nonprofit organizations to help customers stay warm this winter or weatherize their homes.\n As Chris mentioned, over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $11 billion to $12 billion, with 88% of that capital spending focused on safety and reliability investments identified by our risk-based capital allocation strategy that includes replacing industry-identified materials such as bare steel, vintage plastic and cast iron. Our Atmos pipeline Texas investments, in addition to safety and reliability, will continue to focus on serving a growing demand, particularly in North Texas. And as Chris mentioned earlier, our Mid-Tex division had a 1.5% net customer growth this past year.\n As you can see on Slide 19, we anticipate our capital spending plan over the next 5 years will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% to 8% of our total system. Included in this amount is the replacement of the remaining cast iron pipe in our system and the replacement of all bare steel main outside of our Mid-Tex division. We also plan to replace between 100,000 and 150,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory between 20% to 25%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over the next 5 years.\n On the technology side, as part of our wireless operations network, we anticipate 75% of our system will be equipped with wireless meter reading at the end of fiscal year 2025. Additionally, through this network, we are testing the ability to wirelessly receive cathodic protection monitoring data from across our distribution and transmission systems.\n In addition to modernizing our systems, we have been focusing on other ways to further reduce our carbon footprint. We categorized our environmental focus into 5 areas: gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers.\n For example, on our gas supply it's RNG. Today, as you've heard us say before, we transport approximately 5 Bcf across our system, which is about 2% of our distribution sales volumes. We have identified several opportunities to increase the amount of RNG on our system. For example, we have just signed an interconnect agreement with a renewables company for an additional level of RNG from 3 dairy facilities. Although it is too soon to commit to how much RNG can ultimately be transported on our system, we will be working with regulators and all stakeholders to help develop frameworks for commercial viable RNG solutions to support our customers and improve the environment.\n Additionally, under the category of facility, we have 13 leadership in energy and environmental design or LEED-certified facilities and have 4 additional LEED-certified facilities planned. Of these 13 LEED facilities, 4 are certified gold and 7 are certified silver.\n LEED is a globally recognized green building certification rating system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council that provides third-party verification of efficiency and emissions reductions. For example, our annual water use at these facilities has reduced 50% to 60%, and our carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are reduced approximately 600 metric tons per year.\n In closing, the long-term fundamentals of our strategy remain the same. And as you just heard, our employees continue to execute at the highest levels and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. Our strategy is supported by the fact that we operate in constructive jurisdictions, and several of our markets continue to have a long, strong term growth potential, most notably in the DFW Metroplex, the fourth largest metropolitan area in the country.\n The successful execution of our strategy, the strength of our balance sheet and our strong liquidity leaves us well positioned to continue to safely deliver reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.\n We appreciate your time this morning and your interest in Atmos Energy. And we'll now take any questions that you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. \nInsoo Kim: My first question is on your 2021 guidance. I appreciate the commentary you gave on the sensitivities on what could happen with COVID during these winter months. But as we think about the midpoint of that guidance, are you able to give us a little more specificity as to what's embedded in terms of any demand impact net? \nChristopher Forsythe: Insoo, this is Chris. Like I said earlier, we did a number of different sensitivities, and rather than debating it with individuals, we thought by putting the sensitivities out that you see in Slide 18 would provide folks with the data that they can do to make some assumptions around what they want to think about the nonresidential load loss. But as I said, we ran multiple scenarios, and we feel like our guidance is reflective of those various scenarios.\n I also do want to point out that we've assumed a full O&M program this year and to the extent that we need to pull levers a little bit to align spending with revenues as well as keeping our employees safe. That opportunity exists for us as well. \nInsoo Kim: Got it. And just on top of that, what markets are you seeing the greatest risk to demand as we enter into these -- into those winter months? \nChristopher Forsythe: I think when we looked at our markets, in the back half of the year, Louisiana, Mississippi are -- excuse me, Mid-Tex were 2 that saw most of our -- the commercial decline that I commented on earlier. But right now, towards the back half of the year, it wasn't nearly as severe as we anticipated. It certainly recovered as we moved along through the third and fourth quarters. And we always have to continue to watch and see. I think it's also going to be contingent upon how the buyer spreads, how states may respond to containing the spreads, protecting the citizenry and also balancing the needs of the economy. \nInsoo Kim: Understood. And then looking at the longer-term guidance, you guys have been so consistent historically and given the 6% to 8% EPS, achieving most of the times at the -- or even above the upper end of that. When we look at the 5-year CAGRs through 2025 off of the 2020 actuals, it does imply a CAGR that's around 6.5%, a little bit less than some of the CAGRs that we've been calculating in prior years. How much of this is you being more just conservative versus some law of large numbers kicking in in terms of how much CapEx you're able to do or the financing plans that you currently have in place? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. I think there's an element of conservatism in our numbers this year, as I mentioned, because we're going to be cautious about what we're seeing around the nonresidential load loss as we go into the winter heating season. If you go back to the kind of midpoint of the guidance for fiscal '20, had we achieved that and then you kind of extrapolate that out, that would get you closer to 7%, I believe. \nInsoo Kim: Yes. Understood. And just one more. At what point do you think, and is this in consideration when you look over this new 5-year time frame in creating potentially a holdco structure to help you guys create additional financing capacity? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. The holding company structure, we get that question from time to time. We like the transparency that our current structure provides for a regulatory environment. It minimizes the questions that you get around what are you doing at the parent level versus at the operating level in terms of equity capitalization, debt financing, so on and so forth. We've seen instances where regulators have tried to kind of pierce that at operating company level and try to get to the parent level to impute a capitalization at the opco level. So we feel like having a transparent capital structure the way we do today, just takes one less question off the table, and we can remain focused on talking about what we're doing with the spending in terms of modernizing system to make it perform more safely, more reliably and more environmentally responsible. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. \nStephen Byrd: Congrats on the continued very good results. I wanted to build on a couple of questions there that were just asked. Just over time, how do you think about the delta between rate base growth and EPS growth? I think you've had a fairly consistent approach there. I was just curious as you continue to get bigger. If there are any sort of changes to your thoughts around that delta between rate base and EPS growth? \nChristopher Forsythe: As we've talked about before, Stephen, that large delta largely reflects the financing plan that we've assumed over the next 5 years. And we certainly believe that -- certainly over the next 5 years that we can continue to operate financing the corporation in a balanced fashion using an improved mix of long-term debt and equity. And the strength of the balance sheet is important. As we saw earlier this year with the shot to the markets, the ability to access the commercial paper markets, we really didn't have much material impact as a result of the strength of that balance sheet. And it also gave us the opportunity to further enhance the liquidity by $700 million because we did have that equity capitalization in place. \nStephen Byrd: Understood. That balance sheet -- [ conservative ] balance sheet certainly has been a nice asset for you all to have. Now that makes sense. I wanted to shift over to M&A, which is -- I know you all don't really need any kind of inorganic growth. You've got great organic growth, really more at a high level. When you think about the skills and the capabilities that you've developed over time and you think about sort of applying that skill set to others, do you often sort of see a gap in that skill set where you could add value? Are there certain sort of categories of value-add you could provide or is that not something you spend much time kind of thinking about in the context of sort of inorganic growth? \nJohn Akers: Well, Stephen, it's Kevin. Let me start with and take us back to, as Chris and I said earlier, over the next 5 years we plan to invest $11 billion to $12 billion. And you know our rate construct very well. Within 6 months, we start earning on 90% of that and 99% by the end of 12 months. So that's where we're going to continue to focus right there. That's our strength. We've proven that over the last decade or so that we can execute at that level. It's a very understandable story for our employees, for our investors and for our regulators to follow. And I think everybody is working hard now around the regulations at the state and federal level to meet compliance. So I think through our associations, through our peer group meetings and everything else, I think our industry is at the top of its game right now and its ability to operate and deliver safe reliable natural gas service every day. \nStephen Byrd: Understood. Okay. And then maybe just lastly, I know this is not likely to be relevant anytime soon, but we do think longer-term about green hydrogen. And I was especially interested just given your geography, in some cases your proximity to sort of pure hydrogen infrastructure nearby, and I was just curious your latest thoughts on sort of the cost to be able to accommodate green hydrogen, what percentage could be blended. And I appreciate that green hydrogen is quite expensive compared to natural gas. I'm not really thinking in the near-term. But also beyond sort of what you could do with your own system, whether there might, in the future, be some potential to combine your capabilities with the capabilities of sort of pure hydrogen infrastructure nearby to create really a backbone that could allow for a larger conversion to green hydrogen and usage of your systems? So I know that's fairly broad, but was just curious your thoughts on that. \nJohn Akers: Sure. And as we've said before, too, we are certainly plugged into and watching all the projects that are coming online, particularly here those in the states. As you're aware, most of those are, what I would call, single-point source or other particular turbine or a particular smaller scale project here or there, not anything on a wide distribution or transmission level. We're also watching very closely what's going on in Europe around -- particularly in Germany right now. There are several projects on a little bit larger scale, if you will, of blending and delivering that hydrogen. So we're staying plugged into the American Gas Association through the Gas Technology Research Institute and other associations to continue to monitor those projects. So we can take a look at such things, as you just mentioned, what is the appropriate blending, right? How and where do you do that? What's the impact on the infrastructure, the steel of those systems and the burners on the end-use equipment, those sort of things. So we're plugged in. We're continuing to monitor that. And we'll continue to stay in touch with those groups, and as necessary, continue our evaluation of our systems and what that may look like for a longer-term. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Richie Ciciarelli with Bank of America. \nRichard Ciciarelli: I just wanted to follow-up a bit on Stephen's question, if I could. You obviously have a robust CapEx plan in front of you. But there are a few players in the space looking to divest some LDC assets, some are adjacent to your service territory. And just given where your multiple is relative to those peers, it would seem like an acquisition to be quite accretive. So just curious how you guys are thinking about the strategic landscape? \nJohn Akers: Exactly, as I said before, we're focused on that $11 billion to $12 billion going back into our system, modernizing our system, both at the distribution, transmission and storage levels, if you will. And again, you look at that regulatory construct on the times we just talked about that coming back to us in rate recovery. It's hard for me to say that you could get that type of recovery through an acquisition. We've been part of several, as you know, over the years. And they are extremely difficult at times to integrate both from an operational perspective, from an employee perspective and a cultural perspective. And right now, we have shown a decades long ability to execute on this strategy. And that's what we're going to continue to focus on making sure we're investing in the right things, getting the right recovery for that and modernizing our system so we can be environmentally sound as we continue to go forward and tighten our system up for our customers, our communities and our investors. \nRichard Ciciarelli: Got it. That's very helpful, focus on the organic profile here. And then just separately on the equity needs remaining for 2021, I think you've executed on roughly $345 million in equity forwards. So is the remaining amount through the ATM program, is it roughly in the $270 million to $300 million range? \nChristopher Forsythe: That's a pretty good assumption. \nRichard Ciciarelli: Okay. And then just last one on the O&M front, I guess, in response to what you were talking about Insoo earlier on the levers there. Should we think about that basically that you can offset and keep O&M flat relative to this year, if sales figures don't come in where you expect? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. I think we'll just have to see how the year unfolds, Richie. I mean first and foremost, we still have to maintain compliance throughout the entire system. And we don't want to achieve compliance just by barely achieving -- by barely making it, if you will. So we'll just have to continue to look at that in terms of -- we do have just general inflation as everybody does in some of our just general costs as they continue to go up. So we'll just continue to monitor that, see where the fiscal year takes us in terms of revenue, looking at the portfolio of O&M activities. And we'll -- to the extent that we need to adjust, we'll update at the appropriate time. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. \nCharles Fishman: Slide 19, where you -- 5,000 to 6,000 miles of pipe replacement over the next 5 years. Where will you stand at the end of 2025 as far as how many miles of pipe are left or how many years of that kind of pace goes on? What's the -- what are we looking at post 2025? \nJohn Akers: Charles, this is Kevin. We have a runway right now in steel service lines at about a 15- to 20-year rate. So you look at that, that will get us down about 5 years off of that. Like I said, they're about a 22% reduction. And then we've got about the same timeframe on industry identified. So we'll have a little over a decade or so left. And let's keep in mind, that's at today's regulation, right? And what I mean by that, rules are always updated on types of equipment, various materials. And in addition, we've now gotten into this past decade of the system modernization, where previous years under the old rate construct, if you will, people would stay out, invest at smaller levels and try and work back through O&M reductions to do that. That model has long since gone. You have got to continue to invest in your system to keep it modernized, to keep the equipment up and leverage technology when and where you can. So I think these are at the current regulations, at current identified materials, but also, you got to keep this other construct in mind of wanting to keep your system as up-to-date as possible, right? \nCharles Fishman: Okay. And then, Kevin, with that argument, I mean, I look at the average monthly bill slide on 26. And I realized you rolled it forward, now you're starting 2009, isn't as good as 2008, when it was much higher. I was just comparing them. But you do have significant increases. What you just told me, is that the argument you used to  municipalities you serve, the regulators? \nJohn Akers: Well, I don't know. I'd quite state it as an argument. I think it's our investment strategy. And again, I think when you look at the household bill there, that's the lowest bill in the household today for our customers. And you compare today's price that we have on the sheet and at $4.50 to $5.50 range, you're talking about equivalent of somewhere around $11, $12 gas, when you compare that to the equivalent electric side. So if you convert that over, you're looking at about $0.06, $0.07, $0.08, $0.09 on the electric side. So I think we're continuing to be affordable at this investment progress that we're making. We continue to do it on an annual basis. So we send the right signals there. And honestly, that paired with the  [ production and ] the basis and where prices sit today are certainly a help for us as well. \nCharles Fishman: Yes. Well, continuing on that affordability issue, we've seen some electrification mandates on the coast. I don't believe there's been anything in your service territories, correct me if I'm wrong, but is -- let me ask you this, how are your market share with respect to new construction? Are you maintaining your market share with respect to single-family and multifamily with respect to competing against an all-electric new home or new apartment? \nJohn Akers: Absolutely. You just heard us talk about the organic growth, particularly here in the Metroplex area, and in addition, the territories we serve in Middle Tennessee and around our Olathe, Kansas area continue to show good growth as well there. So our market share continues to be strong. And when you look at what the Metroplex and how it's continued to grow here, I think we've got a good long horizon of customers wanting and demanding our natural gas product, as you've seen from those percentage increases there.\n And as you said, we haven't seen that electrification discussion, that push yet. We continue to talk with our customers. We continue to survey our customers, and they like the value the product brings and at the price, as I said today, at the $4.50 to $5.50 range, that equates again to $0.10, $0.11 a kilowatt electric, right? And you show me somewhere where people are getting that today. So I think we continue to remain competitive and continue to have strong market share. \nCharles Fishman: I would think, Kevin, with the -- with respect to these electrification mandates, the amount of energy that you as a gas utility deliver on the coldest day, the electric utilities would be hard-pressed to come up with that. It's a huge increase in their capacity, is that -- isn't it correct? \nJohn Akers: Yes. You're exactly right. You've seen the challenges, particularly on the West Coast that, unfortunately, some of those folks are having during the peaks right now. So you draw parallels back to a winter period and trying to meet that demand, and those peak needs is going to be even more challenging. But as you've heard me probably say before, right now, the population of the U.S. is about 330 million to 335 million and due to head toward 360 million by 2030. That's adding at Texas 30-plus million people here in less than a decade. So where are you going to get that energy? Natural gas, as we just talked about, is abundant, it's affordable and it's reliable. So -- and as the fourth largest proven reserve country in the world, I don't know why we would continue to leverage that asset and find ways to continue to grow that when we're thinking about a diversified energy portfolio going forward. So I think you're spot on with that. And that's how we view it. We view it that the industry serves 70 million, 75 million customers today where we continue to grow with that. And we are in the right place with the right infrastructure today to continue to provide that reliable service. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks. \nChristopher Forsythe: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through December of 2020. Have a good day. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christopher Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and are happy that you can join us this morning. \n Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share of $4.89, compared to diluted earnings per share of $4.35 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 results included a onetime noncash income tax benefit, $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share that we recognized during the third fiscal quarter related to a legislative change in Kansas that reduced our state deferred tax rate. Excluding this nonrecurring benefit, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 was $4.72. This represents the 18th consecutive year of rising earnings per share.\n In summarizing the year, the pandemic began to impact the economies of the states we serve at the end of our winter heating season. By that time, we had earned 70% of our distribution revenue for fiscal '20. Given the economic uncertainty at that time, we were conservative about the anticipated nonresidential load loss for the third and fourth quarter. And we plan to reduce O&M activities during the third and fourth quarters to keep our employees healthy and to align spending with anticipated revenues.\n Our residential load loss during the last 6 months in the fiscal year was less severe than we had originally anticipated. And we maintained our O&M spending in the back half of the fiscal year in line with the revised guidance we issued after our second fiscal quarter. As a result, our fiscal 2020 EPS came in at the higher end of our earnings guidance range of $4.58 to $4.73.\n Taking a closer look, consolidated operating income rose over 10% to $824 million. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.\n Rate increases in both of our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $140 million. We also experienced a $14 million increase in distribution operating income, primarily due to customer growth in our Mid-Tex division. During the 12 months ended September 30, our Mid-Tex division experienced net customer growth of 1.5%. On a consolidated basis, we experienced net customer growth of 1.2% over the same period.\n We did experience a $6 million reduction in operating income, primarily due to a 13% decline in commercial consumption in our Distribution segment during the last 6 months of the year. We also experienced a $6 million decline in service order revenue, primarily due to the suspension of collection activities since March of this year.\n In our Pipeline and Storage segment, we experienced a net $14 million decrease through system revenue. Volumes declined 17% and prices declined 13% due to reduced associated gas production in the Permian Basin. Consolidated O&M expense for fiscal 2020 was flat compared to 2019, in line with our expectations. O&M in our Distribution segment was about $8 million lower than the prior year, reflecting lower employee, travel and training costs, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense.\n Lower spending in our Distribution segment was offset by higher spending for system maintenance activities in our Pipeline and Storage segment, most of which was completed during the first half of the fiscal year. Consolidated capital spending increased 14% to $1.94 billion, with 88% of our spending directed towards investments to modernize the safety, reliability and environmental performance of our system. With this spending, our team replaced approximately 845 miles in distribution and transmission pipe and 55,000 service lines across the 8 states in which we operate.\n In fiscal 2020, over 90% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $160 million in annualized operating income increases. And since the end of the fiscal year, we reached agreement with our regulators to implement an additional $106 million of annualized operating income during our fiscal 2021 first quarter.\n As of today, we have 3 filings pending seeking about $12.5 million. Slides 30 to 42 summarize our regulatory activities. During fiscal 2020, we successfully executed our long-term financing strategy while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and further enhancing our liquidity position. We completed over $1.6 billion of long-term debt and equity financing. We fully satisfied our fiscal '20 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. Under the program, we issued 4.8 million shares under forward agreements for $523 million and settled 6.1 million shares for net proceeds of $624 million.\n As of September 30, we had about $345 million remaining under equity forward arrangements. This equity financing complemented the $800 million in long-term debt financing we issued last fall and the $200 million term loan we executed in April. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization was 60% as of September 30. Additionally, due in part of the additional -- addition of $700 million of new credit facility capacity, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $2.6 billion of liquidity, including cash held in escrow under equity forward arrangements. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity leaves us well positioned as we move into fiscal 2021. Details of our financing activities, including our equity forward arrangements as well as our financial profile can be found on Slides 9 through 12.\n Looking forward, fiscal '21 will represent the tenth year of executing our operating plan to modernize our distribution, transmission and storage systems. The fundamentals of our operating plan remain the same. Yesterday, we initiated our fiscal '21 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10. Consistent with prior years, we expect about 2/3 of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate earnings per share will grow 6% to 8% per year. By fiscal '25, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.70.\n From a revenue perspective, we have assumed no material changes to our residential revenue as a result of COVID-19. However, we continue to remain cautious about our nonresidential revenue due to the continued economic uncertainty and the fact that we are now heading into the winter heating season. Although it is difficult to precisely estimate the potential load loss that we might experience, we performed multiple sensitivity scenarios as we considered our fiscal '21 earnings per share guidance.\n Slide 18 summarizes our key Distribution segment revenue attributes and provides EPS sensitivities for the full fiscal year for each 1% change in sales volumes by customer class. And as you're aware, the performance of our Pipeline and Storage segment is predominantly driven by APT. As a reminder, over 80% of APT's revenues are earned from delivery services to LDCs, including our Mid-Tex division, under a straight fixed variable rate design. The remainder of APT's revenues relates to a 3-system business and other ancillary pipeline services.\n APT only keeps 25% of the difference between actual revenues earned from these activities and the approved $69 million benchmark in its straight design. Our fiscal '21 guidance reflects current market conditions for the small portion of APT's business.\n From an O&M perspective, we have assumed that we'll execute our normal O&M program as we continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety. These activities include enhanced leak surveys, pipeline integrity work, work to address PHMSA's new integrity management rules that became effective July 1, 2020, and continued record establishment and retention.\n Similar to fiscal '20, we do have some flexibility around the timing of this O&M spending, which could help us align spending with potential changes to revenue. As we continue to focus on safely operating our system, we continue to assume O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal '25. Additional details can be found on Slides 16 and 17.\n Fiscal '21 capital spending is expected to rise about 7.5% and is expected to range from $2 billion to $2.2 billion. Approximately 85% of the spending will be dedicated to safety and reliability spending, which will also reduce methane emissions from our system. Approximately 73% of the spending will be allocated to our Distribution segment. Over 90% of our consolidated capital spending is expected to begin earning a return within 6 months of the test period end.\n Continued spending, persistent replacement and modernization will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal '25. As you can see on Slide 21, we anticipate capital spending to increase about 7% to 8% per year off of fiscal 2020 spend levels for a total of $11 billion to $12 billion over the next 5 years. This should support rate base growth of about 12% to 14% per year. This translates into an estimated rate base of $19 billion to $20 billion in fiscal '25, up from about $11 billion at the end of fiscal 2020, as you can see on Slide 22.\n Annual filing mechanisms will be the primary means through which we recover our capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy capital and generate the returns necessary to attract the capital we need to finance our investments. And these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our ongoing system modernization efforts. We have assumed no material changes to these mechanisms through fiscal '25.\n In fiscal 2021, we anticipate completing filings from $195 million to $215 million in annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years 2021 and 2022.\n Moving to Slide 24. In light of our financial performance of fiscal 2020, yesterday Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 148th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated dividend for fiscal 2021 is $2.50, an 8.7% increase over fiscal 2020. We continue to expect dividends per share to grow in line with earnings per share over the next 5 years. And we will continue to target a payout ratio of approximately 50% as it strikes the right balance between using funds to invest in the modernization of our system and providing a reasonable return to our shareholders who support our operating plans with their investments. \n This 5-year plan also continues the financing strategy that we've been executing over the last few years. It balances the interest of our customers and our investors while preserving strong credit metrics that minimize the cost of financing.  Based upon our spending assumptions, we anticipate the need to raise between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion in incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our balance sheet enables us to continue to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity in order to maintain a balanced capital structure, with the targeted equity to total capitalization ratio ranging from 50% to 60%, inclusive of short-term debt. This strategy is summarized on Slide 25. And consistent with prior year plans, our financing plan has fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal 2025.\n In October, we completed a $600 million 10-year senior note issuance with a coupon of 1.5%. As a result, our overall weighted average cost of debt, as of October 1, 2020, stands at 3.94%. And our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 19 years.\n From an equity perspective, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal '20 will set us a significant portion of our expected equity needs for fiscal '21. We expect to raise the remaining equity needs for fiscal '21 through our ATM program.\n To recap, the execution of this plan to modernize our system through disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms and balanced long-term financing all support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends at 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2025.  And as you can see on Slide 26, the execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable, which will help us sustain this plan for the long-term.\n Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his remarks. Kevin? Insoo, this is Chris. Like I said earlier, we did a number of different sensitivities, and rather than debating it with individuals, we thought by putting the sensitivities out that you see in Slide 18 would provide folks with the data that they can do to make some assumptions around what they want to think about the nonresidential load loss. But as I said, we ran multiple scenarios, and we feel like our guidance is reflective of those various scenarios.\n I also do want to point out that we've assumed a full O&M program this year and to the extent that we need to pull levers a little bit to align spending with revenues as well as keeping our employees safe. That opportunity exists for us as well. I think when we looked at our markets, in the back half of the year, Louisiana, Mississippi are -- excuse me, Mid-Tex were 2 that saw most of our -- the commercial decline that I commented on earlier. But right now, towards the back half of the year, it wasn't nearly as severe as we anticipated. It certainly recovered as we moved along through the third and fourth quarters. And we always have to continue to watch and see. I think it's also going to be contingent upon how the buyer spreads, how states may respond to containing the spreads, protecting the citizenry and also balancing the needs of the economy. Yes. I think there's an element of conservatism in our numbers this year, as I mentioned, because we're going to be cautious about what we're seeing around the nonresidential load loss as we go into the winter heating season. If you go back to the kind of midpoint of the guidance for fiscal '20, had we achieved that and then you kind of extrapolate that out, that would get you closer to 7%, I believe. Yes. The holding company structure, we get that question from time to time. We like the transparency that our current structure provides for a regulatory environment. It minimizes the questions that you get around what are you doing at the parent level versus at the operating level in terms of equity capitalization, debt financing, so on and so forth. We've seen instances where regulators have tried to kind of pierce that at operating company level and try to get to the parent level to impute a capitalization at the opco level. So we feel like having a transparent capital structure the way we do today, just takes one less question off the table, and we can remain focused on talking about what we're doing with the spending in terms of modernizing system to make it perform more safely, more reliably and more environmentally responsible. As we've talked about before, Stephen, that large delta largely reflects the financing plan that we've assumed over the next 5 years. And we certainly believe that -- certainly over the next 5 years that we can continue to operate financing the corporation in a balanced fashion using an improved mix of long-term debt and equity. And the strength of the balance sheet is important. As we saw earlier this year with the shot to the markets, the ability to access the commercial paper markets, we really didn't have much material impact as a result of the strength of that balance sheet. And it also gave us the opportunity to further enhance the liquidity by $700 million because we did have that equity capitalization in place. That's a pretty good assumption. Yes. I think we'll just have to see how the year unfolds, Richie. I mean first and foremost, we still have to maintain compliance throughout the entire system. And we don't want to achieve compliance just by barely achieving -- by barely making it, if you will. So we'll just have to continue to look at that in terms of -- we do have just general inflation as everybody does in some of our just general costs as they continue to go up. So we'll just continue to monitor that, see where the fiscal year takes us in terms of revenue, looking at the portfolio of O&M activities. And we'll -- to the extent that we need to adjust, we'll update at the appropriate time. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through December of 2020. Have a good day."

            "name": "John Akers",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Atmos Energy.\n Our success in fiscal 2020 reflects the talent and dedication of our 4,700 employees. I've said it before and I will say it again today that they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. I'm extremely proud of their commitment to keep our 3.2 million customers, our 1,400 communities themselves and their families healthy and safe.\n I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank our state regulatory commissions, our many peer companies, our state gas associations as well as the American Gas Association for their assistance and support during these challenging times.\n Our robust risk management process has served us extremely well during this pandemic and will continue to guide us as we navigate our way forward. As I've shared previously, through the outstanding work of our risk management and compliance committee and our senior leadership team, all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees were well prepared when we transitioned to a digital work environment.\n As you can see in our fiscal year operating and financial performance, our team has proven their ability to execute at the highest levels in all facets of our business. \n Our move to digital work environment in March provided opportunities for us to leverage new tools to virtually connect with one another. One of the areas I want to highlight today is technical training. To date, we have trained over 900 employees, utilizing a virtual format designed by our workforce development and curriculum design teams. This has created exciting possibilities for us as this training is a critical part of our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services.\n We play a vital role in every community we serve through our safe delivery natural gas service. Also important is our time, our talent and our resources, invested in bringing out the best in our communities so they can thrive.\n For example, during September, that's Hunger Action Month, we joined forces with hundreds of local school districts, food banks and other essential organizations that provide breakfast, lunch, snacks and healthy meals that all children need to grow, develop and succeed. Additionally, we provided resources that help students read on level by third grade.\n Furthermore, during our annual week of giving in September, our employees generously pledged nearly $900,000 in donations to benefit No Kid Hungry, United Way and The Salvation Army. Atmos Energy will match our employee pledges to further support the important work these agencies do every day.\n We also donated $1 million to more than 100 local energy assistant agency and nonprofit organizations to help customers stay warm this winter or weatherize their homes.\n As Chris mentioned, over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $11 billion to $12 billion, with 88% of that capital spending focused on safety and reliability investments identified by our risk-based capital allocation strategy that includes replacing industry-identified materials such as bare steel, vintage plastic and cast iron. Our Atmos pipeline Texas investments, in addition to safety and reliability, will continue to focus on serving a growing demand, particularly in North Texas. And as Chris mentioned earlier, our Mid-Tex division had a 1.5% net customer growth this past year.\n As you can see on Slide 19, we anticipate our capital spending plan over the next 5 years will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% to 8% of our total system. Included in this amount is the replacement of the remaining cast iron pipe in our system and the replacement of all bare steel main outside of our Mid-Tex division. We also plan to replace between 100,000 and 150,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory between 20% to 25%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over the next 5 years.\n On the technology side, as part of our wireless operations network, we anticipate 75% of our system will be equipped with wireless meter reading at the end of fiscal year 2025. Additionally, through this network, we are testing the ability to wirelessly receive cathodic protection monitoring data from across our distribution and transmission systems.\n In addition to modernizing our systems, we have been focusing on other ways to further reduce our carbon footprint. We categorized our environmental focus into 5 areas: gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers.\n For example, on our gas supply it's RNG. Today, as you've heard us say before, we transport approximately 5 Bcf across our system, which is about 2% of our distribution sales volumes. We have identified several opportunities to increase the amount of RNG on our system. For example, we have just signed an interconnect agreement with a renewables company for an additional level of RNG from 3 dairy facilities. Although it is too soon to commit to how much RNG can ultimately be transported on our system, we will be working with regulators and all stakeholders to help develop frameworks for commercial viable RNG solutions to support our customers and improve the environment.\n Additionally, under the category of facility, we have 13 leadership in energy and environmental design or LEED-certified facilities and have 4 additional LEED-certified facilities planned. Of these 13 LEED facilities, 4 are certified gold and 7 are certified silver.\n LEED is a globally recognized green building certification rating system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council that provides third-party verification of efficiency and emissions reductions. For example, our annual water use at these facilities has reduced 50% to 60%, and our carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are reduced approximately 600 metric tons per year.\n In closing, the long-term fundamentals of our strategy remain the same. And as you just heard, our employees continue to execute at the highest levels and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. Our strategy is supported by the fact that we operate in constructive jurisdictions, and several of our markets continue to have a long, strong term growth potential, most notably in the DFW Metroplex, the fourth largest metropolitan area in the country.\n The successful execution of our strategy, the strength of our balance sheet and our strong liquidity leaves us well positioned to continue to safely deliver reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.\n We appreciate your time this morning and your interest in Atmos Energy. And we'll now take any questions that you may have. Well, Stephen, it's Kevin. Let me start with and take us back to, as Chris and I said earlier, over the next 5 years we plan to invest $11 billion to $12 billion. And you know our rate construct very well. Within 6 months, we start earning on 90% of that and 99% by the end of 12 months. So that's where we're going to continue to focus right there. That's our strength. We've proven that over the last decade or so that we can execute at that level. It's a very understandable story for our employees, for our investors and for our regulators to follow. And I think everybody is working hard now around the regulations at the state and federal level to meet compliance. So I think through our associations, through our peer group meetings and everything else, I think our industry is at the top of its game right now and its ability to operate and deliver safe reliable natural gas service every day. Sure. And as we've said before, too, we are certainly plugged into and watching all the projects that are coming online, particularly here those in the states. As you're aware, most of those are, what I would call, single-point source or other particular turbine or a particular smaller scale project here or there, not anything on a wide distribution or transmission level. We're also watching very closely what's going on in Europe around -- particularly in Germany right now. There are several projects on a little bit larger scale, if you will, of blending and delivering that hydrogen. So we're staying plugged into the American Gas Association through the Gas Technology Research Institute and other associations to continue to monitor those projects. So we can take a look at such things, as you just mentioned, what is the appropriate blending, right? How and where do you do that? What's the impact on the infrastructure, the steel of those systems and the burners on the end-use equipment, those sort of things. So we're plugged in. We're continuing to monitor that. And we'll continue to stay in touch with those groups, and as necessary, continue our evaluation of our systems and what that may look like for a longer-term. Exactly, as I said before, we're focused on that $11 billion to $12 billion going back into our system, modernizing our system, both at the distribution, transmission and storage levels, if you will. And again, you look at that regulatory construct on the times we just talked about that coming back to us in rate recovery. It's hard for me to say that you could get that type of recovery through an acquisition. We've been part of several, as you know, over the years. And they are extremely difficult at times to integrate both from an operational perspective, from an employee perspective and a cultural perspective. And right now, we have shown a decades long ability to execute on this strategy. And that's what we're going to continue to focus on making sure we're investing in the right things, getting the right recovery for that and modernizing our system so we can be environmentally sound as we continue to go forward and tighten our system up for our customers, our communities and our investors. Charles, this is Kevin. We have a runway right now in steel service lines at about a 15- to 20-year rate. So you look at that, that will get us down about 5 years off of that. Like I said, they're about a 22% reduction. And then we've got about the same timeframe on industry identified. So we'll have a little over a decade or so left. And let's keep in mind, that's at today's regulation, right? And what I mean by that, rules are always updated on types of equipment, various materials. And in addition, we've now gotten into this past decade of the system modernization, where previous years under the old rate construct, if you will, people would stay out, invest at smaller levels and try and work back through O&M reductions to do that. That model has long since gone. You have got to continue to invest in your system to keep it modernized, to keep the equipment up and leverage technology when and where you can. So I think these are at the current regulations, at current identified materials, but also, you got to keep this other construct in mind of wanting to keep your system as up-to-date as possible, right? Well, I don't know. I'd quite state it as an argument. I think it's our investment strategy. And again, I think when you look at the household bill there, that's the lowest bill in the household today for our customers. And you compare today's price that we have on the sheet and at $4.50 to $5.50 range, you're talking about equivalent of somewhere around $11, $12 gas, when you compare that to the equivalent electric side. So if you convert that over, you're looking at about $0.06, $0.07, $0.08, $0.09 on the electric side. So I think we're continuing to be affordable at this investment progress that we're making. We continue to do it on an annual basis. So we send the right signals there. And honestly, that paired with the  [ production and ] the basis and where prices sit today are certainly a help for us as well. Absolutely. You just heard us talk about the organic growth, particularly here in the Metroplex area, and in addition, the territories we serve in Middle Tennessee and around our Olathe, Kansas area continue to show good growth as well there. So our market share continues to be strong. And when you look at what the Metroplex and how it's continued to grow here, I think we've got a good long horizon of customers wanting and demanding our natural gas product, as you've seen from those percentage increases there.\n And as you said, we haven't seen that electrification discussion, that push yet. We continue to talk with our customers. We continue to survey our customers, and they like the value the product brings and at the price, as I said today, at the $4.50 to $5.50 range, that equates again to $0.10, $0.11 a kilowatt electric, right? And you show me somewhere where people are getting that today. So I think we continue to remain competitive and continue to have strong market share. Yes. You're exactly right. You've seen the challenges, particularly on the West Coast that, unfortunately, some of those folks are having during the peaks right now. So you draw parallels back to a winter period and trying to meet that demand, and those peak needs is going to be even more challenging. But as you've heard me probably say before, right now, the population of the U.S. is about 330 million to 335 million and due to head toward 360 million by 2030. That's adding at Texas 30-plus million people here in less than a decade. So where are you going to get that energy? Natural gas, as we just talked about, is abundant, it's affordable and it's reliable. So -- and as the fourth largest proven reserve country in the world, I don't know why we would continue to leverage that asset and find ways to continue to grow that when we're thinking about a diversified energy portfolio going forward. So I think you're spot on with that. And that's how we view it. We view it that the industry serves 70 million, 75 million customers today where we continue to grow with that. And we are in the right place with the right infrastructure today to continue to provide that reliable service."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. \n It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dan Meziere, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, Dan. \nDaniel Meziere: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me this morning are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. \n Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. \n As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 32 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin? \nJohn Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Atmos Energy. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy as we continue to navigate our way through this challenge together. The safety of our employees, our customers and the safety of our communities remain our focus as we continue to deliver safe and reliable natural gas service. Today, over 95% of our employees continue to work remotely as we are doing our part to reduce the spread of the virus, following the CDC guidelines as well as following our safety protocols such as hand washing, practicing social distancing and wearing face coverings. As I've said before, we were early to transition to remote work and we will be very intentional about returning to our offices. We continue listening closely to the health experts and following the data as we go about our daily operations. \n As I shared last quarter, through the outstanding work of our Risk Management and Compliance Committee, our senior leadership team and all 4,800 Atmos Energy employees, we were well prepared to transition every facet of our business to a remote work environment in mid-March. That level of preparation and agility served us well as we continued executing at the highest levels during the third fiscal quarter. For example, our customer service agents and service technicians continued providing exceptional customer service, as indicated by our customers rating their satisfaction with our agents and technicians at 98%. \n Our strategic focus on digital bill delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as the percentage of electronic bills issued as of the end of the third quarter increased to 45%. And our electronic methods of payments received such as bank drafts, credit cards and online banking increased to 76% of the payments received as of June 30. Through these innovative electronic bill delivery and payment channels, Atmos Energy and our customers are doing our part to conserve environmental resources. For example, on an annual basis, the use of this technology saves approximately 1,300 tons of wood, nearly 6 million pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent, 7 million gallons of water and nearly 400,000 pounds of waste. During the quarter, we deployed mobile wallet, a unique bill delivery platform enabling customers to view and pay their bill and manage their Atmos Energy accounts from Apple Wallet or Google Pay. \n I also want to highlight the great work of our Safety and Enterprise Services and Operations teams that they are doing in the area of damage prevention, especially given we are just 5 days away from National 811 Day. This work is an integral part of our ongoing commitment to safety and our proactive measures to help raise awareness about third-party excavation damage, which is one of the greatest threats to the safety of distribution systems. Our teams have implemented a damage prevention ambassador program. They've developed social media alerts and other public awareness campaigns, such as postponing nonessential digging during the COVID-19 pandemic. All these efforts support the year-to-date result of a damage rate that is less than the industry average. \n Using our safety practices and protocols I mentioned earlier, we have continued executing our proven investment strategy and remain on track to meet our capital spending range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. A safely performing distribution and transmission pipeline system work that includes maintenance and compliance activities, pipe replacement, line locating and system inspections. Our fiscal year-to-date consolidated capital spending grew 17% to $1.4 billion, with approximately 88% of our spending being directed towards safety and reliability, all to modernize our system. Finally, our financial position remains very strong. And at the end of June, our liquidity was almost $3 billion, and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris for a financial update, and I will turn shortly with a few closing remarks. Chris? \nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2020 third quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.96 compared to $0.68 in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, we reported diluted earnings per share of $4.37 compared to $3.88 in the prior year period. Results for the quarter and year-to-date periods included a onetime noncash income tax benefit of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share related to a change in our state deferred tax rate resulting from legislation that was passed by the Kansas Legislature in June to eliminate the assessment of state income taxes on regulated utilities operating in the state. As a result of the change in our state deferred tax rate, we reduced our deferred tax liability by $33 million during the fiscal third quarter. We established a $12 million regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes that will be returned to Kansas customers, and we recognize remaining $21 million as a onetime income tax benefit. Excluding this nonrecurring benefit, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.79 and $4.2 year-to-date. \n Consolidated operating income during the 9 months ended June 30 rose over 10% to $723 million. Rate increases in both our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability spending totaled $111 million. We also experienced a $10 million increase in distribution operating income, primarily due to customer growth in our Mid-Tex division. During the 12 months ended June 30, our Mid-Tex division experienced net customer growth of 1.6%. On a consolidated basis, we experienced net customer growth of 1.3% over the same period. \n The impact of COVID-19 did not have a material impact on our year-to-date operating income as we are able to align our O&M spending with a decline in nonresidential customer consumption we experienced during the third quarter. Through the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we earned approximately 85% of our distribution revenues. Additionally, residential revenues comprised approximately 60% of our distribution revenues during the second half of the year. These bills are at their lowest during this time. \n Finally, we collect a significant portion of our revenues, excluding gas costs, through the base charge, which partially insulates us from volumetric risk. For most of our service territories the base charge represents the largest portion of a customer's bill by the middle of our third fiscal quarter. For the year-to-date period, we experienced a $7 million reduction in operating income due to lower sales and transportation volumes during the third quarter. We did not identify a meaningful change in residential consumption due to COVID. However, we did experience a 14% decline in nonresidential consumption. We also saw a $3 million decline in service order revenue, primarily due to the suspension of collection activities. Our nonresidential consumption decline was concentrated in our commercial customer class, which declined 18% during the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. We experienced most of the volumetric decline in our Mid-Tex and Louisiana divisions. \n During the quarter, we saw commercial consumption climb by as much as 30% compared to the 2-year historical average in certain of our states by mid-May as shelter-in-place orders in our service areas impacted their businesses. However, since that time, we have seen a steady improvement. Through mid-July, commercial customer usage was just 11% below the 2-year average over the same period. \n Additionally, we experienced a 12% decline in transportation volumes during the third quarter, primarily due to slower economic activity in the Automotive and Metals sectors. These declines in operating income were offset by a $17 million decrease in O&M expense, primarily associated with employee costs for overtime; standby and other costs; lower travel and training costs; and the temporary deferral of pipeline maintenance activities. \n In our Pipeline and Storage segment, over 80% of APT's revenues are earned from delivery services to our Mid-Tex division and a few other LDCs under a straight fixed variable rate design. The remainder of APT's revenues relates to its 3 system business and other ancillary pipeline services. As a reminder, APT only keeps 25% of revenues earned from these activities under its straight design. \n During the third quarter, we experienced a net $2.5 million decrease in transportation and other revenue in this segment. APT's quarter-over-quarter through-system volumes declined 19% and prices declined by 30% due to reduced associated gas production in the Permian Basin. Year-to-date, transportation and other revenue declined by less than $1 million. \n Slides 6 and 7 provide additional details of period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. On the regulatory front, to date, we have implemented $123 million in annual operating income increases. Additionally, we received approval for the 4 Texas GRIP filings that we voluntarily delayed in March for $23 million. These filings will be implemented on September 1. Currently, we have $141 million of regulatory filings in progress, most of which are scheduled to be implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Details of these filings can be found on Slides 19 through 29. \n And other regulatory matters, we have orders in 5 of our 8 states that address the impacts of COVID-19. These orders cover more than 85% of our distribution customers and APT. Generally, these orders allow us to defer net incremental expenses, including bad debt expense and in a few of our states, certain lost revenues due to COVID-19. We are still evaluating these orders. Therefore, we did not record any regulatory assets or liabilities related to COVID-19 as of June 30. Slide 14 summarizes these orders. \n As of June 30, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong. Our equity capitalization was 58.8%, and we finished the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in liquidity, including $750 million in cash between our operating accounts and ATM net proceeds. \n During the third quarter, we executed new forward sales arrangements for approximately 2.3 million shares with anticipated net proceeds of $234 million. Additionally, we sold approximately 1 million shares for $100 million. Through June 30, we had sold about 3.6 million shares for $359 million. And as of June 30, we had about $547 million in cash available under equity forward arrangements. \n Yesterday, we reaffirmed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $4.58 to $4.73. We now have more clarity around how COVID has and continues to affect our business from a customer perspective and an operational perspective. Based on what we understand today, we now believe earnings per share will be at the upper end of the range. For the fourth quarter, we have assumed similar nonresidential consumption declines that we experienced in the third quarter as several of our states have slowed the pace of reopening their economies. Additionally, we expect fourth quarter O&M to trend similarly to what we experienced during the third quarter. Slides 15 and 16 provide additional details around our guidance. \n Thanks for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin for some closing remarks. \nJohn Akers: Thank you, Chris. Community service is woven into the fabric of Atmos Energy's culture, we call Atmos Spirit. And our 4,800 employees take pride in fueling safe and thriving communities each and every day. During National Hospitality Week -- or Hospital Week, in May, we saluted our medical professionals\u2019 heroic efforts by delivering more than 12,000 meals to health care heroes across our 8 state service area. In valuing our strong partnerships with local restaurant owners and chefs across our 1,400 communities, we celebrated Take-Out Tuesday, an initiative that brings support to local restaurants by offering all employees the opportunity to enjoy lunch from the favorite neighborhood restaurant. Along with these enterprise-wide efforts to lift each other up during these uncertain times, we are fueling safe and thriving communities in ways both large and small. By working with school districts, early childhood programs and nonprofits across our service area to improve the reading proficiency by third grade and to feed hungry children so they can learn and thrive. I'm truly inspired by the many ways our employees come together to give of their time and talent to further support those who need a helping hand. \n As I said earlier, our robust risk management process has served us extremely well during this pandemic and will continue to guide us as we execute at the highest levels on all facets of our business. Our year-to-date results were in line with our expectations. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have further enhanced our liquidity. Our focus remains the same: the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities as we execute our proven investment strategy; and continue delivering safe, reliable, affordable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. \n With that, I'll open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Richie Ciciarelli from Bank of America. \nRichard Ciciarelli: Just curious given some of the deterioration in volumes you've seen on the nonresidential side and, obviously, appreciate the confidence for the back half or the remainder of the year in 2020. But just curious how you're thinking of things beyond that in light of the COVID impacts? And just really considering the fact that you and then really all of your gas LDC peers haven't gotten to experience this through the more meaningful peak winter heating season? \nChristopher Forsythe: Well, Rich, that's a good question. With the fiscal year-end rapidly coming to a close, we're deep in our planning cycle right now and we're certainly evaluating what's going on in the economies in the 8 states that we serve. And so we're keeping a close eye on that. We're not ready to announce yet what assumptions we're going to put into the fiscal 2021 guidance. As you know, we'll roll that out here in the fall in November. But we are taking a look at that. We're also assessing operationally what we're going to be doing to keep our employees safe and the community safe, and we'll have a better picture and more information to provide in November. \nRichard Ciciarelli: Got it. And just a follow-up on that a little bit, if I can. Just given like the annual true-up mechanisms you have for your O&M efforts, is there any other offsets that you could pursue into next year if the economic recovery is a bit more prolonged? \nChristopher Forsythe: When you say offsets, I mean, it's primarily -- we just have to continue to see, first and foremost, what we can do in terms of work that can be performed and doing it in a way that we can keep our employees safe, keep our community safe. And as Kevin said at the top of the call, doing our part to minimize the spread of the virus in the community. So we, obviously, have compliance work that has to be completed on certain schedules and time lines, and we can't let that slip. But we will be evaluating things, but we do have a little bit of discretion in the event that we do need to align our O&M with any potential volumetric and revenue declines due to the pandemic. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Aga Zmigrodzka from UBS. \nAga Zmigrodzka: How should we think about your equity needs for 2021? Is it fair to assume that with the updated forward equity agreements that will be sufficient or should we expect a larger equity offering? \nChristopher Forsythe: I think we've been pretty consistent now for the last year, 12 to 15 months that the ATM is our preferred method for raising equity. We've got our financing plan out there, and we intend to do -- execute that financing plan in a balanced fashion with both long-term debt and equity. And we'll seek to use the ATM to the best of our ability to meet those equity needs for fiscal 2021 and beyond. \nAga Zmigrodzka: What has been an increase in bad debt? And how quickly you can recover those costs for the mechanism that you have in place? \nChristopher Forsythe: So far, it really hasn't materially impacted us, and there's a couple of things to keep in mind around bad debt and collections. First, in all of our service territories, moratoriums are still in place that -- or in most of our service territories to prohibit the disconnect or resumption of collection activities. We then need to evaluate what the tone is from the regulatory environment. What's the tone from just the community in terms of those types of activities. Once we do begin to collect or resume collection activities, one, that could be several months down the road. But then number two, we won't see the impact of really bad debt until well beyond the resumption of those activities because it takes a certain number of months for it to work through the process of collection before it ultimately gets written off. \n So right now, as where we sit here today it hasn't had a material impact on our business for fiscal 2020. Certainly, a watcheye and that we're keeping an eye on for fiscal 2021. But we think it's going to be some time before we begin to see that -- those bad debts really begin to rise up. And then you have to work it through the regulatory process and because we do have the opportunity first to have an annual filing mechanism. And as I mentioned, we do have the reg asset orders in 5 of out of 8 states, which provides us another tool to address those types of costs. I think at this point, it's probably just a little bit too soon to tell when exactly we're going to see that rise in bad debt. And then number two, when it will ultimately be reflected in rates. \nJohn Akers: Yes. Aga, this is Kevin, I'll just follow-up a little bit on that. In addition, our customer service agents and our customer advocacy team that supports those agents have been for several months now reaching out to customers in all classes, residential, commercial and industrial, about different payment options that exist out there for them, LIHEAP, local health agencies those sort of things. And whether those were outbound calls, letters, some folks allow us to have their e-mail address, getting in contacting with it. That way, we've been very proactive in reaching out to customers that appear to be having a tough time paying their bill. And we're going to continue to do that as we move forward and head towards this upcoming heating season. \nAga Zmigrodzka: I have a last question. Could you please maybe discuss a little in more detail what are the components of lower O&M? What is short in nature and you could still benefit from that in 4Q? And how much of cost savings you're expecting going forward kind of more sustainable? \nChristopher Forsythe: Sure. \nJohn Akers: Yes, the type of work... \nChristopher Forsythe: Go ahead, Kevin, you start. \nJohn Akers: Well, I was going to talk about the components and things that we looked at that we could defer going into the period. I'll hand off to Chris to talk to you about the numbers specifically. But there's such things like this right-of-way encroachment clearing trees, overhang brush, those sort of things, cleanup around GIS data, record digitization, those sort of things. And where we're ahead on certain inspections on our systems right now. Those things that we can move out to a different period, not do away with, not cancel, but move to a different period. Those are the sort of O&M things that we have shifted during the last quarter to 2 quarters and are currently evaluating now what opportunities do we have maybe to pick back up some of that and what does that timing look like as we head that into the end of this fiscal year and into next fiscal year. Chris? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. I would just say to add to that too, as we are still working remotely. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are still seeing lower employee travel entertainment costs, some of the overtime and standby. Certainly into the third quarter, we expect that to be consistent as we move into the fourth quarter. And -- so again, it's basically items that are certainly within our control, items that we don't have to -- where there's -- it's not a compliance deadline related where we have a little discretion around the timing of that and in terms of actual dollars saved. Again, as we think about 2021, we'll provide a little bit more color around our O&M spending levels for '21 in November. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from in Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. \nInsoo Kim: A question on just demand trends that you're seeing on a more geographic basis. I know the bulk of your exposure is in Texas, but you do have exposure to a lot of different states. Just which jurisdictions are performing from a demand perspective, better than what you expected and which are a little bit more concerning? \nChristopher Forsythe: Well, as really the -- what we're seeing across the board, as I mentioned, Mid-Tex and Louisiana in the third quarter were probably the hardest hit from a volumetric perspective. And that was in that all in, in the 20% range. The other states range anywhere from 9% to 17%, 18%. And as I mentioned, too, we have seen a steady improvement since really the middle part of May, kind of when things seem to have bottomed out. So all in, when I talked about that 11% versus the 2 year historical average, most of our divisions now are kind of right in that range. You do see a little bit of weakness still, but again, it's improving in a bit in Mississippi and Louisiana. But overall, things continue to trend in a better way than what we were seeing in the first half of the third quarter. \nJohn Akers: Yes, Insoo, this is Kevin. The other thing I'd just add is if you go back in, as we did, as we're looking at these volumes, we also look at the unemployment rates. As some of our jurisdictions opened up their phased reopenings and moved into the second and third tiers of those, if you will, we've noticed slight improvements in the unemployment rates in just about every jurisdictions from an April Bureau of Labor Statistics average. If you look at those through the June numbers, almost every one of them has shown some slight improvement. We think that's reflected again back in those states reopenings, commercial, retail, some other businesses, industrials, opening back up, bringing folks back in and picking up some of the business there. So that was a good indicator for us as well. \nInsoo Kim: Great. In terms of cost contingencies, I think you spoke on it and a couple of people have asked the questions already. But given a little bit stronger-than-expected performance for this year, does it, all else being equal, give you a little bit more contingencies that you could utilize in 2021? \nChristopher Forsythe: Like I said earlier, yes, we're still evaluating and putting together our fiscal 2021 budget. We'll have to, obviously, see what's happening with our customer behavior, particularly on the nonresidential side and in the -- here in the fourth quarter before we make a final determination of what -- or how we align our O&M going into 2021. So we'll have more color on that in November. \nInsoo Kim: Got it. And finally, just on the technology side, I think you mentioned things like automated customer bill payments and whatnot. Whether it's that or other technological advancements you are making or plan to make on the horizon? Are -- what type of efficiencies could you realize from those type of -- that type of work? \nJohn Akers: Yes. I'll talk a little bit about that. And -- the more data, access to data and providing data in a sooner format, in a better format, a consumable format, more in real time, if you will, an example of that is our WMR network. We're now working with our vendor to have real-time cathodic protection pilots on our system. So now it's going on and having manual reads on our system. We can upload those through our network and get those readings off of our pipeline and our distribution system in real time. Now that again, not much from an efficiency standpoint, but it provides continuous monitoring of your system and allows you to identify where you might have a cathodic protection system down sooner rather than later. We continue to roll out our automated leak detection equipment as well. And you heard us talk before about our Locus Map technology that we are in the final stages of rolling out to some of our crews here in the Mid-Tex division, which allows us to gather construction, material information, geo location positions in real-time as we're at these sites and upload those right back into our compliance systems. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Ryan Levine from Citi. \nRyan Levine: What's the capacity resistance to handle hydrogen? And is that capacity different than the RNG capacity from a constraint standpoint? \nJohn Akers: Yes. Ryan, 2 separate things there. We know there's a lot of discussion here lately about hydrogen, particularly with some of the things that are going on in Europe right now. And I know some of the dual fuel companies are talking about projects at particular sites, a site-specific hydrogen utilization, if you will. So it's a much different look than if you think about some of the discussion of blending. That's not yet on the near-term horizon. There are studies going on through particular groups associations. GTI even has a group together that's studying opportunities around hydrogen at this point. So that to say, I think, it's early for us to think about, to your question, how does that fit into our current distribution system. There's a lot of things that need to be worked out from a material standpoint, a supply standpoint, a utilization standpoint at the customer premises. So, I think, that's further out for us. It is separate from RNG, whether it comes from landfill or it's captured through digesters. The only challenge there is the BTU content, the quality of the gas. But once you get over that hurdle, it blends right in with the rest of our stream that we're delivering to customers. And as we talked about before with you, we're doing about 5 to 6 Bcf a year of RNG across our system that we're moving, and we continue to look for those opportunities near our system today. \nRyan Levine: And then to clarify some of the earlier questions, in terms of contingencies in place to the extent that COVID impacts extend into the winter months. Am I correct in hearing that the key tools that you're looking at are O&M cost management and potentially capital market activity or are there other opportunities that you can pursue in order to adapt to the market conditions? \nChristopher Forsythe: I think you hit it on the head. It's just the -- again, looking at the O&M, aligning that O&M with the revenues that we're expected to get going into the next fiscal year. We're certainly mindful of the capital markets opportunities as well. As you can see in our 10-Q, we have layered in some hedges for future financing activities going out for a few years now to help lock in or take advantage of some of the current interest rate environment. So those are a couple of opportunities as well. So I think those are 2 very good ones to keep an eye on, and that's certainly items that we are contemplating as we finalize our fiscal '21 plans. \nRyan Levine: On the capital market activity, given your regulatory construct, would you look to cement those plans in the coming months or could they be phased in over a broader time period, if you were to... \nChristopher Forsythe: I am not sure I understand your question, Ryan. \nRyan Levine: Would you need to refinance debt or raise equity into the calendar year-end given the regulatory constructs in different jurisdictions? Or can you be more patient, if that's an option that you wanted to pursue? \nChristopher Forsythe: I see. Yes. So really the financing needs of the corporation, they're outlined on the website. It's at $5 billion to $6 billion over the current 5-year planning window of 2020 through 2024. Obviously, we'll update that in the fall as well. And those financing needs are really driven just by the -- primarily by the cash flow needs of the Corp and the spending needs. So I think we'll evaluate the timing and the execution of the various tools that we have available to us from a financing perspective. But we -- and obviously, you can also see we've layered in hedges for the fall for an anticipated debt issuance. So that one is kind of forecasted already and is out there for all to see. \nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Charles Fishman from Morningstar. \nCharles Fishman: I had a question on Slide 8, capital spending. Certainly, the 17% increase is terrific. You say you're on target. I guess, I happen to be in the Dallas area over the July 4 weekend and the construction along I-75 is amazing. And I was just wondering if you could provide some color. Is your new construction connections, which, I believe, is not part of the 88% safety and reliability, is that on target as well? Has that been impacted by COVID-19, at least with respect to your plan? And, obviously, my viewing is just a small piece of all your jurisdictions. I wonder if you can maybe provide some color on new construction in your other jurisdictions because, obviously, you don't have as much control over that as you do on the safety and reliability spend. \nJohn Akers: Right. I'll start out with a little color on the North Texas area there as you talked about and then on some of our other jurisdictions. But going into COVID and particularly the first month, 1.5 months, we did see a bit of a slowdown of dip, if you will, in the housing market, in particular, but they quickly rebounded. We're doing virtual tours of homes. The inventory of available homes on the market quickly tightened up. And we're seeing a lot of individuals, as you know, with the low interest rate, moving to the new construction. So we certainly see that pick up as things started to open back up and we got into these phased reopenings. \n We continue to see good growth in that market here in the North Texas area. I think as we said last year, we're experiencing somewhere around 1.5 to 1.6 net customer growth on the system, particularly all -- most of that is going to be here in the Metroplex area. So we've continued to see a little bit of a lull, but now a pickup in that residential market. And in other areas, not to quite that scale, but outside of Nashville in our Franklin service territory, we continue to see some good residential growth there as well and then outside of our Kansas City location and Olathe that area, we do continue to see some residential growth as well. All taking advantage of, we believe, as we keep a handle on, have conversations with builders, developers and realtors association, trying to take advantage of this low interest rate environment. \nCharles Fishman: So as we look -- as we sit here today, 2021, do you expect customer growth to still be around the 1.5%? \nJohn Akers: Yes. I think that's a good indication here -- as we, again, talk to builders and developers, they're continuing to develop properties. They're continuing to have people come in. Right now, we are continuing to see strong activity in that area. And yes... \nCharles Fishman: That's all I had. \nChristopher Forsythe: I was just going to say the other piece that's driving it, too, is that same home sales. Folks that already have homes are staying in their homes for obvious reasons. And so the folks that are looking to get out of the apartment environment or maybe out of an urban downtown environment are now flocking into that new home and growth markets. So it's -- that's just another piece that's driving some of that the customer growth. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. \nPeter Giannuzzi: This is actually Peter on for Jeremy. I just have a quick -- I just have a quick question on the EPS sensitivities, the update that you gave here. Is the change each quarter or at least what we have strictly related to historical demand for each customer class or are there other factors that you kind of think about when you give these? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. So on Slide 13, we do have the EPS sensitivity that we've updated that for the fourth quarter. So you can see again, on the bottom 1/3 or bottom half of the page, the revenue by customer class, residential on down through the nonresidential and then the sensitivities to the right. So that's basically the 1% change relative in the customer volumes in the fourth quarter and kind of how that moves it for us. So in terms of how that compares to the prior year, I mean, that's just a 1% change for each of those customer classes produces that EPS sensitivity. \nPeter Giannuzzi: Right. Okay. And so that's for the last quarter kind of right on a stand-alone basis. And then just to clarify, the one -- the sensitivity you provided at your last call, that was for just the back half or that was for on a full year basis? \nChristopher Forsythe: That was for the back half of the fiscal year. So we'll probably update this slide again in November to provide a better impact or what that 1% looks like on a full fiscal year basis here in November. \nPeter Giannuzzi: Okay. And then, I guess, just last one here. I guess, looking at the sensitivities, obviously, lower for each class compared to what you showed for the back half last quarter. But should we think about the net impact kind of being the same as we see recovery across all classes where residential still kind of offsets the same amount of, I guess, drag from the other classes like -- on a relative basis, kind of like what we saw in 3Q? \nChristopher Forsythe: Well, a couple of comments there. I mean, the impacts are smaller here in the fourth quarter because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the first half of the third quarter, you're still seeing some volumetric influence across all customer classes and now beginning at the latter half of May and June, all the way to December, we're primarily into the base charge component only of the bill given the summer months. So I mean what remains to be seen exactly how customers are going to behave. Like I said, we have seen modest improvement since the lows have been made. That's something we're watching very closely. And it's for that reason, we don't have -- it's hard for us to predict as we look out, particularly as some of our reopenings have slowed a little bit. So that's why we provided the sensitivities in 13 for you to make that assessment. \nOperator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. \nDaniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call will be available for replay on our website through November 12, 2020. Have a good day. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and everyone, you may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Christopher Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2020 third quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.96 compared to $0.68 in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, we reported diluted earnings per share of $4.37 compared to $3.88 in the prior year period. Results for the quarter and year-to-date periods included a onetime noncash income tax benefit of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share related to a change in our state deferred tax rate resulting from legislation that was passed by the Kansas Legislature in June to eliminate the assessment of state income taxes on regulated utilities operating in the state. As a result of the change in our state deferred tax rate, we reduced our deferred tax liability by $33 million during the fiscal third quarter. We established a $12 million regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes that will be returned to Kansas customers, and we recognize remaining $21 million as a onetime income tax benefit. Excluding this nonrecurring benefit, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.79 and $4.2 year-to-date. \n Consolidated operating income during the 9 months ended June 30 rose over 10% to $723 million. Rate increases in both our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability spending totaled $111 million. We also experienced a $10 million increase in distribution operating income, primarily due to customer growth in our Mid-Tex division. During the 12 months ended June 30, our Mid-Tex division experienced net customer growth of 1.6%. On a consolidated basis, we experienced net customer growth of 1.3% over the same period. \n The impact of COVID-19 did not have a material impact on our year-to-date operating income as we are able to align our O&M spending with a decline in nonresidential customer consumption we experienced during the third quarter. Through the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we earned approximately 85% of our distribution revenues. Additionally, residential revenues comprised approximately 60% of our distribution revenues during the second half of the year. These bills are at their lowest during this time. \n Finally, we collect a significant portion of our revenues, excluding gas costs, through the base charge, which partially insulates us from volumetric risk. For most of our service territories the base charge represents the largest portion of a customer's bill by the middle of our third fiscal quarter. For the year-to-date period, we experienced a $7 million reduction in operating income due to lower sales and transportation volumes during the third quarter. We did not identify a meaningful change in residential consumption due to COVID. However, we did experience a 14% decline in nonresidential consumption. We also saw a $3 million decline in service order revenue, primarily due to the suspension of collection activities. Our nonresidential consumption decline was concentrated in our commercial customer class, which declined 18% during the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. We experienced most of the volumetric decline in our Mid-Tex and Louisiana divisions. \n During the quarter, we saw commercial consumption climb by as much as 30% compared to the 2-year historical average in certain of our states by mid-May as shelter-in-place orders in our service areas impacted their businesses. However, since that time, we have seen a steady improvement. Through mid-July, commercial customer usage was just 11% below the 2-year average over the same period. \n Additionally, we experienced a 12% decline in transportation volumes during the third quarter, primarily due to slower economic activity in the Automotive and Metals sectors. These declines in operating income were offset by a $17 million decrease in O&M expense, primarily associated with employee costs for overtime; standby and other costs; lower travel and training costs; and the temporary deferral of pipeline maintenance activities. \n In our Pipeline and Storage segment, over 80% of APT's revenues are earned from delivery services to our Mid-Tex division and a few other LDCs under a straight fixed variable rate design. The remainder of APT's revenues relates to its 3 system business and other ancillary pipeline services. As a reminder, APT only keeps 25% of revenues earned from these activities under its straight design. \n During the third quarter, we experienced a net $2.5 million decrease in transportation and other revenue in this segment. APT's quarter-over-quarter through-system volumes declined 19% and prices declined by 30% due to reduced associated gas production in the Permian Basin. Year-to-date, transportation and other revenue declined by less than $1 million. \n Slides 6 and 7 provide additional details of period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. On the regulatory front, to date, we have implemented $123 million in annual operating income increases. Additionally, we received approval for the 4 Texas GRIP filings that we voluntarily delayed in March for $23 million. These filings will be implemented on September 1. Currently, we have $141 million of regulatory filings in progress, most of which are scheduled to be implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Details of these filings can be found on Slides 19 through 29. \n And other regulatory matters, we have orders in 5 of our 8 states that address the impacts of COVID-19. These orders cover more than 85% of our distribution customers and APT. Generally, these orders allow us to defer net incremental expenses, including bad debt expense and in a few of our states, certain lost revenues due to COVID-19. We are still evaluating these orders. Therefore, we did not record any regulatory assets or liabilities related to COVID-19 as of June 30. Slide 14 summarizes these orders. \n As of June 30, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong. Our equity capitalization was 58.8%, and we finished the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in liquidity, including $750 million in cash between our operating accounts and ATM net proceeds. \n During the third quarter, we executed new forward sales arrangements for approximately 2.3 million shares with anticipated net proceeds of $234 million. Additionally, we sold approximately 1 million shares for $100 million. Through June 30, we had sold about 3.6 million shares for $359 million. And as of June 30, we had about $547 million in cash available under equity forward arrangements. \n Yesterday, we reaffirmed our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $4.58 to $4.73. We now have more clarity around how COVID has and continues to affect our business from a customer perspective and an operational perspective. Based on what we understand today, we now believe earnings per share will be at the upper end of the range. For the fourth quarter, we have assumed similar nonresidential consumption declines that we experienced in the third quarter as several of our states have slowed the pace of reopening their economies. Additionally, we expect fourth quarter O&M to trend similarly to what we experienced during the third quarter. Slides 15 and 16 provide additional details around our guidance. \n Thanks for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin for some closing remarks. Well, Rich, that's a good question. With the fiscal year-end rapidly coming to a close, we're deep in our planning cycle right now and we're certainly evaluating what's going on in the economies in the 8 states that we serve. And so we're keeping a close eye on that. We're not ready to announce yet what assumptions we're going to put into the fiscal 2021 guidance. As you know, we'll roll that out here in the fall in November. But we are taking a look at that. We're also assessing operationally what we're going to be doing to keep our employees safe and the community safe, and we'll have a better picture and more information to provide in November. When you say offsets, I mean, it's primarily -- we just have to continue to see, first and foremost, what we can do in terms of work that can be performed and doing it in a way that we can keep our employees safe, keep our community safe. And as Kevin said at the top of the call, doing our part to minimize the spread of the virus in the community. So we, obviously, have compliance work that has to be completed on certain schedules and time lines, and we can't let that slip. But we will be evaluating things, but we do have a little bit of discretion in the event that we do need to align our O&M with any potential volumetric and revenue declines due to the pandemic. I think we've been pretty consistent now for the last year, 12 to 15 months that the ATM is our preferred method for raising equity. We've got our financing plan out there, and we intend to do -- execute that financing plan in a balanced fashion with both long-term debt and equity. And we'll seek to use the ATM to the best of our ability to meet those equity needs for fiscal 2021 and beyond. So far, it really hasn't materially impacted us, and there's a couple of things to keep in mind around bad debt and collections. First, in all of our service territories, moratoriums are still in place that -- or in most of our service territories to prohibit the disconnect or resumption of collection activities. We then need to evaluate what the tone is from the regulatory environment. What's the tone from just the community in terms of those types of activities. Once we do begin to collect or resume collection activities, one, that could be several months down the road. But then number two, we won't see the impact of really bad debt until well beyond the resumption of those activities because it takes a certain number of months for it to work through the process of collection before it ultimately gets written off. \n So right now, as where we sit here today it hasn't had a material impact on our business for fiscal 2020. Certainly, a watcheye and that we're keeping an eye on for fiscal 2021. But we think it's going to be some time before we begin to see that -- those bad debts really begin to rise up. And then you have to work it through the regulatory process and because we do have the opportunity first to have an annual filing mechanism. And as I mentioned, we do have the reg asset orders in 5 of out of 8 states, which provides us another tool to address those types of costs. I think at this point, it's probably just a little bit too soon to tell when exactly we're going to see that rise in bad debt. And then number two, when it will ultimately be reflected in rates. Sure. Go ahead, Kevin, you start. Yes. I would just say to add to that too, as we are still working remotely. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are still seeing lower employee travel entertainment costs, some of the overtime and standby. Certainly into the third quarter, we expect that to be consistent as we move into the fourth quarter. And -- so again, it's basically items that are certainly within our control, items that we don't have to -- where there's -- it's not a compliance deadline related where we have a little discretion around the timing of that and in terms of actual dollars saved. Again, as we think about 2021, we'll provide a little bit more color around our O&M spending levels for '21 in November. Well, as really the -- what we're seeing across the board, as I mentioned, Mid-Tex and Louisiana in the third quarter were probably the hardest hit from a volumetric perspective. And that was in that all in, in the 20% range. The other states range anywhere from 9% to 17%, 18%. And as I mentioned, too, we have seen a steady improvement since really the middle part of May, kind of when things seem to have bottomed out. So all in, when I talked about that 11% versus the 2 year historical average, most of our divisions now are kind of right in that range. You do see a little bit of weakness still, but again, it's improving in a bit in Mississippi and Louisiana. But overall, things continue to trend in a better way than what we were seeing in the first half of the third quarter. Like I said earlier, yes, we're still evaluating and putting together our fiscal 2021 budget. We'll have to, obviously, see what's happening with our customer behavior, particularly on the nonresidential side and in the -- here in the fourth quarter before we make a final determination of what -- or how we align our O&M going into 2021. So we'll have more color on that in November. I think you hit it on the head. It's just the -- again, looking at the O&M, aligning that O&M with the revenues that we're expected to get going into the next fiscal year. We're certainly mindful of the capital markets opportunities as well. As you can see in our 10-Q, we have layered in some hedges for future financing activities going out for a few years now to help lock in or take advantage of some of the current interest rate environment. So those are a couple of opportunities as well. So I think those are 2 very good ones to keep an eye on, and that's certainly items that we are contemplating as we finalize our fiscal '21 plans. I am not sure I understand your question, Ryan. I see. Yes. So really the financing needs of the corporation, they're outlined on the website. It's at $5 billion to $6 billion over the current 5-year planning window of 2020 through 2024. Obviously, we'll update that in the fall as well. And those financing needs are really driven just by the -- primarily by the cash flow needs of the Corp and the spending needs. So I think we'll evaluate the timing and the execution of the various tools that we have available to us from a financing perspective. But we -- and obviously, you can also see we've layered in hedges for the fall for an anticipated debt issuance. So that one is kind of forecasted already and is out there for all to see. I was just going to say the other piece that's driving it, too, is that same home sales. Folks that already have homes are staying in their homes for obvious reasons. And so the folks that are looking to get out of the apartment environment or maybe out of an urban downtown environment are now flocking into that new home and growth markets. So it's -- that's just another piece that's driving some of that the customer growth. Yes. So on Slide 13, we do have the EPS sensitivity that we've updated that for the fourth quarter. So you can see again, on the bottom 1/3 or bottom half of the page, the revenue by customer class, residential on down through the nonresidential and then the sensitivities to the right. So that's basically the 1% change relative in the customer volumes in the fourth quarter and kind of how that moves it for us. So in terms of how that compares to the prior year, I mean, that's just a 1% change for each of those customer classes produces that EPS sensitivity. That was for the back half of the fiscal year. So we'll probably update this slide again in November to provide a better impact or what that 1% looks like on a full fiscal year basis here in November. Well, a couple of comments there. I mean, the impacts are smaller here in the fourth quarter because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the first half of the third quarter, you're still seeing some volumetric influence across all customer classes and now beginning at the latter half of May and June, all the way to December, we're primarily into the base charge component only of the bill given the summer months. So I mean what remains to be seen exactly how customers are going to behave. Like I said, we have seen modest improvement since the lows have been made. That's something we're watching very closely. And it's for that reason, we don't have -- it's hard for us to predict as we look out, particularly as some of our reopenings have slowed a little bit. So that's why we provided the sensitivities in 13 for you to make that assessment."

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Atmos Energy. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy as we continue to navigate our way through this challenge together. The safety of our employees, our customers and the safety of our communities remain our focus as we continue to deliver safe and reliable natural gas service. Today, over 95% of our employees continue to work remotely as we are doing our part to reduce the spread of the virus, following the CDC guidelines as well as following our safety protocols such as hand washing, practicing social distancing and wearing face coverings. As I've said before, we were early to transition to remote work and we will be very intentional about returning to our offices. We continue listening closely to the health experts and following the data as we go about our daily operations. \n As I shared last quarter, through the outstanding work of our Risk Management and Compliance Committee, our senior leadership team and all 4,800 Atmos Energy employees, we were well prepared to transition every facet of our business to a remote work environment in mid-March. That level of preparation and agility served us well as we continued executing at the highest levels during the third fiscal quarter. For example, our customer service agents and service technicians continued providing exceptional customer service, as indicated by our customers rating their satisfaction with our agents and technicians at 98%. \n Our strategic focus on digital bill delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as the percentage of electronic bills issued as of the end of the third quarter increased to 45%. And our electronic methods of payments received such as bank drafts, credit cards and online banking increased to 76% of the payments received as of June 30. Through these innovative electronic bill delivery and payment channels, Atmos Energy and our customers are doing our part to conserve environmental resources. For example, on an annual basis, the use of this technology saves approximately 1,300 tons of wood, nearly 6 million pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent, 7 million gallons of water and nearly 400,000 pounds of waste. During the quarter, we deployed mobile wallet, a unique bill delivery platform enabling customers to view and pay their bill and manage their Atmos Energy accounts from Apple Wallet or Google Pay. \n I also want to highlight the great work of our Safety and Enterprise Services and Operations teams that they are doing in the area of damage prevention, especially given we are just 5 days away from National 811 Day. This work is an integral part of our ongoing commitment to safety and our proactive measures to help raise awareness about third-party excavation damage, which is one of the greatest threats to the safety of distribution systems. Our teams have implemented a damage prevention ambassador program. They've developed social media alerts and other public awareness campaigns, such as postponing nonessential digging during the COVID-19 pandemic. All these efforts support the year-to-date result of a damage rate that is less than the industry average. \n Using our safety practices and protocols I mentioned earlier, we have continued executing our proven investment strategy and remain on track to meet our capital spending range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. A safely performing distribution and transmission pipeline system work that includes maintenance and compliance activities, pipe replacement, line locating and system inspections. Our fiscal year-to-date consolidated capital spending grew 17% to $1.4 billion, with approximately 88% of our spending being directed towards safety and reliability, all to modernize our system. Finally, our financial position remains very strong. And at the end of June, our liquidity was almost $3 billion, and our balance sheet continues to be very strong. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris for a financial update, and I will turn shortly with a few closing remarks. Chris? Thank you, Chris. Community service is woven into the fabric of Atmos Energy's culture, we call Atmos Spirit. And our 4,800 employees take pride in fueling safe and thriving communities each and every day. During National Hospitality Week -- or Hospital Week, in May, we saluted our medical professionals\u2019 heroic efforts by delivering more than 12,000 meals to health care heroes across our 8 state service area. In valuing our strong partnerships with local restaurant owners and chefs across our 1,400 communities, we celebrated Take-Out Tuesday, an initiative that brings support to local restaurants by offering all employees the opportunity to enjoy lunch from the favorite neighborhood restaurant. Along with these enterprise-wide efforts to lift each other up during these uncertain times, we are fueling safe and thriving communities in ways both large and small. By working with school districts, early childhood programs and nonprofits across our service area to improve the reading proficiency by third grade and to feed hungry children so they can learn and thrive. I'm truly inspired by the many ways our employees come together to give of their time and talent to further support those who need a helping hand. \n As I said earlier, our robust risk management process has served us extremely well during this pandemic and will continue to guide us as we execute at the highest levels on all facets of our business. Our year-to-date results were in line with our expectations. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have further enhanced our liquidity. Our focus remains the same: the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities as we execute our proven investment strategy; and continue delivering safe, reliable, affordable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. \n With that, I'll open it up for questions. Yes. Aga, this is Kevin, I'll just follow-up a little bit on that. In addition, our customer service agents and our customer advocacy team that supports those agents have been for several months now reaching out to customers in all classes, residential, commercial and industrial, about different payment options that exist out there for them, LIHEAP, local health agencies those sort of things. And whether those were outbound calls, letters, some folks allow us to have their e-mail address, getting in contacting with it. That way, we've been very proactive in reaching out to customers that appear to be having a tough time paying their bill. And we're going to continue to do that as we move forward and head towards this upcoming heating season. Yes, the type of work... Well, I was going to talk about the components and things that we looked at that we could defer going into the period. I'll hand off to Chris to talk to you about the numbers specifically. But there's such things like this right-of-way encroachment clearing trees, overhang brush, those sort of things, cleanup around GIS data, record digitization, those sort of things. And where we're ahead on certain inspections on our systems right now. Those things that we can move out to a different period, not do away with, not cancel, but move to a different period. Those are the sort of O&M things that we have shifted during the last quarter to 2 quarters and are currently evaluating now what opportunities do we have maybe to pick back up some of that and what does that timing look like as we head that into the end of this fiscal year and into next fiscal year. Chris? Yes, Insoo, this is Kevin. The other thing I'd just add is if you go back in, as we did, as we're looking at these volumes, we also look at the unemployment rates. As some of our jurisdictions opened up their phased reopenings and moved into the second and third tiers of those, if you will, we've noticed slight improvements in the unemployment rates in just about every jurisdictions from an April Bureau of Labor Statistics average. If you look at those through the June numbers, almost every one of them has shown some slight improvement. We think that's reflected again back in those states reopenings, commercial, retail, some other businesses, industrials, opening back up, bringing folks back in and picking up some of the business there. So that was a good indicator for us as well. Yes. I'll talk a little bit about that. And -- the more data, access to data and providing data in a sooner format, in a better format, a consumable format, more in real time, if you will, an example of that is our WMR network. We're now working with our vendor to have real-time cathodic protection pilots on our system. So now it's going on and having manual reads on our system. We can upload those through our network and get those readings off of our pipeline and our distribution system in real time. Now that again, not much from an efficiency standpoint, but it provides continuous monitoring of your system and allows you to identify where you might have a cathodic protection system down sooner rather than later. We continue to roll out our automated leak detection equipment as well. And you heard us talk before about our Locus Map technology that we are in the final stages of rolling out to some of our crews here in the Mid-Tex division, which allows us to gather construction, material information, geo location positions in real-time as we're at these sites and upload those right back into our compliance systems. Yes. Ryan, 2 separate things there. We know there's a lot of discussion here lately about hydrogen, particularly with some of the things that are going on in Europe right now. And I know some of the dual fuel companies are talking about projects at particular sites, a site-specific hydrogen utilization, if you will. So it's a much different look than if you think about some of the discussion of blending. That's not yet on the near-term horizon. There are studies going on through particular groups associations. GTI even has a group together that's studying opportunities around hydrogen at this point. So that to say, I think, it's early for us to think about, to your question, how does that fit into our current distribution system. There's a lot of things that need to be worked out from a material standpoint, a supply standpoint, a utilization standpoint at the customer premises. So, I think, that's further out for us. It is separate from RNG, whether it comes from landfill or it's captured through digesters. The only challenge there is the BTU content, the quality of the gas. But once you get over that hurdle, it blends right in with the rest of our stream that we're delivering to customers. And as we talked about before with you, we're doing about 5 to 6 Bcf a year of RNG across our system that we're moving, and we continue to look for those opportunities near our system today. Right. I'll start out with a little color on the North Texas area there as you talked about and then on some of our other jurisdictions. But going into COVID and particularly the first month, 1.5 months, we did see a bit of a slowdown of dip, if you will, in the housing market, in particular, but they quickly rebounded. We're doing virtual tours of homes. The inventory of available homes on the market quickly tightened up. And we're seeing a lot of individuals, as you know, with the low interest rate, moving to the new construction. So we certainly see that pick up as things started to open back up and we got into these phased reopenings. \n We continue to see good growth in that market here in the North Texas area. I think as we said last year, we're experiencing somewhere around 1.5 to 1.6 net customer growth on the system, particularly all -- most of that is going to be here in the Metroplex area. So we've continued to see a little bit of a lull, but now a pickup in that residential market. And in other areas, not to quite that scale, but outside of Nashville in our Franklin service territory, we continue to see some good residential growth there as well and then outside of our Kansas City location and Olathe that area, we do continue to see some residential growth as well. All taking advantage of, we believe, as we keep a handle on, have conversations with builders, developers and realtors association, trying to take advantage of this low interest rate environment. Yes. I think that's a good indication here -- as we, again, talk to builders and developers, they're continuing to develop properties. They're continuing to have people come in. Right now, we are continuing to see strong activity in that area. And yes..."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President and Treasurer for Atmos Energy. Thank you. You may begin. \nDaniel Meziere: Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the Internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab.\n As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 32 and are more fully described in our SEC filings.\n Our first speaker is Kevin Akers, President and CEO of Atmos Energy. Kevin? \nJohn Akers: Thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy as we continue to navigate our way through this challenge together.\n I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank our everyday heroes, those who are helping our country battle this pandemic: our first responders, health care workers, law enforcement officials, grocery store employees, truck drivers delivering our nation's supplies, those serving in our branches of the military and all essential services providers working to support our communities. Thank you for what you are doing to help all of us. We are eternally grateful.\n I also want to thank our 4,800 Atmos Energy everyday heroes as they continue to provide our customers safe and reliable natural gas service. I'm extremely proud of their dedication and commitment to keeping our 3.1 million customers of 1,400 communities and themselves healthy and safe. Atmos Energy's commitment to safety paired with our culture have led us during unique times, and this will be no different.\n In early February, our Chief Information Officer led a team effort to assess and test our company-wide remote work capabilities, including our 2 customer support centers, gas supply, our 2 gas control centers, our shared service functions and over 200 operational service centers across our 8-state service territory. Through their efforts, by mid-March when local and state governments started issuing shelter-in-place orders, we were ready to transition every facet of our business to a fully remote work environment. Today, we have over 95% of our employees working remotely and continuing to perform at the highest levels.\n As an example of their outstanding effort, for the month of April, our customer service agent satisfaction scores were 97.6%, and our service technician satisfaction scores were 97.4%. Truly outstanding work by that team.\n In addition, our Risk Management and Compliance Committee, along with senior leaders from across the company, focused on several operational scenario planning exercises in early March. These exercises, based on current world and U.S. situations, were focused on maintaining the safety of our customers, communities and employees as we continue to provide reliable natural gas service. Specific areas of focus were emergency response, system maintenance and compliance work, including pipe replacement, line locating, system inspections as well as the ability to remotely train employees.\n Besides working remotely, you will see employees doing our part to reduce the spread of the virus by practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings while working in our communities or working in smaller construction crews. We believe the above implemented practices for our employees and our contractors, along with using CDC guidelines to design safety protocols for things such as self temperature and system screening, have us positioned to continue providing safe and reliable natural gas service.\n Using the safety practices and protocols mentioned above under shelter-in-place orders, we have been able to safely perform distribution and transmission pipeline system work. This work includes maintenance and compliance activities, pipe replacement, line locating and system inspections.\n In preparing our work plans, practices and protocols, we worked with our regulatory agencies, local and state officials, emergency management, the American Gas Association and industry peers across our service territory. We greatly appreciate their leadership and ongoing support as we all work together for the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities.\n Our culture atmosphere has guided us in the past, is guiding us during this challenging time and will continue to guide us into the future as we look to be at our best, bring out the best in others and make a difference. Making a difference for local food banks and communities across our 8 states to help keep meals on tables through our donation of $1.5 million. Being at our best, Atmos Energy employees partnered with many nonprofit agencies, schools, hospitals throughout our service territory to fill lunch bags for children, provide meals for our health care heroes and first responders or by donating much-needed plasma. Making a difference for our customers by temporarily suspending disconnections for nonpayment and waive late payment and certain reconnect fees during these challenging times so customers continue to have safe and reliable natural gas service for heat, water heat and cooking.\n I'm extremely proud of our 4,800 employees in how their atmosphere has shined so brightly upon our neighbors and our communities. Also making a difference, we closely work with our regulators to develop solutions to the mutual benefit of our customers in the company. We have elected to defer implementation of new rates for approximately 32% of our customers in Texas from our fiscal third quarter to at least September 1 of this year.\n Additionally, we have received regulatory orders in 4 states covering approximately 80% of our customers to defer any COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense. In April, we executed $900 million in new financing arrangements to further solidify our liquidity. As of April 30, our liquidity was $2.9 billion and our balance sheet remains very strong.\n Now I would like to turn the call over to Chris for a financial update, and I will return shortly with a few closing remarks. \nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fiscal 2020 second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.95 compared to $1.82 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, diluted earnings per share were $3.42 compared with $3.21 per diluted share in the prior year period.\n As Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, mitigation efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 began to impact our service territories during the last 2 weeks of March. Therefore, we did not experience a material impact from COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. Consolidated operating income during the 6 months ended March 31 rose over 9% to $584 million.\n I will touch on a few of the highlights now. Rate increases in both our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, totaled $83 million. Customer growth in our distribution segment contributed incremental $8.5 million as we continue to benefit from the strong population growth in several of our service areas, most notably in the DFW Metroplex. For the 12 months ended March 31, we experienced 1.5% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.2% net customer growth across our 8-state footprint.\n Consolidated O&M increased $12 million or 4.2% primarily driven by higher employee and information technology costs and pipeline and maintenance activities. The period-over-period increase also reflects well integrity work that incurred during our first fiscal quarter.\n Slides 5 and 6 provide additional details of the period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. Consolidated capital spending for the 6-month period grew 28% to $995 million, with 87% directed towards safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. Because of our designation as an essential service provider and the measures we have taken to protect our employees and contractors, we still believe our fiscal 2020 capital spending will range between $1.85 billion and $1.95 billion.\n Our fiscal second quarter is the busiest regulatory filing period of our fiscal year. Year-to-date, we have implemented $58 million of annualized operating regulatory outcomes. And currently, we have about $215 million in progress. Of this amount, we currently anticipate to implement approximately $100 million in annualized regulatory outcomes by the end of the fiscal year. Slides 21 to 31 provide details for all of these filings. Slide 20 outlines our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n Maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and a strong liquidity position continues to be one of our primary financial objectives, and it has served us well during this uncertain time. During the second quarter, we filed a $4 billion shelf registration statement and we filed a new $1 billion ATM program.\n Also in the second quarter, we executed new forward sales agreements for approximately 1.6 million shares with anticipated proceeds of $180 million as of March 31, we had about $419 million in cash available under equity forward arrangements. With this activity, we have priced all of our anticipated equity needs for fiscal 2020 and a portion of fiscal 2021.\n Additionally, the strength of our balance sheet supports our Tier 1 commercial paper rating. As a result, we have been able to maintain reasonable access to the commercial paper markets. As of March 31, we had about $200 million in outstanding commercial paper. At the end of the second quarter, our equity capitalization was 58.2%, and we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements.\n Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, we took action in April to increase our liquidity to approximately $2.9 billion. We accomplished this through the execution of a $200 million 2-year term loan and 3 new 364-day credit facilities totaling $700 million. The net proceeds from the term loan were used to repay all outstanding commercial paper backstopped by our primary $1.5 billion credit facility.\n This facility is fully available and in place through September 2023. Additional details regarding our liquidity can found on Slide 10. We believe this liquidity position, the strength of our balance sheet and $3 billion available under our shelf registration statement gives us the financial flexibility to support our operations as we move forward.\n Looking towards the second half of the fiscal year, we are certainly aware that the economies of the service areas we serve have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent economic data reflects rising unemployment in each of our states. However, based on what we know today, we still expect earnings per share in the range of $4.58 to $4.73.\n We considered a number of factors in our evaluation. First, our winter heating season is complete. We typically earn approximately 70% of our distribution revenues during the first half of our fiscal year. In our distribution segment, although we are not fully decoupled, we believe there are factors that mitigate revenue risk for this segment. These factors are summarized on Slide 14.\n Residential revenues comprise approximately 60% of the segment's revenues during the second half of the fiscal year and residential builds were at their lowest during this time. Additionally, we collect a significant portion of our revenues, excluding gas cost, through the base charge, which partially insulates us from volumetric risk. For most of our service territories, the base charge represents the largest portion of the customer's bill by the middle of our third fiscal quarter.\n We typically experience a decline in volumes during April. However, given that April is a shoulder month, it is difficult for us to identify if changes in volumes are weather related or representative of underlying economic activity. Therefore, we have provided some sensitivity information by customer class on Slide 14.\n Additionally, the rate design and various annual filing mechanisms in our distribution segment support our ability to recover our costs timely. Slide 15 summarizes various aspects of rate design by state. Most of these mechanisms are well understood by you. However, I wanted to highlight that since March 31, our regulators in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Virginia had issued orders to defer COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense, into a regulatory asset for consideration for future recovery. These orders cover approximately 80% of our customers.\n Finally, as Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, for approximately 32% of our customers in Texas, including the City of Dallas, we have voluntarily delayed implementation of new rates that were scheduled to go into effect during our fiscal third quarter to at least September 1. These delayed implementations will not have a material impact to our fiscal 2020 financial performance due to the time of year if these rates would have been implemented.\n In our pipeline and storage segment, revenues are earned primarily through demand fees. As you're aware, performance of the segment is predominantly driven by APT. Over 80% of APT's revenues are earned from delivery services to our North Texas distribution company and a few other LDCs under a straight, fixed, variable rate design. The remainder of APT's revenues relate to its 3-system business and other ancillary pipeline services. As a reminder, APT only keeps 25% of revenues earned from these activities under its rate design. And the COVID-19 regulatory asset order issued by the Texas Railroad Commission also applies to APT.\n Finally, from an O&M perspective, we have deferred some discretionary spending to future periods as we remain focused on the health and safety of our employees. Slides 17 and 18 provide additional details around our guidance.\n Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin for some closing remarks. \nJohn Akers: As you can see, we have a robust risk management process that has served us extremely well during this pandemic and will continue to guide us as we navigate our way through. As you just heard, we have continued to execute at the highest levels on all facets of our business.\n Our year-to-date results were in line with our expectations. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have further enhanced our liquidity. And as we stated earlier, we have continued our system maintenance and compliance work, including pipe replacement, line locating and system inspections.\n Our leadership team and all 4,800 employees were prepared to operate in this environment as it developed in our service areas and have continued to adjust and adapt as new information or local and state orders were issued. We were early to transition to remote work, and we will be very intentional about reopening our offices.\n As you have heard, orders to shelter in place began in mid-March with others being issued in April across our service territory. Therefore, we have not yet seen material impacts to our business. Additionally, 6 of our 8 states have now lifted their shelter-in-place orders and have begun phased reopening plans.\n Over the next quarter, we anticipate having further information and results available to assess any operational or financial impact. Our focus remains the same: the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities as we execute our proven investment strategy and continue delivering safe, reliable, affordable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.\n With that, we'll open up for questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Aga Zmigrodzka with UBS. \nAga Zmigrodzka: Could you please provide more color on the reaffirmed CapEx range? Which factors could potentially push you to the lower end of the range? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. With respect to the CapEx range, we're $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. Again, we are an essential service provider. Our crews are working using -- practicing safe social distances. So to the extent that a regulatory authority were to come in and change our designation as an essential service provider, ask us to stop or slow down for whatever reason as they navigate through the pandemic, that could be a factor that could drive us towards the lower end of that range. \nAga Zmigrodzka: Can you discuss what you're seeing in terms of COVID-19? You provided some sensitivities. What is the impact that you're actually including in your 2020 guidance? \nChristopher Forsythe: Well, as I said, April is a shoulder month for us. We have -- we've certainly modeled some potential outcomes. But we really can't see yet what is driving the decline in volumes that we typically see in April, if it's seasonality or if it's a true underlying economic activity. So we put those sensitivities out there for everyone to use in their modeling and in their evaluation. \nAga Zmigrodzka: And my last question is have you seen any delays from PUCs on your pending or expected filings? \nChristopher Forsythe: No, we haven't. We -- as I mentioned, we have $215 million in progress at this point in time. This is our busiest filing period of the year. A large number of those filings were filed right at the end of March or the first part of April, and we are working through the discovery process with our intervenors in due course.\n Everyone's working really well from home. So information is flowing back and forth. For a large number, about roughly $100 million of that filing, and exclusive of $215 million, is not scheduled to be implemented until October 1. And those are our Texas RRM filings. So we're very early in the process. We have another $15 million or so that was filed for Louisiana. That's scheduled to be implemented on July 1. And at this time, we have no indication of any delays. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richie Ciciarelli with Bank of America. \nRichard Ciciarelli: I hope everyone's staying safe and healthy out there. I appreciate you guys taking my question. Yes. Just had a question on the O&M guidance, reduced -- essentially flat outlook for 2020. Is this principally in response to COVID? And can you kind of discuss where these cost cuts are coming from? And how you're thinking about O&M over the forecast period? \nChristopher Forsythe: Sure. Yes, a lot of it is COVID related. We're focused on the health and safety of our employees. So to the extent that we don't have to perform compliance-related work in order to keep those employees out of the community or limit our actual exposure to it, we've got employees in the community, we decided to pull back on some of that discretionary O&M.\n So that's typical work like encroachment, right of way maintenance. We've done a really good job over the years by keeping up with a lot of that work. So they gave us some flexibility to defer that to future periods and other types of work, be it noncompliance-related in-line inspection and other noncompliance-related pipeline maintenance activity.\n So we see the guidance range on Page 18 for O&M. As you noted, it is flat to flattish to last year. And we'll just continue to monitor our O&M and really the entire organizational -- the operations of the organization as we move through the next 6 months. \nRichard Ciciarelli: Got it. That's very helpful. And you're still -- for long-term forecast, are you still expecting the 2.5% to 3%? Or is it something less than that now? \nChristopher Forsythe: At this point, given what we know, we're holding to the 2.5% to 3.5%. Again, we're going to come through the pandemic. And at some point, this work that we're deferring will have to be completed. So for now, we're holding to that. \nRichard Ciciarelli: Okay. Got it. That's very helpful. And sorry if I missed it, but did you explicitly reaffirm your 2020 guidance? I know you said it was unchanged. But just curious if you explicitly reaffirmed it. Because I mean, it seems like minimal sales impact, as best as we can tell, you have all the regulatory mechanisms in place. I just wanted to make sure we understand you correctly here on 2020. \nChristopher Forsythe: Sure. Sure. I mean you can see it in our earnings release. It's in the titling. It says it's reaffirmed. And again, based on what we know today, we believe the range of $4.58 to $4.73 is appropriate. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. \nCharles Fishman: You have a unique regulatory framework in Texas on the distribution with the municipalities and the Railroad Commission. When you made the statement, Kevin, that -- with respect to the treatment of the asset deferral with respect to any COVID-19-related cost, is that similar to how the state commissions work and how that's going to be treated? Or is there any unique factors just because of the different regulatory framework you have in Texas? \nJohn Akers: No, I don't think there's any uniqueness to it. It works very similar as it does in the other jurisdictions. We'll incur those costs and in our next filing, we'll take those under consideration and review. So we're just like our other jurisdictions. \nCharles Fishman: So the municipalities actually gave you that order? Or was that done at the Railroad Commission? How did that work? \nJohn Akers: That was through the Railroad Commission that... \nCharles Fishman: Okay. Which is the ultimate regulator for the distribution? \nJohn Akers: That is correct. \nCharles Fishman: Okay. And then I heard you talk about 2020 CapEx. Are you also reaffirming, though, the $10 billion to $11 billion of CapEx between 2020 and 2024? \nJohn Akers: As we said, well, we've been able to continue our capital work through this program designated as an essential service provider. We anticipate continuing to be able to do that and at this point, don't see anything out there that would defer our capital strategy that we have in place right now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. \nRyan Levine: Would you be able to comment on what you're seeing in the labor market within your service territory and how that impacts any of your hiring or spending programs? \nChristopher Forsythe: Sure. I mentioned that we are -- go ahead, Kevin. \nJohn Akers: Well, right now, as Chris and I said in our opening remarks, we've been able to do the work that we need to get done to maintain the safety and reliability of our system, both on the distribution and transmission side and coupled with our employees and our contract employees, believe we have the appropriate staff levels at this point. There are some impacts, as you would imagine, from the oil fields at this point on the unemployment numbers. But we believe we are fully staffed and operational, continue to do the things we need to do on a daily basis. \nRyan Levine: Okay. And then in terms of just practical implementation of some of your spending programs, you mentioned that you practice -- or additional social distancing in order to implementing the projects. I mean what does that mean in practice? Does that mean you need to -- takes a little longer to do the jobs? Or you just -- can you kind of just delineate what the practical implications are? \nJohn Akers: Yes. For example, on our main replacement, we would have a larger crew that would go out and work on the main and service lines at the same time. What we've chosen to do now is break those into smaller crews, wearing their face masks, social distancing, driving separate vehicles to the project at some times and then working as best they can remotely from each other until they have to get in the ditch and inspect. And then we have a separate crew that will come in later and work on the service line. So we don't have all those employees up one side at one time. \nRyan Levine: Does that drive any changes in the cost profile? Or what are the financial implications of this new social distancing? \nJohn Akers: No, it does not affect that costing at all. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. \nInsoo Kim: My first question is regarding just your language and around the guidance and your ability to hit that range. You gave a lot of details, which definitely I appreciate. But just coming, when I think about how you guys are situated on your business profile and your point that the bulk of the distribution revenues have already been earned through March as well as all the regulatory mechanisms, what concerns do you have, I guess, besides the -- just the length of how long we're going to be in this current situation that you think could potentially impact you to the downside? Are you seeing some economic deterioration already in some of your jurisdictions as a result of COVID? \nJohn Akers: Can you restate that second part there? I think you broke up a little bit, your last part. \nInsoo Kim: I was just asking, are you seeing any initial signs of economic deterioration in any of your jurisdictions? \nJohn Akers: Not at this point. As we said, the -- our first full month of operation was April. Those bills are just now going out. And we'll have some more information as those come through in the next few weeks on into -- later into May and first part of June. But as we have said, with these shelter-in-place orders across our states, a lot of businesses have been able to continue to operate. We've seen construction continue to go on. We've seen a lot of road work continue to go on. Some of the restaurants have continued to be open without the in-room dining but have continued to provide pickup and carry out-type service. So we've seen a lot of activity even though there's some shelter in place. And we're just waiting to see how that plans out as we go through these phased reopenings and get a look at some of those bills to see if those loads picked up or maintained what they normally would have been. \nInsoo Kim: Understood. And then regarding your plant O&M guidance for the year, does that -- I assume that's excluding the O&M costs that are related to COVID-19 in jurisdictions that you're allowed to defer from the income statement? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. It does. And to this point, we're closing out the books for April right now. So we'll have a clearer look here in the coming days as what that spend is. But to your point, anything that is COVID-related or incremental over and above our run rates would be considered for regulatory asset treatment. \nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. \nDaniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through August 6. Have a good day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christopher Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fiscal 2020 second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.95 compared to $1.82 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, diluted earnings per share were $3.42 compared with $3.21 per diluted share in the prior year period.\n As Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, mitigation efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 began to impact our service territories during the last 2 weeks of March. Therefore, we did not experience a material impact from COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. Consolidated operating income during the 6 months ended March 31 rose over 9% to $584 million.\n I will touch on a few of the highlights now. Rate increases in both our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, totaled $83 million. Customer growth in our distribution segment contributed incremental $8.5 million as we continue to benefit from the strong population growth in several of our service areas, most notably in the DFW Metroplex. For the 12 months ended March 31, we experienced 1.5% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.2% net customer growth across our 8-state footprint.\n Consolidated O&M increased $12 million or 4.2% primarily driven by higher employee and information technology costs and pipeline and maintenance activities. The period-over-period increase also reflects well integrity work that incurred during our first fiscal quarter.\n Slides 5 and 6 provide additional details of the period-over-period changes to operating income for each of our segments. Consolidated capital spending for the 6-month period grew 28% to $995 million, with 87% directed towards safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. Because of our designation as an essential service provider and the measures we have taken to protect our employees and contractors, we still believe our fiscal 2020 capital spending will range between $1.85 billion and $1.95 billion.\n Our fiscal second quarter is the busiest regulatory filing period of our fiscal year. Year-to-date, we have implemented $58 million of annualized operating regulatory outcomes. And currently, we have about $215 million in progress. Of this amount, we currently anticipate to implement approximately $100 million in annualized regulatory outcomes by the end of the fiscal year. Slides 21 to 31 provide details for all of these filings. Slide 20 outlines our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n Maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and a strong liquidity position continues to be one of our primary financial objectives, and it has served us well during this uncertain time. During the second quarter, we filed a $4 billion shelf registration statement and we filed a new $1 billion ATM program.\n Also in the second quarter, we executed new forward sales agreements for approximately 1.6 million shares with anticipated proceeds of $180 million as of March 31, we had about $419 million in cash available under equity forward arrangements. With this activity, we have priced all of our anticipated equity needs for fiscal 2020 and a portion of fiscal 2021.\n Additionally, the strength of our balance sheet supports our Tier 1 commercial paper rating. As a result, we have been able to maintain reasonable access to the commercial paper markets. As of March 31, we had about $200 million in outstanding commercial paper. At the end of the second quarter, our equity capitalization was 58.2%, and we had approximately $2 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements.\n Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, we took action in April to increase our liquidity to approximately $2.9 billion. We accomplished this through the execution of a $200 million 2-year term loan and 3 new 364-day credit facilities totaling $700 million. The net proceeds from the term loan were used to repay all outstanding commercial paper backstopped by our primary $1.5 billion credit facility.\n This facility is fully available and in place through September 2023. Additional details regarding our liquidity can found on Slide 10. We believe this liquidity position, the strength of our balance sheet and $3 billion available under our shelf registration statement gives us the financial flexibility to support our operations as we move forward.\n Looking towards the second half of the fiscal year, we are certainly aware that the economies of the service areas we serve have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent economic data reflects rising unemployment in each of our states. However, based on what we know today, we still expect earnings per share in the range of $4.58 to $4.73.\n We considered a number of factors in our evaluation. First, our winter heating season is complete. We typically earn approximately 70% of our distribution revenues during the first half of our fiscal year. In our distribution segment, although we are not fully decoupled, we believe there are factors that mitigate revenue risk for this segment. These factors are summarized on Slide 14.\n Residential revenues comprise approximately 60% of the segment's revenues during the second half of the fiscal year and residential builds were at their lowest during this time. Additionally, we collect a significant portion of our revenues, excluding gas cost, through the base charge, which partially insulates us from volumetric risk. For most of our service territories, the base charge represents the largest portion of the customer's bill by the middle of our third fiscal quarter.\n We typically experience a decline in volumes during April. However, given that April is a shoulder month, it is difficult for us to identify if changes in volumes are weather related or representative of underlying economic activity. Therefore, we have provided some sensitivity information by customer class on Slide 14.\n Additionally, the rate design and various annual filing mechanisms in our distribution segment support our ability to recover our costs timely. Slide 15 summarizes various aspects of rate design by state. Most of these mechanisms are well understood by you. However, I wanted to highlight that since March 31, our regulators in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Virginia had issued orders to defer COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense, into a regulatory asset for consideration for future recovery. These orders cover approximately 80% of our customers.\n Finally, as Kevin mentioned in his opening remarks, for approximately 32% of our customers in Texas, including the City of Dallas, we have voluntarily delayed implementation of new rates that were scheduled to go into effect during our fiscal third quarter to at least September 1. These delayed implementations will not have a material impact to our fiscal 2020 financial performance due to the time of year if these rates would have been implemented.\n In our pipeline and storage segment, revenues are earned primarily through demand fees. As you're aware, performance of the segment is predominantly driven by APT. Over 80% of APT's revenues are earned from delivery services to our North Texas distribution company and a few other LDCs under a straight, fixed, variable rate design. The remainder of APT's revenues relate to its 3-system business and other ancillary pipeline services. As a reminder, APT only keeps 25% of revenues earned from these activities under its rate design. And the COVID-19 regulatory asset order issued by the Texas Railroad Commission also applies to APT.\n Finally, from an O&M perspective, we have deferred some discretionary spending to future periods as we remain focused on the health and safety of our employees. Slides 17 and 18 provide additional details around our guidance.\n Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin for some closing remarks. Yes. With respect to the CapEx range, we're $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. Again, we are an essential service provider. Our crews are working using -- practicing safe social distances. So to the extent that a regulatory authority were to come in and change our designation as an essential service provider, ask us to stop or slow down for whatever reason as they navigate through the pandemic, that could be a factor that could drive us towards the lower end of that range. Well, as I said, April is a shoulder month for us. We have -- we've certainly modeled some potential outcomes. But we really can't see yet what is driving the decline in volumes that we typically see in April, if it's seasonality or if it's a true underlying economic activity. So we put those sensitivities out there for everyone to use in their modeling and in their evaluation. No, we haven't. We -- as I mentioned, we have $215 million in progress at this point in time. This is our busiest filing period of the year. A large number of those filings were filed right at the end of March or the first part of April, and we are working through the discovery process with our intervenors in due course.\n Everyone's working really well from home. So information is flowing back and forth. For a large number, about roughly $100 million of that filing, and exclusive of $215 million, is not scheduled to be implemented until October 1. And those are our Texas RRM filings. So we're very early in the process. We have another $15 million or so that was filed for Louisiana. That's scheduled to be implemented on July 1. And at this time, we have no indication of any delays. Sure. Yes, a lot of it is COVID related. We're focused on the health and safety of our employees. So to the extent that we don't have to perform compliance-related work in order to keep those employees out of the community or limit our actual exposure to it, we've got employees in the community, we decided to pull back on some of that discretionary O&M.\n So that's typical work like encroachment, right of way maintenance. We've done a really good job over the years by keeping up with a lot of that work. So they gave us some flexibility to defer that to future periods and other types of work, be it noncompliance-related in-line inspection and other noncompliance-related pipeline maintenance activity.\n So we see the guidance range on Page 18 for O&M. As you noted, it is flat to flattish to last year. And we'll just continue to monitor our O&M and really the entire organizational -- the operations of the organization as we move through the next 6 months. At this point, given what we know, we're holding to the 2.5% to 3.5%. Again, we're going to come through the pandemic. And at some point, this work that we're deferring will have to be completed. So for now, we're holding to that. Sure. Sure. I mean you can see it in our earnings release. It's in the titling. It says it's reaffirmed. And again, based on what we know today, we believe the range of $4.58 to $4.73 is appropriate. Sure. I mentioned that we are -- go ahead, Kevin. Yes. It does. And to this point, we're closing out the books for April right now. So we'll have a clearer look here in the coming days as what that spend is. But to your point, anything that is COVID-related or incremental over and above our run rates would be considered for regulatory asset treatment."

            "content": "Thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy as we continue to navigate our way through this challenge together.\n I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank our everyday heroes, those who are helping our country battle this pandemic: our first responders, health care workers, law enforcement officials, grocery store employees, truck drivers delivering our nation's supplies, those serving in our branches of the military and all essential services providers working to support our communities. Thank you for what you are doing to help all of us. We are eternally grateful.\n I also want to thank our 4,800 Atmos Energy everyday heroes as they continue to provide our customers safe and reliable natural gas service. I'm extremely proud of their dedication and commitment to keeping our 3.1 million customers of 1,400 communities and themselves healthy and safe. Atmos Energy's commitment to safety paired with our culture have led us during unique times, and this will be no different.\n In early February, our Chief Information Officer led a team effort to assess and test our company-wide remote work capabilities, including our 2 customer support centers, gas supply, our 2 gas control centers, our shared service functions and over 200 operational service centers across our 8-state service territory. Through their efforts, by mid-March when local and state governments started issuing shelter-in-place orders, we were ready to transition every facet of our business to a fully remote work environment. Today, we have over 95% of our employees working remotely and continuing to perform at the highest levels.\n As an example of their outstanding effort, for the month of April, our customer service agent satisfaction scores were 97.6%, and our service technician satisfaction scores were 97.4%. Truly outstanding work by that team.\n In addition, our Risk Management and Compliance Committee, along with senior leaders from across the company, focused on several operational scenario planning exercises in early March. These exercises, based on current world and U.S. situations, were focused on maintaining the safety of our customers, communities and employees as we continue to provide reliable natural gas service. Specific areas of focus were emergency response, system maintenance and compliance work, including pipe replacement, line locating, system inspections as well as the ability to remotely train employees.\n Besides working remotely, you will see employees doing our part to reduce the spread of the virus by practicing social distancing, wearing face coverings while working in our communities or working in smaller construction crews. We believe the above implemented practices for our employees and our contractors, along with using CDC guidelines to design safety protocols for things such as self temperature and system screening, have us positioned to continue providing safe and reliable natural gas service.\n Using the safety practices and protocols mentioned above under shelter-in-place orders, we have been able to safely perform distribution and transmission pipeline system work. This work includes maintenance and compliance activities, pipe replacement, line locating and system inspections.\n In preparing our work plans, practices and protocols, we worked with our regulatory agencies, local and state officials, emergency management, the American Gas Association and industry peers across our service territory. We greatly appreciate their leadership and ongoing support as we all work together for the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities.\n Our culture atmosphere has guided us in the past, is guiding us during this challenging time and will continue to guide us into the future as we look to be at our best, bring out the best in others and make a difference. Making a difference for local food banks and communities across our 8 states to help keep meals on tables through our donation of $1.5 million. Being at our best, Atmos Energy employees partnered with many nonprofit agencies, schools, hospitals throughout our service territory to fill lunch bags for children, provide meals for our health care heroes and first responders or by donating much-needed plasma. Making a difference for our customers by temporarily suspending disconnections for nonpayment and waive late payment and certain reconnect fees during these challenging times so customers continue to have safe and reliable natural gas service for heat, water heat and cooking.\n I'm extremely proud of our 4,800 employees in how their atmosphere has shined so brightly upon our neighbors and our communities. Also making a difference, we closely work with our regulators to develop solutions to the mutual benefit of our customers in the company. We have elected to defer implementation of new rates for approximately 32% of our customers in Texas from our fiscal third quarter to at least September 1 of this year.\n Additionally, we have received regulatory orders in 4 states covering approximately 80% of our customers to defer any COVID-19-related costs, including bad debt expense. In April, we executed $900 million in new financing arrangements to further solidify our liquidity. As of April 30, our liquidity was $2.9 billion and our balance sheet remains very strong.\n Now I would like to turn the call over to Chris for a financial update, and I will return shortly with a few closing remarks. As you can see, we have a robust risk management process that has served us extremely well during this pandemic and will continue to guide us as we navigate our way through. As you just heard, we have continued to execute at the highest levels on all facets of our business.\n Our year-to-date results were in line with our expectations. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have further enhanced our liquidity. And as we stated earlier, we have continued our system maintenance and compliance work, including pipe replacement, line locating and system inspections.\n Our leadership team and all 4,800 employees were prepared to operate in this environment as it developed in our service areas and have continued to adjust and adapt as new information or local and state orders were issued. We were early to transition to remote work, and we will be very intentional about reopening our offices.\n As you have heard, orders to shelter in place began in mid-March with others being issued in April across our service territory. Therefore, we have not yet seen material impacts to our business. Additionally, 6 of our 8 states have now lifted their shelter-in-place orders and have begun phased reopening plans.\n Over the next quarter, we anticipate having further information and results available to assess any operational or financial impact. Our focus remains the same: the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities as we execute our proven investment strategy and continue delivering safe, reliable, affordable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.\n With that, we'll open up for questions. Operator? No, I don't think there's any uniqueness to it. It works very similar as it does in the other jurisdictions. We'll incur those costs and in our next filing, we'll take those under consideration and review. So we're just like our other jurisdictions. That was through the Railroad Commission that... That is correct. As we said, well, we've been able to continue our capital work through this program designated as an essential service provider. We anticipate continuing to be able to do that and at this point, don't see anything out there that would defer our capital strategy that we have in place right now. Well, right now, as Chris and I said in our opening remarks, we've been able to do the work that we need to get done to maintain the safety and reliability of our system, both on the distribution and transmission side and coupled with our employees and our contract employees, believe we have the appropriate staff levels at this point. There are some impacts, as you would imagine, from the oil fields at this point on the unemployment numbers. But we believe we are fully staffed and operational, continue to do the things we need to do on a daily basis. Yes. For example, on our main replacement, we would have a larger crew that would go out and work on the main and service lines at the same time. What we've chosen to do now is break those into smaller crews, wearing their face masks, social distancing, driving separate vehicles to the project at some times and then working as best they can remotely from each other until they have to get in the ditch and inspect. And then we have a separate crew that will come in later and work on the service line. So we don't have all those employees up one side at one time. No, it does not affect that costing at all. Can you restate that second part there? I think you broke up a little bit, your last part. Not at this point. As we said, the -- our first full month of operation was April. Those bills are just now going out. And we'll have some more information as those come through in the next few weeks on into -- later into May and first part of June. But as we have said, with these shelter-in-place orders across our states, a lot of businesses have been able to continue to operate. We've seen construction continue to go on. We've seen a lot of road work continue to go on. Some of the restaurants have continued to be open without the in-room dining but have continued to provide pickup and carry out-type service. So we've seen a lot of activity even though there's some shelter in place. And we're just waiting to see how that plans out as we go through these phased reopenings and get a look at some of those bills to see if those loads picked up or maintained what they normally would have been."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jennifer Hills, Vice President, Investor Relations for Atmos Energy. Jennifer, please go ahead.\nJennifer Hills: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This call is being webcast live on the internet. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 22 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Our 2020 fiscal year is off to a solid start. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $179 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. We reported growth in both our distribution and pipeline and storage businesses, driven by continued customer growth and distribution and rate recovery in both segments. Consolidated operating income rose 7% to $253 million in the first quarter. Slide four summarizes key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Operating income for our distribution business rose 6.4% to $180 million. Rate increases, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, provided incremental $27 million, primarily in our Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi jurisdictions. Customer growth contributed incremental $4 million, as we have continued to benefit from the strong population growth in some of our service areas, most notably in the DFW Metroplex. For the 12 months ended December 31, we experienced 1.4% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.2% net customer growth across our eight-state footprint. Consumption declined modestly due to colder weather last year before weather normalization mechanisms went into effect and O&M expenses increased $8.6 million associated with the distribution integrity management work and higher employee-related costs. Operating income for the pipeline and storage business grew 8% to $73 million, primarily driven by a $13.7 million increase due to the implementation of new rates from our 2019 GRIP filing, partially offset by a $5 million increase in O&M, related to the timing of well integrity work. Consolidated capital spending grew 27% to $529 million, with 86% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. We remain on track to invest between $1.85 billion and $1.95 billion this fiscal year. We have a well-established regulatory strategy, focused on reducing lag. In fiscal 2020, we expect to begin earning a return on 90% of our spending within six months of the test period end. Year-to-date, we have implemented $59 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and currently we have about $21 million in progress. Slides 13 to 18 provide details for all of these filings. Slide 19 outlines our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our ability to attract the necessary long-term financing to fund our capital expenditure program, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet, is critical to the successful execution of our strategic plan. During the first quarter, we received $1.1 billion in net proceeds from long-term financing activities. In October, we issued $3 million of 10-year notes and $500 million of 30-year notes at an all-in effective rate of 3.15%. As a result, we were able to reduce our weighted average cost of debt to 4.32%. Our customers continue to benefit from these historically low rates. Additionally, we increased our weighted average maturities to 22 years and do not have a material maturity until 2027. From an equity perspective, we settled forward agreements on 2.7 million shares for approximately $259 million in net proceeds and we executed new forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 340,000 shares, with an anticipated net proceeds of approximately $37 million. As of December 31, we had about $240 million remaining under equity forward arrangements that must be utilized by the end of our fiscal year. We continue to believe that we can satisfy our fiscal 2020 needs through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization was 58.6% as of December 31 and we finished the quarter with approximately $2 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements. The strength of our balance sheet and our five-year financial plan continues to be recognized by the credit rating agencies. In December, Moody's upgraded our long-term debt rating to A1 with a stable outlook and S&P reaffirmed our A credit rating. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on slide seven through 10. Our first quarter performance leaves us well positioned to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target. As a result, yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2020 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.58 to $4.73 per diluted share. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Akers for his closing remarks.\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. As you can see from our fiscal first quarter results, we are off to a good start to the year, as we remain on track to meet our capital spending goals and earnings growth targets. From an operational perspective, we remain focused on executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution transmission storage systems as well. We are continuing our investments in people, process and technologies that will enable Atmos Energy to scale safely and efficiently, while investing $10 billion to $11 billion over the next five years. I would like to highlight one of our larger investments, the Bethel Salt Dome project, which we began in fiscal 2019 and is estimated to be completed in 2025. As we've discussed previously, we plan to invest between $100 million and $120 million to develop a third salt-dome cavern at our Bethel storage facility. This project will enable us to safely perform regulatory compliance work on our two existing caverns and meet the growing demand in the North Texas market. The construction of the power and leaching facilities, have been completed and we began the leaching process in mid-December. The leaching process is estimated to take between 25 and 30 months and we anticipate finishing our required compliance work on all three caverns and have them in service by late 2025. Natural gas is an important driver of economic growth in this country and we have seen our industrial business grow in our Kentucky mid states and Mississippi divisions, particularly in the automotive manufacturing sector and in the spirits industry. Over the last few quarters, clean, efficient and affordable natural gas lead transport has supported the expansion of existing facilities and fueled new industrial project development. Once these expansion projects fully come online, over the next few years, we expect to deliver an additional two Bcf annually to these customers. Additionally, we continue to expand deliveries to CNG customers with the addition of a new customer in Colorado. As a result, our customer expects to replace nearly 90,000 gallons of diesel fuel annually. During the first quarter, we continued to enhance our sustainability reporting capabilities. In December, we launched a Corporate Responsibility section on our website to provide greater disclosure of our focus on safety and long-term sustainability and to highlight how we are working to meet the needs of our various stakeholders. We also published our second corporate responsibility and sustainability report as well as an updated methane emissions report, both of which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility section under Reports. The continued modernization of our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems will help ensure all residential, commercial, public authority and industrial customers continue to have access to reliable, affordable, abundant and efficient natural gas. To support this effort, last week, we were pleased to announce that we joined the One Future coalition, a voluntary alliance of leading companies across the natural gas supply chain, focused on technology and policy to drive continued improvement in reduction of methane emissions. We look forward to working with One Future as we move toward achieving our target of a 50% reduction in methane emissions by 2035. In closing, I want to thank our 4,800 employees who are dedicated every day to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and giving back to the communities where we live and work. We appreciate your time this morning and now we will take any questions you may have.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Richard Ciciarelli from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRichard Ciciarelli: Hey good morning. Can you guys hear me okay?\nKevin Akers: Yes, good morning Richie. How are you doing?\nRichard Ciciarelli: Doing well. I just had a question on the O&M profile. It seems like it was a sizable uptick this year. And I appreciate some of that was for like the increased employees due to the faster growth but just curious like how you intend to shape the O&M curve through the outlook given like the 2% to 3% growth that you're managing towards?\nChris Forsythe: Yes. Some of that -- a couple of things. We got the 2% to 3% -- 2.5% to 3.5% that's baked into our five-year plan through 2024. We had already -- and that's a CAGR over that five-year period. So, we had already anticipated as you noted an uptick in O&M this year as a result of the additional hiring that we had obviously in the first quarter. As you try to turn that out over four quarters that can be a little bit difficult. We did have some timing particularly in our pipeline and storage segment around some well integrity work that was kind of accelerated more into the first quarter. So, when we look at the O&M guidance that we published for fiscal 2020, we feel like we are still on track to achieve that at this point in time.\nRichard Ciciarelli: All right. It makes a lot of sense. That's all I had. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. My first question is at the pipeline segment. When you look at the year-over-year decrease in transportation volumes how does that magnitude compare versus your expectations? I know you've expected some of that given the online of the Gulf Coast Express pipeline and whatnot, but how does that magnitude like fare versus your expectation? And how does that place you in terms of the expected growth of the segment for this year?\nChris Forsythe: Yes, it's pretty much in line with our expectations. And honestly, we saw volumes pick up just a little bit versus what we expected but pricing was a little bit down. So, net-net we were in line with expectations. And as we look forward, we'll continue to monitor the market conditions. You're very well aware of the supply and demand dynamics are ongoing in the Permian Basin and we'll just keep an eye on that. But at this point we still think that our net income as well as our guidance that we have out there is still good.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. And second Kevin I know you touched upon this in your prepared remarks but with ESG and electrification of the grid story having taken hold recently in our market, so could you share your thoughts a little bit more on your view of the gas that plays a role in the future of the U.S. energy grid? And also how do you see that potential shift creating maybe a secular decline in existing or new gas usage on the customer base?\nKevin Akers: Yes. I appreciate your question. First of all, let me say that I'm proud to be in the natural gas business particularly this morning as we sit here in Dallas, the wind-chill is in the low 20, so our customers are receiving safe reliable heating for their home and have hot showers as well. So, we're very, very proud of our product and what we're able to do from a reliability and efficiency standpoint. But the way we see it as you look at the population in U.S. today about 335 million or so headed towards 360 million by 2030, that's like adding a Texas to the population in about a 10-year period with growth at about 2.5 million people or so a year there. That's going to require a diversified energy portfolio and we see natural gas as a vital part of that energy solution as we move forward. As we said before, it's efficient, it's affordable, it's abundant, it's reliable, and it's flexible. There's not another fuel that's flexible like it to meet this growing demand of energy that's going to be required by 2030. You can compress, it you can decompress it, you can transport it, you can liquefy it, you can store it below ground. There's nothing like it that's reliable and abundant today that's out there. And as a natural gas distribution utility having interstate transmission assets, we embraced our role operating responsibly and being good stewards of our environment. As you've heard us say before, we're working to tighten up our system with our modernization of our infrastructure and we continue to deploy technology across our system, both in a monitoring capability and equipment capability to make sure we are operating as responsibly and as efficiently as possible. And we'll continue to work with our partners both upstream as you saw with our joining of ONE Future to measure that we're getting the best available practices that are going on in the industry today to look at and maybe incorporate into our business, as well as partner with groups like AGA and GTI to not only tell our story, but to also look at what technology is available from a burner tip perspective or technology perspective whether that's carbon capture or carbon storage. So as we see it we see a continued growth of natural gas. It plays a viable role in the energy future now -- in the energy portfolio now and well into the future trying to meet that energy demand by 2030. Again there's nothing like it that's as flexible reliable and as efficient. So as we talked about in my script with industrial demand out there, we're continuing to see good expansion of industrial load, good new growth on the industrial and commercial side as well. And then in addition you heard Chris mention the 1.2% to 1.4 % net growth on the residential side, as well in our market areas. So both residential through the industrial markets we continue to see good growth area.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Charles Fishman from Morningstar Research. Your line is now live.\nCharles Fishman: Good morning. I just want to make sure I understand this. On the pipeline and storage you talked last quarter about the new pipeline coming on, competitor pipeline impacting operating income. And obviously, we didn't see that in the last quarter. It was pretty darn good, but then you made the statement that it's on-track. I mean do you anticipate pipeline and storage being roughly flattish this year versus last year? Or when you say on track if you could provide a little more color what that might be?\nChris Forsythe: Sure. Yes. Charles this is Chris. A couple of comments around that. Last quarter GCX came online in the middle of the quarter. So we had some strong pricing opportunities if you will, in the first half of the fourth quarter last year which contributed to that quarter's results. As we move forward as we reiterated this morning we're on track with our earnings per share targets. And I'll also say that our contribution of our business between distribution and pipeline storage is going to be roughly the same as well. So that's roughly 2/3 distribution and 1/3 on the pipeline storage side. So as we continue to grow in that 6% to 8% range certainly for 2020 and as we look out through 2024, we expect the business mix between our two segments to be in that roughly that 2/3, 1/3 allocation, if you will. So it can ebb-and-flow a little bit, but we still see a lot of continued growth. And when you think about pipeline and storage most of the earnings drivers in that segment is the continued safety and reliability work that we are doing on our APT system. Kevin talks about the Bethel storage facility. So it's driven by fundamental rate based growth as a result of the supply or the -- what we're trying to accomplish from a safety perspective, as well as meeting the growing needs of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. So I mean Chris the takeaway from your answer is that, since the mix of business is staying the same and we know distribution is growing pretty well that means pipeline and storage is really growing even though you're seeing this competitor pipeline?\nChris Forsythe: That's correct. And remember too on this competitive pipeline and we've been talking about this for a couple of years, the non-tariff businesses that run through the pipeline that represents a relatively small piece of the overall puzzle for APT, primarily due to the existence of a Rider REV mechanism. So whatever we tend to pick up, in terms of a commercial business activity on that pipe 75% of the benefit flows back to our regulated customers on the distribution side in our Mid-Tex Division in North Texas. So and you heard us consistently say over the years, when they pick up a little bit here and there, but we don't view that as a material driver of our performance. It could have a little bit of an impact in a given year, given pricing dynamics but we don't -- certainly don't look to it as a source of fundamental growth for the long term.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. And if I could ask -- go ahead.\nJohn Akers: Well, I was just going to add to that. Chris is exactly right. We don't see that as a competitor pipeline. Again with its direction its heading, it's mainly focused on takeaway out of the Permian down to the Gulf Coast area there. So we don't really see it as a competitor by nature because our responsibility on the pipeline side itself is those core markets and serving those core markets.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. Got it. Now if I can ask just one more question on the new dome storage that's being developed how does that work from a regulatory standpoint? I mean I would assume a lot of that is for the benefit of your distribution system Mid-Tex et cetera?\nKevin Akers: Correct. It's for our -- making sure we have the reliability to continue to meet the contractual demands of those customers behind APT. All those costs that -- or investments into that are grip eligible and so the recovery through that mechanism.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. So it's under grip. Got it. Okay.\nKevin Akers: Correct. \nCharles Fishman: That\u2019s it. Thank you very much.\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Charles.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is now live.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. \nKevin Akers: Hey, Ryan. \nRyan Levine: Hey. What's your appetite to invest in the build-out of RNG infrastructure given your footprint and stated objectives of both AGA and Atmos?\nKevin Akers: Again, we're -- we want to operate responsibly. We want to take a look at opportunities that are out there, but we're going to take a look at it in the way that we've done everything else about our business. And what I mean by that is if you take a look at how we set up our rate structures over time, our annual mechanisms, our pipe mechanisms those sort of things we have to look at it from a regulatory perspective on investment and recovery of that investment and what those opportunities look like as well as what are the laws or regulations around that that exist today or may exist in the future. So, all that to say, we're keeping an eye on it. We're looking at it. But we are working with other industry partners and seeing what other states are doing to see how the regulatory environment plays out on those and how the legislative environment plays out on those. And when we see something that is of interest to us or ready to move forward we'll like we said with the rest of our rate structure make sure that it is tied up with our investment and the recovery and it benefits our customers across the enterprise.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then another one in terms of the O&M cost increase. I was wondering what impact the new PHMSA regulation have in your increased guidance for 2020 versus 2019.\nChris Forsythe: You see the O&M guidance that we've put out there we have already kind of anticipated those PHMSA rules coming into effect beginning in July of this calendar year. So it's going to be -- have a muted impact in 2020 and will continue to roll in on a full fiscal year basis and beginning in 2021. But we've already contemplated that in our O&M forecast through 2024.\nRyan Levine: Is there a way to quantify the magnitude of that impact versus the other items that were highlighted from an earlier question?\nChris Forsythe: We don't have that information readily available.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then the last question for me. Curious what your gas price assumption is in your 2020 guide. And with the weakness in spot basis in some of your jurisdictions curious how much regulatory headroom you have versus your guidance in terms of customer builds?\nChris Forsythe: Well, we've got -- you'll see it in our Analyst Day this deck that we put out last fall, I think, we're at an all-in price anywhere from $3.20 -- $5.25 to $5.50 inclusive of storage and transportation costs. Storage and current transportation is usually between $1 and $1.50. So we assumed a high $2, low $3 range on the commodity pricing. So to the extent that we have lower pricing that we're able to capture from our various sources of gas, it's obviously a benefit that flows back to our customers. And we've got a very good gas supply team in our shared services function that is working to minimize the cost of gas across the enterprise.\nRyan Levine: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Marc Solecitto from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nMarc Solecitto: Hi. Good morning.\nChris Forsythe: Good morning.\nMarc Solecitto: Kind of following up on some of the earlier questions, can you quantify the year-over-year impact from Waha basis differentials in fiscal 1Q?\nChris Forsythe: If you look through our MDA, it's roughly down about a $750,000 to $1 million. It's in our line item that flows -- it's not on our Mid-Tex line, but it's our pipeline, it's in our three-system line item. So it's out there in the 10-Q.\nMarc Solecitto: Got it. Okay. And then in terms of your FY 2020 EPS guidance, I think, Waha spreads were $12 million year-over-year tailwind in fiscal 2019. Just curious what the embedded assumption was in your fiscal 2020 guidance. Or maybe said differently if you captured any benefit in fiscal 2020 would that represent upside to your budget?\nChris Forsythe: We made a call based upon market conditions at the time that we put the plan together last summer, but we haven't released those specific details.\nMarc Solecitto: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nJennifer Hills: Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through May 7, 2020. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

From an operational perspective, we remain focused on executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution transmission storage systems as well. We are continuing our investments in people, process and technologies that will enable Atmos Energy to scale safely and efficiently, while investing $10 billion to $11 billion over the next five years. I would like to highlight one of our larger investments, the Bethel Salt Dome project, which we began in fiscal 2019 and is estimated to be completed in 2025. As we've discussed previously, we plan to invest between $100 million and $120 million to develop a third salt-dome cavern at our Bethel storage facility. This project will enable us to safely perform regulatory compliance work on our two existing caverns and meet the growing demand in the North Texas market. The construction of the power and leaching facilities, have been completed and we began the leaching process in mid-December. The leaching process is estimated to take between 25 and 30 months and we anticipate finishing our required compliance work on all three caverns and have them in service by late 2025. Natural gas is an important driver of economic growth in this country and we have seen our industrial business grow in our Kentucky mid states and Mississippi divisions, particularly in the automotive manufacturing sector and in the spirits industry. Over the last few quarters, clean, efficient and affordable natural gas lead transport has supported the expansion of existing facilities and fueled new industrial project development. Once these expansion projects fully come online, over the next few years, we expect to deliver an additional two Bcf annually to these customers. Additionally, we continue to expand deliveries to CNG customers with the addition of a new customer in Colorado. As a result, our customer expects to replace nearly 90,000 gallons of diesel fuel annually. During the first quarter, we continued to enhance our sustainability reporting capabilities. In December, we launched a Corporate Responsibility section on our website to provide greater disclosure of our focus on safety and long-term sustainability and to highlight how we are working to meet the needs of our various stakeholders. We also published our second corporate responsibility and sustainability report as well as an updated methane emissions report, both of which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility section under Reports. The continued modernization of our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems will help ensure all residential, commercial, public authority and industrial customers continue to have access to reliable, affordable, abundant and efficient natural gas. To support this effort, last week, we were pleased to announce that we joined the One Future coalition, a voluntary alliance of leading companies across the natural gas supply chain, focused on technology and policy to drive continued improvement in reduction of methane emissions. We look forward to working with One Future as we move toward achieving our target of a 50% reduction in methane emissions by 2035. In closing, I want to thank our 4,800 employees who are dedicated every day to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and giving back to the communities where we live and work. We appreciate your time this morning and now we will take any questions you may have. Yes, good morning Richie. How are you doing? Yes. I appreciate your question. First of all, let me say that I'm proud to be in the natural gas business particularly this morning as we sit here in Dallas, the wind-chill is in the low 20, so our customers are receiving safe reliable heating for their home and have hot showers as well. So, we're very, very proud of our product and what we're able to do from a reliability and efficiency standpoint. But the way we see it as you look at the population in U.S. today about 335 million or so headed towards 360 million by 2030, that's like adding a Texas to the population in about a 10-year period with growth at about 2.5 million people or so a year there. That's going to require a diversified energy portfolio and we see natural gas as a vital part of that energy solution as we move forward. As we said before, it's efficient, it's affordable, it's abundant, it's reliable, and it's flexible. There's not another fuel that's flexible like it to meet this growing demand of energy that's going to be required by 2030. You can compress, it you can decompress it, you can transport it, you can liquefy it, you can store it below ground. There's nothing like it that's reliable and abundant today that's out there. And as a natural gas distribution utility having interstate transmission assets, we embraced our role operating responsibly and being good stewards of our environment. As you've heard us say before, we're working to tighten up our system with our modernization of our infrastructure and we continue to deploy technology across our system, both in a monitoring capability and equipment capability to make sure we are operating as responsibly and as efficiently as possible. And we'll continue to work with our partners both upstream as you saw with our joining of ONE Future to measure that we're getting the best available practices that are going on in the industry today to look at and maybe incorporate into our business, as well as partner with groups like AGA and GTI to not only tell our story, but to also look at what technology is available from a burner tip perspective or technology perspective whether that's carbon capture or carbon storage. So as we see it we see a continued growth of natural gas. It plays a viable role in the energy future now -- in the energy portfolio now and well into the future trying to meet that energy demand by 2030. Again there's nothing like it that's as flexible reliable and as efficient. So as we talked about in my script with industrial demand out there, we're continuing to see good expansion of industrial load, good new growth on the industrial and commercial side as well. And then in addition you heard Chris mention the 1.2% to 1.4 % net growth on the residential side, as well in our market areas. So both residential through the industrial markets we continue to see good growth area. Correct. It's for our -- making sure we have the reliability to continue to meet the contractual demands of those customers behind APT. All those costs that -- or investments into that are grip eligible and so the recovery through that mechanism. Correct. Thank you, Charles. Hey, Ryan. Again, we're -- we want to operate responsibly. We want to take a look at opportunities that are out there, but we're going to take a look at it in the way that we've done everything else about our business. And what I mean by that is if you take a look at how we set up our rate structures over time, our annual mechanisms, our pipe mechanisms those sort of things we have to look at it from a regulatory perspective on investment and recovery of that investment and what those opportunities look like as well as what are the laws or regulations around that that exist today or may exist in the future. So, all that to say, we're keeping an eye on it. We're looking at it. But we are working with other industry partners and seeing what other states are doing to see how the regulatory environment plays out on those and how the legislative environment plays out on those. And when we see something that is of interest to us or ready to move forward we'll like we said with the rest of our rate structure make sure that it is tied up with our investment and the recovery and it benefits our customers across the enterprise."

            "content": "Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Our 2020 fiscal year is off to a solid start. Yesterday, we reported first quarter net income of $179 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, in line with our expectations. We reported growth in both our distribution and pipeline and storage businesses, driven by continued customer growth and distribution and rate recovery in both segments. Consolidated operating income rose 7% to $253 million in the first quarter. Slide four summarizes key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Operating income for our distribution business rose 6.4% to $180 million. Rate increases, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, provided incremental $27 million, primarily in our Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi jurisdictions. Customer growth contributed incremental $4 million, as we have continued to benefit from the strong population growth in some of our service areas, most notably in the DFW Metroplex. For the 12 months ended December 31, we experienced 1.4% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.2% net customer growth across our eight-state footprint. Consumption declined modestly due to colder weather last year before weather normalization mechanisms went into effect and O&M expenses increased $8.6 million associated with the distribution integrity management work and higher employee-related costs. Operating income for the pipeline and storage business grew 8% to $73 million, primarily driven by a $13.7 million increase due to the implementation of new rates from our 2019 GRIP filing, partially offset by a $5 million increase in O&M, related to the timing of well integrity work. Consolidated capital spending grew 27% to $529 million, with 86% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. We remain on track to invest between $1.85 billion and $1.95 billion this fiscal year. We have a well-established regulatory strategy, focused on reducing lag. In fiscal 2020, we expect to begin earning a return on 90% of our spending within six months of the test period end. Year-to-date, we have implemented $59 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and currently we have about $21 million in progress. Slides 13 to 18 provide details for all of these filings. Slide 19 outlines our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our ability to attract the necessary long-term financing to fund our capital expenditure program, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet, is critical to the successful execution of our strategic plan. During the first quarter, we received $1.1 billion in net proceeds from long-term financing activities. In October, we issued $3 million of 10-year notes and $500 million of 30-year notes at an all-in effective rate of 3.15%. As a result, we were able to reduce our weighted average cost of debt to 4.32%. Our customers continue to benefit from these historically low rates. Additionally, we increased our weighted average maturities to 22 years and do not have a material maturity until 2027. From an equity perspective, we settled forward agreements on 2.7 million shares for approximately $259 million in net proceeds and we executed new forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 340,000 shares, with an anticipated net proceeds of approximately $37 million. As of December 31, we had about $240 million remaining under equity forward arrangements that must be utilized by the end of our fiscal year. We continue to believe that we can satisfy our fiscal 2020 needs through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization was 58.6% as of December 31 and we finished the quarter with approximately $2 billion of liquidity under our credit facilities and equity forward agreements. The strength of our balance sheet and our five-year financial plan continues to be recognized by the credit rating agencies. In December, Moody's upgraded our long-term debt rating to A1 with a stable outlook and S&P reaffirmed our A credit rating. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on slide seven through 10. Our first quarter performance leaves us well positioned to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth target. As a result, yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2020 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.58 to $4.73 per diluted share. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Akers for his closing remarks. Yes. Some of that -- a couple of things. We got the 2% to 3% -- 2.5% to 3.5% that's baked into our five-year plan through 2024. We had already -- and that's a CAGR over that five-year period. So, we had already anticipated as you noted an uptick in O&M this year as a result of the additional hiring that we had obviously in the first quarter. As you try to turn that out over four quarters that can be a little bit difficult. We did have some timing particularly in our pipeline and storage segment around some well integrity work that was kind of accelerated more into the first quarter. So, when we look at the O&M guidance that we published for fiscal 2020, we feel like we are still on track to achieve that at this point in time. Yes, it's pretty much in line with our expectations. And honestly, we saw volumes pick up just a little bit versus what we expected but pricing was a little bit down. So, net-net we were in line with expectations. And as we look forward, we'll continue to monitor the market conditions. You're very well aware of the supply and demand dynamics are ongoing in the Permian Basin and we'll just keep an eye on that. But at this point we still think that our net income as well as our guidance that we have out there is still good. Sure. Yes. Charles this is Chris. A couple of comments around that. Last quarter GCX came online in the middle of the quarter. So we had some strong pricing opportunities if you will, in the first half of the fourth quarter last year which contributed to that quarter's results. As we move forward as we reiterated this morning we're on track with our earnings per share targets. And I'll also say that our contribution of our business between distribution and pipeline storage is going to be roughly the same as well. So that's roughly 2/3 distribution and 1/3 on the pipeline storage side. So as we continue to grow in that 6% to 8% range certainly for 2020 and as we look out through 2024, we expect the business mix between our two segments to be in that roughly that 2/3, 1/3 allocation, if you will. So it can ebb-and-flow a little bit, but we still see a lot of continued growth. And when you think about pipeline and storage most of the earnings drivers in that segment is the continued safety and reliability work that we are doing on our APT system. Kevin talks about the Bethel storage facility. So it's driven by fundamental rate based growth as a result of the supply or the -- what we're trying to accomplish from a safety perspective, as well as meeting the growing needs of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. That's correct. And remember too on this competitive pipeline and we've been talking about this for a couple of years, the non-tariff businesses that run through the pipeline that represents a relatively small piece of the overall puzzle for APT, primarily due to the existence of a Rider REV mechanism. So whatever we tend to pick up, in terms of a commercial business activity on that pipe 75% of the benefit flows back to our regulated customers on the distribution side in our Mid-Tex Division in North Texas. So and you heard us consistently say over the years, when they pick up a little bit here and there, but we don't view that as a material driver of our performance. It could have a little bit of an impact in a given year, given pricing dynamics but we don't -- certainly don't look to it as a source of fundamental growth for the long term. You see the O&M guidance that we've put out there we have already kind of anticipated those PHMSA rules coming into effect beginning in July of this calendar year. So it's going to be -- have a muted impact in 2020 and will continue to roll in on a full fiscal year basis and beginning in 2021. But we've already contemplated that in our O&M forecast through 2024. We don't have that information readily available. Well, we've got -- you'll see it in our Analyst Day this deck that we put out last fall, I think, we're at an all-in price anywhere from $3.20 -- $5.25 to $5.50 inclusive of storage and transportation costs. Storage and current transportation is usually between $1 and $1.50. So we assumed a high $2, low $3 range on the commodity pricing. So to the extent that we have lower pricing that we're able to capture from our various sources of gas, it's obviously a benefit that flows back to our customers. And we've got a very good gas supply team in our shared services function that is working to minimize the cost of gas across the enterprise. Good morning. If you look through our MDA, it's roughly down about a $750,000 to $1 million. It's in our line item that flows -- it's not on our Mid-Tex line, but it's our pipeline, it's in our three-system line item. So it's out there in the 10-Q. We made a call based upon market conditions at the time that we put the plan together last summer, but we haven't released those specific details."

Again with its direction its heading, it's mainly focused on takeaway out of the Permian down to the Gulf Coast area there.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nDan Meziere: Thank you, Diana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure.  As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 37 and more fully described in our SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and are glad you could join us this morning. On this Veterans Day, I would like to take just a moment to say thank you to those who have served our own forces. Nearly 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are part of the more than 20 million Americans who bravely serve our country, so that we may live freely. Thank you for your service. Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $5.12, which represents the 19th consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in this call.  I will begin today's call with a review of our fiscal '21 accomplishments, provide an update on key pipeline projects, and we'll close with some thoughts about fiscal '22. Our success in fiscal '21, once again, reflects the commitment and ongoing effort of all 4,700 employees at Atmos Energy. I've said it before and I'll say it again, they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our Company. I'm extremely proud of their commitment to keep our 3.2 million customers, our 1,400 communities, themselves and their families healthy and safe.  As you've heard us say, fiscal '21 was our 10th year executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage systems. And over that 10-year period, we invested nearly $13 billion in modernizing and expanding our natural gas systems, replacing approximately 5,500 miles of distribution pipeline, 394,000 steel service lines, and 1,100 miles of transmission pipeline. And over that same 10-year period, we added nearly 350,000 customers. As I said during our second quarter earnings call, those investments provided our natural gas systems the reliability and resiliency necessary to meet the gas demand of our human needs customers during winter storm Uri.  Our fiscal '21 capital investment of $2 billion supported the modernization of our distribution transmission systems further replacement of over 930 miles of distribution pipe, the replacement of more than 38,000 steel service lines and over 175 miles of transmission pipeline, all to further and enhance system safety and reliability. Additionally, we installed approximately 230,000 wireless meter reading devices and now have nearly 1.9 million wireless devices on our system. The above-mentioned capital investments also helped us make progress towards reducing methane emissions 50% by 2035 for EPA reported distribution maintenance services.  Through the end of fiscal '21, we have achieved an approximate 20% reduction. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our procurement team for their focus and dedication, as well as their continued outstanding efforts to ensure the necessary materials and resources are available for our distribution, transmission, and storage projects. Just as they did throughout the past decade, their strategic planning efforts have us well positioned for continued execution upon our strategy in fiscal '22. For example, throughout the pandemic, we've increased our inventory levels and coordinated with vendors as well as pipe mills to have our steel pipe requirements ready and available at job site for the upcoming fiscal year's projects.  Now I want to provide you an update on a few of our larger Atmos Pipeline Texas Project and highlight their value in safety, reliability, versatility, and supply diversification that those projects bring to APT and its customers. We're nearly 60% complete with the development of APT third salt dome storage cavern project at Bethel. This project will be placed in service in late '22, and will provide an additional 5 BCF to 6 BCF of cavern storage capacity.  We're also nearing completion of 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline as part of our Line X Phase 1 integrity replacement project, and we've already begun Phase 2, which includes an additional 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline, which we anticipate being completed sometime in late '22. As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT system, as well as transportation customers that move gas from Waha to Katy. Also, nearing completion is the 1st phase of three phases of our Line S2 project. Line S2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex. Our Phase 1 project replaces 21 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline.  We anticipate this phase to be in service by this calendar year-end, and Phase 2 of Line S2, which is approximately 17 miles of 36-inch pipeline, is now underway with completion expected in late '22, and the final phase of this 36-inch, 90-mile total project is expected to be completed in late '23. Again, this project will provide additional supply from the shale plays east of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. To support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in Williamson County, Texas, we began work on a 22-mile, 36-inch line that will connect the southern end of APT system with the 42-inch Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This line is currently expected to be in service by December of '22. As you've heard in my previous updates, our customer service agents and service technicians continue providing exceptional customer service during these challenging times. During fiscal year \u201821, our agents and technicians received a 98% satisfaction ready from customers. Thank you, team, for taking exceptional care of our customers every day. Our strategic focus on digital bill delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as over 48% of our customers are receiving electronic bills, while the utility industry average is around 28%, and 79% of the total payments we received as of September 30 for electronic methods of payment such as bank drafts, credit cards, and online banking.  During fiscal '21, we provided approximately 217,000 hours of training and we onboarded nearly 400 new employees through our Atmos Essentials classes. All of this activity was completed virtually. I'm very proud of our technical training and operations teams. In fiscal '21, we integrated our various safety and business process improvement initiatives into a comprehensive environmental strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and environmentally impact from our operations in the following five key areas: operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply, and customers. Our efforts in fiscal '21 to reduce emissions in our environmental impact included such things as our ongoing distribution transmission, and underground storage system modernization programs mentioned earlier. It also included the installation of gas cloud imaging capabilities that APT's troughs at each storage fields, and we will complete the remaining installation of that equipment, that APT sales in fiscal 22. We will also deploy additional wellhead, fixed based, or gas cloud imaging detection technologies at our distribution storage fields in fiscal 22 We developed a plan to replace our pneumatic devices with no bleed or low bleed devices. We expanded advanced late detection technology, and developed a strategy to capture methane emissions from pipeline maintenance activities.  We've continued our R&G strategy of identifying customers who wish to use our system to transport the R&G they produce. We increased the amount of R&G transported across our system to approximately 8 BCF a year, and we are evaluating nearly 30 opportunities that this time that could further expand these transportation opportunities. In fiscal '22, we will begin transitioning our light-duty vehicle fleet to gasoline hybrid vehicles and to C and G for our heavy-duty vehicles. In September, we completed our first zero net energy home in partnership with the Greeley-Weld Habitat for Humanity in Evans, Colorado.  This home uses high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels, and insulation to produce more energy than it consumes at a very affordable cost of approximately $50 a month for a combined gas and electric bill. We're currently developing 2 more of these type homes in Texas. Projects like these demonstrate the value of using all energy sources to reduce carbon emission. In this summer, we joined the low carbon resources initiative. As a reminder, this joint research and development effort between the Gas Technology Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute is working to accelerate commercial deployment of low and 0 carbon technologies.  Finally, we are nearing the completion of a fuel cell at one of our data facilities to generate low carbon electricity. This fuel cell will be powered with natural gas and is anticipated to substantially reduce the carbon footprint from that facility. To wrap up fiscal '21, our 4,700 employees still are feeling safe and thriving communities initiatives made a difference in the lives of others this year. All about supporting schools and students with books, meals, and snacks. We honored our community heroes and healthcare workers by providing them with meals as they were working. We planted trees, worked in community gardens. We hosted utility fares, Energy Assistance Blitz to share the warmth for over 9,000 customers as we donated $3 million of financial support, and for nearly 300 local food banks and shelters.  The financial and volunteer resources of our team provided translated into nearly 8 million meals for our neighbors in need across 1,400 communities. I'm very proud of our team because of their investment of time, talent, and resources, we are making a difference in our communities. A successful fiscal '21 has us well-positioned as we move into the second decade of our strategy. I will now turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some additional color around our fiscal '21 financial results and discuss our fiscal '22 guidance, as well as our updated 5-year plan through fiscal 26. I will then return with some closing remarks. Chris, over to you.\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Our fiscal '21 diluted earnings per share of $5.12, representing 8.5% increase over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 GAAP results included a one-time non-cash income tax benefit of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share related to the enactment of new tax legislation in Kansas. As we entered fiscal 21, we conservatively planned for lower non-residential revenues while planning to execute our normal O and M program. Though nonresidential sales volumes declined 10% period-over-period during the first quarter and early into the second quarter, we carefully manage our O&M spending focusing on compliance-related activities.  Non-residential sales volumes rebounded sooner than we anticipated, which created the opportunity to expand our O&M spending in the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, the timing difference between the impact of refunding excess deferred taxes on our revenues and deferred income tax expense contributed about a penny to fiscal 21 results. As a result, actual earnings-per-share slightly exceeded the higher-end of our guidance range. Taking a closer look, consolidated operating income rose approximately 10% to $905 million. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.  Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $207 million. We continue to benefit from strong customer growth and most of our jurisdictions, resulting in a $19 million increase in distribution operating income. During fiscal '21, we added 51,000 new customers, which represents a 1.6% increase over the last 12 months. Sales volumes for our commercial customers recovered fiscal '21, rising almost 6% over last year. Service order revenue in our distribution segment declined about $8.5 million primarily due to the waiver of our customer service fees for disconnections and reconnections. Additionally, our bad debt expense increased about $18 million year-over-year.  Bulk collection activities resume in the third quarter, and we continue to offer flexible payment arrangements, help customers find financial assistance, and remain in close contact with our regulators. We continue to believe this bad debt will be recovered over time. Consolidated [Indiscernible] and expense, excluding bad debt, increased $31 million with a focus on system safety, including enhanced leak surveys, pipeline integrity work, and continued records establishment, and retention. Additionally, line locate requests increased over 9% as a result of increased economic activity and the effects of our third-party damage awareness efforts. Capital and spending increased to $2 billion with 88% of our spending directed towards investments to modernize the safety, reliability, and environmental performance of our system.  In fiscal 21, over 90% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $226 million of annualized operating income increases. Excellent in the amortization of excess deferred tax liabilities. Since the end of fiscal year, we have reached agreement for the regulators and additional $69 million annualized operating income during our fiscal 2022 first quarter. As of today, we have four filings pending seeking about $22 million. Slides 27 to 36 summarize our regulatory activities. During fiscal '21, we completed over $1.2 billion of long-term debt and equity financing to support our ongoing operations.  We fully satisfied or fiscal '21 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. Under that program, we issued approximately 6 million shares under forward agreements for $578 million, and we settled approximately 6 million shares for net proceeds of $607 million. As of September 30th, we had approximately $300 million remaining under existing equity forward arrangements that will satisfy a significant portion of our fiscal '22 equity needs. This equity financing complemented the $600 million of long-term debt financing we issued last fall.  Additionally, we improved our financial flexibility during fiscal '21. During the second quarter, we renewed, extended, an increase in non-liquidity under our credit facilities. Our primary 5-year $1.5 billion facility was extended to March of 2026 and retained the $250 million accordion feature, and we replaced our expiring 364 day, $600 million credit facility with a new $900 million, 3-year credit facility with a $100 million accordion feature. We now have $2.5 billion available under 4 credit facilities. The financial flexibility these facilities provide improves our ability to respond to unforeseen events such as winter storm hearing. Additionally, we issued a new $5 million shelf registration statement and a new $1 billion ATM program to support our financing plans for fiscal '22 and beyond. Additionally, during the fourth quarter we mitigated future interest rate risk by executing $875 million of forward starting interest rate swaps.  Currently we have $1.85 billion in swaps to support our future long-term debt financing needs. Finally, our treasury team did an outstanding job in upstanding for $2.2 billion in cost effective interim financing to pay for the gas costs incurred during winter storm Uri, all of which preserved our ability to continue supporting our operational needs. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization, excluding the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing, was 60.6% as of September 30th. Additionally, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $2.9 billion of total liquidity, and strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, we just well-positioned as we move into fiscal '22. Details of our financing activities and financial profile can be found on Slides 9 to 12.  We've also fair to winter operations for the next fiscal year. You heard Kevin discuss that our procurement team has mitigated supply chain and inflation risk in our operations. Our gas supply chain has also done an excellent job preparing our gas supply strategy for the upcoming winter heating season. Our proprietary contracted storage is over 95% full and a weighted average cost of gas for approximately $3. Additionally, we have physically and financially hedged about 1/3 of our expected purchase requirements in approximately $4. Through the use of storage and hedge purchases, we have stabilized prices for approximately 1/2 of our normal winter usage in the mid-$3 range.  The remainder of anticipating gas supply needs, we satisfied through a combination of baseline purchases at person on prices, peaking contracts, and spot purchases but needed. Today, we had transportation capacity on 37 pipelines across our 8-state footprint which provides our gas supply team access to a wide variety of producing basins to ensure supply reliability and competitive natural gas prices for our customers.  As a reminder, all the gas costs we incur are recovered through purchase gas cost mechanisms generally over 12 months, and the process journey involves a weighted average approach, which helps us move the impact in customer bills. Finally, we've been actively communicating with our customers about how they can mitigate the potential impact of higher gas prices to energy conservation, as well as the various ways we can help them with their bills through installment plans, budget billing, and locating energy assistance agencies.  Looking forward, fiscal '22 will begin the second decade of pursuing our safety-focused organic growth strategy. Yesterday, we initiated our fiscal '22 earnings-per-share guidance in the range of $5.40 to $5.60. Consistent to prior years, we expect about 2/3 of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Details surrounding our fiscal '22 guidance can be found on Slides 20 and 21. Also yesterday, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 152nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal '22 is $2 and 72%, with 8.8% increase over fiscal '21.  Finally, fiscal '22, capital spending is expected to rise by 25%, and it's expected to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. Most of this increase will be incurred at APT, which represent approximately 1/3 of our capital spending in fiscal '22 as a result of the project work that Kevin described a few minutes ago. Over 90% of fiscal '22 capital spending is expected to begin earning return within 6 months when the test period end. Slide 19 summarizes the key themes underlying our fiscal '22 5-year plan. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate earnings per share will grow 6% to 8% per year. By fiscal '26, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $7 and $7.40.  We also anticipate dividends per share to increase annually in line with earnings per share. Continued spending per system replacement modernization, and environmental improvements, consistent expansion will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal '26. Over the next five years, we anticipate total spending at approximately $13 billion to $14 billion. This level of spend is expected to support rate-based growth of about 11% to 13% per year. This translates into an estimated right base of $21 billion to $23 billion in fiscal '26, up from about $12 billion at the end of fiscal '21. From an O&M perspective, we continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety.  For fiscal '22, we anticipate O&M to range from $690 million to $710 million and we assumed O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal '26. In addition to the spending plans I outlined; we had assumed approximately $600 million in excess deferred tax refunds over the next 5 years will flow back to customers. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal '22 to be between 9% and 11%. This rate assumes no tax changes are currently being considered at the federal level, and the financing perspective, we will continue to follow the financing strategy we've been executing the last few years to preserve the strength of our Balance Sheet.  Excluding securitization, we anticipate the need to raise between $7 billion and $8 billion incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our Balance Sheet analysis to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity financing to target a 50% to 60% equity capitalization ratio, inclusive of short-term debt. This financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings-per-share guidance through fiscal '26. In October, we completed a $600 million 30-year senior note issuance with a coupon of 2.85% after factoring in a favorable settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps, the effective rate on this issuance is 2.58%, and our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 19 years, excluding the $2.2 billion of incremental winter storm financing.  Finally, as I previously mentioned, we have hedged a substantial portion of our anticipated long-term debt needs to mitigate interest rate risk. From an equity perspective, utilizing our ATM program continues to be our preferred method for raising equity. As I mentioned earlier, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal '21 will satisfy a significant portion of our expected equity needs for fiscal '22. we expect to rage our remaining fiscal '22 equity needs through our ATM program. Regarding Securitization, we have made substantial progress in the last few months. Yesterday, the Bureau Commission of Texas unanimously issued a final determination of regulatory asset that will be securitized under the Statewide program.  The final order stipulated that all of our gas and storage costs are prudently incurred and are fully recoverable. The next step is for the Railroad Commission to issue a financing order. Following the issuance of the financing order, the Texas Public Financing Authority has up to 180 days to complete the securitization transaction. Upon receipt of the securitization funds, we will repay the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing we issued last March. In Kansas, we filed our Securitization application in mid-September. We are currently responding to various questions, and a procedural schedule has been set, with all proceedings expected to begin in January.  Finally, annual filing mechanisms with the primary means to which we'd recover capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy our capital spend, and generate returns necessary to attract the capital we made to finance our investments, and these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our system modernization efforts. We have assumed no material changes these mechanisms to fiscal '26. In fiscal '22, we anticipate completing filings for $215 million to $225 million in annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years, '22 and '23.  The execution of this plan to modernize our system to disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms, and balanced long-term financing, all supports our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends in the 6 to 8% range annually through fiscal 2026, and as you can see on Slide 25. The execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable and it help us sustain this plan for the long term. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. Looking forward, I'm very excited about the direction and long-term sustainability of our Company. The foundation has been set with a proven safety driven strategy accompanied with organic growth that yield, as Chris said, 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share commensurate dividend per share growth, supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of the investment in natural gas infrastructure. 97% of our rate basis situated in 6 of our 8 states that have passed legislation in support of energy choice.  The constructive regulatory mechanisms in our jurisdiction support the necessary capital investments to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage systems. We have a long runway of work to support the planned $13 billion to $14 billion in capital spending over the next 5 years as you can see on Slide 16 and 17. That spending will support replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe, or about 6% to 8% of our total system.  We also plan to replace between 100,000 to 150,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over that 5-year period. Additionally, you've heard us discuss the growth in our jurisdiction. 8 of the 11 fastest-growing counties we serve are in the DFW Metroplex and to the north of Austin. Additionally, our Middle Tennessee, service territory ranks among the fastest growing areas in the U.S. as well, and we continue to see industrial customers in our footprint choose natural gas. In fiscal '21, we added approximately 45 new industrial customers with an estimated annual load of between 10 to 12 BCF a year once they are fully online, and these customers are from various industry, manufacturing, food processing, hospitals and distilleries.  Focusing on the long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy as reflected in the vital role we play every day in our communities. Delivering safe, reliable, and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses, and industries to fuel our energy needs now and into the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKody Clark: Hey, it's actually Kody Clark on for Julien. Good morning.\nKevin Akers: Good morning, Kody. How are you?\nChris Forsythe: Good morning, Kody.\nKody Clark: Good. So first on the delta between the 11% to 13% rate base growth and the 6% to 8% EPS growth. I know there's a good deal of equity contemplated in plan, so definitely cognizant of the dilution there, but low like regulatory lag, given the recovery mechanisms that you have across your jurisdiction, so I'm wondering if there are any other drivers of that delta that you would call out.\nKevin Akers: Yes. At this time, it really is just the financing plan that we've assumed over the next five years as you point out, it's the equity component. But again, that's factored into the 6% to 8% earnings per share growth that we highlighted on the call this morning.\nKody Clark: Got it. Okay. And then building off that question a little bit. I'm wondering how you would characterize where you see yourself in that 6% to 8% long-term EPS growth range. Is it more towards the midpoint or top 10? I'm asking because the past couple of year-end updates I've seen you performed well during the year, rebase off that strong number and then reiterate the 6 to 8% growth after that. So are you being a little bit conservative or how would you think about that?\nKevin Akers: When you look at the ranges that we've put out this morning, the $5.40 to $5.60 for fiscal '22, and then the $7 to $7.40 in fiscal 2026. If you take the midpoint of both of those ranges and kind of do the math and that implies about a 7% annual growth rate per year.\nKody Clark: Okay. And then last one if I can just sneak it in that. We've seen the market multiple for gas utilities decline relative to the electric peers throughout the year, and at the same time has seen some healthy transaction multiples for some of the gas utilities. So how are you thinking about potentially monetizing an asset or assets to offset the ATM equity needs. I know you've stated in the past thing you'd like your business mix, but wondering if that has changed at all.\nKevin Akers: I'll start on that, Kody, and then Chris can certainly jump in if he wants to. Again, as you said, we've been very proud of our assets. We continue to be very proud of them. You look at the results here. You talked about the diversified growth that we just mentioned on our call here, the mechanisms, the regulatory relationships that we have out there, our involvement in the communities. We're very proud of the asset mix we have today. So we're not contemplating at this point anything, but continuing the excellent operation of those assets.\nKody Clark: Great. That's all I had.\nChris Forsythe: Kody, I\u2019ll add\u2026\nKody Clark: Okay. Very good.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just wanted to start with this Permian highway project. Does it create incremental base and takeaway or just better connectivity to the Permian highway pipeline?\nKevin Akers: Well, that project you're talking about where we are connecting up in the Permian highway project, that's just to meet the growing demand of that Austin corridor down there to feel that diversification of a load as well for us. So, that's what we're looking to do. We're connecting to that Permian Highway project to bringing that supply up from the Sal instead of moving gas around from the north or bringing it over from Katy at this point. So for us, again, it's another supply optionality to meet the growing corridor that we have down there, and then some supply diversification.\nRichard Sunderland: Understood. And then I realized the entire five-year capital plan is up year-over-year. But is there anything notable in the 2022 CapEx step-up or just any color there?\nKevin Akers: Well, I think nothing that steps up again. We go through a very rigorous and robust planning process each year that looks at the one, three, and five-year projects levels that are out there. As you've heard us say before, we take a long look at the projects and how I meet integrity management goals, compliance goals, but we also look at it from that growth perspective, what has been the band going to be out in the future and how do we meet that demand? So I think that's all contemplated within this. That's why we spiked out those projects. So I think this is just a further iteration of meeting the supply needs to demand and diversification that we continue to talk about.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nInsoo Kim : Thank you. My first question is on just general gas hedging. I know that the salt dome is coming on and that's going to help just the storage capacity but whether it's in Texas or other regions, you're following what the hedging rules are that the commissions of those states put on limited to that, but just whether it's a result of Uri or some other spikes we're seeing in the current winter season, any dialogue with any of the commissions on potentially changing the hedging strategy?\nKevin Akers: Yes, I'll start out and then see if Chris wants to add any color. We have dialogue every year with our commissions, as you know, laying out what our anticipated gas supply plan is for that year, how we perform the following year. We're open to that feedback. But right now, both our commissions, our gas supply teams are very comfortable with the plans we've been able to put together. And you heard that combined with our storage opportunity, our base load purchases, those sort of things, how well they have us positioned going into this winter heating season. So we'll continue those dialogues, continue those conversations, we'll continue to meet with our jurisdictions at the end of each winter season and work collaboratively with each of those jurisdictions as they see it going forward.\nInsoo Kim : Got it. And my second question, the proposed methane fee that's in the reconciliation package. I think more on the upstream and midstream side of things, but just curious on your thoughts or whether it's direct or indirect, any potential impact or ramifications you see for your utilities or just the gas LDC industry in general?\nKevin Akers: There's still a lot of moving parts and pieces to that legislation. A lot of conversation is still going on at the federal level with that. And quite frankly, as they continue to do that, we'll monitor that. But I think the thing is you've heard us say before that the United States, as we sit here today, is among the top five producers in natural gas. We're among the top five and proven reserves in the world today. And for us to continue to have the economic growth, the economic stability, and security that we need from an energy perspective and a national perspective, we're going to need to have a continued diversified energy portfolio. And we believe natural gas certainly brings that to the table with the flexibility, reliability, and abundance it provides everybody. We just outlined through today's update how natural gas plays a key role in that. So we'll continue to monitor that, but we will look for a diversified energy portfolio to continue to meet the demands of the U.S.\nInsoo Kim : Got it. We'll leave it there. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Hey, good morning.\nKevin Akers: Good morning.\nChris Forsythe: Hey, Steve.\nStephen Byrd: Hey. So a lot of topics have been covered. I wanted to touch on two things. Maybe first, just back on the natural gas pricing impact, that Slide 25, I think is quite constructive to your point, we don't see big shocks. Are there dynamics though, whether it's in 1 jurisdiction, where the impact is greater or an assumption that could change, it could cause that fairly modest increase in '22, for example, to be a little bit different, or worse for any jurisdiction, or I guess, my bottom line question is, what kinds of shocks could cause that to be different, or is it really hard to envision that?\nChris Forsythe: Go ahead, Kevin.\nKevin Akers: Go ahead. I'm sorry.\nChris Forsythe: Well, I don't foresee anything that could impact us at this point, those are averages as you know, that we put out there, we continue to look for diversification across our pipes as you heard us mentioned earlier, we're across 37 pipelines, multiple basins. So we tried to blend in as much diversification and flexibility as we can within our systems. We have these annual mechanisms that tend to level out, increases over time, and I think for conservative on those gold bars there on 25, as you've heard us say before, we're looking way out into the future on some of those prices, and as outlook today, while hard at cash basis is $3.98 Katy to $4.40 and I believe the non-Maxx is at $4.91 today.  So I think again, with the great work, our gas supply team does, where our assets are located on multiple pipes, availability of storage, that sort of thing, we're in a really good position. Chris, anything you want to add? Yes, I'd say, too as we saw about what could potentially move the needle in terms of pricing, and it's again, it's weather patterns. It sums in the pricing dynamics that Kevin just described. Also, just customer usage and to all that's very, very difficult to predict and trying to estimate or come up with a true impact, and again, with an 8-state footprint that covers a fairly significant geographical difference that you could have weather patterns that impact the eastern portion of the U.S. that are completely there from Texas and what we might experience in Colorado.  So really, it's, I think, pretty challenging for us to say across the 8-state footprint if there is a trade key driver to watch out for. I think it's going to be a combination of all of the items you just mentioned; pricing, the basins that we have access to. They're very highly liquid basins. So we were able to have a good keen eye on what that pricing situation customer usage, as well as just general weather patterns.\nDan Meziere: That's really helpful, and then shifting over to financing, I am going to step back a little bit on this question. Atmos is in a really interesting situation. You have perhaps the fastest growth rate in terms of your rate base among companies we cover. We love the growth outlook. What's interesting is that the amount of equity needed compared to your market cap is high, and the value of the stock, the PE multiple of the stock is dramatically lower than what we're seeing in private asset sales, including not just sales of a 100%, but just selling a minority stake, we've seen dramatically higher valuations.  So I guess the math my suggests that a sale of a minority stake at the kinds of multiples we've been seeing on other situations would be dramatically less dilutive than this kind of volume of equity issuance that we're looking at over the next 5 years. How do you all kind of think about the possibility of selling non-controlling minority stakes, potentially much higher valuations than just where your own stock is trading? How do you-all think about that?\nChris Forsythe: It's a challenge for us because we don't have the holding Company structure like many of our peers do. So when you look at each of our divisions or each of our states, that's all under one corporate umbrella. So we can't do a minority sale for a single jurisdiction. The way we're structured today, it would have to be a partial assets sale or a certain geographic region that we would have to exit, and as you heard Kevin talk earlier with Kody, we're very happy with the assets that we have, the jurisdiction footprints.  We do see the dislocation between what the private market is a place of evaluation on versus what we're seeing from the public traded perspective and we think again to the public and trade perspective, the fact that 97% of our asset base is located in jurisdictions that are supportive of natural gas, both from a policy perspective, the regulatory perspective, the fact that we have very strong customer growth is currently being a little bit underappreciated, and that's where we just need to continue to remind those investors that we are very well-positioned in the country to capture the growth experienced in our jurisdictions and have jurisdictions that have strong support natural gas.\nKevin Akers: Yes. Chris, I'll just add you've got 19 years of EPS growth and 38 years of consecutive dividend increases all support our strong position as well as what Chris had about our regulatory jurisdiction. So we're going to continue to operate and do the things we do within our strategy. We've outlined, we think it's solid. We think it fits our jurisdictions well. So really believe we are in a good position going forward, not only for our customers but our communities and all stakeholders.\nStephen Byrd: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming Ryan Levine of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Good morning.\nChris Forsythe: Good morning.\nKevin Akers: Hey, Ryan.\nRyan Levine: Hey. What are the drivers of where you would fall in the 22% range for EPS? Can you talk about some of the pluses or minuses that may determine the outcome?\nChris Forsythe: Key pluses or minuses obviously will be the execution of the regulatory strategy. Customer usage patterns, whether although we are [Indiscernible] normalized, 97% of our jurisdictions, we can see a little bit of that weather year-over-year, and just timing of O&M spending as we continue our ongoing system safety and compliance work, those are the key drivers that we generally point to when we're talking about where we can fall within the 6% to 8% range.\nRyan Levine: On the O&M point, think you're assuming 3%, 8% to 3.5% O&M cost inflation in your '22 outlook, what underpins that? Seeing some more robust inflation figures more recently, can you elaborate on what's driving that assumption?\nChris Forsythe: Sure. It's the ongoing expansion of our compliance work. You've heard us talk before that we're in a mode now, doing more compliance work every year rather than holding back and waiting for another rate case to occur. So as we continue to look at the rule making that's happening at the federal and the state level, we work to try to get ahead of that, so that when it comes time for a compliance deadline to have met, we're getting there. Well in advance on when that deadline is and we're also just looking at the system needs and what we want to be doing from a safety perspective. So when talked about advanced leak detection technologies and further expanding that across our footprint, as well as just ongoing hydrotesting at inline inspection work on our large-scale distribution in some of transmission lines to make sure that better system is operating as safely as it possibly can.\nRyan Levine: Okay, and then from the federal legislation, what do you view as the impact to Atmos more broadly?\nKevin Akers: Are you referring to the infrastructure bill there, Ryan?\nRyan Levine: The infrastructure bill and potential tax reform or tax changes.\nKevin Akers: On the infrastructure bill itself, as you know, it's very comprehensive, we're still working our way through it, but some of the things that we've seen that we are focusing in on our incentives in there for high-efficiency natural gas appliances, systems that regard hydrogen research and development, as well as there's some, I think, $500 million or so over the next 5-year increase for low heat. That's in there as well. The rest of it at this point, we're still working our way through the detailed piece of that with, with our peer companies and with the American Gas Association.\nRyan Levine: Okay, and then last question for me. Are you talking to any of your regulators within your few jurisdictions about rate-basing electrolyzers within the LDC?\nKevin Akers: Short answer is no.\nRyan Levine: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.\nDan Meziere: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us today. The recording of this call is available for replay on our website through January 6, 2022. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Akers",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and are glad you could join us this morning. On this Veterans Day, I would like to take just a moment to say thank you to those who have served our own forces. Nearly 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are part of the more than 20 million Americans who bravely serve our country, so that we may live freely. Thank you for your service. Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $5.12, which represents the 19th consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in this call.  I will begin today's call with a review of our fiscal '21 accomplishments, provide an update on key pipeline projects, and we'll close with some thoughts about fiscal '22. Our success in fiscal '21, once again, reflects the commitment and ongoing effort of all 4,700 employees at Atmos Energy. I've said it before and I'll say it again, they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our Company. I'm extremely proud of their commitment to keep our 3.2 million customers, our 1,400 communities, themselves and their families healthy and safe.  As you've heard us say, fiscal '21 was our 10th year executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage systems. And over that 10-year period, we invested nearly $13 billion in modernizing and expanding our natural gas systems, replacing approximately 5,500 miles of distribution pipeline, 394,000 steel service lines, and 1,100 miles of transmission pipeline. And over that same 10-year period, we added nearly 350,000 customers. As I said during our second quarter earnings call, those investments provided our natural gas systems the reliability and resiliency necessary to meet the gas demand of our human needs customers during winter storm Uri.  Our fiscal '21 capital investment of $2 billion supported the modernization of our distribution transmission systems further replacement of over 930 miles of distribution pipe, the replacement of more than 38,000 steel service lines and over 175 miles of transmission pipeline, all to further and enhance system safety and reliability. Additionally, we installed approximately 230,000 wireless meter reading devices and now have nearly 1.9 million wireless devices on our system. The above-mentioned capital investments also helped us make progress towards reducing methane emissions 50% by 2035 for EPA reported distribution maintenance services.  Through the end of fiscal '21, we have achieved an approximate 20% reduction. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our procurement team for their focus and dedication, as well as their continued outstanding efforts to ensure the necessary materials and resources are available for our distribution, transmission, and storage projects. Just as they did throughout the past decade, their strategic planning efforts have us well positioned for continued execution upon our strategy in fiscal '22. For example, throughout the pandemic, we've increased our inventory levels and coordinated with vendors as well as pipe mills to have our steel pipe requirements ready and available at job site for the upcoming fiscal year's projects.  Now I want to provide you an update on a few of our larger Atmos Pipeline Texas Project and highlight their value in safety, reliability, versatility, and supply diversification that those projects bring to APT and its customers. We're nearly 60% complete with the development of APT third salt dome storage cavern project at Bethel. This project will be placed in service in late '22, and will provide an additional 5 BCF to 6 BCF of cavern storage capacity.  We're also nearing completion of 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline as part of our Line X Phase 1 integrity replacement project, and we've already begun Phase 2, which includes an additional 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline, which we anticipate being completed sometime in late '22. As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT system, as well as transportation customers that move gas from Waha to Katy. Also, nearing completion is the 1st phase of three phases of our Line S2 project. Line S2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex. Our Phase 1 project replaces 21 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline.  We anticipate this phase to be in service by this calendar year-end, and Phase 2 of Line S2, which is approximately 17 miles of 36-inch pipeline, is now underway with completion expected in late '22, and the final phase of this 36-inch, 90-mile total project is expected to be completed in late '23. Again, this project will provide additional supply from the shale plays east of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. To support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in Williamson County, Texas, we began work on a 22-mile, 36-inch line that will connect the southern end of APT system with the 42-inch Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This line is currently expected to be in service by December of '22. As you've heard in my previous updates, our customer service agents and service technicians continue providing exceptional customer service during these challenging times. During fiscal year \u201821, our agents and technicians received a 98% satisfaction ready from customers. Thank you, team, for taking exceptional care of our customers every day. Our strategic focus on digital bill delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as over 48% of our customers are receiving electronic bills, while the utility industry average is around 28%, and 79% of the total payments we received as of September 30 for electronic methods of payment such as bank drafts, credit cards, and online banking.  During fiscal '21, we provided approximately 217,000 hours of training and we onboarded nearly 400 new employees through our Atmos Essentials classes. All of this activity was completed virtually. I'm very proud of our technical training and operations teams. In fiscal '21, we integrated our various safety and business process improvement initiatives into a comprehensive environmental strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and environmentally impact from our operations in the following five key areas: operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply, and customers. Our efforts in fiscal '21 to reduce emissions in our environmental impact included such things as our ongoing distribution transmission, and underground storage system modernization programs mentioned earlier. It also included the installation of gas cloud imaging capabilities that APT's troughs at each storage fields, and we will complete the remaining installation of that equipment, that APT sales in fiscal 22. We will also deploy additional wellhead, fixed based, or gas cloud imaging detection technologies at our distribution storage fields in fiscal 22 We developed a plan to replace our pneumatic devices with no bleed or low bleed devices. We expanded advanced late detection technology, and developed a strategy to capture methane emissions from pipeline maintenance activities.  We've continued our R&G strategy of identifying customers who wish to use our system to transport the R&G they produce. We increased the amount of R&G transported across our system to approximately 8 BCF a year, and we are evaluating nearly 30 opportunities that this time that could further expand these transportation opportunities. In fiscal '22, we will begin transitioning our light-duty vehicle fleet to gasoline hybrid vehicles and to C and G for our heavy-duty vehicles. In September, we completed our first zero net energy home in partnership with the Greeley-Weld Habitat for Humanity in Evans, Colorado.  This home uses high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels, and insulation to produce more energy than it consumes at a very affordable cost of approximately $50 a month for a combined gas and electric bill. We're currently developing 2 more of these type homes in Texas. Projects like these demonstrate the value of using all energy sources to reduce carbon emission. In this summer, we joined the low carbon resources initiative. As a reminder, this joint research and development effort between the Gas Technology Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute is working to accelerate commercial deployment of low and 0 carbon technologies.  Finally, we are nearing the completion of a fuel cell at one of our data facilities to generate low carbon electricity. This fuel cell will be powered with natural gas and is anticipated to substantially reduce the carbon footprint from that facility. To wrap up fiscal '21, our 4,700 employees still are feeling safe and thriving communities initiatives made a difference in the lives of others this year. All about supporting schools and students with books, meals, and snacks. We honored our community heroes and healthcare workers by providing them with meals as they were working. We planted trees, worked in community gardens. We hosted utility fares, Energy Assistance Blitz to share the warmth for over 9,000 customers as we donated $3 million of financial support, and for nearly 300 local food banks and shelters.  The financial and volunteer resources of our team provided translated into nearly 8 million meals for our neighbors in need across 1,400 communities. I'm very proud of our team because of their investment of time, talent, and resources, we are making a difference in our communities. A successful fiscal '21 has us well-positioned as we move into the second decade of our strategy. I will now turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some additional color around our fiscal '21 financial results and discuss our fiscal '22 guidance, as well as our updated 5-year plan through fiscal 26. I will then return with some closing remarks. Chris, over to you. Thank you, Chris. Looking forward, I'm very excited about the direction and long-term sustainability of our Company. The foundation has been set with a proven safety driven strategy accompanied with organic growth that yield, as Chris said, 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share commensurate dividend per share growth, supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of the investment in natural gas infrastructure. 97% of our rate basis situated in 6 of our 8 states that have passed legislation in support of energy choice.  The constructive regulatory mechanisms in our jurisdiction support the necessary capital investments to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission, and storage systems. We have a long runway of work to support the planned $13 billion to $14 billion in capital spending over the next 5 years as you can see on Slide 16 and 17. That spending will support replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe, or about 6% to 8% of our total system.  We also plan to replace between 100,000 to 150,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over that 5-year period. Additionally, you've heard us discuss the growth in our jurisdiction. 8 of the 11 fastest-growing counties we serve are in the DFW Metroplex and to the north of Austin. Additionally, our Middle Tennessee, service territory ranks among the fastest growing areas in the U.S. as well, and we continue to see industrial customers in our footprint choose natural gas. In fiscal '21, we added approximately 45 new industrial customers with an estimated annual load of between 10 to 12 BCF a year once they are fully online, and these customers are from various industry, manufacturing, food processing, hospitals and distilleries.  Focusing on the long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy as reflected in the vital role we play every day in our communities. Delivering safe, reliable, and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses, and industries to fuel our energy needs now and into the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions. Good morning, Kody. How are you? Yes. At this time, it really is just the financing plan that we've assumed over the next five years as you point out, it's the equity component. But again, that's factored into the 6% to 8% earnings per share growth that we highlighted on the call this morning. When you look at the ranges that we've put out this morning, the $5.40 to $5.60 for fiscal '22, and then the $7 to $7.40 in fiscal 2026. If you take the midpoint of both of those ranges and kind of do the math and that implies about a 7% annual growth rate per year. I'll start on that, Kody, and then Chris can certainly jump in if he wants to. Again, as you said, we've been very proud of our assets. We continue to be very proud of them. You look at the results here. You talked about the diversified growth that we just mentioned on our call here, the mechanisms, the regulatory relationships that we have out there, our involvement in the communities. We're very proud of the asset mix we have today. So we're not contemplating at this point anything, but continuing the excellent operation of those assets. Well, that project you're talking about where we are connecting up in the Permian highway project, that's just to meet the growing demand of that Austin corridor down there to feel that diversification of a load as well for us. So, that's what we're looking to do. We're connecting to that Permian Highway project to bringing that supply up from the Sal instead of moving gas around from the north or bringing it over from Katy at this point. So for us, again, it's another supply optionality to meet the growing corridor that we have down there, and then some supply diversification. Well, I think nothing that steps up again. We go through a very rigorous and robust planning process each year that looks at the one, three, and five-year projects levels that are out there. As you've heard us say before, we take a long look at the projects and how I meet integrity management goals, compliance goals, but we also look at it from that growth perspective, what has been the band going to be out in the future and how do we meet that demand? So I think that's all contemplated within this. That's why we spiked out those projects. So I think this is just a further iteration of meeting the supply needs to demand and diversification that we continue to talk about. Yes, I'll start out and then see if Chris wants to add any color. We have dialogue every year with our commissions, as you know, laying out what our anticipated gas supply plan is for that year, how we perform the following year. We're open to that feedback. But right now, both our commissions, our gas supply teams are very comfortable with the plans we've been able to put together. And you heard that combined with our storage opportunity, our base load purchases, those sort of things, how well they have us positioned going into this winter heating season. So we'll continue those dialogues, continue those conversations, we'll continue to meet with our jurisdictions at the end of each winter season and work collaboratively with each of those jurisdictions as they see it going forward. There's still a lot of moving parts and pieces to that legislation. A lot of conversation is still going on at the federal level with that. And quite frankly, as they continue to do that, we'll monitor that. But I think the thing is you've heard us say before that the United States, as we sit here today, is among the top five producers in natural gas. We're among the top five and proven reserves in the world today. And for us to continue to have the economic growth, the economic stability, and security that we need from an energy perspective and a national perspective, we're going to need to have a continued diversified energy portfolio. And we believe natural gas certainly brings that to the table with the flexibility, reliability, and abundance it provides everybody. We just outlined through today's update how natural gas plays a key role in that. So we'll continue to monitor that, but we will look for a diversified energy portfolio to continue to meet the demands of the U.S. Good morning. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Yes. Chris, I'll just add you've got 19 years of EPS growth and 38 years of consecutive dividend increases all support our strong position as well as what Chris had about our regulatory jurisdiction. So we're going to continue to operate and do the things we do within our strategy. We've outlined, we think it's solid. We think it fits our jurisdictions well. So really believe we are in a good position going forward, not only for our customers but our communities and all stakeholders. Hey, Ryan. Are you referring to the infrastructure bill there, Ryan? On the infrastructure bill itself, as you know, it's very comprehensive, we're still working our way through it, but some of the things that we've seen that we are focusing in on our incentives in there for high-efficiency natural gas appliances, systems that regard hydrogen research and development, as well as there's some, I think, $500 million or so over the next 5-year increase for low heat. That's in there as well. The rest of it at this point, we're still working our way through the detailed piece of that with, with our peer companies and with the American Gas Association. Short answer is no."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Our fiscal '21 diluted earnings per share of $5.12, representing 8.5% increase over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 reported in the prior year. As a reminder, our fiscal 2020 GAAP results included a one-time non-cash income tax benefit of $21 million or $0.17 per diluted share related to the enactment of new tax legislation in Kansas. As we entered fiscal 21, we conservatively planned for lower non-residential revenues while planning to execute our normal O and M program. Though nonresidential sales volumes declined 10% period-over-period during the first quarter and early into the second quarter, we carefully manage our O&M spending focusing on compliance-related activities.  Non-residential sales volumes rebounded sooner than we anticipated, which created the opportunity to expand our O&M spending in the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, the timing difference between the impact of refunding excess deferred taxes on our revenues and deferred income tax expense contributed about a penny to fiscal 21 results. As a result, actual earnings-per-share slightly exceeded the higher-end of our guidance range. Taking a closer look, consolidated operating income rose approximately 10% to $905 million. Slides 5 and 6 provide details of the year-over-year changes to operating income for each of our segments. I will touch on a few of the fiscal year highlights.  Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $207 million. We continue to benefit from strong customer growth and most of our jurisdictions, resulting in a $19 million increase in distribution operating income. During fiscal '21, we added 51,000 new customers, which represents a 1.6% increase over the last 12 months. Sales volumes for our commercial customers recovered fiscal '21, rising almost 6% over last year. Service order revenue in our distribution segment declined about $8.5 million primarily due to the waiver of our customer service fees for disconnections and reconnections. Additionally, our bad debt expense increased about $18 million year-over-year.  Bulk collection activities resume in the third quarter, and we continue to offer flexible payment arrangements, help customers find financial assistance, and remain in close contact with our regulators. We continue to believe this bad debt will be recovered over time. Consolidated [Indiscernible] and expense, excluding bad debt, increased $31 million with a focus on system safety, including enhanced leak surveys, pipeline integrity work, and continued records establishment, and retention. Additionally, line locate requests increased over 9% as a result of increased economic activity and the effects of our third-party damage awareness efforts. Capital and spending increased to $2 billion with 88% of our spending directed towards investments to modernize the safety, reliability, and environmental performance of our system.  In fiscal 21, over 90% of our capital spending began to earn a return within 6 months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $226 million of annualized operating income increases. Excellent in the amortization of excess deferred tax liabilities. Since the end of fiscal year, we have reached agreement for the regulators and additional $69 million annualized operating income during our fiscal 2022 first quarter. As of today, we have four filings pending seeking about $22 million. Slides 27 to 36 summarize our regulatory activities. During fiscal '21, we completed over $1.2 billion of long-term debt and equity financing to support our ongoing operations.  We fully satisfied or fiscal '21 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. Under that program, we issued approximately 6 million shares under forward agreements for $578 million, and we settled approximately 6 million shares for net proceeds of $607 million. As of September 30th, we had approximately $300 million remaining under existing equity forward arrangements that will satisfy a significant portion of our fiscal '22 equity needs. This equity financing complemented the $600 million of long-term debt financing we issued last fall.  Additionally, we improved our financial flexibility during fiscal '21. During the second quarter, we renewed, extended, an increase in non-liquidity under our credit facilities. Our primary 5-year $1.5 billion facility was extended to March of 2026 and retained the $250 million accordion feature, and we replaced our expiring 364 day, $600 million credit facility with a new $900 million, 3-year credit facility with a $100 million accordion feature. We now have $2.5 billion available under 4 credit facilities. The financial flexibility these facilities provide improves our ability to respond to unforeseen events such as winter storm hearing. Additionally, we issued a new $5 million shelf registration statement and a new $1 billion ATM program to support our financing plans for fiscal '22 and beyond. Additionally, during the fourth quarter we mitigated future interest rate risk by executing $875 million of forward starting interest rate swaps.  Currently we have $1.85 billion in swaps to support our future long-term debt financing needs. Finally, our treasury team did an outstanding job in upstanding for $2.2 billion in cost effective interim financing to pay for the gas costs incurred during winter storm Uri, all of which preserved our ability to continue supporting our operational needs. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization, excluding the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing, was 60.6% as of September 30th. Additionally, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $2.9 billion of total liquidity, and strength of our balance sheet and liquidity, we just well-positioned as we move into fiscal '22. Details of our financing activities and financial profile can be found on Slides 9 to 12.  We've also fair to winter operations for the next fiscal year. You heard Kevin discuss that our procurement team has mitigated supply chain and inflation risk in our operations. Our gas supply chain has also done an excellent job preparing our gas supply strategy for the upcoming winter heating season. Our proprietary contracted storage is over 95% full and a weighted average cost of gas for approximately $3. Additionally, we have physically and financially hedged about 1/3 of our expected purchase requirements in approximately $4. Through the use of storage and hedge purchases, we have stabilized prices for approximately 1/2 of our normal winter usage in the mid-$3 range.  The remainder of anticipating gas supply needs, we satisfied through a combination of baseline purchases at person on prices, peaking contracts, and spot purchases but needed. Today, we had transportation capacity on 37 pipelines across our 8-state footprint which provides our gas supply team access to a wide variety of producing basins to ensure supply reliability and competitive natural gas prices for our customers.  As a reminder, all the gas costs we incur are recovered through purchase gas cost mechanisms generally over 12 months, and the process journey involves a weighted average approach, which helps us move the impact in customer bills. Finally, we've been actively communicating with our customers about how they can mitigate the potential impact of higher gas prices to energy conservation, as well as the various ways we can help them with their bills through installment plans, budget billing, and locating energy assistance agencies.  Looking forward, fiscal '22 will begin the second decade of pursuing our safety-focused organic growth strategy. Yesterday, we initiated our fiscal '22 earnings-per-share guidance in the range of $5.40 to $5.60. Consistent to prior years, we expect about 2/3 of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Details surrounding our fiscal '22 guidance can be found on Slides 20 and 21. Also yesterday, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 152nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal '22 is $2 and 72%, with 8.8% increase over fiscal '21.  Finally, fiscal '22, capital spending is expected to rise by 25%, and it's expected to be in the range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. Most of this increase will be incurred at APT, which represent approximately 1/3 of our capital spending in fiscal '22 as a result of the project work that Kevin described a few minutes ago. Over 90% of fiscal '22 capital spending is expected to begin earning return within 6 months when the test period end. Slide 19 summarizes the key themes underlying our fiscal '22 5-year plan. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate earnings per share will grow 6% to 8% per year. By fiscal '26, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $7 and $7.40.  We also anticipate dividends per share to increase annually in line with earnings per share. Continued spending per system replacement modernization, and environmental improvements, consistent expansion will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share through fiscal '26. Over the next five years, we anticipate total spending at approximately $13 billion to $14 billion. This level of spend is expected to support rate-based growth of about 11% to 13% per year. This translates into an estimated right base of $21 billion to $23 billion in fiscal '26, up from about $12 billion at the end of fiscal '21. From an O&M perspective, we continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety.  For fiscal '22, we anticipate O&M to range from $690 million to $710 million and we assumed O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal '26. In addition to the spending plans I outlined; we had assumed approximately $600 million in excess deferred tax refunds over the next 5 years will flow back to customers. As a result, we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal '22 to be between 9% and 11%. This rate assumes no tax changes are currently being considered at the federal level, and the financing perspective, we will continue to follow the financing strategy we've been executing the last few years to preserve the strength of our Balance Sheet.  Excluding securitization, we anticipate the need to raise between $7 billion and $8 billion incremental long-term financing over the next 5 years. The strength of our Balance Sheet analysis to use a prudent mix of long-term debt and equity financing to target a 50% to 60% equity capitalization ratio, inclusive of short-term debt. This financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings-per-share guidance through fiscal '26. In October, we completed a $600 million 30-year senior note issuance with a coupon of 2.85% after factoring in a favorable settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps, the effective rate on this issuance is 2.58%, and our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 19 years, excluding the $2.2 billion of incremental winter storm financing.  Finally, as I previously mentioned, we have hedged a substantial portion of our anticipated long-term debt needs to mitigate interest rate risk. From an equity perspective, utilizing our ATM program continues to be our preferred method for raising equity. As I mentioned earlier, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal '21 will satisfy a significant portion of our expected equity needs for fiscal '22. we expect to rage our remaining fiscal '22 equity needs through our ATM program. Regarding Securitization, we have made substantial progress in the last few months. Yesterday, the Bureau Commission of Texas unanimously issued a final determination of regulatory asset that will be securitized under the Statewide program.  The final order stipulated that all of our gas and storage costs are prudently incurred and are fully recoverable. The next step is for the Railroad Commission to issue a financing order. Following the issuance of the financing order, the Texas Public Financing Authority has up to 180 days to complete the securitization transaction. Upon receipt of the securitization funds, we will repay the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing we issued last March. In Kansas, we filed our Securitization application in mid-September. We are currently responding to various questions, and a procedural schedule has been set, with all proceedings expected to begin in January.  Finally, annual filing mechanisms with the primary means to which we'd recover capital spending. These mechanisms enable us to more efficiently deploy our capital spend, and generate returns necessary to attract the capital we made to finance our investments, and these mechanisms produce a smaller impact to customer bills while providing the regular rate adjustments that support our system modernization efforts. We have assumed no material changes these mechanisms to fiscal '26. In fiscal '22, we anticipate completing filings for $215 million to $225 million in annualized regulatory outcomes that will impact fiscal years, '22 and '23.  The execution of this plan to modernize our system to disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms, and balanced long-term financing, all supports our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends in the 6 to 8% range annually through fiscal 2026, and as you can see on Slide 25. The execution of this plan will also keep customer bills affordable and it help us sustain this plan for the long term. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin? Good morning, Kody. Kody, I\u2019ll add\u2026 Hey, Steve. Go ahead, Kevin. Well, I don't foresee anything that could impact us at this point, those are averages as you know, that we put out there, we continue to look for diversification across our pipes as you heard us mentioned earlier, we're across 37 pipelines, multiple basins. So we tried to blend in as much diversification and flexibility as we can within our systems. We have these annual mechanisms that tend to level out, increases over time, and I think for conservative on those gold bars there on 25, as you've heard us say before, we're looking way out into the future on some of those prices, and as outlook today, while hard at cash basis is $3.98 Katy to $4.40 and I believe the non-Maxx is at $4.91 today.  So I think again, with the great work, our gas supply team does, where our assets are located on multiple pipes, availability of storage, that sort of thing, we're in a really good position. Chris, anything you want to add? Yes, I'd say, too as we saw about what could potentially move the needle in terms of pricing, and it's again, it's weather patterns. It sums in the pricing dynamics that Kevin just described. Also, just customer usage and to all that's very, very difficult to predict and trying to estimate or come up with a true impact, and again, with an 8-state footprint that covers a fairly significant geographical difference that you could have weather patterns that impact the eastern portion of the U.S. that are completely there from Texas and what we might experience in Colorado.  So really, it's, I think, pretty challenging for us to say across the 8-state footprint if there is a trade key driver to watch out for. I think it's going to be a combination of all of the items you just mentioned; pricing, the basins that we have access to. They're very highly liquid basins. So we were able to have a good keen eye on what that pricing situation customer usage, as well as just general weather patterns. It's a challenge for us because we don't have the holding Company structure like many of our peers do. So when you look at each of our divisions or each of our states, that's all under one corporate umbrella. So we can't do a minority sale for a single jurisdiction. The way we're structured today, it would have to be a partial assets sale or a certain geographic region that we would have to exit, and as you heard Kevin talk earlier with Kody, we're very happy with the assets that we have, the jurisdiction footprints.  We do see the dislocation between what the private market is a place of evaluation on versus what we're seeing from the public traded perspective and we think again to the public and trade perspective, the fact that 97% of our asset base is located in jurisdictions that are supportive of natural gas, both from a policy perspective, the regulatory perspective, the fact that we have very strong customer growth is currently being a little bit underappreciated, and that's where we just need to continue to remind those investors that we are very well-positioned in the country to capture the growth experienced in our jurisdictions and have jurisdictions that have strong support natural gas. Good morning. Key pluses or minuses obviously will be the execution of the regulatory strategy. Customer usage patterns, whether although we are [Indiscernible] normalized, 97% of our jurisdictions, we can see a little bit of that weather year-over-year, and just timing of O&M spending as we continue our ongoing system safety and compliance work, those are the key drivers that we generally point to when we're talking about where we can fall within the 6% to 8% range. Sure. It's the ongoing expansion of our compliance work. You've heard us talk before that we're in a mode now, doing more compliance work every year rather than holding back and waiting for another rate case to occur. So as we continue to look at the rule making that's happening at the federal and the state level, we work to try to get ahead of that, so that when it comes time for a compliance deadline to have met, we're getting there. Well in advance on when that deadline is and we're also just looking at the system needs and what we want to be doing from a safety perspective. So when talked about advanced leak detection technologies and further expanding that across our footprint, as well as just ongoing hydrotesting at inline inspection work on our large-scale distribution in some of transmission lines to make sure that better system is operating as safely as it possibly can."

Last night, we reported fiscal 2021 third quarter net income of $102 million or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to adjusted earnings of $97 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $617 million or $4.77 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $515 million or $4.20 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings in both prior year periods excluded $21 million or $0.17 non-cash income tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 [led] [Ph] to the enactment of new tax legislation in Kansas. Our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects the continued execution of our strategy, and was in line with our expectations outlined in our last quarterly call. Additionally, our results for the nine-months, ended June 30, continue to reflect the impact of refunding excess deferred tax liabilities to our customers. As a reminder, last quarter, we received authorization to refund excess deferred tax liabilities to APT's customers, and distribution customers in Tennessee over a three-year period. During the third quarter, and in July, we received authorization to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities to distribution customers in Louisiana, Virginia, and for certain of our customers in our West Texas division over a three-year period. The refund of excess deferred taxes is recognized as reduction in revenue, and a reduction to income tax expense. However, there is a timing difference between the recognition of the income tax benefit, which is recognized in our annual effective tax rate when the regulatory orders are approved, and the corresponding reduction in revenue which is recognized over time as it is billed to customers. This timing difference resulted in a $0.06 benefit during the nine-months ended June 30. We anticipate that most of this timing difference will reverse during the fourth quarter. Taking a closer look at the performance, consolidated operating income increased about 13%, to $814 million, during the nine months ending June 30. Slides four and five summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both our operating segments totaled $170 million. Customer growth in our Distribution segment contributed an incremental $15 million as we are continuing to benefit from strong population growth in virtually all of our service territories. New customer connections increased 1.68% over the last 12 months, and net customer growth over the same period was 1.82%. Sales volumes for commercial customers continue to trend in a favorable direction. Third quarter sales volumes increased 25% over the prior year quarter, and were consistent with what we experienced before the pandemic. Year-over-year, commercial sales volumes were 6% higher. We experienced an $8.5 million decline in service order revenues in our Distribution segment primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities and waiver of our customer service fees for disconnections and reconnections. Additionally, our bad debt expense has increased about $22 million year-over-year. We even focused on keeping our customers connected to our system by offering more flexible payment arrangements, and helping our customers find financial assistance to help with their bills. During the third quarter, we resumed collection activities, focusing first on the largest past-due balances, which are typically the oldest. Additionally, we continue to remain in close contact with our regulators about our customer outreach efforts. And we believe this bad debt expense will be recovered over time. Consolidated O&M expense excluding bad debt increased $8 million year-over-year, and $22 million quarter-over-quarter as we increased pipeline maintenance activities in each of our segments and in-line inspection work at APT. Additionally, we experienced a 12.5% quarter-over-quarter increase in line locate requests as a result of increased economic activity and the effects of our third-party damage prevention efforts. The O&M spending we experienced during the third quarter was in line with our expectations we outlined during the second quarter call is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. Consolidated capital spending decreased 3% to $1.36 billion, with 80% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability to modernize our system. The slight year-over-year decrease primarily reflects timing of spending in our distribution segment. We remain on track to spend $2 billion to $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year to modernize our distribution and transmission network to further enhance its safety and reliability while reducing methane emissions. From regulatory perspective, we've completed all the filings that will impact fiscal 2021. We are now focused on filings that will impact fiscal '22. To date, we've completed $186 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. As a reminder, many of these regulatory outcomes reflect the lower revenues due to the refund of access to deferred tax liabilities. However, this amount does not include the corresponding reduction in income tax expense. And we currently have about $53 million in progress, most of which it's expected to be implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Slides 13 through 28 provide additional details. From a financing perspective, the third quarter was relatively quiet. During the quarter, we executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM program for approximately [1 million] [Ph] shares for $100 million. As of June 30, we had approximately $213 million in net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements. We have now priced all of our fiscal 2021 equity needs as well as a portion of our fiscal 2022 equity names. As we said before, using our ATM equity sales program is our preferred method to meet our plant equity needs. During the third quarter, we issued a new $5 million self-registration statement and a new $1 billion ATM equity sales program. The new shelf in ATM program positions us well to meet our future financing needs while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. Securitization is also another tool that will help preserve the strength of our balance sheet. On June 16, Governor Abbott signed HB 1520 Texas Statewide Securitization Program to address the extraordinary gas costs incurred by natural gas utilities during winter storm hearing. Last week, we filed our application to participate in the program seeking to recover $2 billion. We are currently awaiting a formal procedure schedule from the Texas Railroad Commission. We are also making progress with our securitization application in Kansas, anticipate making a filing before the end of the fiscal year. As of June 30, our equity capitalization was 60.2% excluding the $2.2 billion of storm-related financing issued during the second quarter. And we finished the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion of liquidity. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found in slides seven through 10. Yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. Based on our third quarter performance and what we were anticipating for the fourth quarter, we continue to believe earnings per share will be at the upper end of this range. We anticipate the fourth quarter activities will mirror what we experienced during the third quarter with sales volumes consistent with seasonal norms and O&M spending that we'll be continuing to focus on system maintenance and compliance. Slides 11 through 12 provide additional details around our guidance. Thank you for your time today. And I'll now turn the call over to Kevin or his closing remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. I appreciate that financial update for everybody. Over the last year, we have highlighted the progress we are making in the five key areas of our environmental strategy, which is focused on reducing our carbon footprint and environmental impact in areas of gas supply operations, fleet facilities, and customers. One element of the strategy has been to evaluate opportunities to expand the amount of RNG re-transport across our system to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. During the third quarter, our largest RNG suppliers announced plans to expand and modernize their facilities beginning in early calendar 2022. Once completed their RNG production is expected to grow by approximately one BCF a year. Additionally, an RNG location here in the Dallas Fort Worth area recently indicated they will soon have the ability to add approximately one BCF a year in RNG transport to our system. So currently we have almost seven BCF of RNG on our system. And once these new projects are fully online, we anticipate this to increase to approximately nine BCF or 3% of our distribution sales volumes. I am extremely proud of our gas supply and marketing teams for their continued effort and work to grow opportunities for Atmos Energy customers to utilize RNG. In support of our environmental strategy, we recently joined the low carbon resource initiative in June. This initiative currently has over 45 member companies participating in their five-year initiative to bring industry stakeholders together to accelerate the development and demonstration of low and zero carbon energy technologies through clean energy research and development. We're proud to be a sponsor of the low carbon research initiative, and has worked to identify cost effective, reliable and diverse solutions on the path to a clean energy future. Alongside our goal reducing methane emissions by 50% from 2017 to 2035, and our demonstrated investment in technologies like renewable natural gas and combined heat and power supporting the low carbon research initiative further reinforces our commitment to the environment through a global platform of collaboration and innovation. And as you just heard, the continued successful execution of our strategy and our strong balance sheet position have us well-positioned to continue safely delivering reliable, affordable, efficient, and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses, and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. We'll take this closing opportunity to thank all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees for their exceptional dedication and commitment, providing safe and reliable natural gas service to a 1400 communities and 3.2 million customers. Their efforts continue to be recognized by our customers with an outstanding satisfaction rating for our agents, as well as our service technicians in excess of 98% job well done. I will now turn the call back over to Dan and open it up for questions.\nOperator: At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. My first question, maybe for Chris, just on the financials, great year-to-date results, the upper end of guidance you reiterated, I think that's great. I think when we think about the timing of the asset, refunds, that'll get screwed up in the fourth quarter, even excluding that, it seems like the way that your run rate is, you could potentially have a result in 2021 that's better than that high-end. Just trying to think about as you prepare for 2022, are there certain things like [indiscernible] O&M into 2021 or other items that you're doing to increase the flexibility as you try to achieve another good year in 2022?\nChris Forsythe: Yes. So, Insoo, so really 2022, we're still working through that right now. So, I'm not really going to comment on that today, but we'll update everybody on that coming November. But again, what we're trying to accomplish right now for 2021 is to focus on the system maintenance, some of the which we were able to safely defer over the last first six months of the fiscal year, as you waited to see what our customer counts are going to do in commercial sales volumes and so on and so forth. So, really the focus right now is to kind of get back to a more normalized O&M run rate. As we see now, that's the pandemic at least at this moment isn't impacting our top line revenues in a material way and remain focused on that, that system maintenance that's in the inline inspection work. Again, we're also saying a lot of economic activity, which is driving the line locates. And as I mentioned we had 12.5% quarter-over-quarter increase. We're up 10% year-over-year. So it's a busy time right now, certainly here in the Dallas Fort Worth area and our focus will be to continue to executing on the strategy as we get to the end of the fiscal year.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. That makes sense. Definitely appreciate all the fluidity here as we continue to move through this crazy environment. Second question and for Kevin, you mentioned on the growth in the flow through of our junior system. We were just talking with another company where Minnesota, they passed legislation there that could potentially give seems like the gas utilities the way to increase investment in RNG while getting some type of regulated rate of return. Although I think there's still some negotiations that need to be had on exactly that process. I think our conversations in the past pointed to in your jurisdictions; you continue to have conversations with the various stakeholders on advancing something like that. Are there any updates that are any progress that you've made on that front for your states?\nKevin Akers: It's pretty much the same story. Insoo, I appreciate the question. We continue to talk to all key stakeholders about these opportunities. As you've seen here, we talked about the increases that we just recently observed on our system. We continue to share with them the opportunities we're seeing out there. And we continue to work with our legislators and regulators in Colorado as they're probably the closest to most on putting legislation on the books right now. So I think for us, this fits nicely into our, as I said earlier on our overall environmental strategy and the focus areas that we'll have, we'll keep an eye on these projects as they come to fruition. We'll certainly share those with our regulators and legislators and keep them abreast of the opportunities, but for now that that's been our focus and making sure we get those opportunities available to customers across our system.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. That's all I had. Thank you so much.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is with Ryan Levine with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. I was hoping that you'd be able to speak to if you're seeing any disruptions in your suppliers around high density polyethylene and how that may impact your business?\nKevin Akers: Ryan short answer is no. At this point, our procurement team does an exceptional job of working with multiple suppliers and vendors, as well as our operations units to make sure we stay ahead of projects, that that's part of our risk management profiles to lay these projects out in front early. So we know what our materials needs are going to be. And then our procurement team goes to work in laying those out, having them stay so we can have access to that material when it's needed. And we also try to keep a significant amount of supply on hand and ready as well. So I think at this point, we're in really good shape. I just checked with our procurement. It's a timely question, checked with our procurement team last week, and I feel like we are in pretty good shape. I know there is some issues around the semiconductor and technology side across the world right now, but we are not seeing any constraints or issues on our supply.\nRyan Levine: If the disruption in the industry were to persist, is there a point in time when it could be more impactful for your outlook?\nKevin Akers: I'm not going to speculate Ryan on what could be out there. As I said, we're not seeing or having any supply issues on any material at this point. So, we continue to be in really good shape. And as far as an IT perspective, our team there said they have all the equipment that they need at this point, and we're in good shape going forward.\nRyan Levine: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back over to Dan Meziere for closing remarks.\nDan Meziere: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. And thank you again for joining us. Recording of this call will be available for replay on our website through September 30, 2021. Have a good day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn the call over to Chris, I wanted to comment on the NTSB preliminary report issued Monday, regarding a worksite accident that occurred in Farmersville, Texas, on June 28. I want to begin by thanking the first responders and emergency responders for their support and assistance. As indicated in the report, parties to the investigation include the Railroad Commission of Texas, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Collin County, and the City of Farmersville Law Enforcement, Bobcat Contracting, Fesco, and Atmos Energy. All parties to the investigation are working closely with the NTSB to help determine causal factors at this time. As a party to the investigation, we cannot provide any additional comments on this matter, and we're not going to comment on any pending litigation. Finally and most importantly, I want to say that our hearts, out thoughts, and our prayers have been and will continue to be with those that were injured and the families of the deceased.

            "name": "Chris Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Last night, we reported fiscal 2021 third quarter net income of $102 million or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to adjusted earnings of $97 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $617 million or $4.77 per diluted share, compared with adjusted earnings of $515 million or $4.20 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted earnings in both prior year periods excluded $21 million or $0.17 non-cash income tax benefit recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 [led] [Ph] to the enactment of new tax legislation in Kansas. Our third quarter and year-to-date performance reflects the continued execution of our strategy, and was in line with our expectations outlined in our last quarterly call. Additionally, our results for the nine-months, ended June 30, continue to reflect the impact of refunding excess deferred tax liabilities to our customers. As a reminder, last quarter, we received authorization to refund excess deferred tax liabilities to APT's customers, and distribution customers in Tennessee over a three-year period. During the third quarter, and in July, we received authorization to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities to distribution customers in Louisiana, Virginia, and for certain of our customers in our West Texas division over a three-year period. The refund of excess deferred taxes is recognized as reduction in revenue, and a reduction to income tax expense. However, there is a timing difference between the recognition of the income tax benefit, which is recognized in our annual effective tax rate when the regulatory orders are approved, and the corresponding reduction in revenue which is recognized over time as it is billed to customers. This timing difference resulted in a $0.06 benefit during the nine-months ended June 30. We anticipate that most of this timing difference will reverse during the fourth quarter. Taking a closer look at the performance, consolidated operating income increased about 13%, to $814 million, during the nine months ending June 30. Slides four and five summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both our operating segments totaled $170 million. Customer growth in our Distribution segment contributed an incremental $15 million as we are continuing to benefit from strong population growth in virtually all of our service territories. New customer connections increased 1.68% over the last 12 months, and net customer growth over the same period was 1.82%. Sales volumes for commercial customers continue to trend in a favorable direction. Third quarter sales volumes increased 25% over the prior year quarter, and were consistent with what we experienced before the pandemic. Year-over-year, commercial sales volumes were 6% higher. We experienced an $8.5 million decline in service order revenues in our Distribution segment primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities and waiver of our customer service fees for disconnections and reconnections. Additionally, our bad debt expense has increased about $22 million year-over-year. We even focused on keeping our customers connected to our system by offering more flexible payment arrangements, and helping our customers find financial assistance to help with their bills. During the third quarter, we resumed collection activities, focusing first on the largest past-due balances, which are typically the oldest. Additionally, we continue to remain in close contact with our regulators about our customer outreach efforts. And we believe this bad debt expense will be recovered over time. Consolidated O&M expense excluding bad debt increased $8 million year-over-year, and $22 million quarter-over-quarter as we increased pipeline maintenance activities in each of our segments and in-line inspection work at APT. Additionally, we experienced a 12.5% quarter-over-quarter increase in line locate requests as a result of increased economic activity and the effects of our third-party damage prevention efforts. The O&M spending we experienced during the third quarter was in line with our expectations we outlined during the second quarter call is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. Consolidated capital spending decreased 3% to $1.36 billion, with 80% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability to modernize our system. The slight year-over-year decrease primarily reflects timing of spending in our distribution segment. We remain on track to spend $2 billion to $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year to modernize our distribution and transmission network to further enhance its safety and reliability while reducing methane emissions.

And we finished the quarter with approximately $3.2 billion of liquidity. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found in slides seven through 10. Yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. Based on our third quarter performance and what we were anticipating for the fourth quarter, we continue to believe earnings per share will be at the upper end of this range. We anticipate the fourth quarter activities will mirror what we experienced during the third quarter with sales volumes consistent with seasonal norms and O&M spending that we'll be continuing to focus on system maintenance and compliance. Slides 11 through 12 provide additional details around our guidance. Thank you for your time today. And I'll now turn the call over to Kevin or his closing remarks. Kevin? Yes.

With that, I will turn the call over to our President and CEO, Kevin Akers. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your continued interest in Atmos Energy. During this quarter we continued to successfully execute our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. This strategy along with the exceptional dedication and effort of all 4,700 employees at Atmos Energy continue to benefit our customers in the form of safe and reliable natural gas service. This was clear during Winter Storm Uri as the modernization of our systems especially over the last 10 years provided the reliability necessary to meet the human needs requirements of our customers. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our gas supply and gas control teams and the many operations, transmission and underground storage employees that dedicated countless hours to keeping natural gas safely flowing during Winter Storm Uri. The winter storm certainly highlighted the importance that reliable natural gas systems, diversified supply portfolios, system versatility along with underground storage capacity bring to delivering safe and reliable natural gas service. As an example of system modernization and reliability, I want to highlight our third Atmos pipeline storage salt-dome project. This project nearing 50% completion will provide an additional five to six Bcf of cavern storage capacity when in full service late 2022 or early 223. This new cavern will provide us the continued capability to meet the growing demand in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex, as well as allow it us to safely perform the required regulatory compliance work, while meeting the current needs of our customers. Additionally, APT has started our Line S-2 replacement project that will create an enhanced supply hub to the east of the growing Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex and bring additional supply in from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays. We anticipate this 36-inch 90-mile project to be completed in three phases with the final phase being complete in 2023. The storm once again highlighted the strength of our balance sheet. After incurring unprecedented gas costs during the storm, we were able to quickly finance these purchases with the issuance of $2.2 billion in long-term debt for an all-in debt cost of 83.4 basis points. This financing is structured to provide us flexibility as we work with our regulators to recover these costs. In Kansas and Texas where we incurred most of our extraordinary gas costs, new legislation was introduced to minimize the impact on the customer bill by extending the recovery periods for these unprecedented costs through securitization. The legislation in Kansas was signed into law on April 9, and allows utilities to file for the permission from commission to securitize these costs for a period of up to 32 years. In Texas, the legislature is considering a statewide securitization program. Under this program, natural gas utilities would have the opportunity to apply to the Railroad Commission to have their extraordinary costs securitized by the Texas Public Financing Authority and to use the net proceeds to pay off the debt they incurred to finance these natural gas purchases. This legislation has been passed by the house and is currently being considered in the Senate. In our remaining states, we anticipate recovering gas costs through our normal purchase gas cost mechanisms over a 12 to 18-month time frame. I am very proud of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees in the work they do every day to provide safe and reliable natural gas service to our 1,400 communities and 3.2 million customers. Their dedication and commitment have Atmos Energy well positioned for success in the second half of the fiscal year. I will now turn the call over to Chris, for an update on our financial performance. Chris?\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. Last night, we reported fiscal 2021 second quarter net income of $297 million, or $2.30 per share, compared to $240 million or $1.95 per share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date earnings were $514 million, or $4.01 per share, compared with earnings of $418 million, or $3.42 per share in the prior year period. Our second quarter and year-to-date performance largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending, customer growth in our distribution segment, lower O&M spending and a reduction in our annual effective tax rate. During the second quarter, APT began refunding $107 million in excess deferred tax liabilities to its customers over a three-year period. Additionally, in Tennessee, we began refunding $17 million in excess deferred taxes over a three-year period. As a reminder, these refunds result in a reduction to revenue and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to our net income. Since these excess deferred taxes were approved during the second quarter, we adjusted our annual effective tax rate to reflect the lower tax expense that we will realize this fiscal year. The application of this lower annual effective tax rate to our results for six months ended March 31, resulted in an $0.11 benefit during the second quarter. However, we can only recognize the associated reduction in revenue, as it is built over the last six months of the fiscal year. Therefore, this $0.11 benefit will be fully offset during the third and fourth quarters, as we build those lower revenues. Consolidated operating income, increased about 17% to $681 million during the six months ended March 31. Slides four and five summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both of our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, totaled $130 million. Customer growth in our distribution segment contributed an incremental $11 million, as we continue to benefit from strong population growth in several of our service areas. For the 12 months ended March 31, we experienced 1.87% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.61% net growth across our eight-state footprint. We experienced an $8 million decline in service order revenues in our distribution segment, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities. Additionally, our provision for bad debt expense increased almost $9 million in our distribution segment, compared to the same period last year. This combined $17 million decrease, represented the most significant impact to our financial performance through the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. Our commercial sales volumes have turned significantly better than our expectations since the start of the fiscal year. After 15% period-over-period decrease in sales volumes during the first quarter, commercial sales volumes increased 16% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year and were about 2% higher year-over-year. While some of this increase is attributed to the significantly colder weather experienced during the second quarter, commercial sales volumes have trended less than 5% below the two-year weather-normalized average, which much of that -- much of that decrease experienced during the first fiscal quarter. Throughout the second quarter, we have noted steady improvement as economic activity has started to pick up. Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt expense, decreased $14 million. O&M in our distribution segment was about $6 million lower than the prior year, primarily reflecting lower travel costs. O&M in our pipeline and storage setting was approximately $8 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to the completion of some nonrecurring well integrity work in the prior year period and conservative O&M management, as we evaluated how our revenues would materialize over the first six months of the fiscal year. Consolidated capital spending decreased 15% to $846 million, with 87% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending. The decrease largely reflects the timing of spending in our distribution segment. We remain on track to spend $2 billion to $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year, to further enhance the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission network, while reducing methane emissions. We continue to execute our well-established regulatory strategy, focused on annual filing mechanisms, which mitigate the incremental impact to customer bills, while reducing lag. To-date, we have implemented $110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. And we have currently about $145 million in progress. Slides 27 and 28 summarize the key attributes for these outcomes. And slide 17 summarizes our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year. Due to the historic nature of Winter Storm Uri, we experienced unforeseen -- unforeseeable and unprecedented market pricing for gas costs, which resulted in aggregated natural gas purchases during the month of February of approximately $2.3 billion. To help pay for these costs, we completed $2.2 billion of long-term debt financing in March. As a reminder, gas costs are a pass-through cost and recover in all of our jurisdictions. However, in Kansas and Texas, due to the size of the costs incurred, our regulators issued orders, authorizing natural gas utilities to record regulatory assets to account for the extraordinary costs associated with the storm. As of March 31, we have recorded a $2.1 billion regulatory asset with approximately $2 billion recorded in Texas and approximately $77 million recorded in Kansas. As Kevin mentioned, we have the ability to securitize these costs in Kansas and we are carefully monitoring the proposed statewide securitization legislation in Texas.  We also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 2.5 million shares for $239 million. And we settled forward agreements on 4.5 million shares for approximately $461 million of net proceeds. As of March 31st, we have approximately $116 million in net proceeds available under existing forward sale agreements and we have about $313 million available for issuance under the ATM program. We intend to satisfy our remaining fiscal 2021 equity needs through our ATM program.  As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization excluding the $2.2 billion of storm-related financing issued during the second quarter was 60.4% as of March 31st and we finished the quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of liquidity. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on slide 7 to 10. Yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. As a reminder, approximately 70% of our distribution revenues are earned through the first six months of the fiscal year. And substantially, all of our pipeline storage and other segments revenues are earned under a straight fixed variable rate design. Now that the winter season -- winter heating season is over, we have more clarity around our revenues for the remainder of the fiscal year and we believe fiscal 2021 earnings per share will be at the upper end of our guidance range.  We anticipate our sales volumes to be consistent with what we typically experience during the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate that our service order revenues will frank consistently with the first six months of the fiscal year. We've also reflected in this guidance the decrease in revenue over the last six months in the fiscal year as we refund excess deferred taxes to our customers and we have updated our income tax expense guidance range to reflect the impact of these refunds.  Finally, we anticipate that O&M will increase modestly during the second half of the fiscal year and be in line with our original O&M guidance range. We continue to meet all of our compliance requirements and we will begin to address some of the system maintenance work we were able to safely delay during the first half of the fiscal year. Slides 11 and 12 provide additional details around our guidance. Thank you for your time today. And I will now turn it back over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Akers : Thank you, Chris. I appreciate that financial update. As you heard we continue to be focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy and remain on track to meet our fiscal 2021 targets. As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to execute on our strategy that supports our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services. During our last two quarterly calls, I've shared the progress we are making to minimize our carbon footprint as well as our water and land impact at some of our offices and service centers, including the work we are doing to increase the amount of RNG we have on our system today and to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. To date, we are evaluating approximately 30 RNG projects across our systems. As a reminder, our environmental strategy is focused on five key areas: gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. Today, I want to highlight how Atmos Energy is working to reduce methane emissions as we modernize our business and infrastructure by investing in innovation and technology. The following examples of how Atmos Energy will meet our goal to reduce methane emissions 50% by 2035 as well as how we are helping customers understand the role that natural gas plays in reducing their carbon footprint at home in an affordable manner. We recently installed a new methane monitoring technology at our Tri-Cities underground storage facility called gas cloud imaging camera. This 360-degree fixed base camera will continuously monitor our compression and storage field assets for methane emissions. And if necessary the technology will send alerts including pop-up alerts with images to our plant operations employees in addition to text and e-mail alerts.  In addition to our existing methane monitoring and detection equipment, we are finalizing plans to deploy fixed base and mobile technologies throughout our underground storage operations. Additionally, we are in the process of installing a fuel cell to generate low-carbon electricity at one of our facilities. The fuel cell will be powered with natural gas and is anticipated to substantially reduce the carbon footprint for that facility. We anticipate the fuel cell will be operational by the end of this calendar year.  With affordability and community support always top of mind for us, our Colorado team partnered with the Greeley-Weld County Habitat for Humanity Group to build a zero-net energy home for a local family. This will be the first of its kind for local habitat homes. This home is designed to receive a home energy rating system score of zero, which means the home produces the same amount of energy it consumes over the course of the year by using efficient natural gas appliances, better insulation and solar technology.  The total utility cost for this home is anticipated to be approximately $350 per year, which is expected to provide about $2000 in annual utility bill savings relative to the average US home. This solution is significantly less expensive than an all-electric home. We are also working with builders in two Texas locations to design homes that are expected to yield similar environmental results. Our employees put their heart, sole and time and energy into projects like these every day to modernize our system, to do our part to protect and preserve our environment for generations to come and to support the communities where they live and work. I'm very humbled by their compassion and commitment to be good neighbors. Providing this family with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost-efficient is just one way Atmos Energy fuels safe and thriving communities. Last year legislation was designed to promote the use of all energy sources and maintain customer energy choice which we refer to as all fuels legislation was passed in Louisiana and Tennessee. During the second quarter, similar legislation was passed in Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi. And earlier this week, the Texas Senate passed HB 17 and it is now on its way to the Governor for signature. Assuming it is signed, six of our eight states will have passed all fuels legislation. The successful execution of our strategy and our financial position have us well positioned to continue safely delivering reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and well and into the future. I will now open up the call for questions. Dan, I'll turn it back over to you and the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is for Chris. For the quarter -- thank you for explaining part of what drove that year-over-year increase. It seems like there was a timing of the asset lower tax rate, but that's going to be trued up by the end of the year with no yearly impact. But even without that it seems like it was a relatively strong quarter versus what we had expected at least. Could you just describe how much of that increase was largely expected by you, or how much was just an additional benefit whether it's from rates or non-weather normal volumes? And guiding -- reiterating your guidance, are you positioned pretty well at least at that midpoint at this point?\nChris Forsythe: Sure, Insoo. And good morning. So yeah, so a couple of things. I mean, the regulatory outcomes were pretty much in line with our expectations, primarily because that reflects the capital spending that we did in the prior fiscal year. So when we made those filings up late last year, they carry over into this year. So we had pretty good visibility into those outcomes. I would -- you noted the temporary timing difference around the update to the annual effective tax rate which will unwind by the end of the year. And then also two we were very conservative on the O&M spending in the first half of the fiscal year as we were able to kind of just take a wait-and-see approach with respect to how our commercial customers in particular would behave during the pandemic. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the performance there has been better than what we anticipated. So we did hold back some of the spending on the O&M side until we had a better sense where those revenues will begin to materialize. And now that we're out of the winter heating season and focused on the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we'll be modestly increasing that O&M spend. And given the momentum that we see with the regulatory outcomes, the commercial sales volumes beginning to trend in the right direction, as economic activity picks up and the fact that we'll do some modest increases on O&M spending, we feel confident that we'll be at the upper end of the range by the end of the fiscal year.\nInsoo Kim: Okay. So upper -- okay. Got it. That's definitely helpful. Kevin maybe a broader strategic question then coming off of I think one of another utilities recently announced sale of a couple of their utilities, gas utilities at pretty impressive valuations. We've asked you with a strategic question on M&A before and obviously there -- you've talked about how there's robust organic opportunities at most of your jurisdictions. So I definitely appreciate that. But how do you balance I guess the valuation that the market is seemingly assigning given the recent transaction versus the ongoing financing needs you have? And at a certain point, does it make sense to potentially weigh those two to see what the ultimate portfolio mix would be ideal for Atmos?\nKevin Akers: No. Good morning. I appreciate your question. Let's just start with the transaction that you're talking about there and discussion around our assets. And again, as you heard Chris go through the financial updates, the performance for year-to-date, our historical performance, we remain very happy with our asset mix our regulatory construct. And again, Insoo as you know, we began to earn 90% of our investment in the first six months and 99% after 12 months. And we've talked about how that story is very simple, very straightforward easy for our folks investors all stakeholders to understand. And there are complications with these acquisitions as we go forward. That's why we like our plan that we have laid out today the performance that our divisions execute on day in and day out. But I think this transaction sends a very strong signal right to the market. In our opinion, it sends a very strong about the value of natural gas that it brings, particularly meeting the energy needs on a go-forward basis, the value of these assets that have been somewhat questioned over time, but are now should be coming into clear focus. So I think it sends a very strong signal to everybody about the role that natural gas is playing continue to play going forward and the value of this infrastructure out there for the reliability, the certainty the affordability that natural gas brings. So very happy to see that have occurred, but remain very, very happy and positive with our regulatory construct and performance of our assets.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. Thank you so much.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nStephen Byrd: Hey, good morning. Congrats on continued great performance.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nStephen Byrd: I wanted to just discuss renewable natural gas a little bit more and maybe just at a high level get your thoughts on the kind of the overall magnitude of that potential in the longer term away from kind of very near term just thinking through, how meaningful that might be? I know it's a broad question. Just interested in your longer-term take on that.\nKevin Akers: Yeah. I think as you've heard us say we continue to grow the number of projects that we have out there under evaluation. We're up to 30 now, and it's a mixture of dairy as well as landfill gas. We've got a combination of those things we're looking at now. We're doing about 5.5 to 6 piece a year. That's a little north of the 2% range I think when you compare that to about the average distribution sales volumes that we move across our system on an annual basis. I think we'll continue to see these projects come up and with the help of some of these energy firms that are out there I think we'll continue to see a good opportunity to bring them on our system. But right now to hang a number on it I think it's still a little bit early. As I said, we're at the 2% of our overall distribution sales throughput volumes. I think there's opportunity there for us. But until we can get in, and see what infrastructure may be required how near are our systems they are is that going to require pipe, or what's required on the other side of that through digesters, processing equipment those sort of things. I think it's still a little bit premature on our side to try and hang a target or a number out there, where this could be, but we remain very optimistic about the opportunities that continue to come up.\nStephen Byrd: No, that's fair. Great. And then maybe just \u2013 I wanted to dig in a little bit more on Texas and lessons learned from the winter storm. You all gave a very good and very thorough update on sort of everything going on in Texas. Again, kind of a longer-term question. Just interested in your take on sort of other changes that you see that would be needed in Texas whether that's operational changes, changes to contract structure? Just other things on your mind longer-term to ensure kind of we don't have a repeat of what happened in Texas?\nKevin Akers: No good question. And I think our team, as you heard me say, I mentioned our gas supplier our gas control groups they're continuing to go through and evaluate things that occurred throughout that 12 to 14 day period there. How we can improve our system things we can put on our system to monitor that additional supply diversification that we can maybe bring on to our systems. So that's continuing to go on. But really those are things we do each year. And I think one of the strengths as I pointed out in my earlier remarks for us is our planning process. Those projects, I mentioned are already in our five-year plan have been in our five-year plan to allow us to continue to fortify grow and think about where those next challenges could be. Just for example, again the storage piece of that. So as we develop those salt cabins we're not only thinking about past performance we're thinking about growth on the system as well. And other places to fortify are, whether it's APT infrastructure or distribution systems as well. So I think the ongoing evaluation of that performance continues, but I'm very proud of how our system performed through that and we'll look for whether it's technology solutions, or supply diversification again to help us through that. And the last thing, I'll mention on that is around that supply diversification. You look at I'll just use our APT asset as an example here. When that supply stopped flowing coming in from the West from the Permian there, we were able through the network that we've been building and fortifying and enforcing over the last 10 years to pull from the North out of the Barnett out of Oklahoma, we fortified that with additional supplies coming out of Carthage from East. We had our fortifications in place, where we could pull from Katy up from the South. All of those points helped us get through that situation during that storm and we needed all of those and that versatility in the system to be able to pull that and pull it at those levels as well as the many suppliers that we have across those areas to be able to bring those into those points, so I'm very proud of how we performed during that period and how our system continues to provide very many options for us going forward.\nStephen Byrd: That\u2019s really great color. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is now live.\nRyan Levine: Hi everybody. In terms of the salt-dome storage project that you highlighted in the Dallas region, could you speak to what additional development opportunities you have on salt-dome storage within your footprint more broadly?\nKevin Akers: Well, in our footprint salt-dome is here in Texas. This is our third cabin here in Texas. Those are behind the APT system to meet the demands of its customer base, its firm needs there for human needs customers here, on the Mid-Tex system. So our other storage fields, throughout our other properties are all traditional sandstone reservoirs. There are no salt-dome projects on or available in those other facilities. But we do have contract storage services, that we use through our interstate supply contracts and with third-party sources as well to supplement our peaking capacity needs. And some of that may potentially be salt. Right now, most of that is generally sandstone, reservoirs itself. So right now, we've taken as I said a good hard look at this third cabin development here. And see that being able to help us for the near to longer-term at this point.\nRyan Levine: Are there additional opportunities within your footprint on the salt-dome side, that you have the resource or commercial arrangements that you would be able to pursue, to the extent that it was needed?\nKevin Akers: No. Again, let's think about storage. Storage for us is there to supplement our peak day at our interstate capacity to meet those firm needs. And the only opportunity for salt right now, as I said is here in Texas. Our other opportunities are sandstone reservoirs. And those are near market, near our large customer bases. So we continue to use those other 15 fields to exactly do that. So the only salt-dome available is here in Texas and right now our third cavern development, that's the one we're focused on.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then, in terms of the financing plan, I appreciate the update around the securitization proceedings in the different service territories. To the extent, that the Senate and the Governor support the proposal in Texas, does that crystallize financing plans for 2021? And can you provide some color around, how you're currently thinking about your equity needs, in light of evolving regulatory decision-making?\nChris Forsythe: Yeah. I'll start, and Kevin, if you want to chime in as well? So yeah, if securitization does pass in Texas, it's our intent at this point to participate in that program which then would really I think crystallize, what we would do with the $2.2 billion that we executed in -- long-term debt that we executed in March. Kind of going forward, and when you think about our financing plan, setting aside, the $2.2 billion for a moment, we'll continue to finance our operations in a very balanced fashion using a mix of long-term debt and equity to finance our needs. So that, -- we don't anticipate that financing strategy to change. It's worked very well for us, over the last 10 years. And it's well understood by our regulators certainly the investment community. And we don't see that changing at this point.\nRyan Levine: So just a follow-up, to the extent that that were to happen, does that put off the table any additional equity financing needs beyond the forward agreements that -- and other programs you already have in place?\nChris Forsythe: Yeah. If we have the opportunity to participate in the securitization program in Texas, and then, have obviously the opportunity to securitize the cost in Kansas, we would anticipate that our financing program -- our financing strategy would be consistent with what we've done in the past.\nRyan Levine: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Your line is now live.\nCharles Fishman: Good morning. Kevin, assume the securitization passes, we're also seeing signs of inflation across the economy that people are concerned about, which will make it more difficult to control your O&M cost which you've certainly done a phenomenal job over the last years now, that certainly put some pressure on rates and create some headroom issue, because we obviously know it's important to keep rates at the general inflation or less. But does that put some pressure on 7% to 8% CapEx growth there? How do you think about that, because obviously that's the key to your earnings growth?\nKevin Akers: Yeah. Yeah. You broke-up there just a little bit. So let me see, if I can answer your question here. I think when you look at the supply right now the abundance of the supply, the pricing it's come back down to I think today, Waha was in the 250 range or so. You look at the growth across our system and our average bills right now are in that $49 to $50 rates absent what we've gone through this past winter obviously. But I think, given those supply pricing and given the growth we have on our system, the signals we can send on our annual mechanisms right now, I think, we're very comfortable with our costing and how we compare on a go-forward basis with that, as well as meeting our O&M and compliance needs. And again, you've heard me talk before about at our all-in cost right now, that again assuming that we get securitization spread out these costs on these abnormal winter pricing events here that at $5 to $5.50 right now, that equates to about $0.01 to $0.015 on a kilowatt rate. So, I think, we still remain very, very competitive out there compared to electric pricing on a go-forward basis for us as well.\nCharles Fishman: Yes. But as far as -- and I'm sorry I broke up. I'm putting myself off speaker here. I -- obviously, regulators look at the general level of rate increases. And will some of these costs that really aren't -- well inflation and higher interest rates not in your control, will that put some pressure on your CapEx growth, is what I was getting at the 7% to 8% annual growth rate that you've targeted over the next five years?\nKevin Akers: I'm not anticipating any pressure at this point on our CapEx program. Again, we've modeled a lot of things going forward into our five-year plan. We continue to monitor the need for our projects and can pull things forward or push some things back. So I think, right now, given the layout that we have for this year and the next few years going forward, I feel very comfortable with what we'll be able to execute upon.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. And if I might ask a second question. I was intrigued earlier this week, when the utility in Phoenix mentioned, they were very proud of the industrial growth going on in Phoenix and they said, it was second only to Dallas. And quite frankly that surprised me. I know, that's electric and we're talking gas here. But -- and industrials are a small percentage of your revenue. I think, I'm looking at slide 13, it looks like 2%. But are you seeing -- in this industrial growth, are you seeing higher gas demand specific to certain chemical industries or anything that might give you an extraordinary boost in revenues from the industrial sector going forward?\nKevin Akers: Not that I would say would equate to an extra boost, if you will. I think we see, certainly as the vaccines have started to roll out, the economy to your point has started to pick back up. Things are opening back up. We see some of our industrial customers across the eight states get back to what we would call pre-pandemic levels. Now some of them stayed at that because, they were associated with the specific needs of that whether the medical industry or metals industry, those sorts of things held steady throughout it. But those that kind of pulled back during that color period have now started to pick back up and hit at a normal pace. To your point, we continue to see new additions and expansions across our system. But I don't know that, I would categorize it at this point as an extra boost. We're very proud to see the growth from an economic and a utilization of natural gas standpoint. And it seems to be a good diversified industrial load from auto, to the distilling industry, to the metals industry, but we're very proud to see that, but nothing that's been unanticipated at this point.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.\nDan Meziere: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us. A recording of this call will be available for replay on our website through June 30 of 2021. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Akers",
            "content": "Thank you Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your continued interest in Atmos Energy. During this quarter we continued to successfully execute our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. This strategy along with the exceptional dedication and effort of all 4,700 employees at Atmos Energy continue to benefit our customers in the form of safe and reliable natural gas service. This was clear during Winter Storm Uri as the modernization of our systems especially over the last 10 years provided the reliability necessary to meet the human needs requirements of our customers. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our gas supply and gas control teams and the many operations, transmission and underground storage employees that dedicated countless hours to keeping natural gas safely flowing during Winter Storm Uri. The winter storm certainly highlighted the importance that reliable natural gas systems, diversified supply portfolios, system versatility along with underground storage capacity bring to delivering safe and reliable natural gas service. As an example of system modernization and reliability, I want to highlight our third Atmos pipeline storage salt-dome project. This project nearing 50% completion will provide an additional five to six Bcf of cavern storage capacity when in full service late 2022 or early 223. This new cavern will provide us the continued capability to meet the growing demand in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex, as well as allow it us to safely perform the required regulatory compliance work, while meeting the current needs of our customers. Additionally, APT has started our Line S-2 replacement project that will create an enhanced supply hub to the east of the growing Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex and bring additional supply in from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays. We anticipate this 36-inch 90-mile project to be completed in three phases with the final phase being complete in 2023. The storm once again highlighted the strength of our balance sheet. After incurring unprecedented gas costs during the storm, we were able to quickly finance these purchases with the issuance of $2.2 billion in long-term debt for an all-in debt cost of 83.4 basis points. This financing is structured to provide us flexibility as we work with our regulators to recover these costs. In Kansas and Texas where we incurred most of our extraordinary gas costs, new legislation was introduced to minimize the impact on the customer bill by extending the recovery periods for these unprecedented costs through securitization. The legislation in Kansas was signed into law on April 9, and allows utilities to file for the permission from commission to securitize these costs for a period of up to 32 years. In Texas, the legislature is considering a statewide securitization program. Under this program, natural gas utilities would have the opportunity to apply to the Railroad Commission to have their extraordinary costs securitized by the Texas Public Financing Authority and to use the net proceeds to pay off the debt they incurred to finance these natural gas purchases. This legislation has been passed by the house and is currently being considered in the Senate. In our remaining states, we anticipate recovering gas costs through our normal purchase gas cost mechanisms over a 12 to 18-month time frame. I am very proud of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees in the work they do every day to provide safe and reliable natural gas service to our 1,400 communities and 3.2 million customers. Their dedication and commitment have Atmos Energy well positioned for success in the second half of the fiscal year. I will now turn the call over to Chris, for an update on our financial performance. Chris? Thank you, Chris. I appreciate that financial update. As you heard we continue to be focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy and remain on track to meet our fiscal 2021 targets. As we look to the second half of the year, we will continue to execute on our strategy that supports our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services. During our last two quarterly calls, I've shared the progress we are making to minimize our carbon footprint as well as our water and land impact at some of our offices and service centers, including the work we are doing to increase the amount of RNG we have on our system today and to help customers reduce their carbon emissions.

Providing this family with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost-efficient is just one way Atmos Energy fuels safe and thriving communities. Last year legislation was designed to promote the use of all energy sources and maintain customer energy choice which we refer to as all fuels legislation was passed in Louisiana and Tennessee. During the second quarter, similar legislation was passed in Kansas, Kentucky and Mississippi. And earlier this week, the Texas Senate passed HB 17 and it is now on its way to the Governor for signature. Assuming it is signed, six of our eight states will have passed all fuels legislation. The successful execution of our strategy and our financial position have us well positioned to continue safely delivering reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and well and into the future. I will now open up the call for questions. Dan, I'll turn it back over to you and the operator. No. Good morning. I appreciate your question. Let's just start with the transaction that you're talking about there and discussion around our assets. And again, as you heard Chris go through the financial updates, the performance for year-to-date, our historical performance, we remain very happy with our asset mix our regulatory construct. And again, Insoo as you know, we began to earn 90% of our investment in the first six months and 99% after 12 months. And we've talked about how that story is very simple, very straightforward easy for our folks investors all stakeholders to understand. And there are complications with these acquisitions as we go forward. That's why we like our plan that we have laid out today the performance that our divisions execute on day in and day out. But I think this transaction sends a very strong signal right to the market. In our opinion, it sends a very strong about the value of natural gas that it brings, particularly meeting the energy needs on a go-forward basis, the value of these assets that have been somewhat questioned over time, but are now should be coming into clear focus. So I think it sends a very strong signal to everybody about the role that natural gas is playing continue to play going forward and the value of this infrastructure out there for the reliability, the certainty the affordability that natural gas brings. So very happy to see that have occurred, but remain very, very happy and positive with our regulatory construct and performance of our assets. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I think as you've heard us say we continue to grow the number of projects that we have out there under evaluation. We're up to 30 now, and it's a mixture of dairy as well as landfill gas. We've got a combination of those things we're looking at now. We're doing about 5.5 to 6 piece a year. That's a little north of the 2% range I think when you compare that to about the average distribution sales volumes that we move across our system on an annual basis. I think we'll continue to see these projects come up and with the help of some of these energy firms that are out there I think we'll continue to see a good opportunity to bring them on our system. But right now to hang a number on it I think it's still a little bit early. As I said, we're at the 2% of our overall distribution sales throughput volumes. I think there's opportunity there for us. But until we can get in, and see what infrastructure may be required how near are our systems they are is that going to require pipe, or what's required on the other side of that through digesters, processing equipment those sort of things. I think it's still a little bit premature on our side to try and hang a target or a number out there, where this could be, but we remain very optimistic about the opportunities that continue to come up. No good question. And I think our team, as you heard me say, I mentioned our gas supplier our gas control groups they're continuing to go through and evaluate things that occurred throughout that 12 to 14 day period there. How we can improve our system things we can put on our system to monitor that additional supply diversification that we can maybe bring on to our systems. So that's continuing to go on. But really those are things we do each year. And I think one of the strengths as I pointed out in my earlier remarks for us is our planning process. Those projects, I mentioned are already in our five-year plan have been in our five-year plan to allow us to continue to fortify grow and think about where those next challenges could be. Just for example, again the storage piece of that. So as we develop those salt cabins we're not only thinking about past performance we're thinking about growth on the system as well. And other places to fortify are, whether it's APT infrastructure or distribution systems as well. So I think the ongoing evaluation of that performance continues, but I'm very proud of how our system performed through that and we'll look for whether it's technology solutions, or supply diversification again to help us through that. And the last thing, I'll mention on that is around that supply diversification. You look at I'll just use our APT asset as an example here. When that supply stopped flowing coming in from the West from the Permian there, we were able through the network that we've been building and fortifying and enforcing over the last 10 years to pull from the North out of the Barnett out of Oklahoma, we fortified that with additional supplies coming out of Carthage from East. We had our fortifications in place, where we could pull from Katy up from the South. All of those points helped us get through that situation during that storm and we needed all of those and that versatility in the system to be able to pull that and pull it at those levels as well as the many suppliers that we have across those areas to be able to bring those into those points, so I'm very proud of how we performed during that period and how our system continues to provide very many options for us going forward. Well, in our footprint salt-dome is here in Texas. This is our third cabin here in Texas. Those are behind the APT system to meet the demands of its customer base, its firm needs there for human needs customers here, on the Mid-Tex system. So our other storage fields, throughout our other properties are all traditional sandstone reservoirs. There are no salt-dome projects on or available in those other facilities. But we do have contract storage services, that we use through our interstate supply contracts and with third-party sources as well to supplement our peaking capacity needs. And some of that may potentially be salt. Right now, most of that is generally sandstone, reservoirs itself. So right now, we've taken as I said a good hard look at this third cabin development here. And see that being able to help us for the near to longer-term at this point. No. Again, let's think about storage. Storage for us is there to supplement our peak day at our interstate capacity to meet those firm needs. And the only opportunity for salt right now, as I said is here in Texas. Our other opportunities are sandstone reservoirs. And those are near market, near our large customer bases. So we continue to use those other 15 fields to exactly do that. So the only salt-dome available is here in Texas and right now our third cavern development, that's the one we're focused on. Yeah. Yeah. You broke-up there just a little bit. So let me see, if I can answer your question here. I think when you look at the supply right now the abundance of the supply, the pricing it's come back down to I think today, Waha was in the 250 range or so. You look at the growth across our system and our average bills right now are in that $49 to $50 rates absent what we've gone through this past winter obviously. But I think, given those supply pricing and given the growth we have on our system, the signals we can send on our annual mechanisms right now, I think, we're very comfortable with our costing and how we compare on a go-forward basis with that, as well as meeting our O&M and compliance needs. And again, you've heard me talk before about at our all-in cost right now, that again assuming that we get securitization spread out these costs on these abnormal winter pricing events here that at $5 to $5.50 right now, that equates to about $0.01 to $0.015 on a kilowatt rate. So, I think, we still remain very, very competitive out there compared to electric pricing on a go-forward basis for us as well. I'm not anticipating any pressure at this point on our CapEx program. Again, we've modeled a lot of things going forward into our five-year plan. We continue to monitor the need for our projects and can pull things forward or push some things back. So I think, right now, given the layout that we have for this year and the next few years going forward, I feel very comfortable with what we'll be able to execute upon. Not that I would say would equate to an extra boost, if you will. I think we see, certainly as the vaccines have started to roll out, the economy to your point has started to pick back up. Things are opening back up. We see some of our industrial customers across the eight states get back to what we would call pre-pandemic levels. Now some of them stayed at that because, they were associated with the specific needs of that whether the medical industry or metals industry, those sorts of things held steady throughout it. But those that kind of pulled back during that color period have now started to pick back up and hit at a normal pace. To your point, we continue to see new additions and expansions across our system. But I don't know that, I would categorize it at this point as an extra boost. We're very proud to see the growth from an economic and a utilization of natural gas standpoint. And it seems to be a good diversified industrial load from auto, to the distilling industry, to the metals industry, but we're very proud to see that, but nothing that's been unanticipated at this point."

            "name": "Chris Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. Last night, we reported fiscal 2021 second quarter net income of $297 million, or $2.30 per share, compared to $240 million or $1.95 per share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date earnings were $514 million, or $4.01 per share, compared with earnings of $418 million, or $3.42 per share in the prior year period. Our second quarter and year-to-date performance largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending, customer growth in our distribution segment, lower O&M spending and a reduction in our annual effective tax rate. During the second quarter, APT began refunding $107 million in excess deferred tax liabilities to its customers over a three-year period. Additionally, in Tennessee, we began refunding $17 million in excess deferred taxes over a three-year period. As a reminder, these refunds result in a reduction to revenue and a corresponding reduction in income tax expense, resulting in no material impact to our net income. Since these excess deferred taxes were approved during the second quarter, we adjusted our annual effective tax rate to reflect the lower tax expense that we will realize this fiscal year. The application of this lower annual effective tax rate to our results for six months ended March 31, resulted in an $0.11 benefit during the second quarter. However, we can only recognize the associated reduction in revenue, as it is built over the last six months of the fiscal year. Therefore, this $0.11 benefit will be fully offset during the third and fourth quarters, as we build those lower revenues. Consolidated operating income, increased about 17% to $681 million during the six months ended March 31. Slides four and five summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both of our operating segments, driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending, totaled $130 million. Customer growth in our distribution segment contributed an incremental $11 million, as we continue to benefit from strong population growth in several of our service areas. For the 12 months ended March 31, we experienced 1.87% net customer growth in our North Texas distribution business and 1.61% net growth across our eight-state footprint. We experienced an $8 million decline in service order revenues in our distribution segment, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities. Additionally, our provision for bad debt expense increased almost $9 million in our distribution segment, compared to the same period last year. This combined $17 million decrease, represented the most significant impact to our financial performance through the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. Our commercial sales volumes have turned significantly better than our expectations since the start of the fiscal year. After 15% period-over-period decrease in sales volumes during the first quarter, commercial sales volumes increased 16% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year and were about 2% higher year-over-year. While some of this increase is attributed to the significantly colder weather experienced during the second quarter, commercial sales volumes have trended less than 5% below the two-year weather-normalized average, which much of that -- much of that decrease experienced during the first fiscal quarter. Throughout the second quarter, we have noted steady improvement as economic activity has started to pick up. Consolidated O&M expense, excluding bad debt expense, decreased $14 million. O&M in our distribution segment was about $6 million lower than the prior year, primarily reflecting lower travel costs. O&M in our pipeline and storage setting was approximately $8 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to the completion of some nonrecurring well integrity work in the prior year period and conservative O&M management, as we evaluated how our revenues would materialize over the first six months of the fiscal year. Consolidated capital spending decreased 15% to $846 million, with 87% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending. The decrease largely reflects the timing of spending in our distribution segment. We remain on track to spend $2 billion to $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year, to further enhance the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission network, while reducing methane emissions. We continue to execute our well-established regulatory strategy, focused on annual filing mechanisms, which mitigate the incremental impact to customer bills, while reducing lag. To-date, we have implemented $110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. And we have currently about $145 million in progress. Slides 27 and 28 summarize the key attributes for these outcomes. And slide 17 summarizes our planned activities for the remainder of the fiscal year. Due to the historic nature of Winter Storm Uri, we experienced unforeseen -- unforeseeable and unprecedented market pricing for gas costs, which resulted in aggregated natural gas purchases during the month of February of approximately $2.3 billion. To help pay for these costs, we completed $2.2 billion of long-term debt financing in March. As a reminder, gas costs are a pass-through cost and recover in all of our jurisdictions. However, in Kansas and Texas, due to the size of the costs incurred, our regulators issued orders, authorizing natural gas utilities to record regulatory assets to account for the extraordinary costs associated with the storm. As of March 31, we have recorded a $2.1 billion regulatory asset with approximately $2 billion recorded in Texas and approximately $77 million recorded in Kansas. As Kevin mentioned, we have the ability to securitize these costs in Kansas and we are carefully monitoring the proposed statewide securitization legislation in Texas.  We also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 2.5 million shares for $239 million. And we settled forward agreements on 4.5 million shares for approximately $461 million of net proceeds. As of March 31st, we have approximately $116 million in net proceeds available under existing forward sale agreements and we have about $313 million available for issuance under the ATM program. We intend to satisfy our remaining fiscal 2021 equity needs through our ATM program.  As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization excluding the $2.2 billion of storm-related financing issued during the second quarter was 60.4% as of March 31st and we finished the quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of liquidity. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on slide 7 to 10. Yesterday, we reaffirmed our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 per diluted share. As a reminder, approximately 70% of our distribution revenues are earned through the first six months of the fiscal year. And substantially, all of our pipeline storage and other segments revenues are earned under a straight fixed variable rate design. Now that the winter season -- winter heating season is over, we have more clarity around our revenues for the remainder of the fiscal year and we believe fiscal 2021 earnings per share will be at the upper end of our guidance range.  We anticipate our sales volumes to be consistent with what we typically experience during the second half of the fiscal year. We also anticipate that our service order revenues will frank consistently with the first six months of the fiscal year. We've also reflected in this guidance the decrease in revenue over the last six months in the fiscal year as we refund excess deferred taxes to our customers and we have updated our income tax expense guidance range to reflect the impact of these refunds.  Finally, we anticipate that O&M will increase modestly during the second half of the fiscal year and be in line with our original O&M guidance range. We continue to meet all of our compliance requirements and we will begin to address some of the system maintenance work we were able to safely delay during the first half of the fiscal year. Slides 11 and 12 provide additional details around our guidance. Thank you for your time today. And I will now turn it back over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin? Sure, Insoo. And good morning. So yeah, so a couple of things. I mean, the regulatory outcomes were pretty much in line with our expectations, primarily because that reflects the capital spending that we did in the prior fiscal year. So when we made those filings up late last year, they carry over into this year. So we had pretty good visibility into those outcomes. I would -- you noted the temporary timing difference around the update to the annual effective tax rate which will unwind by the end of the year. And then also two we were very conservative on the O&M spending in the first half of the fiscal year as we were able to kind of just take a wait-and-see approach with respect to how our commercial customers in particular would behave during the pandemic. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the performance there has been better than what we anticipated. So we did hold back some of the spending on the O&M side until we had a better sense where those revenues will begin to materialize. And now that we're out of the winter heating season and focused on the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we'll be modestly increasing that O&M spend. And given the momentum that we see with the regulatory outcomes, the commercial sales volumes beginning to trend in the right direction, as economic activity picks up and the fact that we'll do some modest increases on O&M spending, we feel confident that we'll be at the upper end of the range by the end of the fiscal year. Yeah. I'll start, and Kevin, if you want to chime in as well? So yeah, if securitization does pass in Texas, it's our intent at this point to participate in that program which then would really I think crystallize, what we would do with the $2.2 billion that we executed in -- long-term debt that we executed in March. Kind of going forward, and when you think about our financing plan, setting aside, the $2.2 billion for a moment, we'll continue to finance our operations in a very balanced fashion using a mix of long-term debt and equity to finance our needs. So that, -- we don't anticipate that financing strategy to change. It's worked very well for us, over the last 10 years. And it's well understood by our regulators certainly the investment community. And we don't see that changing at this point. Yeah. If we have the opportunity to participate in the securitization program in Texas, and then, have obviously the opportunity to securitize the cost in Kansas, we would anticipate that our financing program -- our financing strategy would be consistent with what we've done in the past."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\nDan Meziere: Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. With me this morning are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. Today\u2019s presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today\u2019s presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 25 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our first speaker today is Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and CFO of Atmos Energy. Chris?\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. We\u2019re off to a solid start to the fiscal year. Yesterday we reported fiscal 2021 first quarter net income of $218 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Our first quarter performance largely reflects positive rate count outcomes driven by system modernization spending, customer growth in our distribution segment and lower O&M spending largely due to the timing of such spending in both of our segments. Consolidated operating income increased by 18% to $299 million in the first quarter. Slide four summarizes the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate outcomes provide an incremental $15 million in operating income. Customer growth in our distribution segment contributed an incremental $6 million, as we continue to benefit from strong population growth in some of our service areas, most notably in North -- in our North Texas Distribution business. For the 12 months ended December 31st, we experienced 1.7% net customer growth in our North Texas Distribution business and 1.4% net growth across our 8-state footprint. The ongoing effects of the pandemic reduce consolidated operating income by approximately $9 million this quarter, primarily in our distribution segments. Quarter-over-quarter operating income fell approximately $2.5 million due to global commercial demand attributable to the effects of the pandemic on the economy. Additionally, we experienced a $4.5 million decline in service order revenues, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities. And bad debt expense increased about $2 million quarter-over-quarter. Consolidated O&M expense excluding bad debt decreased $16 million. During the quarter, we deferred non-compliance spending into late in the fiscal year as we evaluated our customer load. O&M in our r distribution segment was about $8 million lower than the prior year, reflecting lower employee, travel and training costs. O&M in our pipeline and storage segment was approximately $8 million lower than prior year, primarily due to non-recurring low integrity costs incurred in the prior year combined with O&M management during the first quarter of this year. Consolidated capital spending decreased approximately 14% to $457 million, but 87% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. This decrease largely reflects the timing of product spending in our distribution segment. We remain on track to spend between $2 billion and $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year with more than 80% of spending focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission network, while reducing methane emissions. We continue to execute a well-established regulatory strategy focused on annual filing mechanisms, which mitigate the incremental impact of customer bills while reducing lag. To-date, we have implemented $110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes, and currently, we have about $32 million in progress. Slides 18 to 24 summarize these outcomes and slide 17 outlines our planned fillings for the remainder of the fiscal year. During the first quarter, we completed over $700 million of long-term financing. We remain focused on balancing the need to finance our capital expenditure program in a cost effective manner with maintaining the strength of a balance sheet. Following the completion of our $600 million 10-year note issuance in October, we reduced our weighted average cost of debt to 3.99% and achieve the weighted average maturity of approximately 19 years. We also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 1.2 million shares for $122 million. And we settled forward arrangements on 2.1 million shares for approximately $216 million in net proceeds during the quarter. As of December 31st, we have approximately $247 million net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements that we will utilize by the end of the fiscal year. We have now priced a substantial portion of our fiscal 2021 equity needs and anticipate satisfying our remaining fiscal \u201821 activities through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization was 58.5% as of December 31st, and we finished the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion liquidity under our credit facilities equity forward agreements. The strength of our balance sheet and our five-year plan continues to be recognized by the credit rating agencies. During the first quarter, Moody\u2019s and S&P maintain their ratings with the stable outlook. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on slide six through nine. So to summarize, our first quarter performance, our financing activities and regular -- regulatory activities were in line with our expectations. As we continue to the winter heating season, we continue to remain cautious given the unpredictable nature of that pandemic. However, with yesterday\u2019s reaffirmation, we remain confident in our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance of $4.90 to $5.10. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. As you can see, from our first quarter results, we are off to a good start. We remain focused on executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. We are continuing our investments in people, processes and technologies that will enable Atmos Energy to scale and efficiently and safely invest $11 billion to $12 billion over the next five years. Working to achieve our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we provide safety messaging to our customers and our communities, innovate and advance employee training, and invest in the modernization of our system. Over the last 10 years we\u2019ve invested more than $11 billion company-wide to modernize our pipeline infrastructure. Over 80% of which was allocated to safety and over the next five years we anticipate spending $11 billion to $12 billion as we replace approximately 5,000 miles to 6,000 miles of our distribution and transmission pipe, including the replacement of the remaining cast iron [ph] by the end of 2021. To build upon our continuous improvement efforts, in 2016, we started the process of implementing a pipeline safety management system following the American Petroleum Institute 2015 publication of the voluntary recommended practice. This voluntary measure encourages continuous improvement by reviewing practices, policies and procedures, as we learn from our experiences and from those of others in the industry. This quarter the National Transportation Safety Board held a public meeting on January 12th, related to the incident that occurred at Dallas, Texas residents in February 2018. The field and gas investigation and lab reports confirmed that unrecorded third-party excavation damage on mechanical equipment caused a major crack and leak. We are currently reviewing the complete findings and recommendations released after the meeting and expect to receive the final report soon. Because third-party damage remains one of the greatest threats to natural gas distribution systems, we have been and will continue to be a champion for damage prevention, through such efforts as auditing our third-party line locating services, to empowering our employees to proactively stop by excavation sites, to provide damage prevention materials and ensure to corporate on notification. We have seen our third-party damage rate continue to outperform the industry average. We continue to undertake numerous safety and other continuous improvement actions, such as updating our leak survey and leak investigation procedures to include mandatory 911 notification when a probable or existing hazardous condition is discovered if first responders are not already on site. As I\u2019ve discussed before, we\u2019ve enhanced our technical training program to provide a virtual format coupled with hands on experience for our employees. In this virtual training environment, we have been able to reduce class sizes and duration to improve the training experience all without sacrificing quality. These are only a few of the improvements that Atmos Energy has been making towards achieving our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services. You may recall on our FY 2020 fourth quarter earnings call, we announced five focus areas in our environmental strategy all designed to reduce our carbon footprint in combination with our pipe replacement efforts. These five focus areas our gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. I also discuss the progress made in minimizing our carbon footprint, as well as our water and land impact at some of our offices and service centers. Today I want to highlight another focus area for you, gas supply. We are working to increase the amount of RNG that we have on our system to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. Annually, we move nearly 5.5 BCF of RNG across our system, which represents approximately 2% of our distribution sales volumes. We are currently assessing over 20 RNG opportunities adjacent to our system in several states for additional supplies. During the first quarter, we initiated a project in Colorado with a dairy to connect RNG from their facility to our system. Although, it\u2019s too soon to commit to how much RNG we can ultimately transport across our system, please know we will be working with regulators and all stakeholders to help develop the framework for commercially viable RNG solutions to support our customers and improve the environment. Finally, during the first quarter, we continued to enhance our sustainability reporting, as we published our third Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability report, as well as our Methane Emissions report. Both of these can be found in the Corporate Responsibility section of our website. These reports paired with our Corporate Responsibility section of our website, allow us to tell our story and keep stakeholders informed about what we are doing to support the communities where we live and work. As you can see from the highlighted continuous improvement efforts, we remain focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy and the foundation of that long-term sustainability is the 4,700 men and women who are dedicated to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and giving back to the communities where we live and work every day. They are successfully executing a proven strategy that is focused on modernizing our system to safely deliver reliable and affordable natural gas in an environmentally responsible manner. The long-term fundamentals of this strategy remain the same. They\u2019re supported by the fact that we operate in constructive jurisdictions for several of our markets continue to have strong long-term growth potential, most notably the DFW Metroplex, which is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the country. Additionally, these jurisdictions recognize the value that natural gas provides to their economies in an environmentally responsible manner. The successful execution of our strategy, the strength of our balance sheet and our strong liquidity leaves us well-positioned to continue to safely deliver reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our industry need -- energy needs now and in the future. I appreciate your time this morning and thank you for your interest in Atmos Energy. And we\u2019ll take any questions that you may have and I\u2019ll turn it back over to the Operator.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nChris Forsythe: Good morning, Jeremy.\nKevin Akers: Hey. Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to start off, there was a lot of concerns in the market, obviously, last March when COVID hit and this was the first heating season where you guys get to see the full impact there. I am just wondering if you could expand a bit on, can you speak to the COVID impacts on the quarter versus your expectations and are you seeing impacts kind of consistent going forward into 2021 with your expectations overall?\nChris Forsythe: Sure, Jeremy. I\u2019ll start here and Kevin feel free to jump in as well. As I mentioned earlier, we had about a $9 million quarter-over-quarter impact that we\u2019ve attributed to COVID between commercial load loss, the decline in service order revenues and a little bit of bad debt expense. On the commercial load loss, that is certainly well within the planning scenarios that we had developed over the summer and into the fall as we established our earnings per share guidance. So from that perspective, we\u2019re pleased to see that that the commercial load loss is in line with those expectations. We\u2019ll continue to monitor that as we moved through the second quarter. We got a still another two months or three months left in our winter heating season, which by the end of winter heating season, we\u2019ll have about 70% of our distribution revenues booked for the fiscal year and we\u2019ll have some more clarity around what the impact of the margin line item will be. Same thing with the service order revenues, a lot will be contingent upon when we resumed full collection activities and we\u2019re working with our regulators on that keeping you abreast of what we\u2019re doing there and but, again, that is completely in line with our expectation.\nKevin Akers: Yeah. Jeremy, the only thing I\u2019ll add to that, as you\u2019ve heard us say many times before, our team, our risk management compliance team, our operations team, our shared service group, continue to adhere and follow to our practices and protocols are in place, again, allowing us to continue to execute at the highest level on all fronts. Even though we\u2019ve seen an increase in some parts of our territory in a number of cases, we are glad to see the vaccine start to be rolling out across our service territory as well. But we believe with those practices, protocols and things we\u2019ve been able to have in place over the last few months w will continue to execute on a go-forward basis at a very high level.\nJeremy Tonet: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And maybe just kind of turning over to O&M, given the O&M tailwinds you have realized already. What are the main drivers and timing of your expected O&M growth over the course of the year?\nChris Forsythe: Yeah. So in the O&M, as we talked about last quarter, we\u2019ve assumed kind of a full O&M budget, if you will, our full compliance program. So our strategy going into the first quarter was to defer some spending that we didn\u2019t need to do in the first quarter to kind of see how the new customer load loss was materializing. In fact, we\u2019ve got a better handle on that now. And as you saw in some of the details around the guidance, we\u2019re still reaffirming the O&M range that we initially put out last fall. So, again, a lot of that will be focused on compliance activities, as well as other activities designed to mitigate risk. As you heard, Kevin talked about, third-party damage, we\u2019ll continue to step up our efforts in that particular area, as well as just other system maintenance activities that are not necessarily compliance oriented, but we certainly want to be performing to maintain the system the way that we like to maintain it. You\u2019ve heard us talk before, we certainly assume in our O&M plan, not just what we need to meet compliance purposes just to meet just in time, but we\u2019re also keeping an eye towards what our requirements are further down the line later in a fiscal year or into next year, so that we are well ahead of those compliance requirements so that we can meet those dead time -- deadlines without having to wait to the last minute.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And you touched on this a bit in your commentary, but I was hoping you could expand a bit more, it seems for the -- in the marketplace for the LDC space as a whole, there\u2019s some concern with regards to new laws that could impact, new gas hookups, effectively banning that. Just wondering, I guess, how you guys see that risk for you in your service territories and how I guess it compares for Atmos versus other LDC peers and difference that you see there?\nKevin Akers: Yeah. Jeremy, I\u2019ll start with that. As again, as I\u2019ve said, we have very constructive rate jurisdictions and we continue to see growth, as Chris talked about across our service territory. We haven\u2019t seen any bans, whether they\u2019re on hookups or usage or those sort of things across our service territory. We stay in close contact through our stakeholder engagement strategy, our local public affairs and operating teams with our jurist -- city jurisdictions or state legislators as well. The -- keeping them informed of what value natural gas brings, what Atmos Energy is doing in their communities. So we stay in touch with them to keep them up to-date on an ongoing basis and haven\u2019t really seen any even come up at the legislative level or through discussions regarding gas bans or clients hookups at this point.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. And I think we might have seen some legislation and some states that were -- at the state level that would ban or stop these types of bans. Have you guys seen anything like that in your service stories or have any expectations for that?\nKevin Akers: Yeah. We\u2019re working with associations and peer companies in all of our jurisdictions to keep an eye on bills that are being filed at the state level. These are called all fuels bills, if you will, you may recall that last year, there was one approved in Tennessee and one approved in Louisiana and we\u2019re very encouraged by those bills. I think it highlights the value that natural gas continues to bring and the value of customer choice and choosing an affordable energy opportunity across our footprint. So we\u2019re aware of those. We\u2019re working with different associations. We\u2019re working with our peer companies as well to make sure that their customers have that choice of fuel going forward.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. I\u2019ll stop there. Thank you very much.\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Jeremy.\nOperator: The next question is from Richie Ciciarelli of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRichie Ciciarelli: Hey. Good morning.\nChris Forsythe: Good morning, Richie.\nKevin Akers: Good morning.\nRichie Ciciarelli: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the customer growth side, so obviously pretty impressive this quarter. Just can you provide any more color on what you\u2019re seeing from the customer classes and more on the residential side with new customer hookups? And how is that kind of progressed into fiscal 2Q, thus far with, potentially more immigration into the State of Texas there?\nChris Forsythe: Yeah. I\u2019ll start and Kevin, you can certainly help out as well. Yeah. As I said, we\u2019ve got 1.4% across the 8-state footprint, 1.7% here in North Texas and a lot of that is new residential growth. And it\u2019s a trend that we started what we\u2019ve really been seeing now for quite some time, but it\u2019s continued throughout this pandemic. I think the stories are reading. You see more and more folks that are interested and maybe moving into the suburbs, looking for either a first home or getting a different type of home as they\u2019re accommodating their work-from-home protocols and strategies. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving a lot of growth. Certainly here in the North Texas area, we continue to see robust economic -- underlying economic activity in terms of companies evaluating the Dallas Fort Worth market and in terms of relocating in this area, and we continue to see how we come to Dallas there. There are cranes and construction everywhere. So I think we\u2019re still seeing that underlying activity and a lot of that\u2019s being driven by the residential class and that\u2019s consistent to across our footprint and really in our first quarter, the number of hookups that we had from a residential perspective was one among the highest that we\u2019ve seen in a number of years and we are grateful to see that not only in North Texas, but across most of our service territory.\nKevin Akers: Yeah. Chris, I just quickly add to that. In addition in some of our other states, Mississippi, Kentucky, we\u2019re seeing industrial expansion as well, which is a good sign in this economy, as well as new industrial customers coming into those locations as well. So we see it, as Chris said, with residential commercial starting move in the Metroplex, but again, good opportunity on the industrial side and our other footprint as well.\nRichie Ciciarelli: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just on your equity needs, obviously, you mentioned you price a good portion of forward and then the remaining is through the ATM this year. But just as you think about kind of your long-term plan, keeping that cap structure towards the 60% level given you can an actual cap structure in Texas. I mean and just given where your multiple is, could you look at other forms, whether it\u2019s portfolio optimization to kind of recycled capital or creating a whole cost structure. Just curious how you guys are thinking about that, just given where your multiple is today?\nChris Forsythe: Sure. I mean, we certainly we go put together our strategic plan every year, refresh it, if you will. I mean, these are things that we\u2019re certainly thinking about. I\u2019ll just remind everybody that when we put together our most recent five-year plan consistent with what we\u2019ve done the last several years, all of our equity financing is already assumed in that five-year plan. So when you look at the 6% to 8% earnings and dividends per share growth, the projected share price that we put out, or sorry, earnings per share out in the out years that has assumed a wide variety of potential stock prices. And we put we put that guidance out after we\u2019ve gone through that rigorous assessment. So we feel right now the current financing strategy is one -- that is one been successful for us in the past. We continue to believe that will be successful for us in the future. And but we will continue to evaluate certainly different structures. And we\u2019ve talked about before in terms of asset dispositions, our 8-state footprint, we\u2019re very, very comfortable with. We\u2019ve got good jurisdictions, very constructive jurisdictions that we are very familiar with these jurisdictions and as this -- again, we always consider it but that\u2019s not a key part of our strategy and we don\u2019t need that type of activity to achieve the 6% to 8% earnings per share growth over the next five years. \nRichie Ciciarelli: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And just one more if I can flip in on the RNG front, you mentioned you\u2019re looking over, I guess, 20 different RNG opportunities. Are you seeing this coming from new outlets or what\u2019s kind of driving this demand? Is it more on the dairy farm side or landfills? Just curious what kind of customer base you\u2019re looking at over there?\nKevin Akers: Yeah. You hit the answer there with the last two. It\u2019s the dairy industry itself and its landfill projects at this point probably have the majority of those approximately 20 projects that we\u2019re looking at and it\u2019s scattered across our footprint. As we mentioned in their opening remarks, we just closed out a supply project with a firm there in Colorado and we continue to work on several others across Kentucky and other parts of our jurisdiction as well. But there are in that area. There are in the dairy side and the landfill side at this point.\nRichie Ciciarelli: All right. Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks for all the time.\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Richie.\nOperator: The next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. My first question is a follow-up to the customer growth one. When you look -- when we look at what\u2019s embedded in your five-year growth plan, what\u2019s the range of customer growth across your jurisdiction that you\u2019re assuming?\nKevin Akers: Yeah. Well, we put together the plan. We\u2019re pretty conservative on that growth estimate. It\u2019s difficult to estimate when exactly it will materialize. So we basically just assume that the same customer count or customer base that we have at the time that we published the plan and that -- and just let that growth be a bit of an upside for us as it materializes. Again, primarily, because it\u2019s very difficult to forecast in which period that growth may occur.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. So I guess when we look at the capital spend and the rate base growth, it\u2019s not -- the bulk of it, again, is just infrastructure replacement and modernization as opposed to new customer line hookups.\nKevin Akers: Right. As I mentioned\u2026\nChris Forsythe: Exactly. You can get a lot more here.\nKevin Akers: Yeah.\nInsoo Kim: Right.\nChris Forsythe: Over 80% of the folks there.\nInsoo Kim: Yeah. Got it. My other question is, to your comments on kind of safety improvement initiatives and actions that you\u2019ve taken already and following up on the NTSB recommendations, when given the report that had come out about a month ago. Do you -- what do you see from either an O&M perspective or I guess, a capital perspective that could be elevated versus your plan or is that already embedded in the growth plan that you\u2019ve laid out?\nKevin Akers: Yeah. Because we continually evaluate our practices and our protocols and adopted several the recommendations already into practices, you\u2019ll find that on our website. We don\u2019t believe that implementing the recommendations that have been laid forward will have a material impact on capital or O&M at this point.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Fishman: Good morning. Just another follow up on the NTSB report, so at this point, we\u2019re just waiting on the final report. You\u2019re waiting on the final report. Is there anything else that\u2019s triggered by that final report? I mean, is there any -- is the Railroad Commission waiting on that report to issue some kind of final -- their final report, any of your city regulatory bodies, any insurance claims, any legal issues? I mean, is there anything else that\u2019s out there besides this final NTSB report?\nKevin Akers: There\u2019s a lot packed in there. Let me see if I can cover all those for you. The final report itself from our understanding, Charles, is merely just corrections or edits to the abstract and other information that you\u2019ve seen out there already. And again, we anticipate that coming out really soon. And the Railroad Commission was a party to the investigation just as we were and they paused their investigation until the NTSB was complete. So we anticipate them to pick up their investigation sometime here soon. As you saw on the recommendations, they\u2019ll be partnering with SAMSA [ph] to do an audit of our integrity management programs. So we anticipate them to pick their investigation backup and close it out relatively soon. I think on your other question, there is no open litigation related to the incident.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. And looking at the preliminary reporter on virtual meeting last month, it appears the Railroad Commission and Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration. They have to do this too. So, I guess, I mean, their report will include the things they have to do?\nKevin Akers: Yeah. We will all receive -- in that NTSB report, those recommendations, as you pointed out, were directed to several of the parties to the investigation, will all have responses back to the NTSB. And it\u2019s my understanding that our initial responses will have a timeframe of about 90 days or so to get our initial response back once we received that final report.\nCharles Fishman: Okay. And then just one other almost a housekeeping question, slide 13, footnote two, where you have no regulatory assets or liabilities related to COVID-19 at this point? Yet, it\u2019s my understanding you have received approval to record regulatory assets in just about all your service territory. So the decision not to record any regulatory asset at this point based on COVID-19. Was your decision -- driven by the fact that you were able to control your expenses at this point that they were reduced enough that you didn\u2019t feel a need to record any Reg assets? Is that a fair assessment of that?\nChris Forsythe: Yeah. It\u2019s pretty close. I mean, as you mentioned, Charles, we\u2019ve got the orders that cover about 90% of our customer base right now. We\u2019re evaluating the language in those orders. They were sufficiently broad and so we\u2019re interpreting and how best to evaluate that order vis-\u00e0-vis our filings talking with our regulators and we anticipate by the end of the fiscal year that we will establish some form of regulatory asset. It\u2019s just a matter of timing in this fiscal year when we establish that, but we are closely evaluating that right now and that\u2019s been factored into the guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nCharles Fishman: Got it. Okay. So it\u2019s more timing that you didn\u2019t have anything in the first quarter. Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Charles.\nOperator: There are no additional questions at this time.\nDan Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. The recording of this call will be available for replay on our website through March 31, 2021. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Akers",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. As you can see, from our first quarter results, we are off to a good start. We remain focused on executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. We are continuing our investments in people, processes and technologies that will enable Atmos Energy to scale and efficiently and safely invest $11 billion to $12 billion over the next five years. Working to achieve our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services, we provide safety messaging to our customers and our communities, innovate and advance employee training, and invest in the modernization of our system. Over the last 10 years we\u2019ve invested more than $11 billion company-wide to modernize our pipeline infrastructure. Over 80% of which was allocated to safety and over the next five years we anticipate spending $11 billion to $12 billion as we replace approximately 5,000 miles to 6,000 miles of our distribution and transmission pipe, including the replacement of the remaining cast iron [ph] by the end of 2021. To build upon our continuous improvement efforts, in 2016, we started the process of implementing a pipeline safety management system following the American Petroleum Institute 2015 publication of the voluntary recommended practice. This voluntary measure encourages continuous improvement by reviewing practices, policies and procedures, as we learn from our experiences and from those of others in the industry. This quarter the National Transportation Safety Board held a public meeting on January 12th, related to the incident that occurred at Dallas, Texas residents in February 2018. The field and gas investigation and lab reports confirmed that unrecorded third-party excavation damage on mechanical equipment caused a major crack and leak. We are currently reviewing the complete findings and recommendations released after the meeting and expect to receive the final report soon. Because third-party damage remains one of the greatest threats to natural gas distribution systems, we have been and will continue to be a champion for damage prevention, through such efforts as auditing our third-party line locating services, to empowering our employees to proactively stop by excavation sites, to provide damage prevention materials and ensure to corporate on notification. We have seen our third-party damage rate continue to outperform the industry average. We continue to undertake numerous safety and other continuous improvement actions, such as updating our leak survey and leak investigation procedures to include mandatory 911 notification when a probable or existing hazardous condition is discovered if first responders are not already on site. As I\u2019ve discussed before, we\u2019ve enhanced our technical training program to provide a virtual format coupled with hands on experience for our employees. In this virtual training environment, we have been able to reduce class sizes and duration to improve the training experience all without sacrificing quality. These are only a few of the improvements that Atmos Energy has been making towards achieving our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services. You may recall on our FY 2020 fourth quarter earnings call, we announced five focus areas in our environmental strategy all designed to reduce our carbon footprint in combination with our pipe replacement efforts. These five focus areas our gas supply, operations, fleet, facilities and customers. I also discuss the progress made in minimizing our carbon footprint, as well as our water and land impact at some of our offices and service centers. Today I want to highlight another focus area for you, gas supply. We are working to increase the amount of RNG that we have on our system to help customers reduce their carbon emissions. Annually, we move nearly 5.5 BCF of RNG across our system, which represents approximately 2% of our distribution sales volumes. We are currently assessing over 20 RNG opportunities adjacent to our system in several states for additional supplies. During the first quarter, we initiated a project in Colorado with a dairy to connect RNG from their facility to our system. Although, it\u2019s too soon to commit to how much RNG we can ultimately transport across our system, please know we will be working with regulators and all stakeholders to help develop the framework for commercially viable RNG solutions to support our customers and improve the environment. Finally, during the first quarter, we continued to enhance our sustainability reporting, as we published our third Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability report, as well as our Methane Emissions report. Both of these can be found in the Corporate Responsibility section of our website. These reports paired with our Corporate Responsibility section of our website, allow us to tell our story and keep stakeholders informed about what we are doing to support the communities where we live and work. As you can see from the highlighted continuous improvement efforts, we remain focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy and the foundation of that long-term sustainability is the 4,700 men and women who are dedicated to safely operating our system, providing exceptional customer service and giving back to the communities where we live and work every day. They are successfully executing a proven strategy that is focused on modernizing our system to safely deliver reliable and affordable natural gas in an environmentally responsible manner. The long-term fundamentals of this strategy remain the same. They\u2019re supported by the fact that we operate in constructive jurisdictions for several of our markets continue to have strong long-term growth potential, most notably the DFW Metroplex, which is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the country. Additionally, these jurisdictions recognize the value that natural gas provides to their economies in an environmentally responsible manner. The successful execution of our strategy, the strength of our balance sheet and our strong liquidity leaves us well-positioned to continue to safely deliver reliable, affordable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our industry need -- energy needs now and in the future. I appreciate your time this morning and thank you for your interest in Atmos Energy. And we\u2019ll take any questions that you may have and I\u2019ll turn it back over to the Operator. Hey. Good morning, Jeremy. Yeah. Jeremy, the only thing I\u2019ll add to that, as you\u2019ve heard us say many times before, our team, our risk management compliance team, our operations team, our shared service group, continue to adhere and follow to our practices and protocols are in place, again, allowing us to continue to execute at the highest level on all fronts. Even though we\u2019ve seen an increase in some parts of our territory in a number of cases, we are glad to see the vaccine start to be rolling out across our service territory as well. But we believe with those practices, protocols and things we\u2019ve been able to have in place over the last few months w will continue to execute on a go-forward basis at a very high level. Yeah. Jeremy, I\u2019ll start with that. As again, as I\u2019ve said, we have very constructive rate jurisdictions and we continue to see growth, as Chris talked about across our service territory. We haven\u2019t seen any bans, whether they\u2019re on hookups or usage or those sort of things across our service territory. We stay in close contact through our stakeholder engagement strategy, our local public affairs and operating teams with our jurist -- city jurisdictions or state legislators as well. The -- keeping them informed of what value natural gas brings, what Atmos Energy is doing in their communities. So we stay in touch with them to keep them up to-date on an ongoing basis and haven\u2019t really seen any even come up at the legislative level or through discussions regarding gas bans or clients hookups at this point. Yeah. We\u2019re working with associations and peer companies in all of our jurisdictions to keep an eye on bills that are being filed at the state level. These are called all fuels bills, if you will, you may recall that last year, there was one approved in Tennessee and one approved in Louisiana and we\u2019re very encouraged by those bills. I think it highlights the value that natural gas continues to bring and the value of customer choice and choosing an affordable energy opportunity across our footprint. So we\u2019re aware of those. We\u2019re working with different associations. We\u2019re working with our peer companies as well to make sure that their customers have that choice of fuel going forward. Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning. Yeah. Chris, I just quickly add to that. In addition in some of our other states, Mississippi, Kentucky, we\u2019re seeing industrial expansion as well, which is a good sign in this economy, as well as new industrial customers coming into those locations as well. So we see it, as Chris said, with residential commercial starting move in the Metroplex, but again, good opportunity on the industrial side and our other footprint as well. Yeah.

Because we continually evaluate our practices and our protocols and adopted several the recommendations already into practices, you\u2019ll find that on our website. We don\u2019t believe that implementing the recommendations that have been laid forward will have a material impact on capital or O&M at this point. Thank you. There\u2019s a lot packed in there. Let me see if I can cover all those for you. The final report itself from our understanding, Charles, is merely just corrections or edits to the abstract and other information that you\u2019ve seen out there already.

            "name": "Chris Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. We\u2019re off to a solid start to the fiscal year. Yesterday we reported fiscal 2021 first quarter net income of $218 million or $1.71 per diluted share. Our first quarter performance largely reflects positive rate count outcomes driven by system modernization spending, customer growth in our distribution segment and lower O&M spending largely due to the timing of such spending in both of our segments. Consolidated operating income increased by 18% to $299 million in the first quarter. Slide four summarizes the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate outcomes provide an incremental $15 million in operating income. Customer growth in our distribution segment contributed an incremental $6 million, as we continue to benefit from strong population growth in some of our service areas, most notably in North -- in our North Texas Distribution business. For the 12 months ended December 31st, we experienced 1.7% net customer growth in our North Texas Distribution business and 1.4% net growth across our 8-state footprint. The ongoing effects of the pandemic reduce consolidated operating income by approximately $9 million this quarter, primarily in our distribution segments. Quarter-over-quarter operating income fell approximately $2.5 million due to global commercial demand attributable to the effects of the pandemic on the economy. Additionally, we experienced a $4.5 million decline in service order revenues, primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities. And bad debt expense increased about $2 million quarter-over-quarter. Consolidated O&M expense excluding bad debt decreased $16 million. During the quarter, we deferred non-compliance spending into late in the fiscal year as we evaluated our customer load. O&M in our r distribution segment was about $8 million lower than the prior year, reflecting lower employee, travel and training costs. O&M in our pipeline and storage segment was approximately $8 million lower than prior year, primarily due to non-recurring low integrity costs incurred in the prior year combined with O&M management during the first quarter of this year. Consolidated capital spending decreased approximately 14% to $457 million, but 87% of our spending directed towards safety and reliability spending to modernize our system. This decrease largely reflects the timing of product spending in our distribution segment. We remain on track to spend between $2 billion and $2.2 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year with more than 80% of spending focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission network, while reducing methane emissions. We continue to execute a well-established regulatory strategy focused on annual filing mechanisms, which mitigate the incremental impact of customer bills while reducing lag. To-date, we have implemented $110 million in annualized regulatory outcomes, and currently, we have about $32 million in progress. Slides 18 to 24 summarize these outcomes and slide 17 outlines our planned fillings for the remainder of the fiscal year. During the first quarter, we completed over $700 million of long-term financing. We remain focused on balancing the need to finance our capital expenditure program in a cost effective manner with maintaining the strength of a balance sheet. Following the completion of our $600 million 10-year note issuance in October, we reduced our weighted average cost of debt to 3.99% and achieve the weighted average maturity of approximately 19 years. We also executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM for approximately 1.2 million shares for $122 million. And we settled forward arrangements on 2.1 million shares for approximately $216 million in net proceeds during the quarter. As of December 31st, we have approximately $247 million net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements that we will utilize by the end of the fiscal year. We have now priced a substantial portion of our fiscal 2021 equity needs and anticipate satisfying our remaining fiscal \u201821 activities through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization was 58.5% as of December 31st, and we finished the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion liquidity under our credit facilities equity forward agreements. The strength of our balance sheet and our five-year plan continues to be recognized by the credit rating agencies. During the first quarter, Moody\u2019s and S&P maintain their ratings with the stable outlook. Details of our financing activities and our financial profile can be found on slide six through nine. So to summarize, our first quarter performance, our financing activities and regular -- regulatory activities were in line with our expectations. As we continue to the winter heating season, we continue to remain cautious given the unpredictable nature of that pandemic. However, with yesterday\u2019s reaffirmation, we remain confident in our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance of $4.90 to $5.10. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his remarks. Kevin? Good morning, Jeremy. Sure, Jeremy. I\u2019ll start here and Kevin feel free to jump in as well. As I mentioned earlier, we had about a $9 million quarter-over-quarter impact that we\u2019ve attributed to COVID between commercial load loss, the decline in service order revenues and a little bit of bad debt expense. On the commercial load loss, that is certainly well within the planning scenarios that we had developed over the summer and into the fall as we established our earnings per share guidance. So from that perspective, we\u2019re pleased to see that that the commercial load loss is in line with those expectations. We\u2019ll continue to monitor that as we moved through the second quarter. We got a still another two months or three months left in our winter heating season, which by the end of winter heating season, we\u2019ll have about 70% of our distribution revenues booked for the fiscal year and we\u2019ll have some more clarity around what the impact of the margin line item will be. Same thing with the service order revenues, a lot will be contingent upon when we resumed full collection activities and we\u2019re working with our regulators on that keeping you abreast of what we\u2019re doing there and but, again, that is completely in line with our expectation. Yeah. So in the O&M, as we talked about last quarter, we\u2019ve assumed kind of a full O&M budget, if you will, our full compliance program. So our strategy going into the first quarter was to defer some spending that we didn\u2019t need to do in the first quarter to kind of see how the new customer load loss was materializing. In fact, we\u2019ve got a better handle on that now. And as you saw in some of the details around the guidance, we\u2019re still reaffirming the O&M range that we initially put out last fall. So, again, a lot of that will be focused on compliance activities, as well as other activities designed to mitigate risk. As you heard, Kevin talked about, third-party damage, we\u2019ll continue to step up our efforts in that particular area, as well as just other system maintenance activities that are not necessarily compliance oriented, but we certainly want to be performing to maintain the system the way that we like to maintain it. You\u2019ve heard us talk before, we certainly assume in our O&M plan, not just what we need to meet compliance purposes just to meet just in time, but we\u2019re also keeping an eye towards what our requirements are further down the line later in a fiscal year or into next year, so that we are well ahead of those compliance requirements so that we can meet those dead time -- deadlines without having to wait to the last minute. Good morning, Richie. Yeah. I\u2019ll start and Kevin, you can certainly help out as well. Yeah. As I said, we\u2019ve got 1.4% across the 8-state footprint, 1.7% here in North Texas and a lot of that is new residential growth. And it\u2019s a trend that we started what we\u2019ve really been seeing now for quite some time, but it\u2019s continued throughout this pandemic. I think the stories are reading. You see more and more folks that are interested and maybe moving into the suburbs, looking for either a first home or getting a different type of home as they\u2019re accommodating their work-from-home protocols and strategies. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving a lot of growth. Certainly here in the North Texas area, we continue to see robust economic -- underlying economic activity in terms of companies evaluating the Dallas Fort Worth market and in terms of relocating in this area, and we continue to see how we come to Dallas there. There are cranes and construction everywhere. So I think we\u2019re still seeing that underlying activity and a lot of that\u2019s being driven by the residential class and that\u2019s consistent to across our footprint and really in our first quarter, the number of hookups that we had from a residential perspective was one among the highest that we\u2019ve seen in a number of years and we are grateful to see that not only in North Texas, but across most of our service territory. Sure. I mean, we certainly we go put together our strategic plan every year, refresh it, if you will. I mean, these are things that we\u2019re certainly thinking about. I\u2019ll just remind everybody that when we put together our most recent five-year plan consistent with what we\u2019ve done the last several years, all of our equity financing is already assumed in that five-year plan. So when you look at the 6% to 8% earnings and dividends per share growth, the projected share price that we put out, or sorry, earnings per share out in the out years that has assumed a wide variety of potential stock prices. And we put we put that guidance out after we\u2019ve gone through that rigorous assessment. So we feel right now the current financing strategy is one -- that is one been successful for us in the past. We continue to believe that will be successful for us in the future. And but we will continue to evaluate certainly different structures. And we\u2019ve talked about before in terms of asset dispositions, our 8-state footprint, we\u2019re very, very comfortable with. We\u2019ve got good jurisdictions, very constructive jurisdictions that we are very familiar with these jurisdictions and as this -- again, we always consider it but that\u2019s not a key part of our strategy and we don\u2019t need that type of activity to achieve the 6% to 8% earnings per share growth over the next five years. Thank you, Richie. Exactly. You can get a lot more here. Over 80% of the folks there. Yeah. It\u2019s pretty close. I mean, as you mentioned, Charles, we\u2019ve got the orders that cover about 90% of our customer base right now. We\u2019re evaluating the language in those orders. They were sufficiently broad and so we\u2019re interpreting and how best to evaluate that order vis-\u00e0-vis our filings talking with our regulators and we anticipate by the end of the fiscal year that we will establish some form of regulatory asset. It\u2019s just a matter of timing in this fiscal year when we establish that, but we are closely evaluating that right now and that\u2019s been factored into the guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. Thank you, Charles."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you, sir. You may begin. \nDaniel Meziere: Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 39 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin. \nKevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and are glad you joined us this morning. As tomorrow's Veterans Day, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and to say thank you to those who served in our own forces and approximately to the 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates as part of the nearly 20 million Americans who have bravely served our country. Thank you for your service. Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $5.60, which represents the 20th consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in the call. I will begin today's call with a review of our fiscal 2022 accomplishments, provide an update on key pipeline projects, and we'll close with some thoughts about fiscal 2023. Our success in fiscal 2022 was once again reflected by the commitment and ongoing effort of all 4,800 Atmos Energy employees. I've said it before, and I will say it again, they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. Fiscal 2022 was our 11th year of executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. Over that 11-year period, we invested over $15 billion in modernizing and expanding our natural gas systems, replacing approximately 6,300 miles of distribution pipeline, approximately 440,000 steel service lines and over 1,200 miles of transmission pipeline. That same 11-year period, we added nearly 400,000 customers, including over 62,000 customers during fiscal 2022. And we continue to see strong natural gas demand from new and expanding industrial customers. In fiscal 2022, we added approximately 50 new industrial customers with an estimated annual load of 20 Bcf per year once they are fully operational. Over the last three years, we have added nearly 120 industrial customers with an estimated annual load of 35 Bcf. And these customers are from various industries, manufacturing, food processing, hospitals, automotive and distilleries. Our fiscal 2022 capital investment of over $2.4 billion supported the modernization of our distribution and transmission systems through the replacement of 715 miles of distribution pipe, the replacement of more than 47,000 service lines, of which 24,000 were steel service lines and over 155 miles of transmission pipe, all to further enhance system safety and reliability. Additionally, we installed over 200,000 wireless meter reading devices and now have over two million such devices across our system. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our procurement team for their focus, dedication and continued outstanding efforts to have the necessary materials and resources available for our distribution, transmission and storage projects. Just as they had done throughout the past decade, their strategic planning efforts have us well positioned for continued execution upon our strategy in fiscal 2023. For example, we currently maintain about six months of inventory for our distribution and transmission operations needs and have ordered all of our anticipated steel pipe needs for fiscal year 2023. We continue to coordinate with our vendors and pipe mills as we place our FY 2024 steel pipe orders. Now, I want to provide you an update on a few of our larger Atmos Pipeline-Texas projects and highlight their value in safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification that they provide APT and its customers. We are nearing the completion of APT's third salt dump cavern project at Bethel, which will provide more than 6 Bcf of additional working gas storage capacity. We began selling the new cavern this week and remain on track to place the cavern in service by the end of the calendar year. We are also nearing completion of the second phase of our Line X integrity replacement project, which we will replace 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline. This project is also on track to be completed by the end of this calendar year. As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas, and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT system as well as transportation customers that move gas from Waha to Katy. We continue to make good progress with our line S-2 project that has three phases. As a reminder, Line S-2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Phase one of the project replaced 21 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline and was placed into service the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In Phase 2 of Line S-2, we'll replace 17 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. We expect this to be in service late calendar this year. The final phase of this project is anticipated to be in service late calendar 2024. And again, this project will provide additional supply from the shale plays east and bring that gas into the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. To support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin and Williamson County, Texas, we have begun work on a 22-mile 36-inch line that will connect the southern end of APT system with the 42-inch Permian highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This line is currently expected to be placed into service during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. As you've heard in my previous updates, our customer service agents and service technicians provide exceptional customer service and support. During fiscal year 2022, our agents and technicians received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers. Thank you team for taking exceptional care of our customers every day. Our strategic focus on digital build delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as over 50% of our customers are receiving electronic bills while the utility industry average is 33%. And 81% of the total payments we received as of September 30 this year were electronic methods of payments such as bank drafts, credit cards and online banking. During fiscal 2022, we provided approximately 260,000 hours of training. And in September, we reached a milestone of delivering 2 million training hours since the opening of our Charles K. Vaughan training center in 2010. In fiscal 2022, we continued enhancing our comprehensive environmental strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from our operations in the five key areas of operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers. Our efforts in fiscal 2022 to reduce emissions and our environmental impact included our ongoing distribution and transmission system modernization programs that I mentioned earlier. And at our 5 APT storage fields, we completed the installation of gas cloud imaging technology. These 360-degree fixed-based cameras will continuously monitor our compression and storage field assets for methane emissions. And if necessary, the technology will send alerts, including images to our plant operations employees in addition to text and e-mail alerts. Additionally, in fiscal 2022, we continued our installation of advanced wellhead leak detection at our distribution storage facilities. And we expanded our system monitoring technologies by adding additional advanced mobile leak detection vehicles as well as implemented technology to capture methane emissions from pipeline maintenance activities. From a fleet and facilities perspective, we began transitioning our fleet to gasoline hybrid light-duty vehicles and to CNG for our heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, we are adding CNG refueling stations at our Fort-Worth and Round Rock facilities, both of which are scheduled for completion by end of this calendar year. At our corporate data center, we installed a natural gas-powered fuel cell to generate high efficiency, grid-independent electricity with low emissions. The fuel cells reduced our emissions at the data center by 27%. This is truly another example of how natural gas plays a pivotal role in lowering greenhouse gas emissions while increasing reliability to our critical facility. We have 2 new service centers that are pending leadership in energy and environmental design or LEED certification. If certified as expected, this will be the total number of LEED-certified facilities we have to 17 or approximately 11% of our total facilities. We are currently transporting approximately 8 Bcf a year of RNG across our system for end-use customers, and we are evaluating over 30 opportunities that could further expand the amount of RNG that we are transporting today. Finally, we are partnering with local habitat for humanity organizations in each of our eight states to provide families with zero net energy homes. These homes use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and advanced insulation materials to produce more energy than they consume. During fiscal 2022, we completed five new zero net energy homes in Texas and one home in Ansbro, Kentucky, and we are scheduled to complete a home in Jackson, Mississippi, this December. We recently broke ground on a home in Dublin, Virginia and expect to complete construction in the spring of 2023. The seven ZNE Homes that we have completed in the last 14 months demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner. To wrap up fiscal 2022, our 4,800 Atmos Energy employees through our fueling safe and thriving communities initiatives made a difference in the lives of others by supporting schools and students with books, meals and snacks. We honored our health care workers and first responders by supporting more than 140 nonprofits, dedicated to taking care of our hometown heroes, supplying them with meals and needed supplies. We planted trees and worked in our community gardens. Our team hosted utility fairs and energy assistant blitzes to support our share of the [Indiscernible] program for over 11,000 customers and donated $7 million of financial support. And for local -- and for 300 local food banks and shelters, the financial and voluntary resources [Indiscernible] provided translated into nearly 9 million meals for our neighbors in need across our 1,400 communities. I am very proud of our team because of their investment of time, talent and resources, we are making a difference in our communities. A successful fiscal 2022 has us well positioned as we move into the second decade of our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some additional color around our fiscal 2022 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2023 guidance and updated five-year plan through fiscal 2027. I will then return with some closing comments. Chris, over to you.\nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As Kevin mentioned, fiscal 2022 diluted earnings per share was $5.60, which represents a 9.4% increase over fiscal 2021. Our performance reflects the continued execution of our proven strategy of modernizing natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems, recovering our cost timely and financing our operations in a balanced manner. We also continue to experience strong customer growth, and we saw a significant improvement in our bad debt expense, both of which offset lower customer consumption and increased O&M spending. Slides four through six provide some details summarizing our financial performance for the fiscal year. Consolidated operating income increased $220 million from rate adjustments implemented in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. These adjustments were primarily driven by safety liability and system expansion spending. Approximately 68% of this increase is recognized in our distribution segment. We continue to see robust customer growth in our distribution segment, which increased operating income by an additional $15 million. This growth offset a $17 million decrease in consumption, most of which occurred during the second fiscal quarter. Additionally, we experienced a $31 million increase in consolidated O&M expense. O&M, excluding bad debt expense, increased $56 million, primarily driven by increased pipeline maintenance activities in both of our segments and employee-related costs compared with the prior year. This increase was partially offset by a $25 million decrease in bad debt expense as we were able to perform collection activities for our full fiscal year. In comparison, in the prior year, we resumed collection activities late in our third fiscal quarter. This decrease also reflects the exceptional work of our customer service team in assisting customers with their bills. During fiscal 2022, we arranged only $34 million of funding to help 67,000 customers with their monthly bill. As a result, our bad debt expense in fiscal 2022 was in line with our pre-pandemic experience. Finally, reductions in fiscal 2022 revenue associated with the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities reduced operating income by approximately $112 million. This reduction was substantially offset by lower income tax expense. Consolidated capital spending increased 24% or $475 million to $2.4 billion, with 88% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects the increased system modernization, integrity and expansion spending to meet the growing natural gas demand in our service territories. Approximately 90% of this spending began to earn a return within six months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $216 million of annualized operating income increases excluding the amortization of excess deferred tax liabilities. And since the end of the fiscal year, we have reached agreement with our regulators in an additional $112 million in annualized operating income increases during our fiscal 2023 first quarter. As of today, we have two filings pending exceeding about $16 million. Slides 29 through 38 summarize our regulatory activities for fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we completed over $1.6 billion of long-term debt and equity financing to support our ongoing operations. We fully satisfied our fiscal 2022 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. As of September 30, we had about $777 million available under existing equity forward arrangements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal 2023 needs and a portion of our anticipated fiscal 2024 needs. This equity financing complemented the $800 million of long-term debt financing we issued during fiscal 2022. We also continue to make progress in securitization. In Texas, we anticipate receiving $2.0 billion from the Texas public financing authorities within the next few months. We'll use the proceeds and available cash on hand to fully retire the $2.2 billion in interim winter storm financing that matures in March of 2023. This will eliminate all of our exposure to floating rate debt. In Kansas, on October 25, the Kansas Corporation Commission issued a financing order authorizing us to securitize $118 million in gas and over cost over a seven to 10-year period. We anticipate completing the securitization process by the end of our second fiscal quarter. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization at the end of fiscal year, excluding the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing or 61.3%. Additionally, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $3.1 billion of available liquidity. In October, we issued $800 million of long-term debt through two tranches. First tranche was a $500 million 30-year senior note with a coupon of 5. 75%. We had financially hedges tranced and received $197 million upon settlement of forward starting interest rate swap, which reduced the effective rate of 4.5%. Second tranche was a $300 million 10-year senior note with a coupon of 5.5% because we have already satisfied our fiscal 2023 equity needs through our ATM program, this transaction and completed our anticipated fiscal 2023 financing activities. Details for our financing activities and our financial profile can found on slides nine and 12. Finally, we finished the fiscal year with a very well-funded pension plan. Based on the current funded position of the plan and the funding requirements in the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we do not anticipate the need to make a minimum required contribution during fiscal 2023. In addition to addressing our fiscal 2023 financing needs, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we've also been preparing to ensure supply reliability and competitive natural gas prices for our customers for the upcoming winter heating season. Our gas supply team has done an outstanding job preparing for the upcoming winter heating season. Our proprietary and contracted storage is over 96% full. Additionally, we have physically and financially hedged 23% of our expected winter purchase requirements. Through the use of storage and physical and financial hedges, we have stabilized prices for just under half for our normal winter usage in the mid-$5 range. The remainder of our anticipated gas supply needs will be satisfied through a combination of base load purchases at first-of-month prices, peaking contracts and storage purchases when needed. Today, we have transportation capacity of 38 pipelines across our eight-state footprint, which provides our team access to a wide variety of liquid-traded producing basins. Further, a significant portion of our gas supply needs will continue to be sourced from Waha, which has traditionally traded below NYMEX and Henry Hub pricing. As a reminder, all prudently incurred gas costs recovered through purchased gas cost mechanisms generally over 12 months. This calculation generally involves a weighted average approach, which helps to smoothly impact on customer bills. Additionally, as a reminder, we have the opportunity to recover the gas cost portion of bad debt expense through a purchase guidance cost mechanisms in five states, which covers approximately 81% of our distribution customer base. Finally, we continue to actively communicate with our customers about how they can mitigate the potential impact of higher gas prices through energy conservations and how we can help by offering installment plans and budget billing plans and locating energy assistant agencies. Looking forward, yesterday, we initiated our fiscal 2023 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.90 to $6.10. Consistent with prior years, we expect about two-thirds of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Details surrounding our fiscal 2023 guidance can be found on slides 20 and 21. Fiscal 2023 capital spending is expected to approximate $2.7 billion. Already 5% of this spending is expected to begin earning a return within six months of the test period end. Substantially, all this increase we incurred in our distribution segment to support our system modernization efforts. Spending on our pipeline storage segment is expected to be in line with fiscal 2022 levels and is expected to represent approximately one-third for consolidated capital spending in fiscal 2023. And yesterday, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 156th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal 2023 is $2.96, an 8.8% increase over fiscal 2022. Slide 19 summarizes the key themes under our fiscal 2023 five-year plan. In short, these themes are very consistent with what we have been presenting over the last several five-year plans. Over the next five years, we anticipate earnings will grow annually at 6% to 8%. By fiscal 2027, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $7.65 to $8.05. We also anticipate dividends per share to increase annually in line with earnings per share. Continued spending for system replacement and modernization and expansion will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share from fiscal 2027. This plan anticipates total capital spending of approximately $15 billion. This level of spending will continue to support rate base growth of about 11% to 13% per year, which translates into an estimated rate base of approximately $25 billion in fiscal 2027, up from $14 billion at the end of fiscal 2022. From an O&M perspective, we will continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate O&M to range from $700 million to $720 million, and we've assumed O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal 2027 off of FY 2022 levels. In addition to the spending plans I outlined, we have assumed approximately $435 million in excess deferred tax refunds over the next five years. We anticipate about 65% of this amount will be refunded during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. As a result, we expect our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2023 to range between 10% and 12%. We've also planned for becoming a material cash taxpayer in the back half of the five-year plan because of the 15% corporate minimum tax that was included in the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed this past August. We've continued to finance our operations in a balanced fashion using a combination of long-term debt and equity to preserve the strength of our balance sheet. Excluding securitization, we anticipate the need to raise between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion in incremental long-term financing over the next five years. As I mentioned earlier, we've already satisfied $1.5 billion of this anticipated need. Strength for our balance sheet enables us to use that prove the mix of long-term debt and equity financing to target a 50% to 60% equity capitalization ratio, inclusive of short-term debt. This financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal 2027. To mitigate interest rate risk associated with our anticipated long-term debt financing needs beyond fiscal 2023, we currently have about $1.35 billion before starting interest rate swaps to effectively fix the treasury component of our total cost of financing at rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.2%. Additionally, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, once we repay the interim winter storm financing, we will have no floating rate debt, which further mitigates interest rate risk. See slide 12 for details. And our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 18 years and a weighted average cost of debt of about 3.78%, excluding the $2.2 billion of incremental financing related to Winter Storm Uri, and no material refinancing needs until fiscal 2027. From an equity perspective, utilizing our ATM program is a preferred method for raising equity. As I mentioned earlier, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal 2022 has fully satisfied our anticipated fiscal 2023 equity needs and a portion of our fiscal 2024 meetings. The execution of this plan to modernize our system through disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms and balanced long-term financing all supports our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2027. And as you can see on slides 25 through 27, the execution of this plan will also keep our customer bills very competitive from a cost perspective compared with other common utility bills in the customer household. Thank you for the time this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. As you heard this morning, we have taken several steps to mitigate execution risk in fiscal 2023. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our procurement team has done an excellent job of sourcing the materials needed to support our capital spending program in fiscal 2023. Our gas supply team has us well positioned for the upcoming heating season. And as Chris noted, our fiscal year 2023 financing costs are known, and we have hedged a significant portion of our financing needs beyond FY 2023. I'm very excited about our direction and long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy. The foundation has been set with a proven safety-driven accompanied with organic growth that yield 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share. Commensurate dividend per share growth supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of our natural gas investment and natural gas infrastructure. 98% of our rate base is situated in six or eight states that have passed legislation in support of energy choice. We have constructive regulatory mechanisms that support the necessary capital investments to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. We have a long runway of work to support the planned $15 billion in capital spending over the next five years. And as you can see on slide 16 and 17, this spending will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% of our total system. We also plan to replace between 120,000 and 170,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. Focusing on long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy and is reflected in the vital role we play in every community. That is delivering safe, reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and now we'll open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi good morning and thank you for the time today. Starting on the O&M side, your 2023 guidance implies a higher step-up relative to the 3% and 3.5% target. What are the drivers of the higher near-term O&M inflation? And then maybe more broadly, how do you think about O&M as a lever to manage customer bill impact overall?\nKevin Akers: Yes, I'll start and then hand it over to Chris. As we've moved out of the pandemic and moving forward, we continue to work with our vendors, our contractors. We've got long-term contracts in place. Some of those have been updated to reflect inflationary costs here recently. All of those are included in the numbers that we've laid out in the 2023 and the five-year plan there. Additionally, such things as line locating, leak survey, we've incurred some additional costs there. But again, all within the parameters laid out there, and we think we have ourselves well positioned to have an understanding of those costs as we continue to move forward. And as far as levers going forward, we have the same opportunity for levers that we had as we were in the pandemic. It's been like travel, even though we're back and trying to find our new normal on a day-to-day basis here, we're not fully traveling to all events or activities that we did pre-pandemic, taking advantage of the technology such as Teams or Zoom meetings, those sort of things that are out there. And some of the things that Chris outlined in our strategy, financing strategy and some of the outcomes there are all things that fold into reducing that O&M as well and trying to keep cost tamping down on a going-forward basis. So Chris, any additional thoughts? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. The only other thing that Kevin, I would add is, and Rich, you've heard us talk about this before the last couple of years in terms of levers. We are -- a lot of this O&M spending or virtually all of it is focused on safety, maintenance and compliance. And so we have the opportunity to continue to expand those types of activities. There is a little bit of inflation in the numbers, as Kevin alluded to, but we are not a just-in-time safety or compliance company. So, we're looking forward in 2023 to kind of staying ahead of the curve, if you will, on those type of activities. So if there is, in fact, a need to pull in a lever, as Kevin alluded to, again, we have that opportunity. So that's really what's driving it. There is really no -- anything new or different in the underlying activities. We're just seeing higher activities across the entire system, as Kevin mentioned. Line locating, we continue to do, enhanced leak survey activities, but we're also seeing a little bit of cost increases through inflation as well.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. That's very helpful color. And just a quick follow-up on that front. So I understand your point about some of these vendor contracts rolling in at higher inflationary costs, is this a trend you expect to continue into 2024? How do you see that kind of moderating over time to get back to the 3% to 3.5% outlook? \nKevin Akers: Yes, we continue to have conversations with our contractors and service providers as well. Right now, I think we're well positioned. I don't want to try and peer into a crystal ball to see what's out there. But again, we're very comfortable with what we have into our plan. As it sits today, the conversations we're having with our contractors, vendors, suppliers on cost as they see them going forward and that we've accurately captured those at this point.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. That makes sense. And just quickly switching gears, several months until Texas securitization proceeds, if I heard you correctly in the script, just any color on the process from who you are and what you're watching for on this front? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes, Richard, we're obviously in close contact with the Texas financing authority. There's a lot of questions that we and all the participating utilities are having and the process is moving along as quickly as they can. And I said within the next few months -- so we were hoping before the end of the calendar year to potentially slip into early 2023. But again, we're working diligently alongside our other participating utilities and the TPFA to get this wrapped up as quickly as possible.\nRichard Sunderland: Understood. Thank you for the time today.\nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nGabe Moreen: Hey good morning everyone. I'm just wondering if you could give us an update on sort of the customer growth outlook going forward here, whether you've seen any signs of changes given, I guess, the slowdown in the housing market? And whether you think you're going to be in that 1.5% to 2% annual range from a customer growth standpoint?\nKevin Akers: Thank you. Obviously, the existing housing market with the increased interest rates, we see some slowdown across our service territory for that. But the new home market, according to our builders, our developers, our folks on the ground across our service territories and the feedback we're getting has been less of an impact, if you will, than the existing home market. Even though we anticipate some decrease as we head into the first part of the year, some of that giving just a winter time period itself, some of that being an impact from the inflation. But what we're being told is there is a significant backlog of homes under construction today with approved buyers that have already locked in interest rates out there. And just to give you some example here, according to Texas Workforce Commission, just a couple of months ago, some of the data they're putting out, the Metroplex in particular, is experiencing pre-pandemic job growth with new hires exceeding 100,000 annually. The Austin area as well is seeing about 40,000 annual job growth. Unemployment in our service territories continues to remain low. And again, our builders and developers have a backlog of folks wanting qualified and ready to purchase homes. So good news to hear that our service territory, even with the inflationary environment we're currently in, continue to see strong job growth, strong economic growth. And our builders and developers are able to keep up with that demand. \nGabe Moreen: Great. And then speaking of interest rates and kind of locking them in, kudos for locking in interest rates for some time on new instruments. I'm just curious in the current interest rate environment, whether you're going to continue to lock in interest rates in anticipation of debt issuance down the line? And then I guess a related question to the minimum book tax. You talked about that potentially hitting kind of towards the end of the five-year plan. Does that change at all the financing plans given the interest expense is tax deductible, would you shift a little bit more? Or to try to, I guess, minimize cash taxes, appreciating that, that's not for several years? \nChristopher Forsythe: Sure. Yes. Gabe, all the credit goes to -- Dan is here, his treasury team for locking in those rates, and we had the opportunity. We continue to look for opportunities to hedge interest rates. Obviously, in a rising price environment right now -- or rate environment, excuse me, it's challenging, but it's something that we will continue to look at, certainly month in and month out, as we continue to watch where the Fed is going with rate increases. With respect to the corporate minimum tax that cash need and therefore, the related financing is already assumed in the current five-year plan. We're expecting that tax to hit sometime in the next four to five years. The size of the impact is still a little bit TBD as we look at where the final rules around depreciation, how repairs are handled, that type of thing. But we have made some assumptions in that plan and it's reflected in our financing needs. \nGabe Moreen: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Wondering if you could talk just a little bit more about the customer bill outlook here? And whether you think there could be any increased pressure to manage rate increases going forward? Are there steps that you're looking at to take just to manage that outlook? \nKevin Akers: Yes, I'll start. Again, it all begins first with our gas supply team and their ability to go out and get reliable, securable supply. And I think, Dan, for us, if you look at the major components of the bill, that's the commodity portion. You look at what's driving that upstream today. You're currently just short of 800 total rigs working in the U.S. today, about half of that over in the Permian. You look at where we sit today at Waha, it's $2 and some change. Right now, the forward look on that April out is in the $2 range. Even on the NYMEX, you look forward, there's a four handle out there. So all to say, I think the outlook in current conditions as we kind of work ourselves through this heating season forward. looks good for the commodity price to mitigate some as well on the customer bill. The other thing that I think is important for us to think about when it comes to affordability out there are the actions that our team, our public affairs team and our local corporate communications team do day in and day out at the state level and the federal level, advocating for light heat [ph] funding and state funding for energy assistance agencies out there. And just to give you an example, this year, our team was able to help almost 70,000 customers gain access to $34 million. So there's a lot of components that go into it. It's being able to secure reliable gas at a reasonable price. It's the ability to get customers the help when they need it. It's also the messaging to customers about what we're seeing. We released now three communications to our customers advising them of ways they can conserve on their energy bill as well. \nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And then wondering if you could comment on the NTSB report that was published last month related to the gas incident from a year ago? And just what initiatives are being undertaken internally in response to that? \nKevin Akers: Yes, we'll let the NTSB report standby itself. We're not going to comment on the NTSB report. We are a party to the investigation. We work closely with them and other parties to the investigation. I'll point you to our operational and report as well that's filed with NTSB, it outlines all of our safety initiatives, findings as well. \nDavid Arcaro: Okay, got it. Thanks. And just one quick follow-up on the tax side of things. Is there a cash tax level that you're expecting in the near term or for 2023 just as kind of a starting point as to what cash tax rate you're experiencing under the current business? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes, in fiscal 2022, we were, I've got to say, a very minimal cash taxpayer, both from a federal and state perspective, very low double digits. We anticipate that to be similar for fiscal 2023 through 2025. And I said 2026, 2027, that's when we expect in that four to five-year period when the ANT [ph] will kick in. \nDavid Arcaro: Perfect. Okay, thanks so much.\nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thank you for the time. Hope you guys are well? Just if I could go back to where Rich started at the top of the Q&A here. If I recall back last quarter, you guys said several months on the tax securitization issue. Can you talk about the -- just what that delay has been? And ultimately, what hoops need to be crossed here in terms of bringing this to finality? I get that there's probably a lot of administrative considerations, a lot of coordination with the state here. But just in terms of practically bringing this securitization to a close on the $2.2 billion, how do you think about what's driven a little bit of this delay ultimately? And your level of confidence that you'll be able to get this thing resolved ahead of the March timeline, which admittedly is well in excess of the next several months.\nKevin Akers: Yes, I'll start and then hand it over to Chris. Again, we have great confidence in the process that the legislature laid out that the Railroad Commission has approved and that the TPFA is going through now. Our role now is just supporting with questions -- answers to questions that the groups have. We're not sitting at the table or anything like that. We are just responding to Q&A or information request that sort of thing at this point. So again, we remain very confident in the process and the ability of the teams to get the answers they need to move forward. So, Chris, anything additional?\nChristopher Forsythe: I think it's pretty well said, Kevin. And just as a reminder, too, a securitization of this nature, I think, is new for the state. And so they're just making sure all the and -- all the Is are dotted and all the Ts are crossed.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Right. So it's truly sort of administrative in execution in terms of the shift in time line? It seems like it and driven by the state more than you guys? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes, absolutely.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you. And then if I can go back to the conversation on O&M as well. Obviously, pressure across the industry, you guys highlighting it in your 2023 numbers. If I can overlay that with the regulatory strategy as it exists today. I mean, as you think about your ability to earn your returns and just accelerate time lines on any kind of regulatory proceedings here, is that shifting anything at all? Obviously, you have a plethora of associated mechanisms across your portfolio of utilities. But can you speak a little bit to the extent to which this is shifting and/or accelerating some time line for recovery? Again, obviously, this in tandem with your elevated level of spending. I'm just curious if you can comment on that.\nKevin Akers: Yes. Again, Julien, I'll start, and Chris can add any comments. If you look at our mechanisms, most of our mechanisms are annual in nature. So they're on prescribed time lines, filing dates, orders on the back end of those sort of things. Those are prescribed. We're going to continue to follow those. Our projects are well laid out as you've seen. You hope for a long time now and how we like to go through planning our fiscal year and then the subsequent four years after that to get to our five-year plans. The only thing that's moving forward or backward is our safety and reliability investments depending on what we see from a need, a growth need, a compliance need, a safety need, those sort of things are levers for us to move things forward or backward to meet the growing demand on our customer system or safety on our system. \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes, and the one thing, Julien, I want to add to that, too, is that with our -- the regulatory strategy, the annual mechanisms, it's a smaller increase, if you will, each year. It also gives us the opportunity to stay in regular contact with our regulatory partners to -- so they understand what we're doing from a total spend perspective. And that's a part of the strategy as well is keeping them well informed of what's going on in our operations, what we're seeing from a safety, maintenance, compliance perspective so that when we do have the other filing in front of them, they're aware of what's included in that filing. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you gentlemen. Appreciate it.\nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: It appears that there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Dan Meziere for closing comments. \nDaniel Meziere: Thank you. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call will be available for replay on our website through December 31st, 2022. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Akers",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and are glad you joined us this morning. As tomorrow's Veterans Day, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and to say thank you to those who served in our own forces and approximately to the 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates as part of the nearly 20 million Americans who have bravely served our country. Thank you for your service. Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $5.60, which represents the 20th consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in the call. I will begin today's call with a review of our fiscal 2022 accomplishments, provide an update on key pipeline projects, and we'll close with some thoughts about fiscal 2023. Our success in fiscal 2022 was once again reflected by the commitment and ongoing effort of all 4,800 Atmos Energy employees. I've said it before, and I will say it again, they are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company. Fiscal 2022 was our 11th year of executing our proven investment strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. Over that 11-year period, we invested over $15 billion in modernizing and expanding our natural gas systems, replacing approximately 6,300 miles of distribution pipeline, approximately 440,000 steel service lines and over 1,200 miles of transmission pipeline. That same 11-year period, we added nearly 400,000 customers, including over 62,000 customers during fiscal 2022. And we continue to see strong natural gas demand from new and expanding industrial customers. In fiscal 2022, we added approximately 50 new industrial customers with an estimated annual load of 20 Bcf per year once they are fully operational. Over the last three years, we have added nearly 120 industrial customers with an estimated annual load of 35 Bcf. And these customers are from various industries, manufacturing, food processing, hospitals, automotive and distilleries. Our fiscal 2022 capital investment of over $2.4 billion supported the modernization of our distribution and transmission systems through the replacement of 715 miles of distribution pipe, the replacement of more than 47,000 service lines, of which 24,000 were steel service lines and over 155 miles of transmission pipe, all to further enhance system safety and reliability. Additionally, we installed over 200,000 wireless meter reading devices and now have over two million such devices across our system. I want to take this opportunity to highlight and thank our procurement team for their focus, dedication and continued outstanding efforts to have the necessary materials and resources available for our distribution, transmission and storage projects. Just as they had done throughout the past decade, their strategic planning efforts have us well positioned for continued execution upon our strategy in fiscal 2023. For example, we currently maintain about six months of inventory for our distribution and transmission operations needs and have ordered all of our anticipated steel pipe needs for fiscal year 2023. We continue to coordinate with our vendors and pipe mills as we place our FY 2024 steel pipe orders. Now, I want to provide you an update on a few of our larger Atmos Pipeline-Texas projects and highlight their value in safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification that they provide APT and its customers. We are nearing the completion of APT's third salt dump cavern project at Bethel, which will provide more than 6 Bcf of additional working gas storage capacity. We began selling the new cavern this week and remain on track to place the cavern in service by the end of the calendar year. We are also nearing completion of the second phase of our Line X integrity replacement project, which we will replace 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline. This project is also on track to be completed by the end of this calendar year. As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas, and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT system as well as transportation customers that move gas from Waha to Katy. We continue to make good progress with our line S-2 project that has three phases. As a reminder, Line S-2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Phase one of the project replaced 21 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline and was placed into service the first quarter of fiscal 2022. In Phase 2 of Line S-2, we'll replace 17 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. We expect this to be in service late calendar this year. The final phase of this project is anticipated to be in service late calendar 2024. And again, this project will provide additional supply from the shale plays east and bring that gas into the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. To support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin and Williamson County, Texas, we have begun work on a 22-mile 36-inch line that will connect the southern end of APT system with the 42-inch Permian highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This line is currently expected to be placed into service during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. As you've heard in my previous updates, our customer service agents and service technicians provide exceptional customer service and support. During fiscal year 2022, our agents and technicians received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers. Thank you team for taking exceptional care of our customers every day. Our strategic focus on digital build delivery and payment options is yielding benefits as over 50% of our customers are receiving electronic bills while the utility industry average is 33%. And 81% of the total payments we received as of September 30 this year were electronic methods of payments such as bank drafts, credit cards and online banking. During fiscal 2022, we provided approximately 260,000 hours of training. And in September, we reached a milestone of delivering 2 million training hours since the opening of our Charles K. Vaughan training center in 2010. In fiscal 2022, we continued enhancing our comprehensive environmental strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from our operations in the five key areas of operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers. Our efforts in fiscal 2022 to reduce emissions and our environmental impact included our ongoing distribution and transmission system modernization programs that I mentioned earlier. And at our 5 APT storage fields, we completed the installation of gas cloud imaging technology. These 360-degree fixed-based cameras will continuously monitor our compression and storage field assets for methane emissions. And if necessary, the technology will send alerts, including images to our plant operations employees in addition to text and e-mail alerts. Additionally, in fiscal 2022, we continued our installation of advanced wellhead leak detection at our distribution storage facilities. And we expanded our system monitoring technologies by adding additional advanced mobile leak detection vehicles as well as implemented technology to capture methane emissions from pipeline maintenance activities. From a fleet and facilities perspective, we began transitioning our fleet to gasoline hybrid light-duty vehicles and to CNG for our heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, we are adding CNG refueling stations at our Fort-Worth and Round Rock facilities, both of which are scheduled for completion by end of this calendar year. At our corporate data center, we installed a natural gas-powered fuel cell to generate high efficiency, grid-independent electricity with low emissions. The fuel cells reduced our emissions at the data center by 27%. This is truly another example of how natural gas plays a pivotal role in lowering greenhouse gas emissions while increasing reliability to our critical facility. We have 2 new service centers that are pending leadership in energy and environmental design or LEED certification. If certified as expected, this will be the total number of LEED-certified facilities we have to 17 or approximately 11% of our total facilities. We are currently transporting approximately 8 Bcf a year of RNG across our system for end-use customers, and we are evaluating over 30 opportunities that could further expand the amount of RNG that we are transporting today. Finally, we are partnering with local habitat for humanity organizations in each of our eight states to provide families with zero net energy homes. These homes use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and advanced insulation materials to produce more energy than they consume. During fiscal 2022, we completed five new zero net energy homes in Texas and one home in Ansbro, Kentucky, and we are scheduled to complete a home in Jackson, Mississippi, this December. We recently broke ground on a home in Dublin, Virginia and expect to complete construction in the spring of 2023. The seven ZNE Homes that we have completed in the last 14 months demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner. To wrap up fiscal 2022, our 4,800 Atmos Energy employees through our fueling safe and thriving communities initiatives made a difference in the lives of others by supporting schools and students with books, meals and snacks. We honored our health care workers and first responders by supporting more than 140 nonprofits, dedicated to taking care of our hometown heroes, supplying them with meals and needed supplies. We planted trees and worked in our community gardens. Our team hosted utility fairs and energy assistant blitzes to support our share of the [Indiscernible] program for over 11,000 customers and donated $7 million of financial support. And for local -- and for 300 local food banks and shelters, the financial and voluntary resources [Indiscernible] provided translated into nearly 9 million meals for our neighbors in need across our 1,400 communities. I am very proud of our team because of their investment of time, talent and resources, we are making a difference in our communities. A successful fiscal 2022 has us well positioned as we move into the second decade of our strategy. I'll now turn the call over to Chris, who will provide some additional color around our fiscal 2022 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2023 guidance and updated five-year plan through fiscal 2027. I will then return with some closing comments. Chris, over to you. Thank you, Chris. As you heard this morning, we have taken several steps to mitigate execution risk in fiscal 2023. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our procurement team has done an excellent job of sourcing the materials needed to support our capital spending program in fiscal 2023. Our gas supply team has us well positioned for the upcoming heating season. And as Chris noted, our fiscal year 2023 financing costs are known, and we have hedged a significant portion of our financing needs beyond FY 2023. I'm very excited about our direction and long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy. The foundation has been set with a proven safety-driven accompanied with organic growth that yield 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share. Commensurate dividend per share growth supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of our natural gas investment and natural gas infrastructure. 98% of our rate base is situated in six or eight states that have passed legislation in support of energy choice. We have constructive regulatory mechanisms that support the necessary capital investments to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. We have a long runway of work to support the planned $15 billion in capital spending over the next five years. And as you can see on slide 16 and 17, this spending will support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe or about 6% of our total system. We also plan to replace between 120,000 and 170,000 steel service lines, which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. Focusing on long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy and is reflected in the vital role we play in every community. That is delivering safe, reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and now we'll open the call for questions. Yes, I'll start and then hand it over to Chris. As we've moved out of the pandemic and moving forward, we continue to work with our vendors, our contractors. We've got long-term contracts in place. Some of those have been updated to reflect inflationary costs here recently. All of those are included in the numbers that we've laid out in the 2023 and the five-year plan there. Additionally, such things as line locating, leak survey, we've incurred some additional costs there. But again, all within the parameters laid out there, and we think we have ourselves well positioned to have an understanding of those costs as we continue to move forward. And as far as levers going forward, we have the same opportunity for levers that we had as we were in the pandemic. It's been like travel, even though we're back and trying to find our new normal on a day-to-day basis here, we're not fully traveling to all events or activities that we did pre-pandemic, taking advantage of the technology such as Teams or Zoom meetings, those sort of things that are out there. And some of the things that Chris outlined in our strategy, financing strategy and some of the outcomes there are all things that fold into reducing that O&M as well and trying to keep cost tamping down on a going-forward basis. So Chris, any additional thoughts? Yes, we continue to have conversations with our contractors and service providers as well. Right now, I think we're well positioned. I don't want to try and peer into a crystal ball to see what's out there. But again, we're very comfortable with what we have into our plan. As it sits today, the conversations we're having with our contractors, vendors, suppliers on cost as they see them going forward and that we've accurately captured those at this point. Thank you. Thank you. Obviously, the existing housing market with the increased interest rates, we see some slowdown across our service territory for that. But the new home market, according to our builders, our developers, our folks on the ground across our service territories and the feedback we're getting has been less of an impact, if you will, than the existing home market. Even though we anticipate some decrease as we head into the first part of the year, some of that giving just a winter time period itself, some of that being an impact from the inflation.

So again, we remain very confident in the process and the ability of the teams to get the answers they need to move forward. So, Chris, anything additional? Yes. Again, Julien, I'll start, and Chris can add any comments. If you look at our mechanisms, most of our mechanisms are annual in nature. So they're on prescribed time lines, filing dates, orders on the back end of those sort of things. Those are prescribed. We're going to continue to follow those. Our projects are well laid out as you've seen. You hope for a long time now and how we like to go through planning our fiscal year and then the subsequent four years after that to get to our five-year plans. The only thing that's moving forward or backward is our safety and reliability investments depending on what we see from a need, a growth need, a compliance need, a safety need, those sort of things are levers for us to move things forward or backward to meet the growing demand on our customer system or safety on our system. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As Kevin mentioned, fiscal 2022 diluted earnings per share was $5.60, which represents a 9.4% increase over fiscal 2021. Our performance reflects the continued execution of our proven strategy of modernizing natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems, recovering our cost timely and financing our operations in a balanced manner. We also continue to experience strong customer growth, and we saw a significant improvement in our bad debt expense, both of which offset lower customer consumption and increased O&M spending. Slides four through six provide some details summarizing our financial performance for the fiscal year. Consolidated operating income increased $220 million from rate adjustments implemented in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022. These adjustments were primarily driven by safety liability and system expansion spending. Approximately 68% of this increase is recognized in our distribution segment. We continue to see robust customer growth in our distribution segment, which increased operating income by an additional $15 million. This growth offset a $17 million decrease in consumption, most of which occurred during the second fiscal quarter. Additionally, we experienced a $31 million increase in consolidated O&M expense. O&M, excluding bad debt expense, increased $56 million, primarily driven by increased pipeline maintenance activities in both of our segments and employee-related costs compared with the prior year. This increase was partially offset by a $25 million decrease in bad debt expense as we were able to perform collection activities for our full fiscal year. In comparison, in the prior year, we resumed collection activities late in our third fiscal quarter. This decrease also reflects the exceptional work of our customer service team in assisting customers with their bills. During fiscal 2022, we arranged only $34 million of funding to help 67,000 customers with their monthly bill. As a result, our bad debt expense in fiscal 2022 was in line with our pre-pandemic experience. Finally, reductions in fiscal 2022 revenue associated with the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities reduced operating income by approximately $112 million. This reduction was substantially offset by lower income tax expense. Consolidated capital spending increased 24% or $475 million to $2.4 billion, with 88% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects the increased system modernization, integrity and expansion spending to meet the growing natural gas demand in our service territories. Approximately 90% of this spending began to earn a return within six months of the test period end. We accomplished this by implementing $216 million of annualized operating income increases excluding the amortization of excess deferred tax liabilities. And since the end of the fiscal year, we have reached agreement with our regulators in an additional $112 million in annualized operating income increases during our fiscal 2023 first quarter. As of today, we have two filings pending exceeding about $16 million. Slides 29 through 38 summarize our regulatory activities for fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2022, we completed over $1.6 billion of long-term debt and equity financing to support our ongoing operations. We fully satisfied our fiscal 2022 equity needs through our ATM equity sales program. As of September 30, we had about $777 million available under existing equity forward arrangements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal 2023 needs and a portion of our anticipated fiscal 2024 needs. This equity financing complemented the $800 million of long-term debt financing we issued during fiscal 2022. We also continue to make progress in securitization. In Texas, we anticipate receiving $2.0 billion from the Texas public financing authorities within the next few months. We'll use the proceeds and available cash on hand to fully retire the $2.2 billion in interim winter storm financing that matures in March of 2023. This will eliminate all of our exposure to floating rate debt. In Kansas, on October 25, the Kansas Corporation Commission issued a financing order authorizing us to securitize $118 million in gas and over cost over a seven to 10-year period. We anticipate completing the securitization process by the end of our second fiscal quarter. As a result of these financing activities, our equity capitalization at the end of fiscal year, excluding the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing or 61.3%. Additionally, we finished the fiscal year with approximately $3.1 billion of available liquidity. In October, we issued $800 million of long-term debt through two tranches. First tranche was a $500 million 30-year senior note with a coupon of 5. 75%. We had financially hedges tranced and received $197 million upon settlement of forward starting interest rate swap, which reduced the effective rate of 4.5%. Second tranche was a $300 million 10-year senior note with a coupon of 5.5% because we have already satisfied our fiscal 2023 equity needs through our ATM program, this transaction and completed our anticipated fiscal 2023 financing activities. Details for our financing activities and our financial profile can found on slides nine and 12. Finally, we finished the fiscal year with a very well-funded pension plan. Based on the current funded position of the plan and the funding requirements in the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we do not anticipate the need to make a minimum required contribution during fiscal 2023. In addition to addressing our fiscal 2023 financing needs, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we've also been preparing to ensure supply reliability and competitive natural gas prices for our customers for the upcoming winter heating season. Our gas supply team has done an outstanding job preparing for the upcoming winter heating season. Our proprietary and contracted storage is over 96% full. Additionally, we have physically and financially hedged 23% of our expected winter purchase requirements. Through the use of storage and physical and financial hedges, we have stabilized prices for just under half for our normal winter usage in the mid-$5 range. The remainder of our anticipated gas supply needs will be satisfied through a combination of base load purchases at first-of-month prices, peaking contracts and storage purchases when needed. Today, we have transportation capacity of 38 pipelines across our eight-state footprint, which provides our team access to a wide variety of liquid-traded producing basins. Further, a significant portion of our gas supply needs will continue to be sourced from Waha, which has traditionally traded below NYMEX and Henry Hub pricing. As a reminder, all prudently incurred gas costs recovered through purchased gas cost mechanisms generally over 12 months. This calculation generally involves a weighted average approach, which helps to smoothly impact on customer bills. Additionally, as a reminder, we have the opportunity to recover the gas cost portion of bad debt expense through a purchase guidance cost mechanisms in five states, which covers approximately 81% of our distribution customer base. Finally, we continue to actively communicate with our customers about how they can mitigate the potential impact of higher gas prices through energy conservations and how we can help by offering installment plans and budget billing plans and locating energy assistant agencies. Looking forward, yesterday, we initiated our fiscal 2023 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.90 to $6.10. Consistent with prior years, we expect about two-thirds of our earnings will come from our distribution segment. Details surrounding our fiscal 2023 guidance can be found on slides 20 and 21. Fiscal 2023 capital spending is expected to approximate $2.7 billion. Already 5% of this spending is expected to begin earning a return within six months of the test period end. Substantially, all this increase we incurred in our distribution segment to support our system modernization efforts. Spending on our pipeline storage segment is expected to be in line with fiscal 2022 levels and is expected to represent approximately one-third for consolidated capital spending in fiscal 2023. And yesterday, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 156th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. The indicated annual dividend for fiscal 2023 is $2.96, an 8.8% increase over fiscal 2022. Slide 19 summarizes the key themes under our fiscal 2023 five-year plan. In short, these themes are very consistent with what we have been presenting over the last several five-year plans. Over the next five years, we anticipate earnings will grow annually at 6% to 8%. By fiscal 2027, we anticipate earnings per share to be in the range of $7.65 to $8.05. We also anticipate dividends per share to increase annually in line with earnings per share. Continued spending for system replacement and modernization and expansion will be the primary driver for the anticipated increase in capital spending, net income and earnings per share from fiscal 2027. This plan anticipates total capital spending of approximately $15 billion. This level of spending will continue to support rate base growth of about 11% to 13% per year, which translates into an estimated rate base of approximately $25 billion in fiscal 2027, up from $14 billion at the end of fiscal 2022. From an O&M perspective, we will continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety. For fiscal 2023, we anticipate O&M to range from $700 million to $720 million, and we've assumed O&M inflation of 3% to 3.5% annually through fiscal 2027 off of FY 2022 levels. In addition to the spending plans I outlined, we have assumed approximately $435 million in excess deferred tax refunds over the next five years. We anticipate about 65% of this amount will be refunded during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. As a result, we expect our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2023 to range between 10% and 12%. We've also planned for becoming a material cash taxpayer in the back half of the five-year plan because of the 15% corporate minimum tax that was included in the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed this past August. We've continued to finance our operations in a balanced fashion using a combination of long-term debt and equity to preserve the strength of our balance sheet. Excluding securitization, we anticipate the need to raise between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion in incremental long-term financing over the next five years. As I mentioned earlier, we've already satisfied $1.5 billion of this anticipated need. Strength for our balance sheet enables us to use that prove the mix of long-term debt and equity financing to target a 50% to 60% equity capitalization ratio, inclusive of short-term debt. This financing plan has been fully reflected in our earnings per share guidance through fiscal 2027. To mitigate interest rate risk associated with our anticipated long-term debt financing needs beyond fiscal 2023, we currently have about $1.35 billion before starting interest rate swaps to effectively fix the treasury component of our total cost of financing at rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.2%. Additionally, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, once we repay the interim winter storm financing, we will have no floating rate debt, which further mitigates interest rate risk. See slide 12 for details. And our debt profile remains very manageable with a weighted average maturity of 18 years and a weighted average cost of debt of about 3.78%, excluding the $2.2 billion of incremental financing related to Winter Storm Uri, and no material refinancing needs until fiscal 2027. From an equity perspective, utilizing our ATM program is a preferred method for raising equity. As I mentioned earlier, the equity forwards we executed during fiscal 2022 has fully satisfied our anticipated fiscal 2023 equity needs and a portion of our fiscal 2024 meetings. The execution of this plan to modernize our system through disciplined capital spending, timely recovery of those investments through our various regulatory mechanisms and balanced long-term financing all supports our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2027. And as you can see on slides 25 through 27, the execution of this plan will also keep our customer bills very competitive from a cost perspective compared with other common utility bills in the customer household. Thank you for the time this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin? Yes. The only other thing that Kevin, I would add is, and Rich, you've heard us talk about this before the last couple of years in terms of levers. We are -- a lot of this O&M spending or virtually all of it is focused on safety, maintenance and compliance. And so we have the opportunity to continue to expand those types of activities. There is a little bit of inflation in the numbers, as Kevin alluded to, but we are not a just-in-time safety or compliance company. So, we're looking forward in 2023 to kind of staying ahead of the curve, if you will, on those type of activities. So if there is, in fact, a need to pull in a lever, as Kevin alluded to, again, we have that opportunity. So that's really what's driving it. There is really no -- anything new or different in the underlying activities. We're just seeing higher activities across the entire system, as Kevin mentioned. Line locating, we continue to do, enhanced leak survey activities, but we're also seeing a little bit of cost increases through inflation as well. Yes, Richard, we're obviously in close contact with the Texas financing authority. There's a lot of questions that we and all the participating utilities are having and the process is moving along as quickly as they can. And I said within the next few months -- so we were hoping before the end of the calendar year to potentially slip into early 2023. But again, we're working diligently alongside our other participating utilities and the TPFA to get this wrapped up as quickly as possible. Thank you. Sure. Yes. Gabe, all the credit goes to -- Dan is here, his treasury team for locking in those rates, and we had the opportunity. We continue to look for opportunities to hedge interest rates. Obviously, in a rising price environment right now -- or rate environment, excuse me, it's challenging, but it's something that we will continue to look at, certainly month in and month out, as we continue to watch where the Fed is going with rate increases. With respect to the corporate minimum tax that cash need and therefore, the related financing is already assumed in the current five-year plan. We're expecting that tax to hit sometime in the next four to five years. The size of the impact is still a little bit TBD as we look at where the final rules around depreciation, how repairs are handled, that type of thing. But we have made some assumptions in that plan and it's reflected in our financing needs. Yes, in fiscal 2022, we were, I've got to say, a very minimal cash taxpayer, both from a federal and state perspective, very low double digits. We anticipate that to be similar for fiscal 2023 through 2025. And I said 2026, 2027, that's when we expect in that four to five-year period when the ANT [ph] will kick in. Thank you. I think it's pretty well said, Kevin. And just as a reminder, too, a securitization of this nature, I think, is new for the state. And so they're just making sure all the and -- all the Is are dotted and all the Ts are crossed. Yes, absolutely. Yes, and the one thing, Julien, I want to add to that, too, is that with our -- the regulatory strategy, the annual mechanisms, it's a smaller increase, if you will, each year. It also gives us the opportunity to stay in regular contact with our regulatory partners to -- so they understand what we're doing from a total spend perspective. And that's a part of the strategy as well is keeping them well informed of what's going on in our operations, what we're seeing from a safety, maintenance, compliance perspective so that when we do have the other filing in front of them, they're aware of what's included in that filing. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to Atmos Energy's Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Meziere: Thank you, Brock. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings call.  With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act.  Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 33 and are more fully described in our SEC filings.  With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, our Senior VP and CFO. Chris?\nChristopher Forsythe: Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy.  Fiscal '22 third quarter net income increased $129 million or $0.92 per diluted share -- $102 million, sorry, $0.78 per diluted share in the prior year quarter and fiscal year-to-date net income was $703 million or $5.12 per diluted share compared with net income of $617 million or $4.77 per diluted share in the prior year period.  Slides 5 and 6 provide operating income highlights for each of our segments for the 3 and 9 months ended June 30. I will focus on some of the more significant drivers underlying our fiscal year-to-date performance.  Rate increases in both our operating segments totaled $172 million, primarily driven by increased safety and reliability spending and system expansion. Approximately 71% of these rate adjustments were recognized in our distribution segment.  We continue to see robust customer growth in our distribution segment, which increased operating income by an additional $13 million. This growth offset a $13 million decrease in consumption, most of which occurred during assessed in the second fiscal quarter. We did not see the same trend continuing in the third fiscal quarter as consumption increased by about $3 million quarter-over-quarter.  Additionally, we experienced a $25 million increase in consolidated O&M expense primarily driven by increased pipeline maintenance activities and employee-related costs compared with the prior year, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.  Finally, reductions in fiscal '22 revenue associated with the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities reduced operating income by $103 million. This reduction was substantially offset by lower income tax expense.  Consolidated capital spending increased 27% or $368 million to $1.7 billion, with 87% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects increased system modernization, system integrity and system expansion spending to meet the growing natural gas demand in our service territories.  We remain on track to spend $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year. On the regulatory front, we have completed approximately $216 million of annualized regulatory outcomes excluding refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities. Of this amount, we have implemented $202 million, and we implemented the remainder on September 1.  Additionally, we had about $127 million in progress. Slides 15 through 32 provide additional detail around the regulatory activities. Our fiscal third quarter financing activities were focused on pricing our fiscal '23 equity needs.  During the quarter, we executed 4 sales agreements under our ATM program for approximately 2.9 million shares for $337 million. And we sold agreements on 731,000 shares for approximately $81 million in net proceeds.  As of June 30, we have approximately $700 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sale agreement, which satisfies substantially all of our anticipated equity needs through fiscal '23. We finished the third quarter with an equity capitalization of 61.7%, excluding the $2.2 billion of interim winter storm financing and with total liquidity of approximately $3.5 billion.  Additional details for our financing activities, including our equity forward arrangements as well as our financial profile on Slides 8 through 11. Turning now to securitization. During the third quarter, we continued to make progress on that front.  In Texas, the Texas Public Financing Authority continues its work on the statewide securitization program, and we believe it is on track to be completed within the next few months. As a reminder, once we receive the securitization funds, we will fully retire the $2.2 billion in interim Winter Storm financing.  In Kansas, during the third quarter, we filed our application for a financing order. Based on the approved procedural schedule, we anticipate receiving the financing order during our fiscal '23 first quarter.  In closing, our fiscal year-to-date performance was in line with our expectations and supports the reaffirmation of our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.50 to $5.60 per diluted share.  Slides 13 and 14 provide additional details around our guidance. The ranges included in those pages have not changed since the last quarter. However, we do anticipate our O&M interest expense to be at the higher end of the ranges provided.  Thank you for your time today. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin?\nJohn Akers: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The fiscal year-to-date results, Chris just shared reflect the continued focus on our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services.  And supporting that vision of our 4,700 dedicated employees executing our safety and reliability investment strategy and our prudent regulatory and financing strategies. These strategies, combined with a strong portfolio of assets will continue to support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2026.  We continue to see robust growth in demand for natural gas in our service territories. During the 12-month period ended June 30, 2022, we added nearly 59,000 new residential customers which represents a 1.8% increase. And during the third quarter of this year, we added 13 new industrial customers that have an expected annual natural gas usage of 5 Bcf when they are fully operational.  Fiscal year-to-date, we have added 28 new industrial customers that have an expected annual natural gas usage of 10 Bcf when they are fully operational. As you heard me say before, on a volumetric basis, that 10 Bcf of annual industrial customer usage is equivalent to adding 170,000 residential customers.  Last month, we released our most recent corporate responsibility and sustainability report, which illustrates our environmental, social and governance strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from operations in the 5 key areas of operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers.  The report also summarizes the commitments as well as the progress made towards executing that strategy during fiscal 2021 and early fiscal 2022. I wanted to comment on one of the exciting highlights in the corporate responsibility report. That is our Zero Net Energy Homes initiative.  By partnering with local Habitat for Humanity organizations in each of our 8 states, we are providing families with Zero Net Energy Homes that use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and insulation to produce more energy than they consume over the course of the year all in a cost-effective manner.  Again, as you've heard us mention before, we've completed our first Zero Net Energy Home in Evans, Colorado in September of 2021. And during the third quarter of this year, we completed a second Zero Net Energy Home in Taylor, Texas located just north of Austin.  Construction is underway on 3 additional Zero Net Energy Homes in Dallas, one in Jackson, Mississippi, one in Owensboro, Kentucky, and all these are scheduled for completion by November of this year. Additionally, groundbreaking is scheduled later this calendar year for an additional 5 Zero Net Energy homes, one in Dublin, Virginia, one in Colombia, Tennessee and 3 in Lubbock, Texas.  These homes provide families with a comfortable natural gas home that demonstrates the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner.  Our fiscal year performance and participation in community projects such as these as our Zero Net Energy homes, reflect the commitment, dedication, focus and effort of our 4,700 Atmos Energy employees as they see a vital role in our 1,400 communities by safely delivering reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  We appreciate your time this morning, and now we'll open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.\nKody Clark: It's Kody Clark on for Julien. So first, wondering if you can walk us through the main drivers for the remainder of the year. It seems like you're well ahead based on year-to-date results, rate increases for the remainder of the year and your updated expectations on O&M and interest. I guess I'm just trying to get a better understanding of your expectations within that $550 million to $560 million range.\nChristopher Forsythe: You muted there a little bit. But if I'm understanding correctly, you're looking for the main drivers for the remainder of the fiscal year to try to give you some color around where we might fall within the guidance range?\nKody Clark: That's right. I'm sorry about that. Hopefully, you can hear me better now.\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes, much better now. Thank you. Yes. I mean, you've touched on a couple of them. The main drivers again on the O&M front, we have some compliance work that we're doing some additional system integrity work.  The timing may shift between September or in October, just based on when the work is performed. We're also monitoring our bad debt expense levels. This is our kind of our big collection season, although the bad debt expense is down year-over-year.  Typically, the fourth quarter -- our fourth fiscal quarter is a time where we have increased collection activities, we're kind of monitoring that as well. And then finally, on the interest expense front, we do have the floating rate note as a component of the interim Winter Storm financing and prices have increased somewhat over the last fiscal year, which is driving our interest expense a little bit higher. And that could potentially tick up once the rates have reset later here in the fourth fiscal quarter.  So those are some of the things that we're monitoring in terms of the guidance range. I would say at this point, where we ended the fiscal quarter or on a year-to-date basis, we were in line with our expectations, and we stand behind the guidance that we put out today.\nKody Clark: Understood. Okay. And as we look toward FY '23, curious if you can opine on how you see inflation cascading through your O&M budget and capital plan.  What sort of trends are you expecting into next year? And any mitigating measures that you're thinking about?\nJohn Akers: Yes. Kody, I'll start off, and then Chris can jump in there. As we've talked about before, a lot of our contracts that we have in place have been refreshed recently with our contractors and our vendors.  A lot of our large projects we do, whether they're on the med tech side or the APT side, our bid projects there. We feel good about how those have been coming in.  As Chris said, we continue to work on our integrity management and compliance projects. We think those are all in good standing. And on the procurement front, we -- as we talked about before, we try to run well ahead to make sure we have enough inventory on hand to complete and stay ahead of our compliance and pipeline replacement work.  Our team tries to keep about a 6-month inventory on hand and may even be looking to push that out towards the 9-month level. We have all the pipe either in the ground or on the ground to complete our 2022 projects.  We have the pipe in the works right now for '23 and are looking for material out into the '24 period. So as you can see, we're taking advantage when we can to make sure we've got the best pricing that our materials are available, and we can continue to move forward at the best and most efficient manner.\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. And Kevin, I'll add to that. I mean you spot on with just the keeping up annually with the increases on the O&M front. But I'll also comment on the treasury side as well.  I mean our team has done an excellent job trying to get ahead of rising interest rates, with the exception of the interim Winter Storm financing, which we will take out once the securitization funds are received that we have no floating rate debt.  We have executed nearly $2 billion in forward starting interest rate swaps on future planned debt issuances beyond fiscal 2022 at very attractive rates, and we've done that here over the last year or so. And we're really well positioned.  When you look at our overall weighted average cost of debt today, it's at 3.8%, which is very beneficial for our customers. And finally, we don't have any significant near-term refinancing needs. Our most -- I guess the most current one that's out there right now is about $500 million due in 2027.  So from a balance sheet and financing perspective, we're also have taken advantage over the last year or so, we're trying to lock in some of the lower rates for the benefit of the customers, which also helps mitigate the impact on the customer bill.\nJohn Akers: Yes. Kody, just to finish that off. And again, some of the same things, tools that we had in our toolkit, if you will, as we were entering and coming through the pandemic are still there for us.  We haven't started back a lot of travel. We're going to the most sense of urgency meetings, those sort of things still taking advantage of teams. So everything that we had in our toolkit during the pandemic, we continue to have today as well as I'll just again mention our ability to move projects forward and back because we are not a just-in-time compliance company. We try and run ahead of that. So that gives us some flexibility as well.\nOperator: The next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: First question, Kevin, you were talking about the industrial customers and the additions this quarter and for the year. First, can you just give a little bit more color on the mix of the types of the industrial customers?  And from a pace perspective of these additions? Is this a little bit faster than what you had baked in? Just trying to get a sense of which industries are -- you're seeing most growth and what type of potential capital opportunities may exist in the future for you guys?\nJohn Akers: Yes. Sure. Just before we get into that, again, our service story is extremely blessed. We have exceptional leadership at the city, the state level there, great chambers of commerce, great economic development partners in each of our states. And so we have a well-diversified industrial footprint out there.  For example, in a couple of our divisions, we've seen the addition of hydroponic greenhouse facilities, which are large consumers of natural gas. We've seen the location of the distilling industry, both new facilities and expansion of distilling facilities out there.  We've seen an EV battery manufacturing plant located on our facilities. We've seen concrete and asphalt facilities, expansions of colleges and universities. So as well as some metals, aluminum, steel, smaller plants and then expansions of some existing ones as well.  So as you can see there, it's a variety of everything across the board there, which is good for a local economy. And the thing that comes along with these expansions or new additions, as you know, is the jobs, the amount of jobs that this supports and brings in the community, which means rooftops and commercial load as well.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. That's definitely good color. Second one, The Inflation Reduction Act, obviously, for the electric industry, a lot of initial thoughts there. Just for you, as it relates to that bill, just curious on your overall thoughts on what potential opportunities or challenges could exist.  For example, I'm thinking of the RNG side, obviously, you're not in the upstream side of things, but how does that fit takes place? How has that changed? Your thinking there and then just from a -- curious from a messing tax perspective, does that impact your pipeline business at all?\nJohn Akers: Okay. Yes. There's a lot packed into that question. So let me first start with, we're still reviewing, going through all of the detail that's laid out in the bill.  And as you know, the bill still got a long way to go through the legislative process. And could be altered one way or the other as it makes its way through. But we're going to stay very close to the process and stay close to the details to see what potential upside exist for us out there.  However, I will say it is good to see Senator Manchin's comments that this bill is not arbitrarily shut off abundant fossil fuels, I think, is his quote. Then in a recent article I saw some time from last year, Senator Manchin indicated that natural gas must be included in any clean energy program.  So for me, it's good to see and hear that because it's going to take all forms of energy, right? A diversified energy portfolio, as we've been saying for a long time, including natural gas, our nearly 3 million miles of pipeline infrastructure in our underground storage fields, which we have about 120 Bcf here at Atmos Energy.  All that's going to be required to meet the growing demand going forward. And again, it's good to see that realization, the conversation at that level being taken place because a one-sized energy solution, I don't think provides the security viability and affordability that this country needs to meet the growing energy demand that's out there.  So we look forward to continuing to see how the bill evolves. We think we are a good operator, a prudent operator. As you've seen through our pipeline replacement projects, we tightened up our system, we've got a good environmental strategy out there. So I think we can operate in this legislation, but we're going to continue to monitor and see what the details show as this thing moves forward.\nOperator: There are no additional questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Dan Meziere for closing remarks.\nDaniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through September 30. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy.  Fiscal '22 third quarter net income increased $129 million or $0.92 per diluted share -- $102 million, sorry, $0.78 per diluted share in the prior year quarter and fiscal year-to-date net income was $703 million or $5.12 per diluted share compared with net income of $617 million or $4.77 per diluted share in the prior year period.  Slides 5 and 6 provide operating income highlights for each of our segments for the 3 and 9 months ended June 30. I will focus on some of the more significant drivers underlying our fiscal year-to-date performance.  Rate increases in both our operating segments totaled $172 million, primarily driven by increased safety and reliability spending and system expansion. Approximately 71% of these rate adjustments were recognized in our distribution segment.  We continue to see robust customer growth in our distribution segment, which increased operating income by an additional $13 million. This growth offset a $13 million decrease in consumption, most of which occurred during assessed in the second fiscal quarter. We did not see the same trend continuing in the third fiscal quarter as consumption increased by about $3 million quarter-over-quarter.  Additionally, we experienced a $25 million increase in consolidated O&M expense primarily driven by increased pipeline maintenance activities and employee-related costs compared with the prior year, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.  Finally, reductions in fiscal '22 revenue associated with the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities reduced operating income by $103 million. This reduction was substantially offset by lower income tax expense.  Consolidated capital spending increased 27% or $368 million to $1.7 billion, with 87% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects increased system modernization, system integrity and system expansion spending to meet the growing natural gas demand in our service territories.  We remain on track to spend $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year. On the regulatory front, we have completed approximately $216 million of annualized regulatory outcomes excluding refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities. Of this amount, we have implemented $202 million, and we implemented the remainder on September 1.  Additionally, we had about $127 million in progress. Slides 15 through 32 provide additional detail around the regulatory activities. Our fiscal third quarter financing activities were focused on pricing our fiscal '23 equity needs.  During the quarter, we executed 4 sales agreements under our ATM program for approximately 2.9 million shares for $337 million. And we sold agreements on 731,000 shares for approximately $81 million in net proceeds.  As of June 30, we have approximately $700 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sale agreement, which satisfies substantially all of our anticipated equity needs through fiscal '23. We finished the third quarter with an equity capitalization of 61.7%, excluding the $2.2 billion of interim winter storm financing and with total liquidity of approximately $3.5 billion.  Additional details for our financing activities, including our equity forward arrangements as well as our financial profile on Slides 8 through 11. Turning now to securitization. During the third quarter, we continued to make progress on that front.  In Texas, the Texas Public Financing Authority continues its work on the statewide securitization program, and we believe it is on track to be completed within the next few months. As a reminder, once we receive the securitization funds, we will fully retire the $2.2 billion in interim Winter Storm financing.  In Kansas, during the third quarter, we filed our application for a financing order. Based on the approved procedural schedule, we anticipate receiving the financing order during our fiscal '23 first quarter.  In closing, our fiscal year-to-date performance was in line with our expectations and supports the reaffirmation of our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.50 to $5.60 per diluted share.  Slides 13 and 14 provide additional details around our guidance. The ranges included in those pages have not changed since the last quarter. However, we do anticipate our O&M interest expense to be at the higher end of the ranges provided.  Thank you for your time today. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin? You muted there a little bit. But if I'm understanding correctly, you're looking for the main drivers for the remainder of the fiscal year to try to give you some color around where we might fall within the guidance range? Yes, much better now. Thank you. Yes. I mean, you've touched on a couple of them. The main drivers again on the O&M front, we have some compliance work that we're doing some additional system integrity work.  The timing may shift between September or in October, just based on when the work is performed. We're also monitoring our bad debt expense levels. This is our kind of our big collection season, although the bad debt expense is down year-over-year.  Typically, the fourth quarter -- our fourth fiscal quarter is a time where we have increased collection activities, we're kind of monitoring that as well. And then finally, on the interest expense front, we do have the floating rate note as a component of the interim Winter Storm financing and prices have increased somewhat over the last fiscal year, which is driving our interest expense a little bit higher. And that could potentially tick up once the rates have reset later here in the fourth fiscal quarter.  So those are some of the things that we're monitoring in terms of the guidance range. I would say at this point, where we ended the fiscal quarter or on a year-to-date basis, we were in line with our expectations, and we stand behind the guidance that we put out today. Yes. And Kevin, I'll add to that. I mean you spot on with just the keeping up annually with the increases on the O&M front. But I'll also comment on the treasury side as well.  I mean our team has done an excellent job trying to get ahead of rising interest rates, with the exception of the interim Winter Storm financing, which we will take out once the securitization funds are received that we have no floating rate debt.  We have executed nearly $2 billion in forward starting interest rate swaps on future planned debt issuances beyond fiscal 2022 at very attractive rates, and we've done that here over the last year or so. And we're really well positioned.  When you look at our overall weighted average cost of debt today, it's at 3.8%, which is very beneficial for our customers. And finally, we don't have any significant near-term refinancing needs. Our most -- I guess the most current one that's out there right now is about $500 million due in 2027.  So from a balance sheet and financing perspective, we're also have taken advantage over the last year or so, we're trying to lock in some of the lower rates for the benefit of the customers, which also helps mitigate the impact on the customer bill."

            "name": "John Akers",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The fiscal year-to-date results, Chris just shared reflect the continued focus on our vision of being the safest provider of natural gas services.  And supporting that vision of our 4,700 dedicated employees executing our safety and reliability investment strategy and our prudent regulatory and financing strategies. These strategies, combined with a strong portfolio of assets will continue to support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2026.  We continue to see robust growth in demand for natural gas in our service territories. During the 12-month period ended June 30, 2022, we added nearly 59,000 new residential customers which represents a 1.8% increase. And during the third quarter of this year, we added 13 new industrial customers that have an expected annual natural gas usage of 5 Bcf when they are fully operational.  Fiscal year-to-date, we have added 28 new industrial customers that have an expected annual natural gas usage of 10 Bcf when they are fully operational. As you heard me say before, on a volumetric basis, that 10 Bcf of annual industrial customer usage is equivalent to adding 170,000 residential customers.  Last month, we released our most recent corporate responsibility and sustainability report, which illustrates our environmental, social and governance strategy focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from operations in the 5 key areas of operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers.  The report also summarizes the commitments as well as the progress made towards executing that strategy during fiscal 2021 and early fiscal 2022. I wanted to comment on one of the exciting highlights in the corporate responsibility report. That is our Zero Net Energy Homes initiative.  By partnering with local Habitat for Humanity organizations in each of our 8 states, we are providing families with Zero Net Energy Homes that use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and insulation to produce more energy than they consume over the course of the year all in a cost-effective manner.  Again, as you've heard us mention before, we've completed our first Zero Net Energy Home in Evans, Colorado in September of 2021. And during the third quarter of this year, we completed a second Zero Net Energy Home in Taylor, Texas located just north of Austin.  Construction is underway on 3 additional Zero Net Energy Homes in Dallas, one in Jackson, Mississippi, one in Owensboro, Kentucky, and all these are scheduled for completion by November of this year. Additionally, groundbreaking is scheduled later this calendar year for an additional 5 Zero Net Energy homes, one in Dublin, Virginia, one in Colombia, Tennessee and 3 in Lubbock, Texas.  These homes provide families with a comfortable natural gas home that demonstrates the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner.  Our fiscal year performance and participation in community projects such as these as our Zero Net Energy homes, reflect the commitment, dedication, focus and effort of our 4,700 Atmos Energy employees as they see a vital role in our 1,400 communities by safely delivering reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  We appreciate your time this morning, and now we'll open the call for questions. Yes. Kody, I'll start off, and then Chris can jump in there. As we've talked about before, a lot of our contracts that we have in place have been refreshed recently with our contractors and our vendors.  A lot of our large projects we do, whether they're on the med tech side or the APT side, our bid projects there. We feel good about how those have been coming in.  As Chris said, we continue to work on our integrity management and compliance projects. We think those are all in good standing. And on the procurement front, we -- as we talked about before, we try to run well ahead to make sure we have enough inventory on hand to complete and stay ahead of our compliance and pipeline replacement work.  Our team tries to keep about a 6-month inventory on hand and may even be looking to push that out towards the 9-month level. We have all the pipe either in the ground or on the ground to complete our 2022 projects.  We have the pipe in the works right now for '23 and are looking for material out into the '24 period. So as you can see, we're taking advantage when we can to make sure we've got the best pricing that our materials are available, and we can continue to move forward at the best and most efficient manner. Yes. Kody, just to finish that off. And again, some of the same things, tools that we had in our toolkit, if you will, as we were entering and coming through the pandemic are still there for us.  We haven't started back a lot of travel. We're going to the most sense of urgency meetings, those sort of things still taking advantage of teams. So everything that we had in our toolkit during the pandemic, we continue to have today as well as I'll just again mention our ability to move projects forward and back because we are not a just-in-time compliance company. We try and run ahead of that. So that gives us some flexibility as well. Yes. Sure. Just before we get into that, again, our service story is extremely blessed. We have exceptional leadership at the city, the state level there, great chambers of commerce, great economic development partners in each of our states. And so we have a well-diversified industrial footprint out there.  For example, in a couple of our divisions, we've seen the addition of hydroponic greenhouse facilities, which are large consumers of natural gas. We've seen the location of the distilling industry, both new facilities and expansion of distilling facilities out there.  We've seen an EV battery manufacturing plant located on our facilities. We've seen concrete and asphalt facilities, expansions of colleges and universities. So as well as some metals, aluminum, steel, smaller plants and then expansions of some existing ones as well.  So as you can see there, it's a variety of everything across the board there, which is good for a local economy. And the thing that comes along with these expansions or new additions, as you know, is the jobs, the amount of jobs that this supports and brings in the community, which means rooftops and commercial load as well. Okay. Yes. There's a lot packed into that question. So let me first start with, we're still reviewing, going through all of the detail that's laid out in the bill.  And as you know, the bill still got a long way to go through the legislative process. And could be altered one way or the other as it makes its way through. But we're going to stay very close to the process and stay close to the details to see what potential upside exist for us out there.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. \n I will now turn the conference over to our host, Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Thank you. You may begin. \nDaniel Meziere: Thank you, Diego. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2022 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. \n As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 33 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, our Senior VP and CFO. Chris? \nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal '22 second quarter net income of $325 million or $2.37 per diluted share compared to $297 million or $2.30 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $574 million or $4.24 per diluted share compared with earnings of $514 million or $4.01 per diluted share in the prior year period.\n Consolidated operating income decreased to $661 million for the 6 months ended March 31. As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and through the end of last fiscal year, we reached agreement with regulators in various states to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities, generally over a 3- to 5-year period. These refunds reduced revenues throughout the fiscal year when those revenues are billed. The corresponding reduction in our interim annual effective income tax rate was recognized in the prior year when those agreements were completed. \n In fiscal '22, the corresponding reduction in the effective tax rate was recognized at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, period-over-period changes in revenues and income tax expense may not offset with [ the minimum ] periods. However, they will substantially offset by the end of the fiscal year. \n Excluding the impact of these refunds, operating income for the 6 months ended March 31, increased $62 million or 9% to $743 million. Slides 4 and 5 summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments, the 3 and 6 months ended March 31. \n I will focus on some of the key drivers underlying our year-to-date performance. Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $120 million with approximately 77% coming from our distribution segment. Continued robust customer growth in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $11 million. These increases were partially offset by a $17 million decrease in consumption. Most of this decrease occurred during the second fiscal quarter will be observed that residential consumption on a per heating degree day basis was approximately 6% lower than the prior year quarter. We attribute this decrease primarily to customer conservation in response to the current inflationary environment, including the increased cost of natural gas included in customer bills. \n As a reminder, our weather normalization mechanisms substantially offset changes in weather as measured on a heating degree day basis. However, they do not adjust for changes in customer behavior. Additionally, we experienced a $27 million increase in consolidated O&M expense. $20 million of this increase occurred during the first fiscal quarter as we performed more pipeline maintenance activities in this year's first fiscal quarter compared to prior year. \n Consolidated capital spending increased 41% or $344 million to $1.2 billion, that's 87% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system while reducing methane emissions. This increase primarily reflects increased system modernization, system integrity and system expansion spending to meet the growing natural gas demand in our service territories. \n We remain on track to spend $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year. We are also on track with our regulatory filings. To date, we have completed $74 million of annualized regulatory outcomes excluding refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities. And we currently have about $270 million in progress. Slides 20 through 32 summarize those outcomes. And Slide 17 outlines our planned filings for the remainder of the fiscal year. \n During the second quarter, we completed our planned financing activities for fiscal '22. In January, we issued $200 million of long-term debt through a tap of our existing 10-year 2.625% notes due September 2029. The net proceeds were used to pay off our $200 million term loan that was scheduled to mature in April. \n Additionally, we fully priced our remaining equity needs for fiscal '22 and a significant portion of our fiscal '23 equity needs. During the second quarter, we executed forward sales agreements under our ATM program for approximately 4.7 million shares for $500 million. And we settled forward agreements on 3.5 million shares for approximately $322 million in net proceeds. As of March 31, we have approximately $450 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements. \n Our second quarter activities exhausted a $1 billion ATM program we established in June of 2021, and we established a new $1 billion ATM program at the end of March. We finished the second quarter with an equity capitalization ratio of 61%, excluding the $2.2 billion of interim winter storm financing and total liquidity of approximately $3.5 billion. Additional details of our financing activities, including our equity forward arrangements as well as our financial profile can be found on Slide 8 to 11. \n During the second quarter, we continued to make progress in securitization. In March, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved our gas and other related costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri with no disallowances. We plan to file our application for a financing order during our third fiscal quarter. And in Texas, the Texas Public Financing Authority continues its work on the statewide securitization program, and we still anticipate the securitization transaction will be completed by the end of our fiscal year. \n I'll close my portion of our prepared remarks with a few comments on our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance, which we tightened to a range of $5.50 to $5.60 per diluted share. Earnings for the first half of the fiscal year were in line with our expectations. With approximately 70% of our distribution revenues earned for the fiscal year and the fact we're heading into the summer months we believe any potential change in customer behavior in the second half of the fiscal year will not have a material impact on revenue. Additionally, customer growth for the first 6 months of the fiscal year were stronger than we had planned, and we expect that trend to continue into the second half of the fiscal year. \n In our Pipeline and Storage segment, our straight fixed variable rate design for substantially all of the segment's revenues drives clarity into the second half of the fiscal year. \n Additionally, we were seeing spreads widen, which is expected to provide a modest increase in APT's through system revenue. Finally, we have completed our fiscal '22 financial -- financing program, including pricing all of our equity needs for the remainder of the fiscal year which removes one more variable. \n Slides 13 through 14 provide additional details around our guidance. \n Thank you for your time today. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Akers for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin? \nJohn Akers: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As you heard, the first 6 months of the fiscal year were in line with our expectations, which leaves us well positioned for another successful fiscal year. This performance reflects a commitment, dedication, focus and effort of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees, as we continue to successfully modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems, while safely providing reliable natural gas service to our 3.4 million customers across 1,400 communities in 8 states.\n During the first half of the fiscal year, we continue to experience strong customer growth, as you just heard from Chris. For example, for the 12 months ended March 31, 2022, we added over 57,000 new customers which represents a 1.8% increase. We added nearly 1,800 commercial customers during the first 6 months of this fiscal year. And we added 15 new industrial customers that we anticipate using nearly 5 Bcf of natural gas annually when at full capacity. \n On a volumetric basis, that 5 Bcf of annual industrial customer usage is equivalent to adding nearly 85,000 residential customers to our system. We're very proud of our efforts for these new customers coming on our system. \n As Chris mentioned, our capital spending has increased about $344 million over the prior year period, and we remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. Through our system modernization efforts, we are on track to replace 800 to 1,000 miles of pipe and 20,000 to 30,000 steel service lines, all of which supports our goal of reducing methane emissions 50% by 2035 from 2017 levels for EPA reported distribution and maintenance services. That also includes APT's integrity work on projects like our Line X Phase 2 replacement, which is under construction and includes 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline anticipated to be completed later this calendar year. As a reminder, we placed Phase 1 into service in Q1 of this fiscal year. That phase replaced 64 miles of 36-inch pipeline. \n Additionally, construction has begun on Phase 2 of our Line S-2 replacement project. This 18-mile 36-inch project is expected to be completed late this calendar year. Again, as a reminder, we placed 22 miles of 36-inch completed in Phase 1 into service in Q1 of this fiscal year. \n This modernization work is a significant component of our comprehensive environmental strategy that focuses on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from operations in the 5 key areas of operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers. \n During the second quarter, we added another RNG facility that will provide renewable natural gas for transportation across our system. That facility has the potential to flow up to 0.5 Bcf a year. As you know, we are currently transporting approximately 8 Bcf a year and we are evaluating nearly 30 opportunities that could further expand these transportation opportunities. \n As I mentioned on previous calls, we completed our first zero-net energy home in partnership with the Greeley-Weld Habitat for Humanity in Evans, Colorado. Zero Net Energy homes use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and insulation to produce more energy than it consumes at a very affordable cost, approximately $50 per month for the combined gas and electric bill for the Evans, Colorado home. We are now partnering with local Habitat for Humanity organization in each of our 8 states to construct additional zero-net energy homes. Currently, our home in Dallas is under construction. And on April 27, we held the dedication for our zero-net energy home in Taylor, Texas. \n Additionally, in Jackson, Mississippi on April 28, Atmos Energy and Habitat for Humanity Capital earlier, held a groundbreaking ceremony for Mississippi's first zero net energy home. And in Lubbock, 3 homes are scheduled to begin construction in early September of this year. These zero net energy homes demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in an affordable manner, providing these families with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost efficient is just one way Atmos Energy fuels safe and thriving communities. \n Our customer support organization and technology support team continue to innovate and look for ways to improve our customer service and offer convenient channels for our customers to communicate with us as well as to make payments. For example, over 31% of our customers are enrolled in recurring auto [ draft ], which is about 8% higher than industry average. \n We also see continuous growth in our electronic bill delivery channels with nearly 50% of our customers enrolled in E-bill. We continue our outreach to customers to make them aware of our flexible planet fans as well as provide contact information for local, state and federal energy assistance programs. \n For the first 6 months of this fiscal year, our customer support associates, our energy assistant specialist and coordinator through our customer advocacy team helped nearly 44,000 customers received $15 million in energy assistance. It is through heartfelt caring efforts like that, an exceptional customer service that provide the satisfaction ratings for these employees that exceed 97%. These activities and initiatives reflect how we are focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy as we serve a very vital role in every community by delivering reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now, and into the future. \n We believe our focus on long-term sustainability combined with executing our proven investment, regulatory and financial strategies continues to support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2026. \n We appreciate your time and interest in Atmos Energy this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nicholas Campanella with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nNicholas Campanella: So a lot of detail. Thanks for the update. Just on the financing side of things, your cost of equity has improved since the start of your fiscal year. And I know you're largely set on '22 equity needs now and you gave us a lot of detail around the forward program. But just any thoughts on why not do more now and take this off the table for kind of future years? And is it just that you guys are being just fairly formulaic? And how you execute here? And just any thoughts on out your equity? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. A couple of things there, Nick. First, we are under our ATM program for a number of quarters now, have been executing forward arrangements. So we may very well take advantage of the current pricing environment to establish pricing for our fiscal '23 and beyond. As I indicated, fiscal '22 is fully priced for the remainder of our fiscal year. \n So that's an opportunity that we'll take a look at here in the third and the fourth quarter to take advantage of the pricing -- the current pricing environment to build on what we've already established with our fiscal '23 work that we  executed through the end of March. \nNicholas Campanella: All right. Great. No, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just a broader question on inflation. Everyone is dealing with it. Just on the gas side, just every day we look at the strip, it's up. And how is that kind of translating to broader customer bills? Do you kind of feel comfortable if we remain at these levels? And if we're at a structurally higher kind of commodity environment through your 5-year plan, just confidence level in executing on this rate base trajectory? \nJohn Akers: Yes. Nick, it's Kevin. There's a couple of things in that -- in your question. Let me first start with, as you heard in my opening comments there, our team has and continues to stay very attuned to and keep affordability at the top of the mind and focused on how we can help. You heard the things that our customer service organization, our customer advocacy team are doing with outreach to energy assistance organizations, trying to find funds, get customers connected to that, find ways we can communicate proactively with customers. For example, during the last winter period, we sent out, think about 1.5 million notices, whether those were phone calls, where those were text, whether those were e-mails, those sort of things, trying to alert customers to pending colder than normal situations moving into the area. \n We're also sending them through those various channels, including social media as well, information on weather tips, energy efficiency, conservation, gas cost pricing, all those sort of things. So we're trying to stay very active with our customers, very up-to-date with our customers on the cost, but also find ways where we can help through our energy assistance LIHEAP programs, point them to the locations where they can receive assistance. But also, as you know, we're a very efficient operator. We work very hard at that. \n You've seen the things we've done over the last couple of years through Uri. Those sort of things will continue those efforts as we monitor the gas price over the next few months, and we'll continue to communicate with our customers where we can. \n And to the second part of your question there, I think where you were heading regarding our capital investment program over the 5-year horizon, I think as you can see in our slide deck right now, we run somewhere between 85% to 90% of our capital investments focused on safety and reliability. That needs to continue and will continue as we continue our strategy to modernize our system for safe delivery of natural gas as well as, as you just heard me mention that growth out there to support that high growth rate, particularly when we're adding 12 months ending March, 57,000 new customers out there and 15 new industrials. \n So we've got to continue to meet that growing positive and strong demand for natural gas across our service territory that we anticipate will continue going forward, as we talk to builders and developers out there. Even with interest rates at 5% right now, they're continuing to see strong demand as well. So that's what we're going to focus on, how we help the customer, how we can connect the customer to the right assistance organization, maintain our focus on O&M where we can and then continue to invest in our system. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. \nInsoo Kim: First, just more on detail for the quarter. I saw on the pipeline side, the O&M year-over-year was up a decent bid. On the distribution side, down year-over-year. Is this just more timing between the quarters? And I know from a guidance perspective for the year, it doesn't seem like much has changed. But just curious on some clarity there. \nChristopher Forsythe: Insoo, this is Chris. Yes, certainly, it's timing on some of the -- just the timing of the work on the pipeline, those are longer lead time projects that need to be planned further out in advance. So just in timing around that. And on the distribution side, to stand a little bit, we had a slightly lower bad debt expense in our current year's fiscal second quarter compared to the prior year. So that's -- those are really kind of the 2 key drivers for those variances that you just described. \nInsoo Kim: Okay. Got it. Second question, just more curious on your observations. We've talked probably over the past couple of years, just about the different changing narratives on the future of gas, and it seems like the latest narrative has changed maybe more to a positive for the sector just on energy, security and all that stuff. Have you seen that play out at all on the ground, whether it's customer growth or just demand for gas in your various jurisdictions, if there was ever really an impact from this narrative on the negative side over the past couple of years, just seeing -- I know you had mentioned customer growth or demand being stronger than expected. So I don't know if that would tied to any of that in your thoughts. \nJohn Akers: Yes. Thank you, Insoo, for your question. And -- as you know, we've continued to have strong growth. We're very proud of our service territories. We believe they are the best in the country. We're fortunate with the states and support politically, the economic development chambers and their hard work that bring these sort of customers into the communities we serve today. But we've seen strong support for natural gas for a long time throughout our history. And I think you could also see that through the customer advocacy, customer choice builds that we have in 6 of our 8 states out there, we get very good support from a regulatory perspective, the political perspective, the community perspective. So I think we've always been in strong supporting natural gas environment. .\n I think the thing that -- to get to the crux of your question, it's probably changed here lately is the conversation that the general public is now seeing and wanting to feel around energy security. Natural gas in our industry has always been there behind the scenes, delivering, transporting, storing natural gas to meet those winter demands, especially as you go back to Uri and how well some of our distribution and transmission systems performed during that piece of it. We've always kind of been out of sight, out of mind. But with the unfortunate geopolitics that are going on now, the war in Ukraine, energy has been thrust to the forefront. \n And I think those are the things we're hearing is people are wanting to know that natural gas is going to be there. It's a viable choice for them. It's abundant, and they're talking to us about national energy security and how they can have that in their community. So those are the sort of things we're hearing now. And as I said, we're very fortunate and blessed and appreciative of our jurisdictions and their support for natural gas. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe just staying with this inflationary focus. I mean what's your view on inflation's impact on your CapEx budgets? How are you thinking about that just vis-a-vis some of the latest pressures we're seeing across the industry? What percentage of your CapEx is exposed to material labor for instance, obviously, that are perhaps disproportionately inflationary? And what's locked in contracted labor where perhaps you may not see that? But on balance, is there an upward bias in your CapEx budget on that alone effectively? \nJohn Akers: Yes, Julien, let me start here and Chris, certainly can add some color if he wants to get into percentages or not. But as we've talked about this before, I couldn't be any proud of our procurement team, our operations team, our engineering teams, all working collectively as we -- we're coming through the last year or so, the pandemic inflationary discussions were picking up. We were seeing some of the signs out there. They were very active. You heard us talk about going from a 3-month to 6-month inventory of materials and pipe. You've also heard us continue to talk about that we have 95% to 100% of our pipe on the ground for the remainder of this fiscal year's steel needs. And that we are already beginning identification and getting steel pipe to the mills for '23 and identifying cost as far out as '24 in those project needs. \n So all to say for us, our team has been very proactive about identifying the types of materials, whether it's pipe, valves, fittings, those sort of things, plastic, steel, increasing our inventory, increasing our lead time on that, so we're not just in time. And yes, we've seen some increases in pipe -- steel pipe, especially from a couple of years ago or 3 years ago. But we think we're doing everything we can to take advantage of current pricing now to lock that in, as I said, as we buy out into the future for those sort of things. \n Really, the only pressures we've seen right now from a supply chain perspective, we've seen a little bit on the technology side and occasionally on some meters, but it corrects itself over time as our team continues to work through our vendors and suppliers to get additional supplies into our warehouses. So I hope that helps answer your question. Chris, anything additional you'd like to add? \nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. I think the same. Just really, Kevin, the other -- Julien, the other point to make is there are contract labors, they're executing on the capital projects. We've got contracts with them. We're currently -- we are in constant communication with them. Many of these contractors go back many, many years with us. So over the years, we have worked with them to manage their cost pressures and needs. And so we've been able to do this at a -- in a bite-size increment, if you will, rather than having to -- holding the cost really low for a long period of time and having to rush now to catch up to market. So those are long-term relationships with those contractors, have given us the ability to bleed in any higher cost over an extended period of time so as to mute the inflationary pressure on our capital spending. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But not ready to quantify in aggregate, but maybe you do see some of these inflationary pressures that could fall through. And maybe to clarify that further, even to the extent of which you do would you perhaps defer some of these investments in order to keep your budget flat? Or is there an argument that would just be made you move forward with the projects despite some modest inflation? \nJohn Akers: We haven't seen anything right now, Julien, that hadn't already been contemplated in the numbers that we've discussed here to date. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Excellent. And so just one other -- please go for it. \nJohn Akers: No, that's all I had. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Excellent. And then just on the transportation and RNG front, you made some comments here. You talked about 30 projects here. It seems like -- or 30 opportunities sees your verbiage. Can you expand a little bit more about what that could amount to just from a sort of a capital opportunity perspective, if you will? \nJohn Akers: Yes, Julien, as you've heard us say before, we're not in the upstream side of that. We're not investing right capital upstream of the meter right now. So truly, all of our investment would be the sales meter, based -- whether they're digesters, they're landfills, biomass, sewer gas capture those sort of things. We're really receiving the processed gas and transporting on behalf of our customers. And right now, those evaluations are truly what is near system, what is close to systems. So any capital investment at this time would be modest and it would be to maybe extend a short distance to a facility. But really, we're not investing upstream at this point. We're really transporting that RNG on behalf of others. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Lots of projects lingering there, but largely sales element. \nJohn Akers: Correct. Helping our customers where we can reduce their carbon footprint and be the conduit. That's why we have the 72,000 miles of pipeline system we have today is to move that gas around it. And be part of that environmental equation to get that gas to the -- [ burn it here ]. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to Dan Meziere for closing remarks. \nDaniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you all for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through June 30. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christopher Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Last night, we reported fiscal '22 second quarter net income of $325 million or $2.37 per diluted share compared to $297 million or $2.30 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, earnings were $574 million or $4.24 per diluted share compared with earnings of $514 million or $4.01 per diluted share in the prior year period.\n Consolidated operating income decreased to $661 million for the 6 months ended March 31. As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and through the end of last fiscal year, we reached agreement with regulators in various states to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities, generally over a 3- to 5-year period. These refunds reduced revenues throughout the fiscal year when those revenues are billed. The corresponding reduction in our interim annual effective income tax rate was recognized in the prior year when those agreements were completed. \n In fiscal '22, the corresponding reduction in the effective tax rate was recognized at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, period-over-period changes in revenues and income tax expense may not offset with [ the minimum ] periods. However, they will substantially offset by the end of the fiscal year. \n Excluding the impact of these refunds, operating income for the 6 months ended March 31, increased $62 million or 9% to $743 million. Slides 4 and 5 summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments, the 3 and 6 months ended March 31. \n I will focus on some of the key drivers underlying our year-to-date performance. Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability capital spending totaled $120 million with approximately 77% coming from our distribution segment. Continued robust customer growth in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $11 million. These increases were partially offset by a $17 million decrease in consumption. Most of this decrease occurred during the second fiscal quarter will be observed that residential consumption on a per heating degree day basis was approximately 6% lower than the prior year quarter. We attribute this decrease primarily to customer conservation in response to the current inflationary environment, including the increased cost of natural gas included in customer bills. \n As a reminder, our weather normalization mechanisms substantially offset changes in weather as measured on a heating degree day basis. However, they do not adjust for changes in customer behavior. Additionally, we experienced a $27 million increase in consolidated O&M expense. $20 million of this increase occurred during the first fiscal quarter as we performed more pipeline maintenance activities in this year's first fiscal quarter compared to prior year. \n Consolidated capital spending increased 41% or $344 million to $1.2 billion, that's 87% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system while reducing methane emissions. This increase primarily reflects increased system modernization, system integrity and system expansion spending to meet the growing natural gas demand in our service territories. \n We remain on track to spend $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year. We are also on track with our regulatory filings. To date, we have completed $74 million of annualized regulatory outcomes excluding refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities. And we currently have about $270 million in progress. Slides 20 through 32 summarize those outcomes. And Slide 17 outlines our planned filings for the remainder of the fiscal year. \n During the second quarter, we completed our planned financing activities for fiscal '22. In January, we issued $200 million of long-term debt through a tap of our existing 10-year 2.625% notes due September 2029. The net proceeds were used to pay off our $200 million term loan that was scheduled to mature in April. \n Additionally, we fully priced our remaining equity needs for fiscal '22 and a significant portion of our fiscal '23 equity needs. During the second quarter, we executed forward sales agreements under our ATM program for approximately 4.7 million shares for $500 million. And we settled forward agreements on 3.5 million shares for approximately $322 million in net proceeds. As of March 31, we have approximately $450 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sales agreements. \n Our second quarter activities exhausted a $1 billion ATM program we established in June of 2021, and we established a new $1 billion ATM program at the end of March. We finished the second quarter with an equity capitalization ratio of 61%, excluding the $2.2 billion of interim winter storm financing and total liquidity of approximately $3.5 billion. Additional details of our financing activities, including our equity forward arrangements as well as our financial profile can be found on Slide 8 to 11. \n During the second quarter, we continued to make progress in securitization. In March, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved our gas and other related costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri with no disallowances. We plan to file our application for a financing order during our third fiscal quarter. And in Texas, the Texas Public Financing Authority continues its work on the statewide securitization program, and we still anticipate the securitization transaction will be completed by the end of our fiscal year. \n I'll close my portion of our prepared remarks with a few comments on our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance, which we tightened to a range of $5.50 to $5.60 per diluted share. Earnings for the first half of the fiscal year were in line with our expectations. With approximately 70% of our distribution revenues earned for the fiscal year and the fact we're heading into the summer months we believe any potential change in customer behavior in the second half of the fiscal year will not have a material impact on revenue. Additionally, customer growth for the first 6 months of the fiscal year were stronger than we had planned, and we expect that trend to continue into the second half of the fiscal year. \n In our Pipeline and Storage segment, our straight fixed variable rate design for substantially all of the segment's revenues drives clarity into the second half of the fiscal year. \n Additionally, we were seeing spreads widen, which is expected to provide a modest increase in APT's through system revenue. Finally, we have completed our fiscal '22 financial -- financing program, including pricing all of our equity needs for the remainder of the fiscal year which removes one more variable. \n Slides 13 through 14 provide additional details around our guidance. \n Thank you for your time today. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Akers for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin? Yes. A couple of things there, Nick. First, we are under our ATM program for a number of quarters now, have been executing forward arrangements. So we may very well take advantage of the current pricing environment to establish pricing for our fiscal '23 and beyond. As I indicated, fiscal '22 is fully priced for the remainder of our fiscal year. \n So that's an opportunity that we'll take a look at here in the third and the fourth quarter to take advantage of the pricing -- the current pricing environment to build on what we've already established with our fiscal '23 work that we  executed through the end of March. Insoo, this is Chris. Yes, certainly, it's timing on some of the -- just the timing of the work on the pipeline, those are longer lead time projects that need to be planned further out in advance. So just in timing around that. And on the distribution side, to stand a little bit, we had a slightly lower bad debt expense in our current year's fiscal second quarter compared to the prior year. So that's -- those are really kind of the 2 key drivers for those variances that you just described. Yes. I think the same. Just really, Kevin, the other -- Julien, the other point to make is there are contract labors, they're executing on the capital projects. We've got contracts with them. We're currently -- we are in constant communication with them. Many of these contractors go back many, many years with us. So over the years, we have worked with them to manage their cost pressures and needs. And so we've been able to do this at a -- in a bite-size increment, if you will, rather than having to -- holding the cost really low for a long period of time and having to rush now to catch up to market. So those are long-term relationships with those contractors, have given us the ability to bleed in any higher cost over an extended period of time so as to mute the inflationary pressure on our capital spending."

            "name": "John Akers",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As you heard, the first 6 months of the fiscal year were in line with our expectations, which leaves us well positioned for another successful fiscal year. This performance reflects a commitment, dedication, focus and effort of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees, as we continue to successfully modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems, while safely providing reliable natural gas service to our 3.4 million customers across 1,400 communities in 8 states.\n During the first half of the fiscal year, we continue to experience strong customer growth, as you just heard from Chris. For example, for the 12 months ended March 31, 2022, we added over 57,000 new customers which represents a 1.8% increase. We added nearly 1,800 commercial customers during the first 6 months of this fiscal year. And we added 15 new industrial customers that we anticipate using nearly 5 Bcf of natural gas annually when at full capacity. \n On a volumetric basis, that 5 Bcf of annual industrial customer usage is equivalent to adding nearly 85,000 residential customers to our system. We're very proud of our efforts for these new customers coming on our system. \n As Chris mentioned, our capital spending has increased about $344 million over the prior year period, and we remain on track to achieve our capital spending target of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. Through our system modernization efforts, we are on track to replace 800 to 1,000 miles of pipe and 20,000 to 30,000 steel service lines, all of which supports our goal of reducing methane emissions 50% by 2035 from 2017 levels for EPA reported distribution and maintenance services. That also includes APT's integrity work on projects like our Line X Phase 2 replacement, which is under construction and includes 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline anticipated to be completed later this calendar year. As a reminder, we placed Phase 1 into service in Q1 of this fiscal year. That phase replaced 64 miles of 36-inch pipeline. \n Additionally, construction has begun on Phase 2 of our Line S-2 replacement project. This 18-mile 36-inch project is expected to be completed late this calendar year. Again, as a reminder, we placed 22 miles of 36-inch completed in Phase 1 into service in Q1 of this fiscal year. \n This modernization work is a significant component of our comprehensive environmental strategy that focuses on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from operations in the 5 key areas of operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers. \n During the second quarter, we added another RNG facility that will provide renewable natural gas for transportation across our system. That facility has the potential to flow up to 0.5 Bcf a year. As you know, we are currently transporting approximately 8 Bcf a year and we are evaluating nearly 30 opportunities that could further expand these transportation opportunities. \n As I mentioned on previous calls, we completed our first zero-net energy home in partnership with the Greeley-Weld Habitat for Humanity in Evans, Colorado. Zero Net Energy homes use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and insulation to produce more energy than it consumes at a very affordable cost, approximately $50 per month for the combined gas and electric bill for the Evans, Colorado home. We are now partnering with local Habitat for Humanity organization in each of our 8 states to construct additional zero-net energy homes. Currently, our home in Dallas is under construction. And on April 27, we held the dedication for our zero-net energy home in Taylor, Texas. \n Additionally, in Jackson, Mississippi on April 28, Atmos Energy and Habitat for Humanity Capital earlier, held a groundbreaking ceremony for Mississippi's first zero net energy home. And in Lubbock, 3 homes are scheduled to begin construction in early September of this year. These zero net energy homes demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in an affordable manner, providing these families with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost efficient is just one way Atmos Energy fuels safe and thriving communities. \n Our customer support organization and technology support team continue to innovate and look for ways to improve our customer service and offer convenient channels for our customers to communicate with us as well as to make payments. For example, over 31% of our customers are enrolled in recurring auto [ draft ], which is about 8% higher than industry average. \n We also see continuous growth in our electronic bill delivery channels with nearly 50% of our customers enrolled in E-bill. We continue our outreach to customers to make them aware of our flexible planet fans as well as provide contact information for local, state and federal energy assistance programs. \n For the first 6 months of this fiscal year, our customer support associates, our energy assistant specialist and coordinator through our customer advocacy team helped nearly 44,000 customers received $15 million in energy assistance. It is through heartfelt caring efforts like that, an exceptional customer service that provide the satisfaction ratings for these employees that exceed 97%. These activities and initiatives reflect how we are focused on the long-term sustainability of Atmos Energy as we serve a very vital role in every community by delivering reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now, and into the future. \n We believe our focus on long-term sustainability combined with executing our proven investment, regulatory and financial strategies continues to support our ability to grow earnings per share and dividends 6% to 8% annually through fiscal 2026. \n We appreciate your time and interest in Atmos Energy this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions. Yes. Nick, it's Kevin. There's a couple of things in that -- in your question. Let me first start with, as you heard in my opening comments there, our team has and continues to stay very attuned to and keep affordability at the top of the mind and focused on how we can help. You heard the things that our customer service organization, our customer advocacy team are doing with outreach to energy assistance organizations, trying to find funds, get customers connected to that, find ways we can communicate proactively with customers.

Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussions might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 25 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Chris?\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal '22 first quarter net income of $249 million, a $1.86 per diluted share. Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations, reflects the ongoing execution of our operating, financial and regulatory strategies.  Consolidated operating income decreased $276 million in the first quarter, primarily due to a $39 million decrease in revenues associated with the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities. As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal '21, and through the end of last fiscal year, we've reached agreement with regulators in various states to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities, generally over a three to five-year period.  These refunds reduced revenues throughout the fiscal year when those revenues are billed. The corresponding reduction in our interim annual effective income tax rate is recognized at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, period-over-period changes in revenues and income tax expense may not offset with interim periods that will substantially offset by the end of the fiscal year. Excluding the impact of these excess deferred tax liability refunds, operating income increased $16 million over the prior year quarter.  Slide 5 summarizes the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both our operating segments, driven by increased safety reliability capital spending, totaled $47 million. Continued robust customer growth in our distribution segment increased operating income by $4 million.  For the 12 months ended December 31, we added 55,000 new customers, which represent a 1.7% increase. These increases are partially offset by a $20 million increase in consolidated O&M expense. As a reminder, in the prior quarter, we deferred non-compliance spending into late in the fiscal year as we evaluated our customer load during that time period. Therefore, the period-over-period variance partly reflects this timing difference.  The first quarter increase is primarily driven by increased pipeline maintenance activities. Consolidated capital spending increased to $684 million. The $227 million period-over-period increase reflects increased system modernization spending in our distribution segment, spending to close out Phase 1 of APT's Line X and Line S2 projects and project timing.  We remain on track to spend $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year with more than 80% of this spending focused on modernizing a distribution and transmission network, which also reduces methane emissions.  We are also on track with our regulatory filings. To date, we have implemented $73 million in annualized regulatory outcomes, refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities, and currently with about $36 million in progress. Slide 17 through 24 summarizes these outcomes.  Slide 16 outlines our planned filings for the remainder of the fiscal year. To date, we have completed over $1 billion of long-term financing. Following the completion of the $600 million 30-year senior note issuance in October, we executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM program for approximately 2.7 million shares for $260 million. And we settled forward agreements on 2.7 million shares for approximately $260 million.  As of December 31, we have approximately $295 million in net proceeds available under our existing forward sale agreements. As a result of this activity, we have now priced a substantial portion of fiscal '22 equity needs and anticipate satisfying the remaining equity needs through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization, excluding the $2.2 billion of Winter Storm financing, was 59% as of December 31.  Additionally, we finished the quarter with approximately $3.1 billion of liquidity. In January, we completed the issuance of $2 million of long-term debt through a tap of our existing 10-year 2.635% notes due September 2029. The net proceeds were used to pay off $200 million term loan that was scheduled to mature in April.  Following this offering and excluding the interim Winter Storm financing, our weighted average cost of debt decreased 3.81% and our weighted average maturity increased 19.23 years, which further strengthens our financial profile. Additional details for financing activities, our equity forward arrangements, as well as our financial profile can be found on Slide 7 through 10. And we continue to make progress on securitization.  Yesterday, the Texas Railroad Commission unanimously issued a financing order authorizing the Texas Public Financing Authority to issue customer rate relief bonds to securitize costs associated with Winter Storm Uri over a period not to exceed 30 years. We currently anticipate the securitization transaction will be completed by the end of our fiscal year. Upon receipt of the securitization funds, we will repay the $2.2 billion of Winter Storm financing we issued last March.  And in Kansas, we started our securitization proceedings at the Kansas Corporation Commission in late January. Based on the current procedural schedule, we are anticipating a financing order by the end of our fiscal third quarter.  Our first quarter performance was a solid start to the fiscal year. The execution of our operational, financial and regulatory plans are on track which positions us well to achieve our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance of $5.40 to $5.60. Details around our guidance can be found in slides 12 and 13.  Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my update today, I want to take just this opportunity to recognize and say thank you to all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees. It is through your dedication, your focus and effort that we safely provide natural gas service to 3.2 million customers in 1,400 communities across our eight states. Thank you for all you do every day for Atmos Energy.  I also want to take this time to thank our hometown heroes, our first responders and emergency responders for their continued dedication and support for all of us. And as you just heard, we're off to a great start. The results Chris summarized reflect the commitment of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees as we work together to continue modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems on our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services.  During the first quarter, we achieved several project milestones that further enhance the safety, reliability, versatility, and supply diversification of our system. For example, at APT, we placed into service Phase 1 of a two-phase pipeline integrity project that will replace 125 miles of Line X. As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT's system. Phase 1 replaced 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline. Phase 2 includes an additional 62 miles of 36-inch pipeline and is anticipated to be completed late this calendar year. Additionally, we completed the first of a three-phase project to replace our existing Line S2. This 91 mile, 36-inch project will provide additional supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the East side of the growing Dallas Fort Worth metroplex. Phase 1 replaced 21 miles of this line and Phase 2 will replace an additional 18 miles and is expected to be completed late this calendar year. Phase 3, which will replace the remaining 52 miles, is expected to be in service in 2023. During the completion of Phase 1 for Line X and Phase 1 for Line S2, our teams used recompression practices to avoid venting or flaring over 70,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. This is an excellent example of how Atmos Energy's environmental strategy is being integrated into our daily operations.  APT's third salt dome cavern project at Bethel is now approximately 80% complete and remains on track to be placed in service late this calendar year. As a reminder, this project is anticipated to provide an additional 5 BCF to 6 BCF of cavern storage capacity.  As I mentioned during our November call, we have started work on a 22 mile, 36-inch line that will connect the Southern end of APT's system with the 42-inch Kinder Morgan Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This new line will support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the North of Austin in both Williamson and Travis County in Texas. This line is expected to be in service late December of this year.  In addition to those system modernization projects, we continue to make progress in advancing our comprehensive environmental strategy that is focused on reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and reduce our environmental impact from our operations in the following five key areas; operations, fleet, facility, gas supply and customers.  For example, across our storage facilities, we utilize advanced methane detection technologies, including gas cloud imaging, acoustic monitoring, forward-looking infrared handheld cameras, and laser-based remote methane leak detectors. At APT storage fields, we are making progress with the installation of the remaining gas cloud imaging cameras for continuous methane monitoring and anticipate completion by the end of this fiscal year. Our RNG strategy focuses on identifying opportunities to transport RNG for our customers. We currently transport approximately 8 BCF a year and anticipate another four projects to come online within the next 12 to 18 months. Those four projects are expected to provide an additional BCF a year of RNG capacity.  Furthermore, we are evaluating approximately 20 opportunities that could further expand our RNG transportation. Two, Zero Net Energy Homes are underway in Texas; one in Taylor and the other in Dallas. The home in Taylor is being developed through our partnership with the Williamson County Habitat for Humanity, and we estimate the home to be completed in late March.  And in Dallas, we are working with the Dallas Habitat for Humanity and estimate construction of this Zero Net Energy Home to begin mid-March. These homes use high efficiency natural gas appliances, coupled with rooftop solar panels and insulation to minimize the home's carbon footprint.  These Zero Net Energy Homes demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas play in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in an affordable manner. Providing these families with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost efficient is just one way Atmos Energy feels safe in thriving communities.  And finally, over the next five years, we will invest $13 billion to $14 billion in capital to support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of our distribution, transmission pipe, or about 6% to 8% of our total system. We will also replace 100 to 150 steel service lines which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over the next five years.  Our first quarter activities and initiatives reflect the continued successful execution of our strategy to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems as we continue our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services.  These efforts, along with the strength of our balance sheet, our strong liquidity, has Atmos Energy well positioned to continue serving the vital role we play in every community; that is delivering safe, reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  We appreciate your time and interest this morning. We'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting on O&M. How is the balance of work and timing tracking versus expectation? Just curious if you have any early sense here, I guess directionally where expenses are putting you in the guidance range?\nChris Forsythe: Yes, sure, Richard. This is Chris. Good morning. Really the O&M spending was generally in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, when you look at our current year compared to the prior year quarter, the prior year quarter was a bit of a low mark. So when you look at where we are now, it's roughly a 15% increase quarter-over-quarter. But we looked to the midpoint of our guidance compared with last year's O&M levels, that's about a 3% increase. So right now, we're still seeing O&M trending in that $7 million to $10 million range. And we believe that at least where we are as we sit today that that spending will continue to be in line with this expectation.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Thanks for the color there. In the mid to the high level, could you outline the expected timing of major base rate cases over the next, say, two to three years, including the APT system?\nChris Forsythe: Sure. Again, we typically execute '18 to '22 annual regulatory filings. The fiscal second quarter is our busiest filing period. So we'll be making a number of GRIP filings at APT as well as in our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions. We'll also be making a regulatory filing in Mississippi in early March as well as in Louisiana, and a secondary filing in July in Mississippi. So a lot of activity to be coming over the next several months. Much of this will be implemented by the end of the fiscal year. We will also file our West Texas and Mid-Tex filings, generally at the end of March 1, first part of April, and those are scheduled to become implemented on or around October 1. So really at start of the next fiscal year. With respect to APT, the general rate case is scheduled to begin in our fiscal 2023 time period. So we've factored that into our five-year plan. So the GRIP filing that we'll make here in mid February will be the last GRIP filing before that annual rate proceeding next year.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Thanks for outlining all that. Thanks for the time today.\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Richard.\nOperator: Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Congratulations on everything here. Just following up here -- good morning. Just following up on Kansas here. Obviously, the process is kicking off here. Can you talk a little bit about the expectations on the tenders are ultimately on that proceeding? And frankly, anything else that you think is relevant that we should be talking about in terms of parameters? Obviously, kudos on getting the RSC finalized here?\nKevin Akers: Thank you. So on Kansas, as I said, we're kind of in early stages right now and beginning the securitization proceedings. In the terms of tenders, it will depend upon what market conditions look like. We're obviously going to be looking to seek AAA rating on that. And we will be working with our banking partners as well as with the staff to determine the appropriate period to make these securitization costs, if you will, as affordable as we can for our Kansas customers. But it's still too early to tell where we are at this point.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Understood. And actually related, especially considering the progress that you've made with the RSC, how are you thinking about the rating agencies moving forward here on removing the outlook here, removing the negative outlook to be specific?\nKevin Akers: Yes, the dialogue we've had with both Moody's and S&P has been -- they've basically been telling us we're going to wait to see what the Texas Railroad Commission financing looks like. That was issued yesterday. I'm sure they have a copy of that. We're anticipating conversations with those rating agencies hopefully here this second fiscal quarter.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And a quick last one here just on tax rate, obviously depressed here. The comments in the transcript here, to the extent to which you should expect to continue to see this rate going forward, the lower rate, just given the tax liabilities?\nChris Forsythe: Sure. So our effective tax rate for the first quarter was about 5.9% that we're anticipating, including the excess deferred tax liabilities and effective income tax rate in the 7% to 9%, given that we are refunding these excess deferred tax liabilities over the next three to five years, that effective tax rate should be in place in that general range over that time period. So when you back out the impact of the excess deferred tax liability refunds, the marginal effective income tax rate is in the 22% to 24% range.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, yes, indeed. Thank you for clarifying that. Sorry, actually, if I can, could I ask the last question on APT. \nKevin Akers: Sure.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: How are you seeing customer growth trend here? Some of your peers talking pretty robustly of late. Just curious to see what you're seeing, especially the impact to some of your other jurisdictions here, like APT?\nKevin Akers: You're talking about particularly here in the metroplex, Julien. As Chris mentioned in his opening remarks, we've been growing just a little bit north of that 1.7% here in the metroplex, probably in the 40,000 to 45,000 customer range per year. It's a lot of residential growth. And as you get those rooftops, as you know, you'll have the supporting commercial businesses as well. We do have a few industrial customers that come in the metroplex area. A lot of this is also showing up in residential rooftops down in the Austin corridor as well. Again, that's why we're putting in that Permian connector line down there; forecasted growth, forecasted demand, expansion down there with all of the people moving in from various locations across the country. That's what we're seeing at least here in Texas across our other jurisdictions, as we talked about, it's been a really good diverse mix of not only residential but as well as industrial growth as well. I think at our fourth quarter call that we added 45 industrial customers last year that we anticipate once they're fully online or utilized somewhere between 12 BCF and 14 BCF of natural gas, that equates to around 200,000 residential customers. And these are customers that are in the metals, they're in healthcare, they're in the auto industry, a good variety of distilling. So we're getting a good mix of natural gas demand and response for the product across all sectors, whether that's Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, good industrial growth. We continue to see good residential growth in our Colorado properties with people coming from the West Coast into Colorado, and then again outside of Olathe, Kansas property.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. My first question is just on cost overall. I think you've recorded in the fiscal first quarter that distribution gas cost of over $7 per Mcf versus I think $4 range last year. And thinking about that and other potential inflation factors, whether it's labor or other commodities for CapEx, any -- when you do the math, any concern there in your ability to achieve, whether it's a '22 or beyond CapEx while managing the bill impact?\nKevin Akers: Yes, so I'll start out and then hand over to Chris. The short answer is no on that. As you've heard us talk about at the end of last quarter when we kind of rolled out our five-year plan and forward-look there, we did have some of this contemplated in our O&M projection that Chris just talked about. As well you've heard us also talk about we worked very hard throughout the procurement team to stay ahead of some of our needs. We try and keep at least a six-month inventory. We're trying to increase that now, whether that's at our supplier or in our own warehouses. And as you may have heard us say before, all of our steel pipe needs for this fiscal year, all those projects that we just talked about, all that pipe is on site, at location. So we feel like we're in really good shape. We stay ahead of our needs to our vendors. So at this point, I think given the work for our procurement team, given that we've got our pipe needs, at least our steel pipe needs covered at this point, we anticipate that our O&M levels that we have baked in right now should be able to handle what we're seeing right now. It should not have any impact on our CapEx spend going forward in the short range.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Thanks for that reminder and that's good color. My second question is kind of related to that or maybe on the other side. I think we've seen the gas basis in your Texas region kind of widen out, again, talks about takeaway capacitor concerns. You're obviously working in line to connect with the Kinder line there, but any views on future gas cost forecast in your Texas jurisdiction and any opportunity to potentially take advantage of that spread in the near or longer term? Acknowledging that from a hedging perspective, I know you're limited on kind of what you can do.\nKevin Akers: Yes, I'll start out and again we'll see if Chris wants to add anything here. I'm looking at the Waha prices this morning, cash prices, and we\u2019re sitting at $3.60 out there. The forwards for Waha if you're taking a look at that for the April off period is around $3.45, something like that. So no crystal ball here, obviously. But I think when you look at the rig count that we're seeing, just last week of well over 600 rigs in the U.S. working, about half those in the Permian, we're seeing production levels that are now in the 14 BCF to 14.25 BCF a day range with projections. I think by the end of this calendar year first of '23 in the 16 BCF a day range, I would hope that kind of supply pushes these prices down even further. But we'll have to wait and see on that piece of it. But very encouraged again by the number of rigs, the supply that's coming online. And just one last comment there on the basis differential. Remember that that's part of our Rider REV mechanism we have on APT and 75% of that goes directly back to the customer to reduce those rates, so that is a sharing mechanism there for those customers' benefit. Chris, anything additional?\nChris Forsythe: Yes, I think the Rider REV comment is spot on, Kevin. We don't -- we certainly think about that in our planning process. It is not a material portion of APT business.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. But at least it would help with the bill headroom, so I guess indirect benefit on that front.\nChris Forsythe: Yes.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Thank you so much.\nChris Forsythe: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Ryan Levine of Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nRyan Levine: Good morning.\nKevin Akers: Good morning.\nRyan Levine: I was hoping just to follow up on the APT expansion to the Permian Express. Can you elaborate on kind of the timeline in terms of executing on that project and if you're seeing any other commercial development opportunities off of APT that are getting more traction?\nKevin Akers: Well, as I said in my opening remarks there, this is going to be a 22 mile line, 36-inch. It certainly will help us meet the forecasted growth in that Austin corridor, both in Williamson and Travis counties down there. And we anticipate this line to be in service late this calendar year, it could be first of next year. We're well on our way with all the necessary aspects to get that project rolling forward. So you're right. Those are the projects outlined; Phase 2, S2 Phase 2 and Phase 3 of S2 and then project here are the major projects we have on tap for APT along with the finalization of that third cavern there. And those all again will bring that diversity, reliability and versatility to APT system, many areas to bring supply and increase capacity.\nRyan Levine: And you have all the right aways [ph] and supplies already procured to help execute on that project?\nKevin Akers: Yes, we have the majority of what we need to begin work on that at this time.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And switching gears in terms of the financing plan. You outlined your maturity schedule. It looks there is a bigger maturity due next year with some floating rate. Curious how you're thinking about staggering your debt maturities going forward and also in context of the recent decision from yesterday?\nChris Forsythe: Sure. So the big maturity that you see next year is the $2.2 billion interim Winter Storm financing we executed last March. We're anticipating with the completion of the Texas securitization process by the end of the fiscal year that we would use the net proceeds received from that securitization process to repay that $2.2 billion. So, again, setting aside the $2.2 billion, when you look at it, the average maturity is 19.23 years. We're in a very, very good spot. And as we continue to execute the five-year financing plan, Dan is here and his team are looking at all the options that are on the table in terms of laddering and maturity schedules, all in with the idea of trying to minimize costs for our customers.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then last question for me. There continues to be talk of LDC assets in the market for sale. Curious if there's any change in how you're looking at deals and if you're spending any more time contemplating acquisitions?\nKevin Akers: Well, as we've said before, we certainly don't have our heads in the sand here. We always got our eyes and ears open on the market and what's going on. But we believe we have the best properties out there and we're in very supportive natural gas states, communities, we have very supportive regulatory and legislative jurisdiction that you know with six of our eight states having All Fuels Bill. Another one, Virginia, I believe has something in the legislature this year along the lines of an All Fuels Bill, so that could move us to seven of our eight jurisdictions. As we talked about this morning, these communities are growing. They're expanding both residential, commercial and industrial. And as we've talked about before, we don't need an acquisition to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth that we talked about in our plan. So at this point, we remain focused on executing our system modernization strategy, as we continue our journey to be the safest provider in natural gas services.\nRyan Levine: I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Dan Meziere for closing remarks.\nDan Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy and again thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our Web site through March 31, 2022. Have a good day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my update today, I want to take just this opportunity to recognize and say thank you to all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees. It is through your dedication, your focus and effort that we safely provide natural gas service to 3.2 million customers in 1,400 communities across our eight states. Thank you for all you do every day for Atmos Energy.  I also want to take this time to thank our hometown heroes, our first responders and emergency responders for their continued dedication and support for all of us. And as you just heard, we're off to a great start. The results Chris summarized reflect the commitment of all 4,700 Atmos Energy employees as we work together to continue modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems on our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services.  During the first quarter, we achieved several project milestones that further enhance the safety, reliability, versatility, and supply diversification of our system. For example, at APT, we placed into service Phase 1 of a two-phase pipeline integrity project that will replace 125 miles of Line X. As a reminder, Line X runs from Waha to Dallas and is key to providing reliable service to the local distribution companies behind APT's system. Phase 1 replaced 63 miles of 36-inch pipeline. Phase 2 includes an additional 62 miles of 36-inch pipeline and is anticipated to be completed late this calendar year. Additionally, we completed the first of a three-phase project to replace our existing Line S2. This 91 mile, 36-inch project will provide additional supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the East side of the growing Dallas Fort Worth metroplex. Phase 1 replaced 21 miles of this line and Phase 2 will replace an additional 18 miles and is expected to be completed late this calendar year. Phase 3, which will replace the remaining 52 miles, is expected to be in service in 2023. During the completion of Phase 1 for Line X and Phase 1 for Line S2, our teams used recompression practices to avoid venting or flaring over 70,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. This is an excellent example of how Atmos Energy's environmental strategy is being integrated into our daily operations.  APT's third salt dome cavern project at Bethel is now approximately 80% complete and remains on track to be placed in service late this calendar year. As a reminder, this project is anticipated to provide an additional 5 BCF to 6 BCF of cavern storage capacity.  As I mentioned during our November call, we have started work on a 22 mile, 36-inch line that will connect the Southern end of APT's system with the 42-inch Kinder Morgan Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This new line will support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the North of Austin in both Williamson and Travis County in Texas. This line is expected to be in service late December of this year.  In addition to those system modernization projects, we continue to make progress in advancing our comprehensive environmental strategy that is focused on reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and reduce our environmental impact from our operations in the following five key areas; operations, fleet, facility, gas supply and customers.  For example, across our storage facilities, we utilize advanced methane detection technologies, including gas cloud imaging, acoustic monitoring, forward-looking infrared handheld cameras, and laser-based remote methane leak detectors. At APT storage fields, we are making progress with the installation of the remaining gas cloud imaging cameras for continuous methane monitoring and anticipate completion by the end of this fiscal year. Our RNG strategy focuses on identifying opportunities to transport RNG for our customers. We currently transport approximately 8 BCF a year and anticipate another four projects to come online within the next 12 to 18 months. Those four projects are expected to provide an additional BCF a year of RNG capacity.  Furthermore, we are evaluating approximately 20 opportunities that could further expand our RNG transportation. Two, Zero Net Energy Homes are underway in Texas; one in Taylor and the other in Dallas. The home in Taylor is being developed through our partnership with the Williamson County Habitat for Humanity, and we estimate the home to be completed in late March.  And in Dallas, we are working with the Dallas Habitat for Humanity and estimate construction of this Zero Net Energy Home to begin mid-March. These homes use high efficiency natural gas appliances, coupled with rooftop solar panels and insulation to minimize the home's carbon footprint.  These Zero Net Energy Homes demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas play in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in an affordable manner. Providing these families with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost efficient is just one way Atmos Energy feels safe in thriving communities.  And finally, over the next five years, we will invest $13 billion to $14 billion in capital to support the replacement of 5,000 to 6,000 miles of our distribution, transmission pipe, or about 6% to 8% of our total system. We will also replace 100 to 150 steel service lines which is expected to reduce our inventory by approximately 20%. This level of replacement work is expected to reduce methane emissions from our system by 15% to 20% over the next five years.  Our first quarter activities and initiatives reflect the continued successful execution of our strategy to modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems as we continue our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services.  These efforts, along with the strength of our balance sheet, our strong liquidity, has Atmos Energy well positioned to continue serving the vital role we play in every community; that is delivering safe, reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  We appreciate your time and interest this morning. We'll now open the call for questions. Thank you. So on Kansas, as I said, we're kind of in early stages right now and beginning the securitization proceedings. In the terms of tenders, it will depend upon what market conditions look like. We're obviously going to be looking to seek AAA rating on that. And we will be working with our banking partners as well as with the staff to determine the appropriate period to make these securitization costs, if you will, as affordable as we can for our Kansas customers. But it's still too early to tell where we are at this point. Yes, the dialogue we've had with both Moody's and S&P has been -- they've basically been telling us we're going to wait to see what the Texas Railroad Commission financing looks like. That was issued yesterday. I'm sure they have a copy of that. We're anticipating conversations with those rating agencies hopefully here this second fiscal quarter. Sure. You're talking about particularly here in the metroplex, Julien. As Chris mentioned in his opening remarks, we've been growing just a little bit north of that 1.7% here in the metroplex, probably in the 40,000 to 45,000 customer range per year. It's a lot of residential growth. And as you get those rooftops, as you know, you'll have the supporting commercial businesses as well. We do have a few industrial customers that come in the metroplex area. A lot of this is also showing up in residential rooftops down in the Austin corridor as well. Again, that's why we're putting in that Permian connector line down there; forecasted growth, forecasted demand, expansion down there with all of the people moving in from various locations across the country. That's what we're seeing at least here in Texas across our other jurisdictions, as we talked about, it's been a really good diverse mix of not only residential but as well as industrial growth as well. I think at our fourth quarter call that we added 45 industrial customers last year that we anticipate once they're fully online or utilized somewhere between 12 BCF and 14 BCF of natural gas, that equates to around 200,000 residential customers. And these are customers that are in the metals, they're in healthcare, they're in the auto industry, a good variety of distilling. So we're getting a good mix of natural gas demand and response for the product across all sectors, whether that's Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, good industrial growth. We continue to see good residential growth in our Colorado properties with people coming from the West Coast into Colorado, and then again outside of Olathe, Kansas property. Yes, so I'll start out and then hand over to Chris. The short answer is no on that. As you've heard us talk about at the end of last quarter when we kind of rolled out our five-year plan and forward-look there, we did have some of this contemplated in our O&M projection that Chris just talked about. As well you've heard us also talk about we worked very hard throughout the procurement team to stay ahead of some of our needs. We try and keep at least a six-month inventory. We're trying to increase that now, whether that's at our supplier or in our own warehouses. And as you may have heard us say before, all of our steel pipe needs for this fiscal year, all those projects that we just talked about, all that pipe is on site, at location. So we feel like we're in really good shape. We stay ahead of our needs to our vendors. So at this point, I think given the work for our procurement team, given that we've got our pipe needs, at least our steel pipe needs covered at this point, we anticipate that our O&M levels that we have baked in right now should be able to handle what we're seeing right now. It should not have any impact on our CapEx spend going forward in the short range. Yes, I'll start out and again we'll see if Chris wants to add anything here. I'm looking at the Waha prices this morning, cash prices, and we\u2019re sitting at $3.60 out there. The forwards for Waha if you're taking a look at that for the April off period is around $3.45, something like that. So no crystal ball here, obviously. But I think when you look at the rig count that we're seeing, just last week of well over 600 rigs in the U.S. working, about half those in the Permian, we're seeing production levels that are now in the 14 BCF to 14.25 BCF a day range with projections. I think by the end of this calendar year first of '23 in the 16 BCF a day range, I would hope that kind of supply pushes these prices down even further. But we'll have to wait and see on that piece of it. But very encouraged again by the number of rigs, the supply that's coming online. And just one last comment there on the basis differential. Remember that that's part of our Rider REV mechanism we have on APT and 75% of that goes directly back to the customer to reduce those rates, so that is a sharing mechanism there for those customers' benefit. Chris, anything additional? Good morning. Well, as I said in my opening remarks there, this is going to be a 22 mile line, 36-inch. It certainly will help us meet the forecasted growth in that Austin corridor, both in Williamson and Travis counties down there. And we anticipate this line to be in service late this calendar year, it could be first of next year. We're well on our way with all the necessary aspects to get that project rolling forward. So you're right. Those are the projects outlined; Phase 2, S2 Phase 2 and Phase 3 of S2 and then project here are the major projects we have on tap for APT along with the finalization of that third cavern there. And those all again will bring that diversity, reliability and versatility to APT system, many areas to bring supply and increase capacity. Yes, we have the majority of what we need to begin work on that at this time. Well, as we've said before, we certainly don't have our heads in the sand here. We always got our eyes and ears open on the market and what's going on. But we believe we have the best properties out there and we're in very supportive natural gas states, communities, we have very supportive regulatory and legislative jurisdiction that you know with six of our eight states having All Fuels Bill. Another one, Virginia, I believe has something in the legislature this year along the lines of an All Fuels Bill, so that could move us to seven of our eight jurisdictions. As we talked about this morning, these communities are growing. They're expanding both residential, commercial and industrial. And as we've talked about before, we don't need an acquisition to meet our 6% to 8% earnings per share growth that we talked about in our plan. So at this point, we remain focused on executing our system modernization strategy, as we continue our journey to be the safest provider in natural gas services. Thank you."

            "name": "Chris Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported fiscal '22 first quarter net income of $249 million, a $1.86 per diluted share. Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations, reflects the ongoing execution of our operating, financial and regulatory strategies.  Consolidated operating income decreased $276 million in the first quarter, primarily due to a $39 million decrease in revenues associated with the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities. As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal '21, and through the end of last fiscal year, we've reached agreement with regulators in various states to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities, generally over a three to five-year period.  These refunds reduced revenues throughout the fiscal year when those revenues are billed. The corresponding reduction in our interim annual effective income tax rate is recognized at the beginning of the fiscal year. Therefore, period-over-period changes in revenues and income tax expense may not offset with interim periods that will substantially offset by the end of the fiscal year. Excluding the impact of these excess deferred tax liability refunds, operating income increased $16 million over the prior year quarter.  Slide 5 summarizes the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both our operating segments, driven by increased safety reliability capital spending, totaled $47 million. Continued robust customer growth in our distribution segment increased operating income by $4 million.  For the 12 months ended December 31, we added 55,000 new customers, which represent a 1.7% increase. These increases are partially offset by a $20 million increase in consolidated O&M expense. As a reminder, in the prior quarter, we deferred non-compliance spending into late in the fiscal year as we evaluated our customer load during that time period. Therefore, the period-over-period variance partly reflects this timing difference.  The first quarter increase is primarily driven by increased pipeline maintenance activities. Consolidated capital spending increased to $684 million. The $227 million period-over-period increase reflects increased system modernization spending in our distribution segment, spending to close out Phase 1 of APT's Line X and Line S2 projects and project timing.  We remain on track to spend $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year with more than 80% of this spending focused on modernizing a distribution and transmission network, which also reduces methane emissions.  We are also on track with our regulatory filings. To date, we have implemented $73 million in annualized regulatory outcomes, refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities, and currently with about $36 million in progress. Slide 17 through 24 summarizes these outcomes.  Slide 16 outlines our planned filings for the remainder of the fiscal year. To date, we have completed over $1 billion of long-term financing. Following the completion of the $600 million 30-year senior note issuance in October, we executed forward sales arrangements under our ATM program for approximately 2.7 million shares for $260 million. And we settled forward agreements on 2.7 million shares for approximately $260 million.  As of December 31, we have approximately $295 million in net proceeds available under our existing forward sale agreements. As a result of this activity, we have now priced a substantial portion of fiscal '22 equity needs and anticipate satisfying the remaining equity needs through our ATM program. As a result of this financing activity, our equity capitalization, excluding the $2.2 billion of Winter Storm financing, was 59% as of December 31.  Additionally, we finished the quarter with approximately $3.1 billion of liquidity. In January, we completed the issuance of $2 million of long-term debt through a tap of our existing 10-year 2.635% notes due September 2029. The net proceeds were used to pay off $200 million term loan that was scheduled to mature in April.  Following this offering and excluding the interim Winter Storm financing, our weighted average cost of debt decreased 3.81% and our weighted average maturity increased 19.23 years, which further strengthens our financial profile. Additional details for financing activities, our equity forward arrangements, as well as our financial profile can be found on Slide 7 through 10. And we continue to make progress on securitization.  Yesterday, the Texas Railroad Commission unanimously issued a financing order authorizing the Texas Public Financing Authority to issue customer rate relief bonds to securitize costs associated with Winter Storm Uri over a period not to exceed 30 years. We currently anticipate the securitization transaction will be completed by the end of our fiscal year. Upon receipt of the securitization funds, we will repay the $2.2 billion of Winter Storm financing we issued last March.  And in Kansas, we started our securitization proceedings at the Kansas Corporation Commission in late January. Based on the current procedural schedule, we are anticipating a financing order by the end of our fiscal third quarter.  Our first quarter performance was a solid start to the fiscal year. The execution of our operational, financial and regulatory plans are on track which positions us well to achieve our fiscal '22 earnings per share guidance of $5.40 to $5.60. Details around our guidance can be found in slides 12 and 13.  Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for his closing remarks. Kevin? Yes, sure, Richard. This is Chris. Good morning. Really the O&M spending was generally in line with our expectations. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, when you look at our current year compared to the prior year quarter, the prior year quarter was a bit of a low mark. So when you look at where we are now, it's roughly a 15% increase quarter-over-quarter. But we looked to the midpoint of our guidance compared with last year's O&M levels, that's about a 3% increase. So right now, we're still seeing O&M trending in that $7 million to $10 million range. And we believe that at least where we are as we sit today that that spending will continue to be in line with this expectation. Sure. Again, we typically execute '18 to '22 annual regulatory filings. The fiscal second quarter is our busiest filing period. So we'll be making a number of GRIP filings at APT as well as in our Mid-Tex and West Texas divisions. We'll also be making a regulatory filing in Mississippi in early March as well as in Louisiana, and a secondary filing in July in Mississippi. So a lot of activity to be coming over the next several months. Much of this will be implemented by the end of the fiscal year. We will also file our West Texas and Mid-Tex filings, generally at the end of March 1, first part of April, and those are scheduled to become implemented on or around October 1. So really at start of the next fiscal year. With respect to APT, the general rate case is scheduled to begin in our fiscal 2023 time period. So we've factored that into our five-year plan. So the GRIP filing that we'll make here in mid February will be the last GRIP filing before that annual rate proceeding next year. Thank you, Richard. Sure. So our effective tax rate for the first quarter was about 5.9% that we're anticipating, including the excess deferred tax liabilities and effective income tax rate in the 7% to 9%, given that we are refunding these excess deferred tax liabilities over the next three to five years, that effective tax rate should be in place in that general range over that time period. So when you back out the impact of the excess deferred tax liability refunds, the marginal effective income tax rate is in the 22% to 24% range. Yes, I think the Rider REV comment is spot on, Kevin. We don't -- we certainly think about that in our planning process. It is not a material portion of APT business. Yes. Thank you. Sure. So the big maturity that you see next year is the $2.2 billion interim Winter Storm financing we executed last March. We're anticipating with the completion of the Texas securitization process by the end of the fiscal year that we would use the net proceeds received from that securitization process to repay that $2.2 billion. So, again, setting aside the $2.2 billion, when you look at it, the average maturity is 19.23 years. We're in a very, very good spot. And as we continue to execute the five-year financing plan, Dan is here and his team are looking at all the options that are on the table in terms of laddering and maturity schedules, all in with the idea of trying to minimize costs for our customers."

I will now turn the conference over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Meziere: Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com, under the Investor Relations tab.  As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 37 and are more fully described in our SEC filings.  I will now turn the call over to Kevin.\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy.  As Saturday is Veterans Day, I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces and those currently serving. Approximately 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are a part of the nearly 20 million Americans who bravely served our country. Thank you all for your service.  Yesterday, we reported our earnings per share of $6.10, which represents the 21st consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in the call.  I will begin today's call highlighting a few of the many accomplishments achieved in fiscal '23 and we'll close with a few updates on key pipeline projects and some thoughts about fiscal '24.  This past October 18 marked Atmos Energy's 40th anniversary as an independent company. We continue to build on the past and focus on the future, and be guided by the simple values laid out by our Founding Chairman, Charles K. Vaughan, of honesty, integrity and good moral character, and supported for more than a quarter of century by our culture atmosphere. These values, combined with the laser focus of our 5,000 dedicated employees on our vision, continue to benefit our customers, our communities and the environment.  I've said it before, and I will say it again today, our employees are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company.  In fiscal '23, we continue to execute our proven strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. Our fiscal '23 capital investment of over $2.8 billion, supported the modernization of our distribution and transmission systems through the replacement of over 900 miles of distribution and transmission pipe and replacement of more than 47,000 service loans. This investment also supported the strong economic development we continue to see in our service territories.  In fiscal '23, we added nearly 61,000 new customers, with over 46,000 of those new customers located here in Texas. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued its streak of record employment. For the 12 months ended September, the seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over 14.5 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, adding nearly 436,000 from September 2022 to September 2023.  And according to a study recently conducted by Site Selection Group, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is projected to add over 674,000 people by 2028, to reach 8.5 million, while the Austin Round Rock Georgetown Corridor is projected to add over 324,000 people by 2028, to reach 2.7 million.  In fiscal '23, we continue to see good commercial growth as well, adding nearly 3,000 new commercial customers. Our industrial demand for natural gas in our service territories has also remained strong. In fiscal '23, we added 55 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 19 Bcf, once they are fully operational. The 19 Bcf of annual usage is equivalent to adding nearly 367,000 residential customers on a volumetric basis. This growing demand from all of our customer classes demonstrates the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development across our service territory.  We continue to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of APT system to support this growth during fiscal '23. We completed Phases 2 and 3 of our 4-phase, 104-mile Line S-2 project. As a reminder, Line S-2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale place, to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex.  Additionally, we completed the final 63-mile portion of our 137-mile, 36-inch, Line X integrity replacement project. We also completed our third salt-dome cavern at our Bethel storage facility. This cavern provides additional support to APT's operations and adds over 6 Bcf of new working gas capacity.  We remain on track to complete Line PC by the end of the calendar year. This 22-mile, 36-inch line will connect the southern end of APT system with the 42-inch Kinder Morgan Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. Our new line will support current demand and the forecasted growth, as well as increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in both Williamson and Travis Counties in Texas.  Our customer support associates and service technicians continued their exceptional customer service, and once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers. The Atmos Energy team continues to build trust as they help nearly 62,000 customers receive over $29 million in energy assistance funds. Thank you team for taking exceptional care of our customers each and every day.  Finally, through our fueling safe and thriving communities initiatives, our employees made a difference in the lives of others by supporting schools and students with books, meals, Macs, as we also honored our health care workers, first responders and helped our neighbors in need by supporting more than 1,409 profits.  And for over 200 local food banks and shelters, the financial and voluntary resources our team provided translated into nearly 5.5 million meals being served to our neighbors in need. And we continue to partner with local Habitat for Humanity organization to provide families with Zero Net Energy Homes. These homes are designed to produce more energy than they consume through the use of high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and advanced insulation materials.  We completed 2 new Zero Net Energy Homes in fiscal '23, and we'll have completed 12 total ZNE homes by the end of fiscal '24. These homes demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner, and is another way Atmos Energy fuel safe and thriving communities.  I'm very proud of Atmos Energy and our full team and their many accomplishments in fiscal '23. I will now turn the call over to Chris to discuss our fiscal '23 financial results, our fiscal '24 guidance, and an updated 5-year plan through fiscal '28. Chris?\nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal '23 earnings per share of $6.10 increased 8.9% over fiscal '22. Our performance continues to reflect the successful execution of our operating, regulatory and financing strategies.  In fiscal '23, we implemented $269 million of annualized operating income increases excluding the amortization of excess deferred tax liability. These outcomes combined with outcomes received in fiscal '22, increased operating income by $254 million this fiscal year. Strong customer growth, higher consumption and rising industrial load in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $30 million.  Consolidated O&M increased $55 million to $765 million, largely driven by higher levels of service orders and increased head count to support our growing service territory, primarily in Texas. This thing came in at the lower end of our updated guidance range as we saw some moderation in inflation in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.  Fiscal '23 capital spending of $2.8 billion represent a 15% increase over the prior fiscal year, 85% of that spend was dedicated to improve the safety and reliability of our system. As a result of this spending, our rate base increased by 18% and estimated $16.6 billion as of September 30.  Finally, we completed $1.6 billion of long-term financing and completed the securitization process in Kansas and Texas. We finished the fiscal year with an equity capitalization of 61.5% and approximately $2.7 billion of available liquidity, which leaves us well positioned to support our future operations.  Looking forward, our strategy continues to focus on system modernization through disciplined capital spending, seeking timely recovery of our costs through our regulatory mechanisms, while financing our operations using a balance of equity and long-term debt to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, mitigate financing risk and minimizing the cost of financing to our customers. We anticipate the execution of this strategy will continue to support 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend per share growth.  For fiscal '24, we anticipate earnings per share will be between $6.45 and $6.65, and we anticipate fiscal '28 earnings per share to be in the range of $8.35 and $8.75. Additionally, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 160th consecutive quarterly cash dividend as an indicated fiscal '24 annual dividend of $3.22, an 8.8% increase over fiscal '23. This plan anticipates total capital spending of approximately $17 billion. This level of spending will continue to support rate base growth of about 11% to 13% per year, which is expected to increase estimated rate base by approximately -- to approximately $29 billion in fiscal '28.  In addition to our capital spending, another significant use of cash will be for taxes. We expect to refund $300 million of excess deferred tax liabilities over the next 5 years, with approximately 70% of this amount be funded during fiscal '24 and fiscal '25. And we anticipate we will become a material federal cash tax payer within the next 3 years because of 15% corporate minimum tax that was included in The Inflation Reduction Act. Our O&M spending will continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety.  We have assumed O&M inflation of 3.5% annually through fiscal '28, from fiscal '23 levels. For fiscal '24, we anticipate O&M to range from $780 million to $800 million. This 5-year plan includes approximately $10 million of incremental long-term debt and financing, which has been reflected in our earnings per share guidance for both fiscal '24 and fiscal '28.  Following completion of our $900 million long-term debt issuance in October, our weighted average cost of debt stood at 4.1%, and our debt maturity schedule is very manageable. Our weighted at maturity is 18.4 years, and our next significant tranche of debt is not scheduled to mature until June of 2027.  Additionally, our financing strategy does not contemplate material exposure to floating rate interest rates. To further mitigate interest rate risk, we have $900 million in forward starting interest rate swaps in place to hedge portions of our anticipated long-term debt issuances in fiscal 2025 and '26. The effective weighted average rate of these swaps is 1.59%.  Finally, we intend to continue utilizing our ATM program to meet our equity financing needs. As of September 30, we have priced $467 million which represents a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 equity need. Handling recovery of our costs remains a key component of our strategy. We are off to a good start in fiscal '24.  Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we had implemented $113 million in annualized operating income increases in our Distribution segment, and we have 5 filings in progress taking about $137 million. Included in this amount is $107 million requested in APT's general rate case.  On October 24, APT and the intervening parties filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the Texas Railroad Commission. The settlement proposes a rate base of $4.3 billion, an authorized rate of return of 8.49%, equity capitalization of 60.44% and an authorized ROE of 11.45%.  We anticipate the settlement agreement will be on the commission's agenda for the December 13 meeting. If approved as filed, this settlement would result in a $27 million increase in annualized operating income. We remain confident the execution of this strategy, will continue to support our ability to modernize our system and to support the continued economic development in our service territories. Our customers will continue to benefit from this strategy as we expect our average residential bill will remain one of the most competitively priced utility bills in our customers' health.  Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin to say some closing remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. And as you've heard this morning, a successful fiscal '23 has us well positioned for fiscal '24.  As part of our $2.9 billion fiscal '24 capital spending plan, APT will continue to focus on enhancing the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of its system. APT will continue to work on the remaining 40 miles of the Line S-2, 36-inch pipeline project, which we anticipate having the final phase in service by December of 2024.  In fiscal '23, APT began a multiphase Line WA Loop project that will install approximately 80 miles of 36-inch pipeline supported by the northern part of the system that serves the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Phase 1, approximately 24 miles is anticipated to be completed by the end of this calendar year. Design is underway for Phase 2, which will install an additional 40 miles and we anticipate that Phase 2 will be placed in service by the end of calendar year 2025. Phase 3 will include the installation of the final 16 miles, and we anticipate that, that phase will be placed into service by the end of calendar year 2026.  Additionally, in fiscal '24, APT will begin construction of a 54-mile, 36-inch pipeline from our Bethel storage facility to our Groesbeck compressor station to support forecasted growth in Williamson and Travis Counties in Central Texas. We anticipate that the project will be placed in service by the end of calendar year 2025.  Our gas supply team has us well positioned for this upcoming heating season to supply reliability and at competitive prices. Our gas supply team has hedged 50% of our winter supply needs, through a combination of storage and financial contracts, at a weighted average cost of $3.31.  I'm very excited about the direction and long-term stability of Atmos Energy. The foundation has been set with a proven safety driven strategy accompanied with organic growth that yields 6% to 8% fully-regulated earnings per share and commensurate dividend per share growth, supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of investment in natural gas infrastructure, with 96% of our rate base situated in 6 of our 8 states that have passed legislation in support of Energy Choice.  We have a long runway of work to support the planned $17 billion in capital spending over the next 5 years as we continue to modernize our natural gas distribution transmission and storage systems.  As Chris noted, most of our fiscal '24 financing costs are known, and we have hedged $900 million of our financing needs beyond fiscal 2024. The strength of our balance sheet and available liquidity will continue to support our operations in a cost-effective manner for our customers.  Focusing on long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy as reflected in the vital role we play in every community, safely delivering reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of Barclays.\nNicholas Campanella: Congrats on the anniversary here. So I guess to start, you've been fairly programmatic in how you issue equity and acknowledging kind of 2024 is largely priced here as well. How do we kind of think about future issuances just given the size of the capital plan seems to go up every year, that's likely going to pressure equity higher. Are you still very comfortable that you can do this all with ATM? Or would you consider other means?\nChristopher Forsythe: Nick, it's Chris. Yes, right now, we remain pretty confident that we can still use the ATM to fund those equity needs. As you know, we have a balanced financing strategy. We're certainly looking at a number of factors that's -- cost of the customer, the strength of the balance sheet which supports credit ratings, credit facilities, our ability to finance attractively in the capital markets and equity is a component of that. So we're certainly looking at that particular tool. I mean, we have other tools available to us if needed. But at this time, given the liquidity that we have in the market, we believe we can satisfy those needs through the ATM.\nNicholas Campanella: Got it. That's super helpful. And then congrats on the APT settlement. I guess just are you reflecting that current settlement outcome in the 6% to 8% guidance here? Or do you wait until December 12?\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes, that has been contemplated in the guidance we issued yesterday.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland: Am I coming through clearly?\nKevin Akers: You are.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Following up on the financing side, just curious if 50% to 60% equity capitalization is still the target to think about? Or is 60% more appropriate given the outcome on the APT side?\nChristopher Forsythe: So we look at the balance sheet holistically across all of our jurisdictions, as well as what we need to continue to support our credit ratings. So we have skewed towards the upper end of a 50% to 60% range now for the last few years. we're comfortable to be in that range, and that's kind of where we anticipate being over the next 5 years.\nRichard Sunderland: Understood. And then turning to the O&M side, you laid out a little bit of this in the script, but just curious if you could parse the recent O&M trends a little bit more. How much of 2H is moderation versus timing? And then how much conservatism is or is not baked into that 2024 outlook?\nKevin Akers: I mean, again, we've been at this 3% to 3.5% projection on O&M now for quite a long time. We feel comfortable in that range. As you know, we've used different levers over time when needed to mitigate any of the O&M pressures that we see coming down the road. And again, with some of the additional pullback in some of our service territories in the housing market, we've seen line locates costs come down, we've seen other compliance costs come down. So we remain confident as we head into '24 right now that what we have projected out there, of the $780 million to $800 million, we feel very confident in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabe Moreen of Mizuho.\nGabriel Moreen: Maybe if I can also stick on the O&M topic just a little bit. You addressed it a bit, but I noticed that the long-term O&M guidance went a little -- smidge higher, but it sounds like you're very confident at least in the near-term outlook for sort of your O&M cost. Can you just address that long-term guidance in the context of sort of what you're seeing near term and how you felt? Maybe a little -- needed to nudge it up a little bit?\nKevin Akers: Yes, again, I'll reiterate what I said previously. There towards the last quarter, we saw some of the line locating requests drive down just a few percentage points in some of our jurisdictions. Even though here in Texas, we saw an 8% increase. So that's what we were looking at there. That certainly reduced some of our compliance costs. Then again with some of our other compliance activity and timing of those sort of things, we think we've got a good handle on what the next year, the 3- to 5-year window looks like on planned O&M activity, compliance activity, those sort of things. So those were some of the drivers we were looking at that came out of the last quarter and allowed us to stay in that 3% to 3.5% range and at $780 million to $800 million O&M.\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. And Gabe, I'll add to that. There's a lot of compliance work that we still have to do as a utility. The rules continue to become more stringent. So we're anticipating some of that in the 3.5%. A little bit to higher -- a little bit higher inflation than we've had in the past, although it has moderated somewhat in the third and fourth quarters. And as a final reminder, with our annual mechanisms that we have in several of our jurisdictions, we had the opportunity to recover that fairly timely, generally within a year. So it shouldn't be a significant drag if approved for those annual mechanisms as we anticipate.\nGabriel Moreen: Got it. And maybe if I can also ask in the context of becoming a cash taxpayer over the next couple of years. Is there anything you can do kind of as an offset, whether from a corporate level or from a regulatory standpoint, to offset maybe some of the cash impact there?  And then maybe also bigger picture, just what you're assuming sort of on interest rates and recoverability from a cost of capital standpoint, over the next couple of years given how dramatically rates have shifted, I guess, since the last 5-year uptake?\nChristopher Forsythe: Sure. I'll address the cash taxes first. First, we've got excess deferred taxes as I mentioned. That's beginning to tail off kind of after a couple of years. The IRA for us expects we should kick in, in the mid part of the 5-year plan, and that's predicated on just to the continued growth of the company. Fortunately, there aren't a lot of levers for us to pull. It's really a 15%, or you end up becoming a cash taxpayer as we begin to burn off some of the NOL shield that we have. And that's been contemplated in our plan.  So we knew going into this plan that we had either 15% or the fact that NOL shields were going to be becoming lower. So there's not a lot of levers we can do. Our tax team is obviously looking at opportunities for tax planning strategies. It's too soon to say if there's anything material that will come from that. But right now, we have conservatively estimated what will be a full cash -- federal cash tax payer have in the middle part of our 5-year plan. With respect to interest rate costs, we certainly have reflected what we believe are current market conditions in the 5-year plan. I'll also just remind you that we have the $900 million in hedges at a weighted average treasury cost of about 1.59%. That's a significant portion of our anticipated FY '25 needs and a fair amount of our anticipated FY '26 need.  So AMT will continue to look for opportunities to lock in some hedges, but given the higher elevated or where the interest rates are right now, it may not be as prudent or as attractive to do so as it was a couple of years ago, when rates were in the sub-2% range.\nKevin Akers: Yes. I just want to reemphasize that the plan does reflect, as Chris said, they're us becoming a tax cash payer out in that time frame. So that's all backed into the plan that's out there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Just maybe picking up where Gabe left off there. Just on the question of taxes, if you don't mind. What about -- for income statement purposes, how do you think about effective tax rate here? I mean, obviously, the comment is about going to a full cash taxpayer here in the next 3 years, certainly relevant from financing. But how do you think about the uptick, obviously, from '23 to '24, and then from there on out, in terms of the effective tax rate on the income statement. Obviously, I get that some of that over time is going to be subsumed back into the regulated cost structure. But I'm just curious on how you would set expectations and if there's any kind of question about recovery and timing there, as well in the next few years as you see that uptick?\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. We'll certainly see an uptick in the effective income tax rate. Again, that's being influenced right now, certainly the last 2 or 3 years with these excess of deferred tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate 2 years ago was in the 11% range, it ticked up closer to 15%. And we'll end up being in that 22% to 23% range here in the not-too-distant future. Again, all of these costs, we believe, are recoverable, including the IRA corporate minimum tax and our regulatory and tax teams are working on strategies right now to begin dialogue with those regulators to educate them on where that is in terms of what the law requires and then what the recoverability might look like.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Right. So regulatory strategy on the come here but not overly concerned about what that does in terms of, like maybe a lag headwind here in, call it, '25 and '26 as you kind of get to that more normalized level, if you will?\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes, correct. Not material impact. And again, all that's been reflected in the guidance for FY '24 through to FY '28.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Very much appreciated. And then just on the O&M side, I just wanted to understand, as you think about that normalized, I think you said 3% to 3.5%. Like, how do you think about what is going on in the context of line locates within that composition through the future? I mean, obviously, that's been elevated here. You saw a little bit of reprieve. How do you think about that contributing to that normalized level versus this just being the new norm? Or is there an elevated line locate just embedded in that 3 to 3.5 year?\nKevin Akers: Julien, it's part of our ongoing strategy with whether they're contractors or internal labor. We always look at what's going on in the market where we have contracts as we look at those on an annual basis to see if they need adjustment, forecasted work for them, and any strategic opportunities we may have to in-source opportunities there to offset some of the cost taking a longer-term view.  So all those options remain on the table as they have in the past, but we continue to look at these on an annual basis. So that's where we get the comfort in that range that we put out there right now.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Fair enough. But it's not like you have some meaningful further uptick in line locates or something like that, that we should be aware of here?\nKevin Akers: Now again, with the growth that I talked about on the front end and the population and trending that we've seen out there, that's all been baked into the plan out there, all the labor or anticipated labor, the current contracts we have in place, the labor rates that are out there right now, we have baked all that into the plan.\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. And the 3.5% annual increase is off of FY '23 levels kind of starting at that elevated level already.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine of Citi.\nRyan Levine: I want to follow up on the O&M getting a little more granular. In terms of the outlook, it's more on an annual basis. But can you speak to maybe the seasonality attributes of the O&M outlook. Should we look to -- this most recent fiscal year as indicative of seasonality trends on a go-forward basis? Is there anything else to call out?\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes, there's that. On the O&M, there is some element of seasonality. It's difficult to predict because we are managing our O&M over the entire fiscal year. So for example, like last fiscal year, where we had -- at the start of the year, we had crews in place, kind of doing some in-line inspection work at APT at the end of fiscal '22. It made good business sense to go ahead and continue that work into fiscal '23, although it had been planned originally to be in the back end of fiscal '23, rather than to demobilize the crews and remobilize 6 or 9 months later, we needed budget, we decided to go ahead and discontinue forward. So that was an operating decision that we made that we thought was in the best interest of the company and our customers. And so we make those decisions on a day in and day out basis. So it's difficult to predict. Certainly, those larger expenses when those could occur within a quarter. But certainly, we're managing to our full fiscal year results. Same thing on line locates. Kevin talked about seeing some moderation right now that we're seeing, but 6 months from now, we can be in a different environment and line locating may pick up for any number of reasons. And we, again, try to manage that on a full fiscal year basis. But quarter-by-quarter, we're not as focused on how to get this work done in a quarter unless there's a specific time requirement. But again, we are well ahead of our compliance deadlines which gives us the opportunity to manage from a full fiscal year basis.\nKevin Akers: Yes, Ryan, the other thing I'd say, Chris, is spot on with that is, we do -- given the economic growth that we've seen across our service territory, there are times when jurisdictions would want to pull forward projects, whether they're water, sewer related or there's fiber things going on, fiber projects out there that we'll have to move and adjust to as well based upon their time line. It may not be seasonably ratable, but it may be in a quarter it may show up. So again, we have to get the work done when we need to get the work done and work with our communities to make sure we're in concert with their projects as well.\nRyan Levine: Great. And maybe just one other. In terms of within Texas with the Railroad Commission, is there any discussion around consolidating jurisdictions or regulatory constructs as you negotiate outcomes on a go-forward basis?\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. We're aware of some filings that are out there kind of looking at that opportunity. We're looking at those right now and seeing at that, would make -- potentially makes sense for us. But we're aware of what others are trying to do at this point in time.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Dan Meziere for some closing remarks.\nDaniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us this morning. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through December 31. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Akers",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy.  As Saturday is Veterans Day, I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces and those currently serving. Approximately 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are a part of the nearly 20 million Americans who bravely served our country. Thank you all for your service.  Yesterday, we reported our earnings per share of $6.10, which represents the 21st consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Chris will provide some additional color around our financial results later in the call.  I will begin today's call highlighting a few of the many accomplishments achieved in fiscal '23 and we'll close with a few updates on key pipeline projects and some thoughts about fiscal '24.  This past October 18 marked Atmos Energy's 40th anniversary as an independent company. We continue to build on the past and focus on the future, and be guided by the simple values laid out by our Founding Chairman, Charles K. Vaughan, of honesty, integrity and good moral character, and supported for more than a quarter of century by our culture atmosphere. These values, combined with the laser focus of our 5,000 dedicated employees on our vision, continue to benefit our customers, our communities and the environment.  I've said it before, and I will say it again today, our employees are the heart and soul of Atmos Energy and provide the foundation for the sustained long-term success of our company.  In fiscal '23, we continue to execute our proven strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. Our fiscal '23 capital investment of over $2.8 billion, supported the modernization of our distribution and transmission systems through the replacement of over 900 miles of distribution and transmission pipe and replacement of more than 47,000 service loans. This investment also supported the strong economic development we continue to see in our service territories.  In fiscal '23, we added nearly 61,000 new customers, with over 46,000 of those new customers located here in Texas. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued its streak of record employment. For the 12 months ended September, the seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over 14.5 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, adding nearly 436,000 from September 2022 to September 2023.  And according to a study recently conducted by Site Selection Group, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is projected to add over 674,000 people by 2028, to reach 8.5 million, while the Austin Round Rock Georgetown Corridor is projected to add over 324,000 people by 2028, to reach 2.7 million.  In fiscal '23, we continue to see good commercial growth as well, adding nearly 3,000 new commercial customers. Our industrial demand for natural gas in our service territories has also remained strong. In fiscal '23, we added 55 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 19 Bcf, once they are fully operational. The 19 Bcf of annual usage is equivalent to adding nearly 367,000 residential customers on a volumetric basis. This growing demand from all of our customer classes demonstrates the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development across our service territory.  We continue to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of APT system to support this growth during fiscal '23. We completed Phases 2 and 3 of our 4-phase, 104-mile Line S-2 project. As a reminder, Line S-2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale place, to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex.  Additionally, we completed the final 63-mile portion of our 137-mile, 36-inch, Line X integrity replacement project. We also completed our third salt-dome cavern at our Bethel storage facility. This cavern provides additional support to APT's operations and adds over 6 Bcf of new working gas capacity.  We remain on track to complete Line PC by the end of the calendar year. This 22-mile, 36-inch line will connect the southern end of APT system with the 42-inch Kinder Morgan Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. Our new line will support current demand and the forecasted growth, as well as increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in both Williamson and Travis Counties in Texas.  Our customer support associates and service technicians continued their exceptional customer service, and once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers. The Atmos Energy team continues to build trust as they help nearly 62,000 customers receive over $29 million in energy assistance funds. Thank you team for taking exceptional care of our customers each and every day.  Finally, through our fueling safe and thriving communities initiatives, our employees made a difference in the lives of others by supporting schools and students with books, meals, Macs, as we also honored our health care workers, first responders and helped our neighbors in need by supporting more than 1,409 profits.  And for over 200 local food banks and shelters, the financial and voluntary resources our team provided translated into nearly 5.5 million meals being served to our neighbors in need. And we continue to partner with local Habitat for Humanity organization to provide families with Zero Net Energy Homes. These homes are designed to produce more energy than they consume through the use of high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels and advanced insulation materials.  We completed 2 new Zero Net Energy Homes in fiscal '23, and we'll have completed 12 total ZNE homes by the end of fiscal '24. These homes demonstrate the value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner, and is another way Atmos Energy fuel safe and thriving communities.  I'm very proud of Atmos Energy and our full team and their many accomplishments in fiscal '23. I will now turn the call over to Chris to discuss our fiscal '23 financial results, our fiscal '24 guidance, and an updated 5-year plan through fiscal '28. Chris? Thank you, Chris. And as you've heard this morning, a successful fiscal '23 has us well positioned for fiscal '24.  As part of our $2.9 billion fiscal '24 capital spending plan, APT will continue to focus on enhancing the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of its system. APT will continue to work on the remaining 40 miles of the Line S-2, 36-inch pipeline project, which we anticipate having the final phase in service by December of 2024.  In fiscal '23, APT began a multiphase Line WA Loop project that will install approximately 80 miles of 36-inch pipeline supported by the northern part of the system that serves the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Phase 1, approximately 24 miles is anticipated to be completed by the end of this calendar year. Design is underway for Phase 2, which will install an additional 40 miles and we anticipate that Phase 2 will be placed in service by the end of calendar year 2025. Phase 3 will include the installation of the final 16 miles, and we anticipate that, that phase will be placed into service by the end of calendar year 2026.  Additionally, in fiscal '24, APT will begin construction of a 54-mile, 36-inch pipeline from our Bethel storage facility to our Groesbeck compressor station to support forecasted growth in Williamson and Travis Counties in Central Texas. We anticipate that the project will be placed in service by the end of calendar year 2025.  Our gas supply team has us well positioned for this upcoming heating season to supply reliability and at competitive prices. Our gas supply team has hedged 50% of our winter supply needs, through a combination of storage and financial contracts, at a weighted average cost of $3.31.  I'm very excited about the direction and long-term stability of Atmos Energy. The foundation has been set with a proven safety driven strategy accompanied with organic growth that yields 6% to 8% fully-regulated earnings per share and commensurate dividend per share growth, supported by a strong financial profile. We operate in a diversified and growing jurisdictional footprint that is supportive of investment in natural gas infrastructure, with 96% of our rate base situated in 6 of our 8 states that have passed legislation in support of Energy Choice.  We have a long runway of work to support the planned $17 billion in capital spending over the next 5 years as we continue to modernize our natural gas distribution transmission and storage systems.  As Chris noted, most of our fiscal '24 financing costs are known, and we have hedged $900 million of our financing needs beyond fiscal 2024. The strength of our balance sheet and available liquidity will continue to support our operations in a cost-effective manner for our customers.  Focusing on long-term sustainability has always been a part of our strategy as reflected in the vital role we play in every community, safely delivering reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call for questions. You are. I mean, again, we've been at this 3% to 3.5% projection on O&M now for quite a long time. We feel comfortable in that range. As you know, we've used different levers over time when needed to mitigate any of the O&M pressures that we see coming down the road. And again, with some of the additional pullback in some of our service territories in the housing market, we've seen line locates costs come down, we've seen other compliance costs come down. So we remain confident as we head into '24 right now that what we have projected out there, of the $780 million to $800 million, we feel very confident in. Yes, again, I'll reiterate what I said previously. There towards the last quarter, we saw some of the line locating requests drive down just a few percentage points in some of our jurisdictions. Even though here in Texas, we saw an 8% increase. So that's what we were looking at there. That certainly reduced some of our compliance costs. Then again with some of our other compliance activity and timing of those sort of things, we think we've got a good handle on what the next year, the 3- to 5-year window looks like on planned O&M activity, compliance activity, those sort of things. So those were some of the drivers we were looking at that came out of the last quarter and allowed us to stay in that 3% to 3.5% range and at $780 million to $800 million O&M. Yes. I just want to reemphasize that the plan does reflect, as Chris said, they're us becoming a tax cash payer out in that time frame. So that's all backed into the plan that's out there. Julien, it's part of our ongoing strategy with whether they're contractors or internal labor. We always look at what's going on in the market where we have contracts as we look at those on an annual basis to see if they need adjustment, forecasted work for them, and any strategic opportunities we may have to in-source opportunities there to offset some of the cost taking a longer-term view.

Yes, Ryan, the other thing I'd say, Chris, is spot on with that is, we do -- given the economic growth that we've seen across our service territory, there are times when jurisdictions would want to pull forward projects, whether they're water, sewer related or there's fiber things going on, fiber projects out there that we'll have to move and adjust to as well based upon their time line. It may not be seasonably ratable, but it may be in a quarter it may show up. So again, we have to get the work done when we need to get the work done and work with our communities to make sure we're in concert with their projects as well."

            "name": "Christopher Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal '23 earnings per share of $6.10 increased 8.9% over fiscal '22. Our performance continues to reflect the successful execution of our operating, regulatory and financing strategies.  In fiscal '23, we implemented $269 million of annualized operating income increases excluding the amortization of excess deferred tax liability. These outcomes combined with outcomes received in fiscal '22, increased operating income by $254 million this fiscal year. Strong customer growth, higher consumption and rising industrial load in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $30 million.  Consolidated O&M increased $55 million to $765 million, largely driven by higher levels of service orders and increased head count to support our growing service territory, primarily in Texas. This thing came in at the lower end of our updated guidance range as we saw some moderation in inflation in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.  Fiscal '23 capital spending of $2.8 billion represent a 15% increase over the prior fiscal year, 85% of that spend was dedicated to improve the safety and reliability of our system. As a result of this spending, our rate base increased by 18% and estimated $16.6 billion as of September 30.  Finally, we completed $1.6 billion of long-term financing and completed the securitization process in Kansas and Texas. We finished the fiscal year with an equity capitalization of 61.5% and approximately $2.7 billion of available liquidity, which leaves us well positioned to support our future operations.  Looking forward, our strategy continues to focus on system modernization through disciplined capital spending, seeking timely recovery of our costs through our regulatory mechanisms, while financing our operations using a balance of equity and long-term debt to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, mitigate financing risk and minimizing the cost of financing to our customers. We anticipate the execution of this strategy will continue to support 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend per share growth.  For fiscal '24, we anticipate earnings per share will be between $6.45 and $6.65, and we anticipate fiscal '28 earnings per share to be in the range of $8.35 and $8.75. Additionally, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 160th consecutive quarterly cash dividend as an indicated fiscal '24 annual dividend of $3.22, an 8.8% increase over fiscal '23. This plan anticipates total capital spending of approximately $17 billion. This level of spending will continue to support rate base growth of about 11% to 13% per year, which is expected to increase estimated rate base by approximately -- to approximately $29 billion in fiscal '28.  In addition to our capital spending, another significant use of cash will be for taxes. We expect to refund $300 million of excess deferred tax liabilities over the next 5 years, with approximately 70% of this amount be funded during fiscal '24 and fiscal '25. And we anticipate we will become a material federal cash tax payer within the next 3 years because of 15% corporate minimum tax that was included in The Inflation Reduction Act. Our O&M spending will continue to focus on compliance-based activities that address system safety.  We have assumed O&M inflation of 3.5% annually through fiscal '28, from fiscal '23 levels. For fiscal '24, we anticipate O&M to range from $780 million to $800 million. This 5-year plan includes approximately $10 million of incremental long-term debt and financing, which has been reflected in our earnings per share guidance for both fiscal '24 and fiscal '28.  Following completion of our $900 million long-term debt issuance in October, our weighted average cost of debt stood at 4.1%, and our debt maturity schedule is very manageable. Our weighted at maturity is 18.4 years, and our next significant tranche of debt is not scheduled to mature until June of 2027.  Additionally, our financing strategy does not contemplate material exposure to floating rate interest rates. To further mitigate interest rate risk, we have $900 million in forward starting interest rate swaps in place to hedge portions of our anticipated long-term debt issuances in fiscal 2025 and '26. The effective weighted average rate of these swaps is 1.59%.  Finally, we intend to continue utilizing our ATM program to meet our equity financing needs. As of September 30, we have priced $467 million which represents a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 equity need. Handling recovery of our costs remains a key component of our strategy. We are off to a good start in fiscal '24.  Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we had implemented $113 million in annualized operating income increases in our Distribution segment, and we have 5 filings in progress taking about $137 million. Included in this amount is $107 million requested in APT's general rate case.  On October 24, APT and the intervening parties filed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the Texas Railroad Commission. The settlement proposes a rate base of $4.3 billion, an authorized rate of return of 8.49%, equity capitalization of 60.44% and an authorized ROE of 11.45%.  We anticipate the settlement agreement will be on the commission's agenda for the December 13 meeting. If approved as filed, this settlement would result in a $27 million increase in annualized operating income. We remain confident the execution of this strategy, will continue to support our ability to modernize our system and to support the continued economic development in our service territories. Our customers will continue to benefit from this strategy as we expect our average residential bill will remain one of the most competitively priced utility bills in our customers' health.  Thank you for your time this morning. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin to say some closing remarks. Kevin? Nick, it's Chris. Yes, right now, we remain pretty confident that we can still use the ATM to fund those equity needs. As you know, we have a balanced financing strategy. We're certainly looking at a number of factors that's -- cost of the customer, the strength of the balance sheet which supports credit ratings, credit facilities, our ability to finance attractively in the capital markets and equity is a component of that. So we're certainly looking at that particular tool. I mean, we have other tools available to us if needed. But at this time, given the liquidity that we have in the market, we believe we can satisfy those needs through the ATM. Yes, that has been contemplated in the guidance we issued yesterday. So we look at the balance sheet holistically across all of our jurisdictions, as well as what we need to continue to support our credit ratings. So we have skewed towards the upper end of a 50% to 60% range now for the last few years. we're comfortable to be in that range, and that's kind of where we anticipate being over the next 5 years. Yes. And Gabe, I'll add to that. There's a lot of compliance work that we still have to do as a utility. The rules continue to become more stringent. So we're anticipating some of that in the 3.5%. A little bit to higher -- a little bit higher inflation than we've had in the past, although it has moderated somewhat in the third and fourth quarters. And as a final reminder, with our annual mechanisms that we have in several of our jurisdictions, we had the opportunity to recover that fairly timely, generally within a year. So it shouldn't be a significant drag if approved for those annual mechanisms as we anticipate. Sure. I'll address the cash taxes first. First, we've got excess deferred taxes as I mentioned. That's beginning to tail off kind of after a couple of years. The IRA for us expects we should kick in, in the mid part of the 5-year plan, and that's predicated on just to the continued growth of the company. Fortunately, there aren't a lot of levers for us to pull. It's really a 15%, or you end up becoming a cash taxpayer as we begin to burn off some of the NOL shield that we have. And that's been contemplated in our plan.  So we knew going into this plan that we had either 15% or the fact that NOL shields were going to be becoming lower. So there's not a lot of levers we can do. Our tax team is obviously looking at opportunities for tax planning strategies. It's too soon to say if there's anything material that will come from that. But right now, we have conservatively estimated what will be a full cash -- federal cash tax payer have in the middle part of our 5-year plan. With respect to interest rate costs, we certainly have reflected what we believe are current market conditions in the 5-year plan. I'll also just remind you that we have the $900 million in hedges at a weighted average treasury cost of about 1.59%. That's a significant portion of our anticipated FY '25 needs and a fair amount of our anticipated FY '26 need.  So AMT will continue to look for opportunities to lock in some hedges, but given the higher elevated or where the interest rates are right now, it may not be as prudent or as attractive to do so as it was a couple of years ago, when rates were in the sub-2% range. Yes. We'll certainly see an uptick in the effective income tax rate. Again, that's being influenced right now, certainly the last 2 or 3 years with these excess of deferred tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate 2 years ago was in the 11% range, it ticked up closer to 15%. And we'll end up being in that 22% to 23% range here in the not-too-distant future. Again, all of these costs, we believe, are recoverable, including the IRA corporate minimum tax and our regulatory and tax teams are working on strategies right now to begin dialogue with those regulators to educate them on where that is in terms of what the law requires and then what the recoverability might look like. Yes, correct. Not material impact. And again, all that's been reflected in the guidance for FY '24 through to FY '28. Yes. And the 3.5% annual increase is off of FY '23 levels kind of starting at that elevated level already. Yes, there's that. On the O&M, there is some element of seasonality. It's difficult to predict because we are managing our O&M over the entire fiscal year. So for example, like last fiscal year, where we had -- at the start of the year, we had crews in place, kind of doing some in-line inspection work at APT at the end of fiscal '22. It made good business sense to go ahead and continue that work into fiscal '23, although it had been planned originally to be in the back end of fiscal '23, rather than to demobilize the crews and remobilize 6 or 9 months later, we needed budget, we decided to go ahead and discontinue forward. So that was an operating decision that we made that we thought was in the best interest of the company and our customers. And so we make those decisions on a day in and day out basis. So it's difficult to predict. Certainly, those larger expenses when those could occur within a quarter. But certainly, we're managing to our full fiscal year results. Same thing on line locates. Kevin talked about seeing some moderation right now that we're seeing, but 6 months from now, we can be in a different environment and line locating may pick up for any number of reasons. And we, again, try to manage that on a full fiscal year basis. But quarter-by-quarter, we're not as focused on how to get this work done in a quarter unless there's a specific time requirement. But again, we are well ahead of our compliance deadlines which gives us the opportunity to manage from a full fiscal year basis. Yes. We're aware of some filings that are out there kind of looking at that opportunity. We're looking at those right now and seeing at that, would make -- potentially makes sense for us. But we're aware of what others are trying to do at this point in time."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.  I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Meziere. Dan, please go ahead.\nDaniel Meziere : Thank you, Aaron. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab.  As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 34 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Chris?\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we announced fiscal year-to-date diluted earnings per share of $5.33 compared to $5.12 per diluted share in the prior year period. Our third quarter and fiscal year-to-date financial results were in line with our expectations and continue to be driven by three key themes. Regulatory outcomes reflecting increased safety and reliability spending, continued strong customer growth and higher O&M spending.  Fiscal '22 and '23 regulatory outcomes in both of our segments increased operating income by approximately $204 million. And higher consumption, residential customer growth and rising industrial load in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $27 million. These increases were partially offset by a $70 million increase in consolidated O&M. Year-to-date, distribution O&M increased $48 million or 12.6%. However, during the third fiscal quarter, the rate of O&M increase in this segment moderated somewhat with O&M increasing approximately 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. The higher levels of O&M spending continues to be largely driven higher levels of service orders to support growing service territory, primarily in Texas. Fiscal year-to-date, we experienced an 8% increase in the number of [indiscernible] located in Texas and we continue to see higher labor costs for these third-party services. Additionally, service orders increased 10%, largely driven by customer growth and increased collection activities. The remaining $22 million fiscal year-to-date increase in consolidated O&M incurred in our Pipeline and Storage segment, primarily driven by the timing of in-line inspection work for this segment. In the prior fiscal year, most network was concentrated in the fourth quarter. In this fiscal year, this work was incurred more regularly throughout the fiscal year. Consolidated capital spending increased 21% or $358 million to $2.1 billion with 86% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects higher spending of APT for Line S-2 and Line PC projects designed to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system. Spending in our distribution segment has increased due to higher safety reliability spending and higher spending to support customer growth. During our third fiscal quarter, we implemented $122 million of annualized regulatory outcomes. Year-to-date, we have now completed $263 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and we currently have an additional $263 million in annualized outcomes in progress, including $107 million related to our APT general rate case that we filed in May of this year. We currently expect to finalize that case in December of 2023.  Our financial position continues to remain strong. We finished our third fiscal quarter with an equity capitalization of 61.8%, approximately $3.1 billion of liquidity. This amount includes $590 million of net proceeds available under existing foreign sales agreement that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal '23 equity needs in a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 needs. Additionally, during our third fiscal quarter, we completed our $95 million securitization process in Kansas, again including securitization charge on customer bills effective July 1. As I previously mentioned, our third quarter and fiscal year-to-date results were in line with our expectations, which gives us the confidence to reaffirm our fiscal '23 guidance in the range of $6 to $6.10. Additionally, we now expect capital spending to approximate $2.8 billion, largely reflecting higher spending per system expansion in our distribution segment. Thank you for your time today, and I'll turn the call over to Kevin for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our fiscal year performance reflects the continued dedication of our 4,800 Atmos Energy employees in executing our proven safety and reliability investment strategy. Through their commitment, focus and effort, we are modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems while safely providing reliable natural gas service to our 3.4 million customers in 1,400 communities across our eight states.  We continue to experience strong customer growth, driven by robust employment trends, particularly in Texas. For the 12 months ended June 30, we added nearly 64,000 new customers with just over 48,000 of those new customers located here in Texas. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the State continued its streak of record employment. For the 12 months ended May 31, the number of employed reached a new record high at nearly 14.4 million, leading the country in number and percentage of jobs added.  Additionally, according to a study by Site Selection Group, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is projected to add one million people by 2028 to reach nearly 8.5 million people here in the Metroplex. Industrial demand for natural gas in our service territory also remained strong. During the third quarter, we added 10 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 8 Bcf once they're fully operational.  Fiscal year-to-date, we've added 41 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 16 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, that 16 Bcf of anticipated load is equivalent to adding nearly 294,000 residential customers. Finally we continued our outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers. During the first nine months of fiscal year, our Customer Advocacy team and customer support agents helped over 55,000 customers receive about $23 million in funding assistance.  Our continued focus on long-term sustainability, combined with executing our proven investment, regulatory and financing strategy has us positioned well for another successful year in fiscal 2023, and reflects the vital role we play in every community, providing safe, reliable and efficient natural gas service to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we'll now open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Richard, please go ahead.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? \nKevin Akers: Yes, good morning.\nDaniel Meziere: Yes, we can.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Thank you. Starting with the O&M trends, can you speak to the year-to-date trends relative to the implied 4Q outlook here? There's certainly a pretty stark reversal kind of embedded in the numbers. I know you referenced inspection work, but just curious if there are other timing factors at play. Also if you've done work to derisk '24, and that's part of the outlook for the balance of the year as well.\nChris Forsythe: Yes. Thank you, Rich. We'll start with '23. Again, a lot of the timing is related to the APT and line section work that I referenced just a couple of minutes ago, and again, more of that work was ratable this year in the first half year, the fiscal year primarily compared to last year. It was more concentrated in the fourth quarter. As we look forward into fiscal '24, we're still pulling together that five-year plan that we are looking for opportunities to derisk that a little bit in terms of, on the distribution side. Looking at how we might approach line locate the strategy there, as well as just trying to lock in some longer contracts and some of our service contracts that are third party by design.  And so those are some things that we're looking at to try to mitigate some increases going forward.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Very helpful color there. And then shifting to the APT rate case, curious on any early thoughts on stakeholder engagement, what you're hearing locally. What is the timing for settlement discussions just procedurally in that case? And any expectations around your ability to reach settlement?\nKevin Akers: Yes, Richard, this is Kevin. I'll start out. We're right on pace with the procedural schedule as it's outlined there. We're still continuing to get data requests. We're responding to those. So at this point, if you look at the procedural schedule, we feel like we're on track to get an order some time toward the end of the calendar year in that December time frame.\nRichard Sunderland: And then just high-level thoughts on ability to reach a settlement here? Is that something that's embedded in the plan? Anything you could say on that front would be helpful.\nKevin Akers: No. Again, we're still continuing to answer questions at this point. We'll see how we progress over the next few weeks or so. But at this point, again, I think we're on track with the outlined procedural schedule.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you for the time today.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nChris Forsythe: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan, please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Hi, everybody. I guess a couple on O&M costs. I appreciate the comments already made, but on a go-forward basis, should we be expecting the seasonality of operating costs to be more like this year or prior years? And kind of what's driving some of the change in cadence.\nKevin Akers: Yes, Ryan. I think as you think about on a go forward, we certainly had anticipated going into '23, some of the inflationary costs. We knew we were going to have some growth. But if you look at the O&M was driven on a line locating, as Chris mentioned before. I would certainly anticipate that to continue. But I think we've got a good outlook on that now on where we stand on number of locates, type of other O&M expenses. As Chris said, as we move to finalize our '24 plan and look forward from that.\nChris Forsythe: Yes. The other thing, too, Ryan, I'll add is that a lot of this timing is just based upon the availability of the contractors to do the work. I've kind of talked about a little bit with APT work last year. We had a lot of work in the fourth quarter because the contractors are on site. They are working with us.  We decided to go ahead and move into the first and second quarter since they're already engaged with us rather than releasing them and have them come back six months later. So we also have to just work around the needs of the system, the timing of the system. It depends on what we might do on construction work on certain segments of the system, which could influence the timing.  I've also referenced service orders. A lot of those are difficult to forecast, but service orders generally related to particularly this last year, more calling into the customer contact center because of high bills, given the higher prices we experienced back in the winter heating season. Difficult to predict that, that will reoccur in the first or second quarter as well as some of our disconnection activities. That's why we manage to a full fiscal year in terms of guidance because some of those operating conditions are difficult to predict, and we're just responding to the needs of the business with an eye towards accomplishing our fiscal earnings per share targets.\nKevin Akers: Yes. And I think that's the other point, Ryan, here, as our communities, as you've heard us say, are growing, expanding out where we're working with them on timing of their projects, whether they are infrastructure projects or current [indiscernible]. You've got fiber optic projects out there, you've got road relocations, new road construction, that sort of thing going on. Some of this just cycle throughout the full fiscal year period.\nRyan Levine: And how much is this change in seasonality of costs that was embedded in that response is really related to the spike in gas prices during this most recent winter opposed to some of the other drivers that you highlighted?\nKevin Akers: Yes. I don't know that I would make that kind of direct correlation. I think what Chris was alluding to are some orders for reread, that sort of thing based on bills, but I don't think it's a meaningful percentage of the rest of the overall operational O&M per se.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then one, I noticed in your -- with your guidance for the year, you're approaching year-end, at least your fiscal year-end and the effective tax rate this year is supposed to be higher than last year. Is that from a longer-term planning perspective, are you anticipating that the current effective tax rate is appropriate for future time periods? Or any color you could share around how you're thinking about your tax position?\nChris Forsythe: Yes, Ryan. The effective tax rate that you see is roughly 11%. That's heavily influenced by the excess of -- the refunds of excess deferred tax liabilities from the TCJA. We're amortizing those over a three to five year period. So that's why we've included in our deck, kind of the marginal effective tax rate of roughly 22.5% to 23.5% per se. So that you have an idea of really what true tax impacts are if you're modeling your O&M or other types of expenses or revenues. But we do anticipate the GAAP effective tax rate to increase as the excess deferred taxes wind down here over the next couple of years and revert back to that more traditional 22% to 23.5%.\nRyan Levine: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And at this point, it does look like we are good on the questions. Dan, would you like me to turn it back over to you for closing remarks?\nDaniel Meziere : Sure. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through September 30. Have a great day. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Dan. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Meziere Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Meziere: Thank you, Mandy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 32 and more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Akers, our President and CEO. Kevin?\nJohn Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported year-to-date fiscal 2023 net income of $630 million or $4.40 per diluted share. As you will hear from Chris, results were in line with our expectations and positions us for another successful fiscal year. This performance continues to reflect the commitment, dedication, focus and effort of all 4,800 Atmos Energy employees to successfully modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems while safely providing reliable natural gas service to our 3.4 million customers and 1,400 communities across our 8 states. We also narrowed our fiscal 2023 earnings per share guidance to a range of $6 to $6.10. We continue to experience strong customer growth, driven by robust employment trends in Texas. For the 12 months ended March 31, we added 65,000 new customers across the company with nearly 49,000 of those new customers located in Texas. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued its streak of record employment in March, adding 664,000 jobs since January of 2022 to reach a series high civilian labor force of 14.9 million people. Industrial demand for natural gas in our service territory also remained strong. During the second quarter, we added 18 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 6 Bcf once they are fully operational. Fiscal year-to-date we've added 30 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 15 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, that 15 Bcf of anticipated industrial load is equal to adding approximately 275,000 residential customers. To support that growth that I just summarized, we continue to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system. For example, in our Atmos Pipeline Texas division, our team completed the injection of working gas into Bethel cavern 1B, our third salt-dome cavern. This third cavern provides additional support to APT's operations and the local distribution companies behind APT system as well as adds over 6 Bcf of new working gas capacity. Work continues on Phase 3 of our Line S-2 project, which will replace 67 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. And as a reminder, this project brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing Metroplex. The final phase of this project is anticipated to be in service late 2024. Later this calendar year, we expect to complete the remaining 5 miles of the 22-mile project that will install a 36-inch pipeline connecting to the southern end of APT system with a 42-inch Permian highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. This new line will support the forecasted growth and increased supply diversity to the north of Austin in both Williamson and Travis Counties in Texas. Atmos Energy's comprehensive environmental strategy is focused on reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and environmental impact from our operations in the following 5 key focus areas: operations, fleet, facilities, gas supply and customers. In the area of operations through our system modernization efforts, we are on track to place 800 to 1,000 miles of pipe this fiscal year and between 20,000 and 30,000 steel service lines. And in the gas supply area during the first 6 months of fiscal 2023, we added another RNG facility that will transport renewable natural gas across our system. We now have 7 flowing RNG facilities directly connected to our system. Additionally, we've executed interconnect agreements with 3 additional RNG projects expected to begin flowing in calendar year 2023. Once these projects are fully operational, we anticipate to have 8 to 9 Bcf of RNG flowing across our system annually. Finally, we are evaluating nearly 30 additional opportunities to connect RNG facilities to our system. As I mentioned on previous calls, we are partnering with Habitat for Humanity in each of our 8 states to build Zero Net Energy homes for families in need. Zero Net Energy Homes use high-efficiency natural gas appliances, rooftop solar panels an installation to produce more energy than they consume at an affordable cost. During the first 6 months of fiscal 2023, we completed 2 homes: 1 in Owensboro, Kentucky and 1 in Jackson, Mississippi. All 8 homes have achieved home energy rating system, or HERS, scores of less than 0, which means the homes produce more energy than they consume. These Zero Net Energy Homes demonstrate the value and vital role that natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in an affordable manner. Providing these families with a natural gas home that is environmentally friendly and cost efficient is just one of the ways Atmos Energy, fuel of safe and thriving communities. Our customer service organization and technology support team continue to innovate and look for ways to improve our customer service and offer convenient channels for customers to communicate with us and to make payments. For example, we see continuous growth in our electronic bill delivery channels with nearly 52% of customers enrolled in eBill, and approximately 85% of customers pay electronically with over 33% of them enrolled in recurring auto draft, which is 10% higher than industry average. We are also fueling safe and thriving communities through our continued outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers. During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, our customer advocacy team and customer support agents helped over 35,000 customers who received over $14 million in funding a system. The dedication and focus of our employees was recently recognized in an American Customer Satisfaction Index energy utility study conducted between January and December of last year. According to the recently released study, Atmos Energy finished in first place, leading all energy utility providers with the highest customer satisfaction score. We believe our focus, dedication and effort, combined with executing our proven investment, regulatory and financing strategy positions us well to safely deliver reliable efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and the industry to fuel our energy needs now and in the future.  I will now turn the call over to Chris for his update.\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you to everyone who joined us this morning. As previously mentioned, net income for the first 6 months of the fiscal year was $630 million or $4.40 per diluted share. Year-to-date consolidated operating income increased $744 million or 13%. I'll touch on a few of the highlights of our year-to-date performance. Fiscal '22 and '23 regulatory outcomes increased operating income by $152 million. Additionally, residential growth and rising industrial load in our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $12 million. And we saw a $7 million increase in APT's through-system business. Most of this increase occurred during our first fiscal quarter when spreads widened while some of the key takeaway pipelines in the Permian undergoing maintenance. Consolidated O&M expense increased $57 million. Distribution O&M increased $43 million, driven largely by supporting our growing service territory in Texas, where we experienced a 10% increase in the number of line locates. They're also seeing higher labor costs for these third-party services. Additionally, service orders system-wide have increased 11%, largely driven by customer growth, increased service requests driven by higher natural gas prices and increased collection activities. As a result, our internal labor costs have risen to fulfill these orders. Finally, we experienced higher levels of bad debt expense due to higher customer bills. Most of this increase was recognized during our second fiscal quarter. The remaining $14 million increase is recognized in our Pipeline and Storage segment, driven by the timing of in-line inspection work compared to the prior year period and increased employee costs. Slides 5 and 6 summarize the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments for the quarter and year-to-date periods. Consolidated capital spending increased 19% or $225 million to $1.4 billion with 86% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primarily reflects higher spending at APT, the projects that Kevin discussed just a few minutes ago. We continue to execute our annual regulatory filing strategy. To date, we have implemented $116 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and we have about $298 million annualized outcomes in progress. We anticipate implementing about half of this amount during the second half of our fiscal year. Slides 20 through 31 summarize these outcomes and Slide 17 outlines our planned filings for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our financial position continues to remain strong. In early March, we executed a $2 billion term loan to help repay our maturing $2.2 billion in senior notes. Later that month, the Texas Public Financing Authority completed its state-wide securitization program, and we used the proceeds from that program to pay off the term loan. We no longer have meaningful exposure to floating rate interest debt. We finished our second fiscal quarter with an equity capitalization of 60.9% and approximately $3.3 billion of liquidity. Included in this amount is $673 million in net proceeds available under existing foreign sale agreements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal '23 equity needs and a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 needs. The strength of our financial profile was recognized by Moody's in March when they reaffirm the credit ratings and outlook. We continue to look for opportunities to mitigate interest rate risk associated with our anticipated long-term debt financing needs beyond fiscal '23. In march and April of this year, we executed $250 million in starting interest rate swaps. We have now have $1.6 billion of swaps to effectively hedge portions of the treasury component of our total cost of financing at rates ranging from 1.76% to 2.38%. With this activity, a substantial portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 long-term debt needs have now been hedged. Finally, in Kansas, we are still on track to complete our gas cost securitization this fiscal year. Additional details for our financing activities and our financial profile be found on Slides 9 through 11. Our fiscal year-to-date performance gives us confidence to narrow our fiscal '23 earnings per share guidance from $5.90 to $6.10 to the new guidance range of $6 to $6.10. We expect the contribution to fiscal '23 earnings to be somewhat ratable by quarter in the back half of the fiscal year. A few additional thoughts about our updated guidance. The winter heating season is over and approximately 70% of our distribution segment revenue has been recognized. Going into the fiscal year with elevated commodity costs, we anticipate lower customer consumption primarily due to conservation. However, the consumption we saw during the winter heating season exceeded our expectations. Additionally, the most significant regulatory filings impacting fiscal '23 has been or will soon be completed giving us a better line of sight into the regulatory outcomes for the fiscal year. Regarding O&M, much of this increase was anticipated as we originally guided to an approximate 5.5% increase over fiscal '22 levels. However, as I mentioned a few months ago, we are experiencing higher-than-planned spending to support our growing serous territories, particularly in Texas. This is was what we did during the panic, we are working to offset some of these increases. Assuming we achieve the midpoint of our updated guidance, we anticipate O&M for the remaining 6 months of the fiscal year to be in line with our level of spending in the back half of fiscal '22. Finally, our expected cost of financing is now pretty clear. Securitization Texas has been resolved and our expected long-term debt financing for the fiscal year is now complete. Further, we're anticipating higher-than-planned AEDC partly due to the timing of product closings within the fiscal year and remaining FY '23 equity needs have been fully priced. Details surrounding our fiscal '23 guidance can be found on Slides 13 and 14. Thank you for your time this morning, and we'll now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Julian Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Look, nicely done, guys. I wanted to maybe kick things off quickly. Texas legislature looking at potentially using some of their surplus here potentially look at paying down some of the securitization here. Can you comment on that a little bit here? What are your expectations? Any nuances there? And then ultimately, I would presume that this would effectively never hit customer bills, but I just want to understand sort of the timing and mechanics as to how it's been collected, how it looks like for you guys specifically?\nJohn Akers: Yes. From a technical basis, Julien, that is correct. We continue to follow that as well as other legislation across our entire system. So not going to try and predict or comment too much further on it than that at this point. If there are any questions or anything that comes up from the committees or those that are sponsoring that, obviously, we're standing by and prepared to answer that for them. But on a system-wide basis, on a legislative perspective, things have kind of been on a consistent theme, if you will, this year, that being damage prevention across all of our jurisdictions has been enhanced as well as some of our jurisdictions looking at energy efficiency programs at the state level as well. So we're very pleased with that. And additionally, I don't know if you've seen out there, but a couple more states have come on to approve all fuels or customer choice legislation, which provides about 24 states, I think, now across the country that has done that as well as, I think, 3 states right now have approved legislation for freedom to cook in their particular jurisdiction. So that's a quick recap across our territory on legislative action.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Actually since you bring it up, maybe I'd love to get your perspective on this. Colorado has had some discussions of late across both the PC and then also, in particular, the legislative side on I suppose, gas bills broadly. Any perspectives therein on where this could go? I mean, it seems a little bit -- it lacks specificity, shall we say.\nJohn Akers: Well, no crystal ball here, Julien. I can tell you that for sure. But with that committee, with ongoing committees there in any legislature when we're asked, we'll certainly participate. We'll provide testimony, we'll provide feedback for our expert opinion. We're going to continue to watch that stay close to it, but also work with the PUC. If they come up with any questions, comments or open any dockets, we're certainly available to provide our feedback as well as our gas supply team that does a tremendous job each year in and out to make sure we get access to reliable supply for our customers.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And just going back quickly, a little nuance. You alluded to it in your remarks. On O&M, I mean, seemingly holding the line fairly well here despite a consistently inflationary environment. Can you comment a little bit about what you're seeing out there? I mean, obviously, some of your peers had less success in managing their costs here. Can you comment a little bit about the clarity that you have and the line of sight here and just perhaps what that implies going forward as well?\nChris Forsythe: Sure, Julien. This is Chris. Working back closely with our operations team, just kind of looking really line by line opportunities where we could potentially defer items that are not compliance-related or safety related or with the system at risk. Similar to what we did there in the pandemic. A few levers there that we might be able to pull. Additionally, a lot just depends on timing of when contracts are executed in terms of locking in costs for a 12- to 18-month period, what we got in contracts kind of at the early part of our fiscal year. So at that point, we had locked in some contracts. We have a better line of sight, at least in terms of labor costs with respect to some of these third-party services which leads the variable -- just the number of locates, for example, that we might have to manage. And we did some sensitivity work around that. So those are just a couple of examples of how we're trying to look forward, manage your O&M within what we're capable of doing, while it can certainly providing a safe able service on the system.\nJohn Akers: Yes. And I'll just close that, Julien. As Chris has said before and I've said before on these calls, we're not a just-in-time company when it comes to integrity work, O&M work, those safety-related items on our system. We like to stay well in advance of that, and that does provide some additional flexibility for us when we need it, certainly can speed things up or move things from one period to another. So that's an additional lever we have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Meziere for closing remarks.\nDaniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through June 30, 2023. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported year-to-date fiscal 2023 net income of $630 million or $4.40 per diluted share. As you will hear from Chris, results were in line with our expectations and positions us for another successful fiscal year. This performance continues to reflect the commitment, dedication, focus and effort of all 4,800 Atmos Energy employees to successfully modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems while safely providing reliable natural gas service to our 3.4 million customers and 1,400 communities across our 8 states. We also narrowed our fiscal 2023 earnings per share guidance to a range of $6 to $6.10. We continue to experience strong customer growth, driven by robust employment trends in Texas. For the 12 months ended March 31, we added 65,000 new customers across the company with nearly 49,000 of those new customers located in Texas. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued its streak of record employment in March, adding 664,000 jobs since January of 2022 to reach a series high civilian labor force of 14.9 million people. Industrial demand for natural gas in our service territory also remained strong. During the second quarter, we added 18 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 6 Bcf once they are fully operational. Fiscal year-to-date we've added 30 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 15 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, that 15 Bcf of anticipated industrial load is equal to adding approximately 275,000 residential customers. To support that growth that I just summarized, we continue to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system. For example, in our Atmos Pipeline Texas division, our team completed the injection of working gas into Bethel cavern 1B, our third salt-dome cavern. This third cavern provides additional support to APT's operations and the local distribution companies behind APT system as well as adds over 6 Bcf of new working gas capacity. Work continues on Phase 3 of our Line S-2 project, which will replace 67 miles of 14-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded on Wednesday, February 08, 2023.  And I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\nDan Meziere: Thank you, Michell. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our fiscal 2023 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 24 and more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Kevin Akers, our President and CEO. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy today. I want to begin today's call by thanking everyone of our 4,800 Atmos Energy employees across all of our eight states with their exceptional effort and dedication to serving our customers under very challenging weather conditions during winter storms Elliott and Mara. Thank you for all that you do for our customers and our communities every day. You are truly the heart and soul of Atmos Energy. Our first quarter results reflect that effort, dedication and focus as we continued modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems on our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2023 first quarter net income of $272 million or $1.91 per diluted share, and we reaffirmed our fiscal 2023 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.90 to $6.10. Our Atmos Pipeline, Texas division achieved several project milestones during the first quarter. Our APT team completed filling the Cushing gas requirements at the Bethel 1B cavern and working gas is currently being injected and debriding operations continue with a targeted completion date of April of this year. This third cavern provides additional support to APTs operations, as well as the local distribution companies behind APT systems and adds over 6 Bcf of new working gas capacity. [Technical Difficulty] we completed the final portion of our 137 mile, 36 inch Line X integrity replacement project, as well as completed Phase 2 of our three phase line S2 project. Line S2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing Dallas Fort Worth metroplex. The second phase will place 17 miles of 14 inch pipeline with 36 inch pipeline. The final phase of this project is anticipated to be in service late calendar 2024. These projects enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system and support the continued growth we are seeing in the local distribution companies behind APT system. According to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued a 14 month streak of record employment in December and added 650,000 jobs for the 12 months ending December. This strong employment trend continues to drive the growth in our Mid Tex and West Texas divisions where approximately 47,000 of our nearly 64,000 new customers were added for the same 12 months ending December period. Additionally, industrial demand for natural gas in our service territory remains strong. During the first quarter, we added 12 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 9 Bcf once they're fully operational. The largest of these new industrial customers is anticipated to use nearly 6 Bcf annually. Our procurement team continues to do an excellent job sourcing the materials needed to support our capital investment as we continue modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. We also maintain about six months of inventory for our distribution and transmission needs. And as we said before, we have ordered all of our anticipated steel pipe needs for FY 2023. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continue their outreach efforts to energy assistant agencies into our customers during the first quarter. Through their work, the team helped nearly 17,000 customers receive over $6 million in funding assistance. As a reminder, during fiscal 2022, our energy assistance teams helped nearly 67,000 customers receive approximately 34 million of funding to help with their monthly bill. As you'll hear from Chris today, our fiscal 2023 financing costs are known. We have hedged a significant portion of our financing needs beyond fiscal year 2023, and our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong. Atmos energy is well positioned to continue delivering safe, reliable, efficient and abundant natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and in the future. I'll now turn the call over to Chris for his update. Chris?\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. As Kevin mentioned, our fiscal \u201823 first quarter net income was $272 million or $1.91 per diluted share. Consolidated operating income increased to $321 million or 16% in the first quarter. Our first quarter performance largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by system modernization spending, continued customer growth in our distribution segment, partial offset by higher O&M spending in both of our segments. Slide 5 summarizes the key performance drivers for each of our operating segments. Rate increases in both of our operating segments driven by increased safety and reliability spending totaled $79 million. Residential customer growth and increased industrial load increased operating income by an additional $5.5 million, and we saw a $5 million increase in APT\u2019s [three] system business due to water spreads driven by maintenance and some of the key takeaway pipelines in the Permian during the quarter. Consolidated O&M expense increased $26 million, driven by planned higher in line inspection spending in APT, higher spending for third party damage prevention activities on our distribution system and increased employee and other administrative costs. Consolidated capital spending increased 16% to $111 million to $796 million with 88% dedicated to improve the safety and reliability of our system. This increase primary reflects higher spending at APT, the project that Kevin discussed just a few minutes ago. We continue to execute our annual regulatory filing strategy. To date, we have implemented $115 million in annualized regulatory outcomes and we currently have about $36 million in progress. Slides 19 through 23 summarize those outcomes, and Slide 16 outlines our planned filings for the reminder of the fiscal year. During the quarter, we completed over $1 billion of long term debt and equity financing, highlighted by the $800 million long term debt financing we completed in October 2022 and $200 million of settled equity forward agreements. As of December 31st, we have approximately $755 million of net proceeds available under existing forward sales arrangements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal '23 equity needs and a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '24 needs.  Finally to mitigate interest rate risk associated with our anticipated long term debt financing needs beyond fiscal '23, we currently have about $1.35 billion in forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively set a portion of treasury component of our total cost of financing at rates ranging from 1.8% to 2.2%. All of this gives us a clear line of sight into our anticipated financing costs of fiscal '23 and a portion of our costs beyond fiscal '23 Our equity capitalization as of December 31st, excluding the $2.2 billion of winter storm financing was 60%. Additionally, we finished the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of liquidity. Additional details for financing activities as well as our financial profile can be found on Slides 7 through 10. Turning now to securitization. In Texas, the Texas Public Financing Authority and the Bond Review Board continue to work diligently to determine the best outcome for customers with respect to securitization. Additionally, in January, the Texas legislature signaled intent to provide funding to gas and other costs incurred during winter storm Uri that were deemed prudently incurred by the Texas Railroad Commission in November 2021. We are encouraged with these developments and continue to support their efforts. However, we do not anticipate receiving securitization funds for interim winter storm financing matures on March 9th. We currently anticipate refinancing this debt through a combination of the syndicated bank term loan and utilization of our existing credit facilities and cash to minimize the cost of the customer while providing maximum flexibility to repay this debt once the securitization process is completed. Additionally, pursuant to an order issued by the Railroad Commission, we have deferred all carrying costs associated with the interim refinancing effective September 1st, and currently intend to defer carrying costs associated with the existing financing and new interim financing until the securitization process is complete. In Kansas, we received our financing order from the Kansas Corporation Commission in October 2022, and we are progressing well to securitize the approximately $90 million in gas and other costs incurred during winter storm Uri. We anticipate completing the securitization process this fiscal year. In closing, we are off to a good start to the fiscal year. The execution of our operational, financial and regulatory plans in the first fiscal quarter positions us well to achieve our fiscal '23 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.90 to $6.10. Details surrounding our fiscal '23 guidance can be found on Slides 12 and 13. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now open up the call for questions. Michelle?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nick Campanella of Credit Suisse.\nNick Campanella: I just wanted to ask on just the recent move in gas prices. Can you kind of just talk about how that's affecting your financial plan or your hedging strategies at all here? Clearly, it should help with bill headroom as well. But maybe you can just give us some more color on what the recent move means?\nKevin Akers: Yes, I'll start a little bit on the supply side and then let Chris pick up on the hedging side, Nick. Yes, we continue to see still good strong rate number [Technical Difficulty] $2 range in Waha and below $2 at Katy. So the forward look, particularly even out of the Waha area and the [indiscernible] area being in the $2 to $3 handle certainly look good on a go forward basis. As you've heard us say before, our storage positions helped us with some of that hedge early on. I think we were all in storage at an average weight cost of $5.48. So I think we're well positioned for the remainder of this year. The forward curves continue to look good at this point as we move into the summer and fall of next year. And the supply continues to look good out there from the major producing basin. So Chris, anything else to add?\nChris Forsythe: Just a couple of things, Nick. First off from a financing perspective, the $800 million long erm debt that we issued in October satisfies our anticipated long term debt financing needs. And as I've also already mentioned equity we got that priced for the remainder of the fiscal year. And you understand the math on the equity given where we are and in terms of what our financing needs over the next five years. Additionally, we do have full access to our credit facilities today, the operating credit facility, which supports our commercial paper program, a $1.5 billion program. We had no short term debt as of December 31st, so we had the ample liquidity there to support operations as well as gas supply. And then finally, just commenting on hedging to kind of follow from Kevin's point, our gas supply team kind of sets that hedging program in advance of the winter heating season. And between the combination of storage that Kevin alluded to, in the hedging programs, we had just under 50% of the cost locked in for this winter heating season. So to the extent that gas prices moderate for the other, say 50% or so, that should have a positive impact on the customer bill.\nNick Campanella: And Chris, I know that you're already fully priced on '23 kind of equity needs here. How should we kind of think about '24 and being opportunistic about further derisking the financial plan?\nChris Forsythe: Yes, of the $755 million, as I mentioned, Nick, that satisfies all of our needs and a substantial portion of our needs -- all of our needs for '23 and a substantial portion of our needs for fiscal '24. So the ATM program continues to work very well for us. We'll continue to utilize that to kind of just layer in additional pricing, if you will, on the equity needs for '24 with an eye towards just being opportunistic on pricing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: Could you comment on the investigation by the Railroad Commission into the -- some of the service challenges that your system experienced during the winter weather in December? And just any initiatives or actions that you're pursuing on the back of that experience?\nKevin Akers: As you know, our team worked very hard going into this winter storm have prepared themselves, have prepared the system. But as the storm moved in we did have approximately 2,300 customers in a limited area of our service territory that experienced some service interruptions out of the 2.1 million, 2.2 million residential and commercial customers that we serve here in Texas. We have been working with the commission to provide them additional information and work with them as they wrap up their investigation, which we hope will occur here very soon.\nDavid Arcaro: And then I was wondering, could you elaborate a bit just on the plans for refinancing some of the floating rate notes that are coming due related to winter storm Uri costs? And just is there an EPS impact that you might anticipate from having to refinance those just sort of waiting for the securitization process to get completed here?\nChris Forsythe: The short answer is no. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've got planned hybrid securitization that will be -- a term loan, a syndicated term loan that we anticipate executing here in the next few weeks as well as utilizing some of our credit facilities and cash. And with the regulatory asset order that the rail commission has granted, we are deferring all of those financing costs right now into that regulatory asset until securitization is complete. And then we'll address that with the commission the appropriate recovery of those costs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gabe Moreen of Mizuho Securities.\nGabe Moreen: Maybe you can just talk to us about, broadly speaking, how O&M is tracking relative to your expectations so far this year. Are you seeing any let up in pressures? I'm just curious on that, your thoughts there.\nKevin Akers: Yes, I'll start and then Chris can jump in. As you heard in Chris' remarks, most of the O&M that we've experienced in the first quarter is what we thought we would see. It's in the range that we've already laid out there. And what I mean by that is that with the growth that we talked about, we certainly -- both on our side and in our jurisdictions have driven increased from a line locating perspective. That economic growth certainly drove new routes, new commercial businesses, new roads, new infrastructure, which drives up locating expenses. As a matter of fact, our Texas number of load case is up almost 10% this quarter-over-quarter last year. And then in addition, as you heard on some of the projects that I mentioned, we had some additional in line inspection work that we needed to pull forward on the APT side and some additional pigging activity that we slowed during the COVID period, but wanted to pick that work back up. So all things we anticipated kind of occurring during the quarter but saw a lot more line locating expense just given the growth that we're experiencing. Chris, anything additional?\nChris Forsythe: I think that's spot on, Kevin. And I would just to add that from an inflation perspective, the inflation we're experiencing that we're seeing, it's still well within the planning parameters that we outlined in our fiscal '23 guidance and our five year plan on an overall basis.\nGabe Moreen: And maybe if I could just follow up with sort of -- and apologies if I missed it, but you got a couple large projects that have either wrapped up or nearing completion. Can you maybe just talk about kind of what's next in the queue from a larger project standpoint as you look at across your system?\nKevin Akers: Well, those projects that I mentioned, Line X was an integrity project, which fortifies that line that comes out of Waha and runs west to east into Dallas and then the S2 is another integrity and capacity project to bring in additional supply from the east. So we'll continue to monitor our system, continue to monitor that growth. We still have, as I mentioned, complete that -- or the Bethel cavern 1B project, that will take us probably into 2026 to get all three caverns back in service at the same time. And just as a reminder, that's not only a capacity and need for the growth behind our systems, it's also an integrity project per rules at the commission where we have to do our integrity work on those caverns over 15 years. So we'll continue to look at our storage. We'll continue to look at the larger pipe infrastructure and see where that may need increasing or fortification as we move forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland: I just wanted to follow up on the earlier discussion around the gas price dynamics. Curious for your thoughts on the duration of Waha weakness. We see a probability that in Waha gas prices remain depressed until Matterhorn enter service in mid-'24. Any thoughts around the duration here and impact to customer bills relative to your outlook last quarter?\nKevin Akers: Again, our team continues to stay close with the producers out there, midstream processors to keep it handle on, as you said, as well as new projects that are coming online. But I think the other thing that we'll continue to work on is the tie-in to some of those lines, that's the other opportunity, I think, for us as those projects continue to build coming out of Waha and head east that gives us an opportunity to get additional tests or to bring in additional supply into our areas as well. So all good signs, as you say, on the forward look. Right now, we believe these prices and the conversations we're holding, numbers look really good as you head into [Novi] March upcoming. So right now, I don't see things changing in the short run, at least the information we're getting out there. And then as we continue through this winter period, pulling on storage and get ready to inject for next season, the pricing looks really good there. As I said before, some in the $2 range or so. So that should have a very positive impact for our bills for next year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from Ryan Levine at Citigroup.\nRyan Levine: Most of my questions were asked already, but I just want to follow up on one. In terms of the Mid Tex DAR proceeding. Can you provide an update around that regulatory activity?\nChris Forsythe: So we made that filing, the DAR filing in mid-January. We're just now beginning to work through the early discovery process, and we anticipate implementing new rates under the DAR filing by the end of the fiscal year.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. So I will turn the conference back to Dan Meziere for any closing remarks.\nDan Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our Web site through March 31, 2023. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for this morning. We would like to thank you all for participating and ask you to please disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy today. I want to begin today's call by thanking everyone of our 4,800 Atmos Energy employees across all of our eight states with their exceptional effort and dedication to serving our customers under very challenging weather conditions during winter storms Elliott and Mara. Thank you for all that you do for our customers and our communities every day. You are truly the heart and soul of Atmos Energy. Our first quarter results reflect that effort, dedication and focus as we continued modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems on our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2023 first quarter net income of $272 million or $1.91 per diluted share, and we reaffirmed our fiscal 2023 earnings per share guidance in the range of $5.90 to $6.10. Our Atmos Pipeline, Texas division achieved several project milestones during the first quarter. Our APT team completed filling the Cushing gas requirements at the Bethel 1B cavern and working gas is currently being injected and debriding operations continue with a targeted completion date of April of this year. This third cavern provides additional support to APTs operations, as well as the local distribution companies behind APT systems and adds over 6 Bcf of new working gas capacity. [Technical Difficulty] we completed the final portion of our 137 mile, 36 inch Line X integrity replacement project, as well as completed Phase 2 of our three phase line S2 project. Line S2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing Dallas Fort Worth metroplex. The second phase will place 17 miles of 14 inch pipeline with 36 inch pipeline. The final phase of this project is anticipated to be in service late calendar 2024. These projects enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system and support the continued growth we are seeing in the local distribution companies behind APT system. According to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued a 14 month streak of record employment in December and added 650,000 jobs for the 12 months ending December. This strong employment trend continues to drive the growth in our Mid Tex and West Texas divisions where approximately 47,000 of our nearly 64,000 new customers were added for the same 12 months ending December period. Additionally, industrial demand for natural gas in our service territory remains strong. During the first quarter, we added 12 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 9 Bcf once they're fully operational. The largest of these new industrial customers is anticipated to use nearly 6 Bcf annually. Our procurement team continues to do an excellent job sourcing the materials needed to support our capital investment as we continue modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. We also maintain about six months of inventory for our distribution and transmission needs. And as we said before, we have ordered all of our anticipated steel pipe needs for FY 2023. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continue their outreach efforts to energy assistant agencies into our customers during the first quarter. Through their work, the team helped nearly 17,000 customers receive over $6 million in funding assistance. As a reminder, during fiscal 2022, our energy assistance teams helped nearly 67,000 customers receive approximately 34 million of funding to help with their monthly bill. As you'll hear from Chris today, our fiscal 2023 financing costs are known. We have hedged a significant portion of our financing needs beyond fiscal year 2023, and our liquidity and balance sheet remains strong.

Fiscal '24 also represents the 40th consecutive year of dividend growth. Our fiscal year results reflect the focus and dedication of the entire Atmos Energy team and their continued successful execution of our proven strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. Our fiscal '24 capital investment of over $2.9 billion, supported the modernization of our systems through the replacement of over 850 miles of distribution and transmission pipe and replacement of more than 55,000 service lines. Additionally, we continue to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of APT system by placing into service our line PC on the southern end of APT system, as well as Phase 1 of the Line WA Loop to the west of Fort Worth and Phase 3 of 4 for Line S2 to the east of the DFW Metroplex. And we've completed the well integrity inspections on our Bethel Salt dome cavern #2. We expect base gas and working gas injection to be completed next month, providing the availability of all three salt dome caverns for this winter season. Our capital investment also supported natural gas service to fuel the strong economic development we continue to see across our service territories. In fiscal '24, we added over 59,000 new residential and commercial customers with over 46,000 of those new customers located in Texas. The housing market in the DFW Metroplex remains strong. For the 12 months ended September 30th, new home closing set a record high with a nearly 1% increase over the prior 12 month period, driven by the strength of the Texas economy. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued its streak of record employment. For the 12 months ended September, the seasonally-adjusted number of employed reached a new record high at over 14.3 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, adding nearly 327,000 jobs from September 2023 through September 2024. In addition to this robust residential customer growth, we saw solid commercial and industrial growth. In fiscal '24, we added nearly 3,500 new commercial customers, a 19% increase over the prior fiscal year. And we added 39 industrial customers, which when fully operational are anticipated to consume approximately 8.4 Bcf of gas annually. This usage is equivalent to adding over 160,000 residential customers on a volumetric basis. Over the last five years, we added nearly 300,000 residential and commercial customers. Over the last five years, we have added 225 industrial customers with an estimated annual load of 63 Bcf, when fully operational. Again, on a volumetric-basis, this is equivalent to adding nearly 1.2 million residential customers. This growing natural gas demand from all customer classes continues to demonstrate the vital role natural gas has in economic development across our service territories. Our customer support associates and service technicians continue to be at their best and inspire trust with our customers and in our community, through their exceptional customer service. They once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers. And during the fiscal year, our customer advocacy team assisted over 57,000 customers in receiving almost $23 million in energy assistance funding. I am very proud of our Atmos Energy team and their many accomplishments in fiscal '24. Their exceptional work has us well positioned for fiscal '25 and beyond. As you know, we operate in a diversified and growing service territory that is supportive of natural gas and our investment in natural gas infrastructure to supply the growing economy and meet the growing energy demand. As a reminder, 96% of our rate base is located in six of our eight states that have passed legislation in support of Energy Choice. To meet the expectations of our communities, our customers, policymakers and regulators, our five year plan contemplates $24 billion of capital investment. That investment will support the continued modernization of our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems as well as support the growing natural gas demand across our jurisdictions, with over 80% of that investment focused on safety and reliability. At APT, we will remain focused on safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification, while fortifying our system to support the growth of the LDC located behind our pipeline. This includes the completion of the final phase of our Line S-2 project to the east of the DFW Metroplex, continuation of the Line WA Loop project to the west of the DFW Metroplex, and adding capacity to move additional gas from our Bethel, Salt down facility towards Central Texas. The strength of our balance sheet, available liquidity and regulatory mechanisms will continue to support the vital role we play in every community of safely delivering reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and into the future. I will now turn the call over to Chris for some additional color around our fiscal '24 financial results, our fiscal '25 guidance and our updated five year plan through fiscal '29. And then we will open the call for questions. Chris?\nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal '24 earnings per share of $6.83 increased 12% over fiscal '23. As a reminder, these results include $0.17 from the one-time benefits we have discussed previously, an unplanned property tax reduction in Texas and lower than planned bad debt expense in Mississippi resulting from a regulatory change in how we recover uncollectible accounts. Excluding these one-time items, earnings per share increased 9.2% in fiscal '24. Our performance continues to reflect in the successful execution of our operating, regulatory and financing strategies. In fiscal '24, we implemented $376 million in annualized operating income increases. These outcomes combined with outcomes received in fiscal '23 increased operating income by over $300 million. Strong customer growth combined with rising industrial load in our Distribution segment increased operating income an additional $25 million, and rising peak day demand requirements from APT's LDC customers resulting in a $15 million increase in operating income. Finally, we saw a $39 million increase from APT's boosters in activities. About half of this increase was recognized during our fourth fiscal quarter. During this time, WAHA pricing is negative for 63% of the trading days. These market conditions were primarily driven by unplanned maintenance on certain pipelines and delays in new takeaway capacity coming online, both of which caused spreads to widen more than we had anticipated. These fourth quarter market conditions were the primary reason, why our fiscal '24 results exceeded the updated guidance range we provided in August. Consolidated O&M, excluding bad debt expense, increased $65 million. This increase is largely driven by higher employee related costs due to additional headcount to support growth and higher costs associated with increased line locating activities, system monitoring, training and administrative costs. Consolidated capital spending increased 5% or $131 million to $2.9 billion with 83% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This spending increased rate base by approximately 13% to an estimated $19 billion as of September 30th. Capital spending in our Distribution segment increased $322 million primarily as a result of increased system modernization and customer growth spending. Capital spending in our Pipeline & Storage segment decreased about $191 million primarily due to the timing of cash payments for pipeline system and safety and reliability work in Texas, that had been completed during the fiscal year. Finally, we completed $1.2 billion of long-term financing. We finished the fiscal year with an equity capitalization of 61% and approximately $4.8 billion of available liquidity, which leaves us well-positioned to support our future operations. Looking forward, we have initiated our fiscal '25 earnings per share guidance range of $7.05 to $7.25. Assuming the midpoint of this guidance range, this implies 7.4% growth in fiscal '24 earnings per share, excluding the previously mentioned one-time item. And we have initiated fiscal '25 capital spending guidance for approximately $3.7 billion Additionally, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 164th quarterly cash dividend with an indicated fiscal '25 annual dividend of $3.48, 8.1% increase over fiscal 2024. Finally, we rolled forward our five year plan in fiscal '29. Our strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to focus on system modernization through disciplined capital spending, take time of recovery of our costs through our various regulatory mechanisms and maintain a strong balance sheet, by financing our operations using a balance of equity and long-term debt. We anticipate the execution of this five year plan will continue to support 6% to 8% annual earnings per share growth and annual dividends per share growth. We anticipate earnings per share in fiscal '29 to be in the range of $9.15 to $9.55. As Kevin mentioned, we've included approximately $24 billion in our current five year plan. This level of spending is expected to support rate base growth of about 13% to 15% per year. By the end of fiscal '29, we anticipate rate base to increase from approximately $19 billion today to approximately $37 billion in fiscal '29. From a revenue perspective, we continue to execute our normal regulatory strategy of implementing approximately 20 rate filings per year. We have assumed no changes to our ROEs or regulatory mechanisms, nor have we assumed the implementation of new cost recovery mechanisms in this cycle plan. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we have implemented $149 million of annualized operating income increases in our Distribution segment, $116 million is related to the implementation of our two annual rate review mechanisms in Texas and $27 million related to the implementation of our two annual rate filings in Mississippi. Currently, we have three filings pending seeking about $77 million. Included in this filed for amount is approximately $40 million related to a system-wide general rate case in our West Texas distribution. This is a required filing affecting all customers in our West Texas division based on a settlement we reached in 2020. Additionally, we are required to refresh our rates upon five years of GRIP filings for portions of our West Texas division. We anticipate filing two similar cases in our Mid Texas Division during our first quarter, where just our cities will recover our costs through GRIP. Additionally, we have filed a general rate case in Kentucky seeking approximately $34 million. We anticipate completing all of these general rate cases in late spring of 2025. From a margin perspective, we've also assumed normal weather, market conditions and modest customer growth in both of our segments in this five year plan. Additionally, we have assumed a 6% decrease in the oil and gas costs included in the customer bill, primarily due to lower commodity costs, partially offset by higher storage and transportation costs. Finally, we have assumed the contribution from APT's three system business to normalize for fiscal '24 levels. Additional takeaway capacity is now in place, which should moderate spreads, and we will have the full year effect of the higher revenue benchmark in APT's wider breadth mechanism. On the cost side, we have assumed 4% annual O&M inflation, excluding bad debt expense. This inflation assumption is driven by increased spending for compliance-based activities to address system safety, system monitoring and employee costs. As we've discussed before, we are not a just in time compliance company, meaning that, we will look to accelerate compliance related work within the five year plan as system conditions dictate or if other opportunities arise. For fiscal '25, we anticipate O&M, excluding bad debt expense, to range from $840 million to $860 million, Approximately $20 million of the year over year increase relates to the amortization of APT's system safety and integrity mechanism. As a reminder, this new mechanism was approved in APT's last general rate case and is a flow through mechanism for costs incurred to address new federal and safety regulated regulations, meaning, we recognize the revenue and related O&M costs after review and approval by the Texas Railroad Commission, resulting in no impact to operating income. APT made its first SSI filing earlier this calendar year, seeking recovery of approximately $19 million in eligible SSI costs. This filing was approved in October, and revenues and O&M were adjusted effective November 1st to recover these costs over a 12 month period. Turning now to our financing plan. This five year plan includes approximately $15 billion of incremental long-term financing to support our operations and cash needs, including the expected impact of the corporate minimum income tax beginning in fiscal '27. We will continue to use a combination of long-term debt and equity to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and minimize the cost of financing for our customers and overall financing risk. As a reminder, this incremental financing is included in our earnings per share guidance for fiscal '25 through fiscal '29. Following the completion of our $650 million long-term debt issuance in October, our weighted average cost of debt is 4.1% and our weighted average maturity was 18.1 years with our next material refinancing not scheduled until June of 2027. From an equity perspective, we anticipate meeting all of our needs through our ATM program. As of September 30th, we have priced $1.4 billion which fully satisfies our fiscal '25 equity needs and a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '26 equity needs. This recent financing activity has substantially reduced our existing shelf registration statement and exhausted our ATM program. Once we receive the necessary regulatory approval, we intend to file for a new three year $8 billion shelf agreement and a new $1.7 billion ATM program to support our anticipated financing needs. In closing, like Kevin, I am very excited for the long-term outlook for Atmos Energy. Our operational and financial performance in fiscal '24 has laid the foundation for sustained success into fiscal '25 and beyond. The successful execution of this plan will continue to support 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share growth and commensurate dividends per share growth, while maintaining a strong financial profile, all of which supports our ability to meet our customers' needs and expectations in our growing service territories. We appreciate your time this morning, and we will now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Fei She with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nFei She: Hi. Good morning, team. Thanks very much for taking my questions, and congrats on another strong year of execution. First, I just wanted to quickly touch on financing, for some further clarity. If I recall previously, you target $600 million to $800 million a year through ATM to support your capital program. So now you have the $8 billion shelf registration you plan to file at $1.7 billion ATM you're renewing. First, I guess, how should we think about the run rate going forward? And also, could you, just discuss a little bit of about how should we think about financing this higher capital plan outside of ATM program? Thanks.\nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you. So again, we have an incremental $15 billion financing assumption in this five year plan. Again, we want to maintain the current strength of our balance sheet. If you want to assume 50% is equity, 50% is long-term debt and then you take that 50% assumption. And generally, relatively over the next five years that's about what the equity need will be, feel a little bit lower in fiscal '25, it will ramp up a little bit in '26 and beyond. But I think that's how you can think about it from a modeling perspective. In terms of just broader financing, this increased CapEx program, we do believe that, we were able -- we will be able to satisfy the equity needs through the ATM program, as well as the continued issuance of long-term debt in order to preserve and maintain the strength of balance sheet.\nFei She: That's great, really helpful. And if I can quickly touch on just the financing side of the equation regarding interest cost, as we roll forward to '25, obviously, you covered $300 million for fiscal -- for that year. And I guess going forward and deeper into the plan, how should we think about doing more interest rate swaps, and kind of maintaining the current debt-to-capitalization ratio in the five year plan?\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. I'll take the second question first on the debt-to-capitalization. We're very comfortable with where that debt-to-capitalization is at this point and we tend to maintain that going forward. And in terms of the interest rate hedging, it has proven to be very successful for us in the last several years, save our customers a lot of money. Dan and his team will continue to look for opportunities to lock in hedges at a point in time where we think it's appropriate to lock in that cost to drive cost stability going forward in the five year plan and also for the benefit of customers. So it's something we'll consider doing, just again as we -- as market conditions continue to evolve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi. Good morning and thank you for the time today. So starting on the CapEx side, given, it's a pretty staggering race here to your five year plan, could you parse some of the factors underpinning the higher pace of system investment? I know you gave some color at a high level on sort of 80% for safety and reliability, what have you, but I'm curious you can give a little bit more specificity around growth, change in replacement rates, anything else driving that higher level?\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. I appreciate your question. I'll point you back to what we talked about earlier, particularly around the 60, almost 60,000 new customers this past fiscal year. That's been pretty close over the last several fiscal years. Again, we're seeing robust growth on the residential, commercial and industrial side that continues to happen year in year out. We continue to look at the housing starts, the market stability here in Texas, as we talked about with the Texas Workforce Commission highlighting the employment growth that continues to occur year in year out here. That's all driving the demand on our system. Again, we need to be out in front of that growth, have it in place for the anticipated winter needs and fueling those commercial industrial demand as well. Those are part of what's driving that growth fortification. But the other part of it, again, is driven by what our risk models or risk factor tells us on a go forward with our pipe replacement program. So just as we've done in the previous years, we're going to look to those models to guide us to where and when to replace pipe. That's what's rolled out through the five year plan there along with meeting the expectations of demand and growth, whether it's on distribution as well as on APT system as well. You heard the two or three projects we talked about there of completing Line S-2, WA Loop, Bethel to grow Spec that we've talked about before as well as some of the work we're doing on storage, all in this capital investment plan that we've laid out.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Very clear. Thank you. And then, turning again to some of the numbers in this update, comparing the 13% to 15% rate base growth versus your 6% to 8% EPS growth guidance. The numbers seem to imply you, should be at or above the top end of the earnings range. I realize there is equity dilution, but I'm curious what is keeping the CAGR at 6% to 8%. Is there any reason you should not be at the top end or higher?\nChristopher Forsythe: Again, we look at our plan with a very conservative eye. There are still a lot of things as you know just coming out of an election, what's going on around the world, that we'll continue to take in our decision and thinking as we move forward there. But again, we believe, that's our comfortable range, as we've executed upon over the last several years. And given where we set today, we think that's very comfortable on a go forward basis for us.\nKevin Akers: Yes. I'll also add to that. We've also increased the O&M CAGR, if you will, from 3.5% to 4%. That's also a kind of a modifying effect on the earnings per share growth vis-a-vis the rate base growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Christopher Jeffrey with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one from me on the '25 guide, kind of, off of 2024, you'd mentioned in your comments about the strong benefits from the WAHA spread. Just kind of how you're thinking about that year-over-year, and kind of versus this year's level? Thanks.\nKevin Akers: Yes. Again, as Chris said in his comments, we've got a new Rider Rep benchmark that's out there approximately $107 million going into this year. Spreads did mitigate somewhat coming out of the summer period. We'll continue to look and see how weather affects that. But on a go forward, we look for things to normalize to a certain extent from what we saw earlier this summer period. That's how we will approach it on a go forward is more on a normalized basis. Again, most of that or all of that demand on APT is for the LDC customers behind the pipes that are out there. So anything we'll do, we'll have to be on off-peak within the summer period when maintenance isn't occurring out there. So we'll look to that again back on a normalized basis.\nChristopher Jeffrey: Got it. Thanks. And then Chris, you had mentioned, about taking the O&M from 3.5% to 4%. Just curious, maybe what you're seeing there? Is that related at all to the SSI rider at APT? And kind of, is there any maybe cadence if that's front-loaded, back-loaded or kind of consistent? Thanks.\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes, certainly between '24 and '25, we'll have a step up because of the SSI rider. We had roughly $6 million or $7 million flow through in fiscal '24. We're looking for closer to $20 million to $25 million in 2025. Again, it's offset in the margin line item. But, we're also just planning for just increased compliance related spending, system surveys, system monitoring, more real time monitoring in the system. You've heard us talk about our AMLD units, we have 16 now that are on the system that we're using in all eight of our states to monitor our system a lot more closely. And then, just we have employee cost as our population or our customer growth continues, we'll have the key to add service technicians and the like to make sure, we're properly serving those growing needs.\nKevin Akers: Yes. Additionally, the thing I'll add there is our line locates with this growing base, particularly here in the Texas region. We continue to grow the number of line locates that we continue to do as well as the rest of the infrastructure is driving that locates. And what I mean by that, as you have water, sewer infrastructure being put in with growing population and all of those leads for us to drive, locate and procted our assets as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi. Good morning, team. I had a couple of questions. One big, one small. The first, I'll start with the bigger one. There's a new very large potential natural gas customer that Entergy has talked about, like 2.3 gigawatts of combined cycle in Northern Louisiana. It looks like you're the local gas utility there. Just any way you could frame potential, whether it's kind of the local or broader capital needs related to that? And just how you're thinking about some of these lumpier economic development activities you're tracking across your footprint would be helpful.\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. I don't have any specifics that we could share at this point, on the Louisiana customer. But, in general, as we talked about large industrial loads over a period of time, we work with both our state economic development group, chambers of commerce, and local communities on sourcing and citing of these particular customers, what is best for them, what may benefit their energy demand for natural gas, how it's located to either our distribution or transmission assets. And then, we'll work with the customer on timing over a period of years, when they anticipate ramping up their usage that way. But, we continue to see steady inquiries as you heard quarter-after-quarter as described from various aspects of the industrial sector, whether it's metals, whether it's healthcare, whether it's distilling, various factors continue to drive the growth on the industrial side.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. That potential customer in Northern Louisiana, is that something that could be upside to the plan or we should kind of think about that within the scope of your capital guidance you put out?\nChristopher Forsythe: Again, we have a lot of customers across our territory looking and siding on a daily basis. We generally don't talk about those, until we have certainty around contractual obligations, ready to serve needs, those sort of things. Right now at this point, we're not at a point where we can discuss any particulars that aren't at that state of process.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Understood. And then, the smaller one. Just in terms of 2025 guidance and interest, it looks like it ticks down a little bit versus the balances up, the weighted cost of debt is up. Just, is that a function of lower short-term rates on commercial paper? Just any other dynamics there we should be cognizant of? Thank you.\nChristopher Forsythe: That's really the influence of, ATBC or capitalized interest. As our spending goes up, we do have a higher portion of our capitalized interest. Again with an all in weighted average cost of 4.1 ticked up very slightly, I mean, less than 5 or 10 basis points year-over-year. It's relatively flat. And then you've got the increased capitalized interest component, which is driving the net interest expense down a bit.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning. What's your assumption for bad debt expense and how does that impact the outlook? It looked like that was excluded from the 4% O&M guide. Is there any lumpiness to that with some of the changes to how that's being accounted for?\nKevin Akers: No. Really no changes anticipated. It was a little bit skewed this year obviously with the change in how we record our collect or uncollectible accounts in Mississippi. We're kind of beginning to normalize into more of a pre-pandemic state in terms of that debt expense. It's always going to rise a bit as a function of revenue going up a bit. But, as we continue to work our comprehensive collection strategy of not only just working with customers around energy assistance, offering them installment plans, levelized billing and alike. We anticipate that to be fairly flat year-over-year in the five year plan.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then what are you assuming for population growth or customer count growth in the Texas market in particular? And then, how sensitive is your outlook to that forecast?\nChristopher Forsythe: Yes. I would say, we've assumed a growth rate that is in line with what we've experienced here over the last couple of years. You heard Kevin talk early in the call about just continued growth from a residential perspective, certainly and then the knock on commercial impact, that we've just assumed basically recent trends that will continue going forward in this five year plan.\nRyan Levine: And then last question. In terms of the 4% O&M guidance, how lumpy is that throughout the forecast time period? Are there periods that are higher than that and others that are lower than that, or any color you can share?\nKevin Akers: No. I think year over year it's going to be, I would say, fairly gradual 4% every year. You might have a little bit of lumpiness within quarters, as we move work around to address the system needs, operational constraints so on and so forth. But year-over-year, we expect that to be fairly level at 4% per year.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Meziere, I turn the call back over to you.\nDaniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us this morning. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through December 31st. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Akers",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. As Monday is Veterans Day, I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who have served in our armed forces. Approximately 300 of our Atmos Energy teammates are a part of the more than 18 million Americans, who bravely served our country. Thank you for your service, and thank you to those currently serving this great nation. Fiscal '24 marked Atmos Energy's 40th anniversary as an independent company. All 5,200 of us here at Atmos Energy proudly serve our customers and our communities as we continue to be guided by the simple values of our founding Chairman, Charles K. Vaughan of honesty, integrity and good moral character. Yesterday, we reported earnings per share of $6.83, which represents the 22nd consecutive year of earnings per share growth. Fiscal '24 also represents the 40th consecutive year of dividend growth. Our fiscal year results reflect the focus and dedication of the entire Atmos Energy team and their continued successful execution of our proven strategy of operating safely and reliably, while we modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems. Our fiscal '24 capital investment of over $2.9 billion, supported the modernization of our systems through the replacement of over 850 miles of distribution and transmission pipe and replacement of more than 55,000 service lines. Additionally, we continue to enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of APT system by placing into service our line PC on the southern end of APT system, as well as Phase 1 of the Line WA Loop to the west of Fort Worth and Phase 3 of 4 for Line S2 to the east of the DFW Metroplex. And we've completed the well integrity inspections on our Bethel Salt dome cavern #2. We expect base gas and working gas injection to be completed next month, providing the availability of all three salt dome caverns for this winter season. Our capital investment also supported natural gas service to fuel the strong economic development we continue to see across our service territories. In fiscal '24, we added over 59,000 new residential and commercial customers with over 46,000 of those new customers located in Texas. The housing market in the DFW Metroplex remains strong. For the 12 months ended September 30th, new home closing set a record high with a nearly 1% increase over the prior 12 month period, driven by the strength of the Texas economy. And according to the Texas Workforce Commission, the state continued its streak of record employment. For the 12 months ended September, the seasonally-adjusted number of employed reached a new record high at over 14.3 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, adding nearly 327,000 jobs from September 2023 through September 2024. In addition to this robust residential customer growth, we saw solid commercial and industrial growth. In fiscal '24, we added nearly 3,500 new commercial customers, a 19% increase over the prior fiscal year. And we added 39 industrial customers, which when fully operational are anticipated to consume approximately 8.4 Bcf of gas annually. This usage is equivalent to adding over 160,000 residential customers on a volumetric basis. Over the last five years, we added nearly 300,000 residential and commercial customers. Over the last five years, we have added 225 industrial customers with an estimated annual load of 63 Bcf, when fully operational. Again, on a volumetric-basis, this is equivalent to adding nearly 1.2 million residential customers. This growing natural gas demand from all customer classes continues to demonstrate the vital role natural gas has in economic development across our service territories. Our customer support associates and service technicians continue to be at their best and inspire trust with our customers and in our community, through their exceptional customer service. They once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers. And during the fiscal year, our customer advocacy team assisted over 57,000 customers in receiving almost $23 million in energy assistance funding. I am very proud of our Atmos Energy team and their many accomplishments in fiscal '24. Their exceptional work has us well positioned for fiscal '25 and beyond. As you know, we operate in a diversified and growing service territory that is supportive of natural gas and our investment in natural gas infrastructure to supply the growing economy and meet the growing energy demand. As a reminder, 96% of our rate base is located in six of our eight states that have passed legislation in support of Energy Choice. To meet the expectations of our communities, our customers, policymakers and regulators, our five year plan contemplates $24 billion of capital investment. That investment will support the continued modernization of our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems as well as support the growing natural gas demand across our jurisdictions, with over 80% of that investment focused on safety and reliability. At APT, we will remain focused on safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification, while fortifying our system to support the growth of the LDC located behind our pipeline. This includes the completion of the final phase of our Line S-2 project to the east of the DFW Metroplex, continuation of the Line WA Loop project to the west of the DFW Metroplex, and adding capacity to move additional gas from our Bethel, Salt down facility towards Central Texas. The strength of our balance sheet, available liquidity and regulatory mechanisms will continue to support the vital role we play in every community of safely delivering reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses and industries to fuel our energy needs now and into the future. I will now turn the call over to Chris for some additional color around our fiscal '24 financial results, our fiscal '25 guidance and our updated five year plan through fiscal '29. And then we will open the call for questions. Chris? Yes. I'll also add to that. We've also increased the O&M CAGR, if you will, from 3.5% to 4%. That's also a kind of a modifying effect on the earnings per share growth vis-a-vis the rate base growth. Yes. Again, as Chris said in his comments, we've got a new Rider Rep benchmark that's out there approximately $107 million going into this year. Spreads did mitigate somewhat coming out of the summer period. We'll continue to look and see how weather affects that. But on a go forward, we look for things to normalize to a certain extent from what we saw earlier this summer period. That's how we will approach it on a go forward is more on a normalized basis. Again, most of that or all of that demand on APT is for the LDC customers behind the pipes that are out there. So anything we'll do, we'll have to be on off-peak within the summer period when maintenance isn't occurring out there. So we'll look to that again back on a normalized basis. Yes. Additionally, the thing I'll add there is our line locates with this growing base, particularly here in the Texas region. We continue to grow the number of line locates that we continue to do as well as the rest of the infrastructure is driving that locates. And what I mean by that, as you have water, sewer infrastructure being put in with growing population and all of those leads for us to drive, locate and procted our assets as well. No. Really no changes anticipated. It was a little bit skewed this year obviously with the change in how we record our collect or uncollectible accounts in Mississippi. We're kind of beginning to normalize into more of a pre-pandemic state in terms of that debt expense. It's always going to rise a bit as a function of revenue going up a bit. But, as we continue to work our comprehensive collection strategy of not only just working with customers around energy assistance, offering them installment plans, levelized billing and alike. We anticipate that to be fairly flat year-over-year in the five year plan. No. I think year over year it's going to be, I would say, fairly gradual 4% every year. You might have a little bit of lumpiness within quarters, as we move work around to address the system needs, operational constraints so on and so forth. But year-over-year, we expect that to be fairly level at 4% per year."

            "name": "Christopher Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal '24 earnings per share of $6.83 increased 12% over fiscal '23. As a reminder, these results include $0.17 from the one-time benefits we have discussed previously, an unplanned property tax reduction in Texas and lower than planned bad debt expense in Mississippi resulting from a regulatory change in how we recover uncollectible accounts. Excluding these one-time items, earnings per share increased 9.2% in fiscal '24. Our performance continues to reflect in the successful execution of our operating, regulatory and financing strategies. In fiscal '24, we implemented $376 million in annualized operating income increases. These outcomes combined with outcomes received in fiscal '23 increased operating income by over $300 million. Strong customer growth combined with rising industrial load in our Distribution segment increased operating income an additional $25 million, and rising peak day demand requirements from APT's LDC customers resulting in a $15 million increase in operating income. Finally, we saw a $39 million increase from APT's boosters in activities. About half of this increase was recognized during our fourth fiscal quarter. During this time, WAHA pricing is negative for 63% of the trading days. These market conditions were primarily driven by unplanned maintenance on certain pipelines and delays in new takeaway capacity coming online, both of which caused spreads to widen more than we had anticipated. These fourth quarter market conditions were the primary reason, why our fiscal '24 results exceeded the updated guidance range we provided in August. Consolidated O&M, excluding bad debt expense, increased $65 million. This increase is largely driven by higher employee related costs due to additional headcount to support growth and higher costs associated with increased line locating activities, system monitoring, training and administrative costs. Consolidated capital spending increased 5% or $131 million to $2.9 billion with 83% dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. This spending increased rate base by approximately 13% to an estimated $19 billion as of September 30th. Capital spending in our Distribution segment increased $322 million primarily as a result of increased system modernization and customer growth spending. Capital spending in our Pipeline & Storage segment decreased about $191 million primarily due to the timing of cash payments for pipeline system and safety and reliability work in Texas, that had been completed during the fiscal year. Finally, we completed $1.2 billion of long-term financing. We finished the fiscal year with an equity capitalization of 61% and approximately $4.8 billion of available liquidity, which leaves us well-positioned to support our future operations. Looking forward, we have initiated our fiscal '25 earnings per share guidance range of $7.05 to $7.25. Assuming the midpoint of this guidance range, this implies 7.4% growth in fiscal '24 earnings per share, excluding the previously mentioned one-time item. And we have initiated fiscal '25 capital spending guidance for approximately $3.7 billion Additionally, Atmos Energy's Board of Directors approved a 164th quarterly cash dividend with an indicated fiscal '25 annual dividend of $3.48, 8.1% increase over fiscal 2024. Finally, we rolled forward our five year plan in fiscal '29. Our strategy remains unchanged. We will continue to focus on system modernization through disciplined capital spending, take time of recovery of our costs through our various regulatory mechanisms and maintain a strong balance sheet, by financing our operations using a balance of equity and long-term debt. We anticipate the execution of this five year plan will continue to support 6% to 8% annual earnings per share growth and annual dividends per share growth. We anticipate earnings per share in fiscal '29 to be in the range of $9.15 to $9.55. As Kevin mentioned, we've included approximately $24 billion in our current five year plan. This level of spending is expected to support rate base growth of about 13% to 15% per year. By the end of fiscal '29, we anticipate rate base to increase from approximately $19 billion today to approximately $37 billion in fiscal '29. From a revenue perspective, we continue to execute our normal regulatory strategy of implementing approximately 20 rate filings per year. We have assumed no changes to our ROEs or regulatory mechanisms, nor have we assumed the implementation of new cost recovery mechanisms in this cycle plan. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, we have implemented $149 million of annualized operating income increases in our Distribution segment, $116 million is related to the implementation of our two annual rate review mechanisms in Texas and $27 million related to the implementation of our two annual rate filings in Mississippi. Currently, we have three filings pending seeking about $77 million. Included in this filed for amount is approximately $40 million related to a system-wide general rate case in our West Texas distribution. This is a required filing affecting all customers in our West Texas division based on a settlement we reached in 2020. Additionally, we are required to refresh our rates upon five years of GRIP filings for portions of our West Texas division. We anticipate filing two similar cases in our Mid Texas Division during our first quarter, where just our cities will recover our costs through GRIP. Additionally, we have filed a general rate case in Kentucky seeking approximately $34 million. We anticipate completing all of these general rate cases in late spring of 2025. From a margin perspective, we've also assumed normal weather, market conditions and modest customer growth in both of our segments in this five year plan. Additionally, we have assumed a 6% decrease in the oil and gas costs included in the customer bill, primarily due to lower commodity costs, partially offset by higher storage and transportation costs. Finally, we have assumed the contribution from APT's three system business to normalize for fiscal '24 levels. Additional takeaway capacity is now in place, which should moderate spreads, and we will have the full year effect of the higher revenue benchmark in APT's wider breadth mechanism. On the cost side, we have assumed 4% annual O&M inflation, excluding bad debt expense. This inflation assumption is driven by increased spending for compliance-based activities to address system safety, system monitoring and employee costs. As we've discussed before, we are not a just in time compliance company, meaning that, we will look to accelerate compliance related work within the five year plan as system conditions dictate or if other opportunities arise. For fiscal '25, we anticipate O&M, excluding bad debt expense, to range from $840 million to $860 million, Approximately $20 million of the year over year increase relates to the amortization of APT's system safety and integrity mechanism. As a reminder, this new mechanism was approved in APT's last general rate case and is a flow through mechanism for costs incurred to address new federal and safety regulated regulations, meaning, we recognize the revenue and related O&M costs after review and approval by the Texas Railroad Commission, resulting in no impact to operating income. APT made its first SSI filing earlier this calendar year, seeking recovery of approximately $19 million in eligible SSI costs. This filing was approved in October, and revenues and O&M were adjusted effective November 1st to recover these costs over a 12 month period. Turning now to our financing plan. This five year plan includes approximately $15 billion of incremental long-term financing to support our operations and cash needs, including the expected impact of the corporate minimum income tax beginning in fiscal '27. We will continue to use a combination of long-term debt and equity to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and minimize the cost of financing for our customers and overall financing risk. As a reminder, this incremental financing is included in our earnings per share guidance for fiscal '25 through fiscal '29. Following the completion of our $650 million long-term debt issuance in October, our weighted average cost of debt is 4.1% and our weighted average maturity was 18.1 years with our next material refinancing not scheduled until June of 2027. From an equity perspective, we anticipate meeting all of our needs through our ATM program. As of September 30th, we have priced $1.4 billion which fully satisfies our fiscal '25 equity needs and a significant portion of our anticipated fiscal '26 equity needs. This recent financing activity has substantially reduced our existing shelf registration statement and exhausted our ATM program. Once we receive the necessary regulatory approval, we intend to file for a new three year $8 billion shelf agreement and a new $1.7 billion ATM program to support our anticipated financing needs. In closing, like Kevin, I am very excited for the long-term outlook for Atmos Energy. Our operational and financial performance in fiscal '24 has laid the foundation for sustained success into fiscal '25 and beyond. The successful execution of this plan will continue to support 6% to 8% fully regulated earnings per share growth and commensurate dividends per share growth, while maintaining a strong financial profile, all of which supports our ability to meet our customers' needs and expectations in our growing service territories. We appreciate your time this morning, and we will now open up the call for questions. Thank you. So again, we have an incremental $15 billion financing assumption in this five year plan. Again, we want to maintain the current strength of our balance sheet. If you want to assume 50% is equity, 50% is long-term debt and then you take that 50% assumption. And generally, relatively over the next five years that's about what the equity need will be, feel a little bit lower in fiscal '25, it will ramp up a little bit in '26 and beyond. But I think that's how you can think about it from a modeling perspective. In terms of just broader financing, this increased CapEx program, we do believe that, we were able -- we will be able to satisfy the equity needs through the ATM program, as well as the continued issuance of long-term debt in order to preserve and maintain the strength of balance sheet. Yes. I'll take the second question first on the debt-to-capitalization. We're very comfortable with where that debt-to-capitalization is at this point and we tend to maintain that going forward. And in terms of the interest rate hedging, it has proven to be very successful for us in the last several years, save our customers a lot of money. Dan and his team will continue to look for opportunities to lock in hedges at a point in time where we think it's appropriate to lock in that cost to drive cost stability going forward in the five year plan and also for the benefit of customers. So it's something we'll consider doing, just again as we -- as market conditions continue to evolve. Yes. I appreciate your question. I'll point you back to what we talked about earlier, particularly around the 60, almost 60,000 new customers this past fiscal year. That's been pretty close over the last several fiscal years. Again, we're seeing robust growth on the residential, commercial and industrial side that continues to happen year in year out. We continue to look at the housing starts, the market stability here in Texas, as we talked about with the Texas Workforce Commission highlighting the employment growth that continues to occur year in year out here. That's all driving the demand on our system. Again, we need to be out in front of that growth, have it in place for the anticipated winter needs and fueling those commercial industrial demand as well. Those are part of what's driving that growth fortification. But the other part of it, again, is driven by what our risk models or risk factor tells us on a go forward with our pipe replacement program. So just as we've done in the previous years, we're going to look to those models to guide us to where and when to replace pipe. That's what's rolled out through the five year plan there along with meeting the expectations of demand and growth, whether it's on distribution as well as on APT system as well. You heard the two or three projects we talked about there of completing Line S-2, WA Loop, Bethel to grow Spec that we've talked about before as well as some of the work we're doing on storage, all in this capital investment plan that we've laid out. Again, we look at our plan with a very conservative eye. There are still a lot of things as you know just coming out of an election, what's going on around the world, that we'll continue to take in our decision and thinking as we move forward there. But again, we believe, that's our comfortable range, as we've executed upon over the last several years. And given where we set today, we think that's very comfortable on a go forward basis for us. Yes, certainly between '24 and '25, we'll have a step up because of the SSI rider. We had roughly $6 million or $7 million flow through in fiscal '24. We're looking for closer to $20 million to $25 million in 2025. Again, it's offset in the margin line item. But, we're also just planning for just increased compliance related spending, system surveys, system monitoring, more real time monitoring in the system. You've heard us talk about our AMLD units, we have 16 now that are on the system that we're using in all eight of our states to monitor our system a lot more closely. And then, just we have employee cost as our population or our customer growth continues, we'll have the key to add service technicians and the like to make sure, we're properly serving those growing needs. Yes. I don't have any specifics that we could share at this point, on the Louisiana customer. But, in general, as we talked about large industrial loads over a period of time, we work with both our state economic development group, chambers of commerce, and local communities on sourcing and citing of these particular customers, what is best for them, what may benefit their energy demand for natural gas, how it's located to either our distribution or transmission assets. And then, we'll work with the customer on timing over a period of years, when they anticipate ramping up their usage that way. But, we continue to see steady inquiries as you heard quarter-after-quarter as described from various aspects of the industrial sector, whether it's metals, whether it's healthcare, whether it's distilling, various factors continue to drive the growth on the industrial side. Again, we have a lot of customers across our territory looking and siding on a daily basis. We generally don't talk about those, until we have certainty around contractual obligations, ready to serve needs, those sort of things. Right now at this point, we're not at a point where we can discuss any particulars that aren't at that state of process. That's really the influence of, ATBC or capitalized interest. As our spending goes up, we do have a higher portion of our capitalized interest. Again with an all in weighted average cost of 4.1 ticked up very slightly, I mean, less than 5 or 10 basis points year-over-year. It's relatively flat. And then you've got the increased capitalized interest component, which is driving the net interest expense down a bit. Yes. I would say, we've assumed a growth rate that is in line with what we've experienced here over the last couple of years. You heard Kevin talk early in the call about just continued growth from a residential perspective, certainly and then the knock on commercial impact, that we've just assumed basically recent trends that will continue going forward in this five year plan."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Dan, you may begin.\nDaniel Meziere: All right. Thank you, Krista. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2024 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on slide 32, and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris Forsythe, our Senior Vice President and CFO. Chris?\nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we announced fiscal year to date diluted earnings per share of $6 compared to $5.33 per diluted share in the prior year period. Our third quarter and fiscal year to date results continued to be driven by two things: regulatory outcomes reflecting increased safety and reliability spending and customer growth. Additionally, strong through system revenues of APT, particularly during the third fiscal quarter, contribute to our performance. Regulatory outcomes in both of our segments increased operating income by $238 million and residential customer growth and rising industrial load and our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $18 million. Our pipeline and storage segment increased $19 million period over period. $11 million of this amount [Technical Difficulty] mechanism was realized during our third fiscal quarter. Several of pipelines coming out of the Permian experienced planned and unplanned maintenance. This reduction takeaway capacity of a robust associated natural gas production, while the spreads between the water heater on the western end of APT system and deliver points to the eastern and southern ends of system. We expect credit spreads remain elevated through the end of our fiscal year. Excluding the $14 million of one-time bad debt adjustment we report in Mississippi in the first quarter, consolidated O&M increase in net $16 million or about 3%. This increase is primarily due to higher employee-related costs, insurance premiums, IT software maintenance costs, partially offset by $15 million decrease in O&M and our pipeline and storage segment, primarily due to the timing of in-line inspection work. As expected, O&M in the third fiscal quarter trended higher than the prior-year quarter, and we anticipate O&M spending in the fourth fiscal quarter of trend higher as well, has continued to focus our spending on compliance, maintenance and system monitoring. We still expect fiscal '24 O&M to be in the range of $800 million to $820 million. Consolidated capital spending increased to $2.1 billion to 8% plus dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. Setting our distribution segment has increased due to higher safety and reliability spending -- higher spending to support customer growth. Spending in our pipeline and storage segment is lower than the prior year due to timing. We remain on track to spend approximately $3.1 billion this fiscal year. Since the end of our second fiscal quarter, we implemented about $213 billion in annualized regulatory outcomes, including all of this year's Texas GRIP filings and annual filings with the City of Dallas, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Year to date, we have completed $380 million annualized for inventory outcomes. Currently, we have an additional $182 million annualized outcomes in progress. Additionally, we made our first filing under APT's new system safety and integrity mechanism, seeking a $19 million increase in revenues. This new mechanism was approved APT's last general rate case as a floating mechanism for costs incurred to address new federal and state safety related regulations, meaning we will recognize the revenue and related O&M costs after review and approval by the Texas Railroad Commission resulting in no impact to operating income. Our financial position continues to remains strong. We finished our third fiscal quarter with an equity capitalization of 61%, and approximate $4.3 billion liquidity. This amount includes $551 million net proceeds available on our existing forward sale agreements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal '24 equity needs and most of our anticipated fiscal '25 needs. In June, we completed a $325 million senior unsecured debt offering, tapping our existing 10 year 5.9% senior notes. As a result, for overall weighted average cost of debt as of June 30 stands at 4.1%, and our debt profile remains very manageable with the weighted average maturity of approximately 17 years. As we head into the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, we now believe our fiscal '24 earnings per share guidance will be at the higher end of our reaffirmed earnings per share guidance range of $6.70 and $6.80. Our anticipated financing plan for fiscal 2024 is complete. All regulatory outcomes that can impact fiscal '24 has been implemented. As I mentioned ago, we anticipate spreads for APTs through system business will remain elevated, which will modestly contribute to our Q4 results. And we have a reasonably clear line of sight and consistent compliance, maintenance, and monitoring we will be performing in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our guidance range includes two items totaling $0.17 that we will exclude when we initiate our '25 guidance in November. The first item is the Texas property tax benefit that we have been discussing all fiscal year, which should favorably impact fiscal '24 results by $0.10. Additionally, the one-time Mississippi Fed debt adjustment for represented $0.07. We continue to anticipate 6% to 8% earnings per share growth and adjusted EPS amount through fiscal '28. Thank you for your time today, and I will turn the call over to Kevin for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We continue to benefit from solid economic growth in our service territory. For the 12 months ended June 30, we added 57,000 new customers, with nearly 45,000 of those new customers located in Texas. So Texas Workforce Commission reported in July that the seasonally adjusted number of employed reached 14.2 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months ending June; adding over 267,000 jobs, representing a 1.9% annual growth rate. Industrial demand for natural gas and service territories also remained strong. During the third quarter, we added 10 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 2 Bcf, once they are fully operational. Fiscal year to date, we have added 32 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 6 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, the 6 Bcf of anticipated industrial load is equal to adding approximately 110,000 residential customers. And during the first nine months of the fiscal year, our customer support agents and customer advocacy team continued their outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers, helping over 47,000 customers received nearly $19 million in funding assistance. Our consistent performance reflects the vital role we play in every community: safely delivering reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses, and industries to fuel our energy needs now, and in the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we will now open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Barclays.\nNicholas Campanella: I just wanted to first quickly touch on financing. Could you just further discuss the equity needs for '25? And definitely, given '25 largely done with all our instruments and the recent renewal of ATM, just how does that better facilitate the equity needs in 2025? Thanks.\nChristopher Forsythe: Yeah. Well, this is Chris. Good morning and thanks for joining us. We typically issue between $600 million and $800 million a year in equity through the ATM program that we have seen. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we had $551 million of price at the end of June, which that amount will basically mostly satisfy our fiscal 2025 needs. So I think that hopefully that will give you enough color to update your models.\nNicholas Campanella: That's great. Thanks for the colors. Very helpful. Maybe just quickly turning to O&M execution for '25, you raised the midpoint guidance by $20 million last quarter. And I guess things are on track for this year. Could you talk about going forward, what are some of the key items you're focusing on O&M execution? And how are you benchmarking with a 3.5% annual increase guidance? Thanks.\nKevin Akers: Yeah, this is Kevin. Good morning. Glad to have you join us today. Again, we're working through the remainder of fiscal '24 right now and anticipate it will be the same items as we move into '25. And we'll have additional detail and color as we get to our November call on 25. But again, the drivers around O&M continue to be hydrostatic testing, line locating, integrity regulations, markable placement on difficult, hard to locate lines. So all sort of things. And then looking for opportunities as we move forward to enhance those or pull things forward when we had the ability to do that. So again, the same items that we're focused on this year, we anticipate seeing again in '25.\nChristopher Forsythe: Yeah -- and I'll add to that, too, is that no, as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, we're still anticipating 6% to 80% EPS growth off of the adjusted EPS and now for fiscal '24. So that's the overall theme to take away from. We will have some puts and takes in the O&M. As Kevin mentioned, we're still guiding to that 6% to 8% growth target.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland: Looking at '24 results, you've called out the $0.17 of one-offs. I'm curious how we should think about the rest of the business into '25 -- everything else continuing to '25 other than APT spread benefit, meaning take to succeed in your top and less $0.17 and maybe back out another roughly $0.10 for the spread pickup?\nChristopher Forsythe: Yeah. I think you're on target there, Richard, backing out the $0.17 off of whatever you want to assume for the outcome for fiscal '24 APT, we will have some spread activity next year, but we just can't predict it. So I wouldn't necessarily discount too far off of what you have -- the two one-time items when you're starting your 7% or 8% or 9%, whatever you want to do on the growth target for fiscal 2025, as we will have some activity. It is just this time this year, and particularly in the third quarter, we saw some elevated spreads. And as you commented, it is expected to revert back to the mean, which means we'll still have some activity there.\nRichard Sunderland: Okay, great. That's really helpful. And I guess one quick follow-up on that spread opportunity. I know you referenced in the script kind of a continuation into 4Q. Is that already contemplated in the higher end guidance language or is that potential upside depending on how that materializes?\nChristopher Forsythe: No, that's all contemplated in the guidance that we've updated here this morning.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.\nRyan Levine: To follow-up on the APT spread dynamics. What are you assuming for the Matterhorn in-service date with the current '24 guidance? Are you assuming that the spread means right for the remaining portion of your fiscal year?\nKevin Akers: Yeah. As Chris said, again, we don't anticipate any further maintenance this year on the upstream segments of APT there that would impact the spreads right now. They've mitigated from the highs we've seen over the last quarter somewhat. And look, going forward, definitely Matterhorn will be coming on, I think, if you read some of the documentation from the upstream folks sometime in September, October, early fall, that will be coming on. We just have to watch and see what that does for the dynamics out there. And then as we normally get into the in winter period, demand will drive it further from there on the spread impact. But again, I'd like to remind here why APT adjusts and that's to serve the customers behind it, the LDCs behind it, and then when we have opportunity, we will move that gas across our system. So right now, again, we don't anticipate any further maintenance upstream that would impact the spreads any further than what we're currently seeing today at this point.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then a follow-up on that. Given the strong performance this fiscal year on APT, does that have any implications for resetting the bar which you get the sharing mechanism in future time periods?\nKevin Akers: No, that's said in the rate case itself on a go forward, so the next time that a potential be looked at would be in the next five years -- in the next required filing?\nChristopher Forsythe: Yeah. So as a reminder, that bar was set at $106.9 million. And so that's the benchmark we got to achieve to begin sharing over and above that amount. And of course, it works the other way too if we fall short, but $106.9 million is the target we're looking at.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And last question for me. To the extent that there is new gas generation or infrastructure built in your service territory, do you see any opportunities on the LDC side to maybe build some infrastructure to support the movement of gas associated some of the gas generation that may be coming?\nKevin Akers: Yeah. As we talked about on previous calls, there's always that opportunity out there. But let's remember the power generators that we currently have behind APT system, we're one of several suppliers to them, so they can move or flex between suppliers at their will out there. So we wouldn't be a sole supplier. So we'll just continue to keep an eye on that over the next few years and see how that develops. But again, we would be one of several of suppliers or inputs into those facilities.\nOperator: And that concludes our question and answer session. And I will now turn the conference back over to Dan for closing remarks.\nDaniel Meziere: Thanks. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us today. And a reminder, a recording of this call is available for replay on our website. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Fiscal year to date, we have added 32 new industrial customers with an anticipated annual load of approximately 6 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, the 6 Bcf of anticipated industrial load is equal to adding approximately 110,000 residential customers. And during the first nine months of the fiscal year, our customer support agents and customer advocacy team continued their outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers, helping over 47,000 customers received nearly $19 million in funding assistance. Our consistent performance reflects the vital role we play in every community: safely delivering reliable and efficient natural gas to homes, businesses, and industries to fuel our energy needs now, and in the future. We appreciate your time this morning, and we will now open the call to questions. Yeah, this is Kevin. Good morning. Glad to have you join us today. Again, we're working through the remainder of fiscal '24 right now and anticipate it will be the same items as we move into '25. And we'll have additional detail and color as we get to our November call on 25. But again, the drivers around O&M continue to be hydrostatic testing, line locating, integrity regulations, markable placement on difficult, hard to locate lines. So all sort of things. And then looking for opportunities as we move forward to enhance those or pull things forward when we had the ability to do that. So again, the same items that we're focused on this year, we anticipate seeing again in '25. Yeah. As Chris said, again, we don't anticipate any further maintenance this year on the upstream segments of APT there that would impact the spreads right now. They've mitigated from the highs we've seen over the last quarter somewhat. And look, going forward, definitely Matterhorn will be coming on, I think, if you read some of the documentation from the upstream folks sometime in September, October, early fall, that will be coming on. We just have to watch and see what that does for the dynamics out there. And then as we normally get into the in winter period, demand will drive it further from there on the spread impact. But again, I'd like to remind here why APT adjusts and that's to serve the customers behind it, the LDCs behind it, and then when we have opportunity, we will move that gas across our system. So right now, again, we don't anticipate any further maintenance upstream that would impact the spreads any further than what we're currently seeing today at this point. No, that's said in the rate case itself on a go forward, so the next time that a potential be looked at would be in the next five years -- in the next required filing? Yeah. As we talked about on previous calls, there's always that opportunity out there. But let's remember the power generators that we currently have behind APT system, we're one of several suppliers to them, so they can move or flex between suppliers at their will out there. So we wouldn't be a sole supplier. So we'll just continue to keep an eye on that over the next few years and see how that develops. But again, we would be one of several of suppliers or inputs into those facilities."

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining us and your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we announced fiscal year to date diluted earnings per share of $6 compared to $5.33 per diluted share in the prior year period. Our third quarter and fiscal year to date results continued to be driven by two things: regulatory outcomes reflecting increased safety and reliability spending and customer growth. Additionally, strong through system revenues of APT, particularly during the third fiscal quarter, contribute to our performance. Regulatory outcomes in both of our segments increased operating income by $238 million and residential customer growth and rising industrial load and our distribution segment increased operating income by an additional $18 million. Our pipeline and storage segment increased $19 million period over period. $11 million of this amount [Technical Difficulty] mechanism was realized during our third fiscal quarter. Several of pipelines coming out of the Permian experienced planned and unplanned maintenance. This reduction takeaway capacity of a robust associated natural gas production, while the spreads between the water heater on the western end of APT system and deliver points to the eastern and southern ends of system. We expect credit spreads remain elevated through the end of our fiscal year. Excluding the $14 million of one-time bad debt adjustment we report in Mississippi in the first quarter, consolidated O&M increase in net $16 million or about 3%. This increase is primarily due to higher employee-related costs, insurance premiums, IT software maintenance costs, partially offset by $15 million decrease in O&M and our pipeline and storage segment, primarily due to the timing of in-line inspection work. As expected, O&M in the third fiscal quarter trended higher than the prior-year quarter, and we anticipate O&M spending in the fourth fiscal quarter of trend higher as well, has continued to focus our spending on compliance, maintenance and system monitoring. We still expect fiscal '24 O&M to be in the range of $800 million to $820 million. Consolidated capital spending increased to $2.1 billion to 8% plus dedicated to improving the safety and reliability of our system. Setting our distribution segment has increased due to higher safety and reliability spending -- higher spending to support customer growth. Spending in our pipeline and storage segment is lower than the prior year due to timing. We remain on track to spend approximately $3.1 billion this fiscal year. Since the end of our second fiscal quarter, we implemented about $213 billion in annualized regulatory outcomes, including all of this year's Texas GRIP filings and annual filings with the City of Dallas, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Year to date, we have completed $380 million annualized for inventory outcomes. Currently, we have an additional $182 million annualized outcomes in progress. Additionally, we made our first filing under APT's new system safety and integrity mechanism, seeking a $19 million increase in revenues. This new mechanism was approved APT's last general rate case as a floating mechanism for costs incurred to address new federal and state safety related regulations, meaning we will recognize the revenue and related O&M costs after review and approval by the Texas Railroad Commission resulting in no impact to operating income. Our financial position continues to remains strong. We finished our third fiscal quarter with an equity capitalization of 61%, and approximate $4.3 billion liquidity. This amount includes $551 million net proceeds available on our existing forward sale agreements that will fully satisfy our anticipated fiscal '24 equity needs and most of our anticipated fiscal '25 needs. In June, we completed a $325 million senior unsecured debt offering, tapping our existing 10 year 5.9% senior notes. As a result, for overall weighted average cost of debt as of June 30 stands at 4.1%, and our debt profile remains very manageable with the weighted average maturity of approximately 17 years. As we head into the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, we now believe our fiscal '24 earnings per share guidance will be at the higher end of our reaffirmed earnings per share guidance range of $6.70 and $6.80. Our anticipated financing plan for fiscal 2024 is complete. All regulatory outcomes that can impact fiscal '24 has been implemented. As I mentioned ago, we anticipate spreads for APTs through system business will remain elevated, which will modestly contribute to our Q4 results. And we have a reasonably clear line of sight and consistent compliance, maintenance, and monitoring we will be performing in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our guidance range includes two items totaling $0.17 that we will exclude when we initiate our '25 guidance in November. The first item is the Texas property tax benefit that we have been discussing all fiscal year, which should favorably impact fiscal '24 results by $0.10. Additionally, the one-time Mississippi Fed debt adjustment for represented $0.07. We continue to anticipate 6% to 8% earnings per share growth and adjusted EPS amount through fiscal '28. Thank you for your time today, and I will turn the call over to Kevin for his update and some closing remarks. Kevin? Yeah. Well, this is Chris. Good morning and thanks for joining us. We typically issue between $600 million and $800 million a year in equity through the ATM program that we have seen. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we had $551 million of price at the end of June, which that amount will basically mostly satisfy our fiscal 2025 needs. So I think that hopefully that will give you enough color to update your models. Yeah -- and I'll add to that, too, is that no, as I said at the end of my prepared remarks, we're still anticipating 6% to 80% EPS growth off of the adjusted EPS and now for fiscal '24. So that's the overall theme to take away from. We will have some puts and takes in the O&M. As Kevin mentioned, we're still guiding to that 6% to 8% growth target. Yeah. I think you're on target there, Richard, backing out the $0.17 off of whatever you want to assume for the outcome for fiscal '24 APT, we will have some spread activity next year, but we just can't predict it. So I wouldn't necessarily discount too far off of what you have -- the two one-time items when you're starting your 7% or 8% or 9%, whatever you want to do on the growth target for fiscal 2025, as we will have some activity. It is just this time this year, and particularly in the third quarter, we saw some elevated spreads. And as you commented, it is expected to revert back to the mean, which means we'll still have some activity there. No, that's all contemplated in the guidance that we've updated here this morning. Yeah. So as a reminder, that bar was set at $106.9 million. And so that's the benchmark we got to achieve to begin sharing over and above that amount. And of course, it works the other way too if we fall short, but $106.9 million is the target we're looking at."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Atmos Energy Corporation Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Dan, please go ahead. \nDaniel Meziere: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab.\n As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 30 and more fully described in our SEC filings.\n With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Akers, our President and CEO. Kevin? \nJohn Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported year-to-date fiscal '24 net income of $743 million or $4.93 per diluted share. And we updated our fiscal '24 earnings per share guidance to a range of $6.70 to $6.80. This performance continues to reflect the commitment, dedication, focus and effort of all 5,000 Atmos Energy employees to successfully modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems, while safely providing reliable natural gas service to 3.4 million customers and 1,400 communities across our 8 states.\n For the quarter, we continue to experience robust customer growth, driven by continuing favorable employment trends in Texas, along with a strong new housing market in the North Texas area. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2024, we added over 56,000 new customers, with more than 43,000 of those new customers located in Texas.\n New home starts in North Texas were up 44.7% during the first calendar quarter of '24 compared to the first quarter of 2023. As a result, the annual new home start rate is now at the highest pace since mid-2022.\n The Texas Workforce Commission reported in April that the seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over 14.1 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, ending March, adding nearly 271,000 jobs, representing a 2% annual growth rate.\n Industrial demand for natural gas in our service territories also remained strong. During the second quarter, we added 11 new industrial customers, with an anticipated annual load of approximately 1 Bcf once they are fully operational. Fiscal year-to-date, we've added 22 new industrial customers, with an anticipated annual load of approximately 4 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, this is equal to adding approximately 68,000 residential customers to our system.\n Commercial customer growth remained solid as well, with over 900 customers connecting to the system during the second quarter and over 2,000 customers connecting to the system fiscal year-to-date. This growth continues to highlight the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development across our service territory.\n In APT, we continue our work on several projects that will enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system, as well as support the continued growth we are seeing in the local distribution companies behind APT's system.\n Work continues on the fourth and final phase of our Line S-2 project. This phase will replace the existing 14-inch and 20-inch pipelines with 40 miles of 36-inch pipeline. As a reminder, this project brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex. This phase of the project is anticipated to be in service by the end of this calendar year.\n To the south of the DFW Metroplex, we have a project underway that will provide additional pipeline capacity to transport gas from our Bethel storage facility into the growing DFW Metroplex in the growth corridor along Interstate 35 in Waco, Temple and the Austin area. This project is scheduled to be placed into service late in calendar year 2025.\n During the second quarter, our customer support associates and service technicians once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers, reflecting the exceptional customer service they provide each and every day. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continue their outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. Through their efforts, the team helped nearly 34,000 customers receive over $12 million in funding assistance.\n Recently, the American Customer Satisfaction Index ranked Atmos Energy first in customer satisfaction. This is the second consecutive year we have reached this ranking. For the second year in a row as well, recognition on Newsweek's list of Most Trustworthy Companies in America. And we also appeared in the first Newsweek Excellence 1000 index, which identifies models of corporate responsibility across more than 25 industries.\n Finally, for the fourth consecutive year, we were named on the Forbes list of America's Best Midsize Employers. And this year, we are ranked first among all companies in the utility industry. This recognition demonstrates how our dedicated employees continue to be guided by the simple values of honesty, integrity and good moral character, the core values laid out by our Founding Chairman, Charles K. Vaughan. These values, combined with our employees' laser-focus on our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services, continue to benefit our customers and the communities we serve.\n I will now turn the call over to Chris for his update. \nChristopher Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. As Kevin mentioned, earnings per share for the first 6 months of the fiscal year was $4.93, which represents a 12% increase over the $4.40 per share reported in the prior year period. Operating income increased to $950 million or 28% for the first 6 months of the fiscal year. I'll highlight a few key drivers for our financial performance.\n Rate increases in both of our operating segments totaled $192 million. Residential commercial customer growth in our Distribution segment, combined with higher industrial load, increased operating income by an [ additional ] $12 million. Revenues in our Pipeline & Storage segment increased $8 million period-over-period, due to wider spreads between the Waha header on the western end of APT system and delivery points in the eastern and southern ends of its system.\n Consolidated O&M expense decreased $13 million, primarily driven by the onetime bad debt adjustment we recorded in Mississippi in the first quarter. Excluding this impact, O&M was essentially flat period-over-period.\n Finally, operating income was favorably impacted by approximately $15 million from the legislative change in Texas to reduce property tax expenses that we discussed last quarter. This amount approximates $0.07.\n From a regulatory perspective, fiscal year-to-date, we have implemented approximately $170 million in annualized regulatory outcomes, and we currently have over $350 million in progress. Of this amount, we anticipate implementing $170 million to $180 million in fiscal '24, with the remainder in the first quarter of fiscal '25.\n Our balance sheet and financial position remains strong. Our equity capitalization as of March 31 was 61%, and we did not have any short-term net outstanding.\n During the second quarter, we expanded our available liquidity through the renewal of our four credit facilities. We now have $3.1 billion available from these facilities, a $600 million increase over what was provided by our former credit facilities.\n At quarter end, we had $4.2 billion of available liquidity to support our operations. Included in this amount is $890 million of net proceeds available from our ATM activities, which is expected to satisfy the remainder of our anticipated fiscal '24 equities and a significant portion of our anticipated equity needs for fiscal '25. And as we mentioned before, the ATM will continue to be our preferred method to issue [ equity ]. To support that strategy, yesterday, we registered a new $1 billion ATM program.\n Our fiscal year-to-date performance gives us confidence to increase our fiscal '24 earnings per share guidance from a range of $6.45 to $6.65 to a new range of $6.70 to $6.80, which leaves us well positioned to grow earnings per share for the 22nd consecutive year. We expect the remaining contribution to fiscal '24 earnings per share to be recognized somewhat evenly by quarter and the back half of the fiscal year. This updated guiding range includes approximately $0.10 to $0.11 for the onetime Texas property tax benefit and approximately $0.07 for onetime Mississippi bad debt adjustment. When we initiate our fiscal '25 earnings per share guidance in November, we will exclude the effect of both nonrecurring items. And we anticipate 6% to 8% earnings per share growth from this adjusted earnings per share amount.\n In addition to the onetime tax -- property tax and bad debt expense adjustments, I'd like to highlight a few additional items reflected in our revised guidance. From a revenue perspective, the winter heating season is over, and approximately 70% of our Distribution segment revenue has been recognized. Additionally, the most significant regulatory filings impacting fiscal '24 has been or will soon be completed. This gives us better line of sight into our revenues for the remainder of the fiscal year. Additionally, we are anticipating higher-than-planned customer growth and consumption for the fiscal year. \n Going into the fiscal year, we anticipated residential customer growth to slow somewhat due to higher mortgage rates. However, that trend was not as pronounced as we had anticipated. Finally, we're anticipating higher throughput revenues at APT, net of the Rider REV benchmark, as spreads are expected to remain higher than we had originally anticipated.\n Partially offsetting these positive trends, we have increased our O&M range from $780 million to $800 million to a new range of $800 million to $820 million, inclusive of the Mississippi bad debt expense adjustment.\n As we said before, we are not a just-in-time compliance company, but we intend to stay ahead of our compliance work in the second half of the fiscal year to further enhance the safety and reliability of our system. We'll also perform some additional maintenance this summer to prepare for the upcoming winter heating season.\n Since most of the spending will be incurred in the back half of the fiscal year, we anticipate O&M for the third and fiscal fourth quarters to trend higher than the prior year's third and fiscal fourth quarters. Also included in this revised range is approximately $7 million for amortization of some regulatory assets after they are approved in the APT case in December. This increased amortization expense does not impact operating income, as we're reflecting an offsetting amount through rates.\n In addition to upgrading our earnings per share guidance, we have increased our capital spending guidance from approximately $2.9 billion to approximately $3.1 billion. Based on our ongoing assessment of our distribution and transmission systems, we've identified some additional system fortification that will be completed in advance of the next winter heating season. Additionally, the robust new housing market in North Texas that Kevin mentioned has modestly increased our gross spending.\n We appreciate your time this morning and your interest in Atmos Energy. We'll now open up the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. \nRichard Sunderland: Can you hear me? \nJohn Akers: Sure can. \nRichard Sunderland: Great. Thanks for all the clarifications around guidance and the changes there. I do just want to circle back to that and particularly the language around the roll forward of the growth rate at year-end, ex those nonrecurring items. Just for the sake of clarity, could you quantify again what those items are? And so just to be clear, those two items would then be removed from your year-end results for the purposes of calculating the growth rate on a [ 4 basis ], am I summarizing that correctly? \nChristopher Forsythe: You are. So just to kind of reemphasize. On the Texas property tax adjustment, we're anticipating that impact to be $0.10 to $0.11. Additionally, the Mississippi bad debt adjustment was about $0.07. So when we initiate our fiscal '25 guidance, wherever we land on a GAAP basis, we'll back off the $0.10 to $0.11 and the $0.07, and that will be the rebased or adjusted earnings per share from which we will launch our fiscal '25 guidance. And as I mentioned, we're anticipating 6% to 8% growth off of that adjusted amount. \nRichard Sunderland: Okay. Got it. Very helpful there. And then just to parse the '24 guidance changes a little more finely. If I'm recalling correctly from last quarter, you had said Mississippi was in the prior range and then Texas property tax, there had been a little uncertainty about whether it was all incremental or not, and now we're obviously getting that update today.\n So is the balance of the change relative to the $0.10 to $0.11 on the Texas side? Is it the customer growth and consumption in APT spreads that you referenced in the script? Or are there any other key things we should think about in terms of trends into '25 that you're kind of illuminating today? \nChristopher Forsythe: Okay. So lots to unpack there. So I think, again, on the $0.10 to $0.11 on the Texas property tax, that was really related to -- we're receiving the final valuations in our property tax valuations here in this quarter. And our team is working through what those final valuations will be for taxation purposes. So that's why there's a range there.\n On the Mississippi bad debt expense which we articulated last quarter, that was a onetime event, as a result of a regulatory change and how we recover those costs. And so again, that will -- going forward, that impact will no longer be reflected in our in our P&L, that the catch-up, if you will, related to primarily prior year periods because the adjustment dated back from April 2022, all the way through the end of calendar '23.\n So we had effectively recognized bad debt expense in the past that we were then allowed to reallocate back to our over under our GCA recovery balances on the balance sheet. So that was the reason for the pickups, and that's why it's a onetime event.\n And going forward, in terms of trends, we will update our fiscal '25 guidance here in the fall, and we'll see what happens. The summer was spread with customer growth, mortgage interest rates, and all that will be fully reflected in our '25 guidance, which we will launch later this fiscal year -- or later this calendar year. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Jeffrey with Mizuho. \nChristopher Jeffrey: Maybe picking up on one of the other guidance item that was updated in the CapEx guidance went up about [ $20 million ]. And apologies if you talked about it in the call already, but any kind of color there as to what kind of the spread between distribution or pipeline or anything else... \nJohn Akers: Yes, it's a little hard to understand your question there, but I think [indiscernible], you're asking about the spreads on the pipeline. Obviously, at different times throughout the year, there will be maintenance on various other takeaway capacity. That's what we've seen over the last few weeks to months and anticipate several other pipelines to have additional maintenance, which is driving some negative spreads coming out of Waha, I believe, this morning.\n Today's cash [ prices ] were negative $2.30. Couple of pipelines have again announced further maintenance into this month, maybe into the following month as well, which will continue to show those wider spreads for the next few week period. And Chris mentioned those in his remarks as well. So we expect it to clear up later toward the summer period. \nChristopher Jeffrey: One of my questions was about spreads on the pipeline. So maybe to clarify my last question, the CapEx guide for '24 increased from the last update. I was just hoping further color on what's driving the increase in which businesses? \nJohn Akers: Yes, as we normally do. What drives our CapEx is our safety and reliability investment. And again, Chris mentioned in his remarks that we had identified several projects before heading into the heating season that we would like to complete for reliability measures that are out there. And our team continues to evaluate safety projects that are out there or pipe programs across our various jurisdictions. We'll further identify those as we head toward our update near the October-November time frame on 2025. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And it looks like there are no further questions. So at this point, I will turn the call back over to Dan Meziere for closing remarks. Dan? \nDaniel Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy, and thank you again for joining us this morning. The recording of this call is available for replay on our website through June 30. Have a great day. \nOperator: Thanks, Dan. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

So that's why there's a range there.\n On the Mississippi bad debt expense which we articulated last quarter, that was a onetime event, as a result of a regulatory change and how we recover those costs. And so again, that will -- going forward, that impact will no longer be reflected in our in our P&L, that the catch-up, if you will, related to primarily prior year periods because the adjustment dated back from April 2022, all the way through the end of calendar '23.\n So we had effectively recognized bad debt expense in the past that we were then allowed to reallocate back to our over under our GCA recovery balances on the balance sheet. So that was the reason for the pickups, and that's why it's a onetime event.\n And going forward, in terms of trends, we will update our fiscal '25 guidance here in the fall, and we'll see what happens. The summer was spread with customer growth, mortgage interest rates, and all that will be fully reflected in our '25 guidance, which we will launch later this fiscal year -- or later this calendar year."

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. Yesterday, we reported year-to-date fiscal '24 net income of $743 million or $4.93 per diluted share. And we updated our fiscal '24 earnings per share guidance to a range of $6.70 to $6.80. This performance continues to reflect the commitment, dedication, focus and effort of all 5,000 Atmos Energy employees to successfully modernize our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems, while safely providing reliable natural gas service to 3.4 million customers and 1,400 communities across our 8 states.\n For the quarter, we continue to experience robust customer growth, driven by continuing favorable employment trends in Texas, along with a strong new housing market in the North Texas area. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2024, we added over 56,000 new customers, with more than 43,000 of those new customers located in Texas.\n New home starts in North Texas were up 44.7% during the first calendar quarter of '24 compared to the first quarter of 2023. As a result, the annual new home start rate is now at the highest pace since mid-2022.\n The Texas Workforce Commission reported in April that the seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over 14.1 million. Texas again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, ending March, adding nearly 271,000 jobs, representing a 2% annual growth rate.\n Industrial demand for natural gas in our service territories also remained strong. During the second quarter, we added 11 new industrial customers, with an anticipated annual load of approximately 1 Bcf once they are fully operational. Fiscal year-to-date, we've added 22 new industrial customers, with an anticipated annual load of approximately 4 Bcf once they are fully operational. On a volumetric basis, this is equal to adding approximately 68,000 residential customers to our system.\n Commercial customer growth remained solid as well, with over 900 customers connecting to the system during the second quarter and over 2,000 customers connecting to the system fiscal year-to-date. This growth continues to highlight the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development across our service territory.\n In APT, we continue our work on several projects that will enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system, as well as support the continued growth we are seeing in the local distribution companies behind APT's system.\n Work continues on the fourth and final phase of our Line S-2 project. This phase will replace the existing 14-inch and 20-inch pipelines with 40 miles of 36-inch pipeline. As a reminder, this project brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale plays to the east side of the growing DFW Metroplex. This phase of the project is anticipated to be in service by the end of this calendar year.\n To the south of the DFW Metroplex, we have a project underway that will provide additional pipeline capacity to transport gas from our Bethel storage facility into the growing DFW Metroplex in the growth corridor along Interstate 35 in Waco, Temple and the Austin area. This project is scheduled to be placed into service late in calendar year 2025.\n During the second quarter, our customer support associates and service technicians once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from our customers, reflecting the exceptional customer service they provide each and every day. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continue their outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers during the first 6 months of the fiscal year. Through their efforts, the team helped nearly 34,000 customers receive over $12 million in funding assistance.\n Recently, the American Customer Satisfaction Index ranked Atmos Energy first in customer satisfaction. This is the second consecutive year we have reached this ranking. For the second year in a row as well, recognition on Newsweek's list of Most Trustworthy Companies in America. And we also appeared in the first Newsweek Excellence 1000 index, which identifies models of corporate responsibility across more than 25 industries.\n Finally, for the fourth consecutive year, we were named on the Forbes list of America's Best Midsize Employers. And this year, we are ranked first among all companies in the utility industry. This recognition demonstrates how our dedicated employees continue to be guided by the simple values of honesty, integrity and good moral character, the core values laid out by our Founding Chairman, Charles K. Vaughan. These values, combined with our employees' laser-focus on our vision to be the safest provider of natural gas services, continue to benefit our customers and the communities we serve.\n I will now turn the call over to Chris for his update. Sure can. Yes, it's a little hard to understand your question there, but I think [indiscernible], you're asking about the spreads on the pipeline. Obviously, at different times throughout the year, there will be maintenance on various other takeaway capacity. That's what we've seen over the last few weeks to months and anticipate several other pipelines to have additional maintenance, which is driving some negative spreads coming out of Waha, I believe, this morning.\n Today's cash [ prices ] were negative $2.30. Couple of pipelines have again announced further maintenance into this month, maybe into the following month as well, which will continue to show those wider spreads for the next few week period. And Chris mentioned those in his remarks as well. So we expect it to clear up later toward the summer period. Yes, as we normally do. What drives our CapEx is our safety and reliability investment. And again, Chris mentioned in his remarks that we had identified several projects before heading into the heating season that we would like to complete for reliability measures that are out there. And our team continues to evaluate safety projects that are out there or pipe programs across our various jurisdictions. We'll further identify those as we head toward our update near the October-November time frame on 2025."

All lines will be placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan Meziere, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nDan Meziere: Thank you, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us \u2013 for joining our fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Kevin Akers, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and conference call slide presentation, which we will reference in our prepared remarks, are available at atmosenergy.com under the Investor Relations tab. As we review these financial results and discuss future expectations, please keep in mind that some of our discussion might contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. Our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are outlined on Slide 26 and are more fully described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Akers, our President and CEO. Kevin?\nKevin Akers: Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. I want to begin today's call by thanking all 5,000 Atmos Energy employees for their exceptional effort and dedication to serving our customers under very challenging weather conditions recently. And thank you for all that you do for our customers and our communities every day. You are truly the heart and soul of Atmos Energy. Our first quarter results reflect that effort, dedication and focus as we continue modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems on our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2024 first quarter net income of $311 million or $2.08 per diluted share and our first fiscal quarter capital spending was $770 million to support continued system modernization and growth across our service territories. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, we added over 58,000 new customers with over 44,000 of those located here in Texas. And the Texas Workforce Commission reported in January that the seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over $14.1 million. Texas once again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, adding nearly 370,000 jobs in calendar 2023, representing a 2.7% annual growth rate. Additionally, we added 11 new industrial customers, which when fully operational, we anticipate consuming approximately 2.5 Bcf of gas annually, that is volumetrically equivalent to 45,000 residential customers. Commercial customer growth remained solid as well with over 1,000 commercial customers connecting to the system during the first quarter. This growing demand from all of our customer classes demonstrates the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development across our service territories. In APT, we completed several projects that will enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system and support the continued growth we are seeing in the local distribution companies behind APT system. During the quarter, we placed in service line PC which connected the southern end of APT system with a 42-inch Kinder Morgan Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. Our 22-mile 36-inch line PC supports the current demand and forecasted growth to the north of Austin in both Williamson and Travis Counties located in Texas as well as increases supply diversity in this service area. Additionally, we placed in service Phase 3 of our 4-phase 104-mile line S2 project. As a reminder, line S2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale place to the east side of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. This third phase replaced 22 miles a 14-inch and 20-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. The final phase of this project is scheduled to be completed by the end of this calendar year. And we completed the first phase of our Line WA Loop project, 24 miles of 36-inch pipeline. This multiphase project will fortify APT system that serves the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex by installing approximately 80 miles of 36-inch transmission pipeline. Our customer support associates and service technicians continued their exceptional customer service and once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from customers during the first quarter. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continued their outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers during the first quarter. Through those efforts, the team helped nearly 17,000 customers received over $5 million in funding assistance. As a reminder, during fiscal 2023, our energy assistance teams helped over 60,000 customers receive over $29 million of financial assistance to help with their monthly bill. Before I turn the call over to Chris, I want to comment on an incident that the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. The incident occurred at a Jackson, Mississippi residents on January 24 and resulted in one fatality. Atmos Energy is working with the National Transportation Safety Board and other federal and state regulators to help determine possible causes. We want to thank the first responders and emergency responders for their support and assistance. Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers have been and continue to be with the family. I will now turn the call over to Chris for his update.\nChris Forsythe: Thank you, Kevin, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. As Kevin mentioned, our fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings per share was $2.08, which represents an 8.9% increase over the $1.91 per share reported in the prior year quarter. Consolidated operating income increased to $399 million or 24% in the first quarter. This performance was driven by several factors. Rate increases in both of our operating segments totaled $84 million. Residential commercial customer growth, combined with higher industrial loads increased operating income by an additional $6 million. Consolidated O&M expense decreased $19 million, primarily driven by lower bad debt expense. In December, the Mississippi Public Service Commission modified how we recover uncollectible customer accounts. Previously, we have recovered these costs through a stable rate filing over a 12-month period. Effective April of 2022, we will now recur these costs for purchased gas cost mechanism over 24-month period, which will benefit our customers. As a result of this change, we reduced our bad debt expense by $14 million during the first quarter. Additionally, with this change, we now collect the bad debt portion of our uncollectible accounts through our purchased gas cost recovery mechanisms 88% of our customer base. O&M decreased an additional $5 million, primarily due to the timing of in-line inspection work at APT that we highlighted last fiscal year. Finally, operating income was favorably impacted by a legislative change in Texas to reduce property tax expenses. In the summer of 2023, the Texas legislature voted to allocate $18 million of the state's budget surplus to offset property taxes assessed on residential commercial property owners for calendar years 2023 and 2024. This legislation became effective during our first fiscal quarter after voters approved the legislation in November. In fiscal 2024, we expect this legislation will reduce our property tax expense by $20 million to $22 million. We recognize approximately $6 million of this impact during the first quarter. This reduction was not reflected in the fiscal 2024 earnings per share guidance we issued in November. We continued to execute our annual regulatory filing strategy. To date, we have implemented $167 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. This amount includes the $27 million associated with APT\u2019s general rate case that was approved in December. We currently have about $61 million in progress and plan to make additional filings this fiscal year seeking $340 million to $370 million in annualized operating income increase. During the quarter we completed over $1.1 billion of long-term debt and equity financing, highlighted by the $900 million long-term debt financing we completed in October 2023. Additionally, we settled $254 million in equity forward agreement. This financing provides the necessary funding for our operations, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and overall financial profile. Our equity capitalization as of December 31 was 60% and we did not have any short-term debt outstanding. We also had $3.2 billion in available liquidity. This amount includes approximately $433 million of net proceeds available under existing foreign sale agreements, which is expected to satisfy the remainder of our anticipated fiscal 2024 equity needs and a portion of our anticipated equity needs for fiscal 2025. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.1% and our weighted average maturity is approximately 18 years, with our next significant refinancing scheduled for June of 2027. And we continue to expect to have limited exposure to floating interest rates in fiscal 2024. Finally, we have $900 million in forward starting interest rate swaps in place to hedge portions or anticipated long-term debt issuances in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. As a reminder, the effective weighted average treasury rate of these swaps is 1.54%. In closing, we are off to a good start for the fiscal year. The execution of our operational, financial and regulatory plans by our employees positions us well to sustain our success. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 earnings per share to be in the range $6.45 and $6.65 per share, inclusive of the favorable impact of the property tax legislation changes in Texas. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Hope you\u2019re doing well.\nKevin Akers: Good morning, David.\nDavid Arcaro: Let\u2019s see. I might have missed the details here. Could you just elaborate a bit on that property tax impact and the change? What EPS impact does that have for the full year this year? And did you say it\u2019s not currently embedded in the EPS guidance?\nChris Forsythe: Yes. The property tax impact for the full fiscal year is expected to be between $20 million and $22 million pre-tax after taking into consideration the properties \u2013 the expected tax rates we put in our investor deck and the range of the share weighted average shares we have out there, we\u2019re anticipating that impact between \u2013 to be between $0.09 and $0.11. And currently that is reflected in our current guidance. It was not reflected in our guidance previously.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, got it. Understood. Thanks for that color. Let\u2019s see. Wanted to get your color on growth in customer additions. It sounds like you\u2019ve continued to see strong customer additions in the quarter. I guess, what are your expectations for that continuing, just given what you\u2019re seeing in building activities and the economic backdrop in your service territories?\nKevin Akers: Yes. In our conversations with our builders and developers, obviously we\u2019re still in the winter period, so connections on existing housing will continue through this period, but would anticipate that activity picking back up as you head into spring and construction picking back up. But again, if you look at some of the studies that have been out there for quite a while, we\u2019ve referenced on other calls, one in particular, there\u2019s an anticipated 1 million additional people projected to come to the Metroplex by 2028. So we think that\u2019ll definitely impact housing, which is already low on an existing home sale on the current market basis. I think the inventory right now is currently around two months or so. We\u2019re told they like to keep that somewhere north of about four to five months worth of inventory, so we could see the builders again trying to meet that demand, picking things back up in the spring as we head into that construction season. And again, we continue to see good diversified growth across the territory, particularly on the industrial side, with those 11 that we added this previous quarter, coming from fertilizer industry, vegetable oils, concrete, asphalt plants, a good mixture of a lot of things across all eight states.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. That\u2019s helpful color. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one more for me. I was wondering what your expectations are ahead of just a couple of the general rate cases you have later this year West Texas and MidTex. Just curious if there are any major things that you need to address, maybe out of the ordinary in those rate cases that would cause it to be a big ask or more contentious than usual?\nChris Forsythe: No, there\u2019s nothing contentious or unusual. And as a reminder, these general rate cases are being filed because those jurisdictions are under our grit mechanism. Here in Texas, we have five consecutive filings that we have to make before we going back in to basically refresh and reset equity capitalization ROEs and the like. So we expect these to be fairly down the middle type of filings with nothing out of the ordinary unusual, and we\u2019re planning to make those filings sometime later this calendar year.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks so much.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Well done here. Look, just to follow-up on the first question. With respect to the tax change here, I mean, just are there other offsets? Do you think about this as being an opportunity to accelerate some work that you might have been contemplating for future periods here? Or is this kind of \u2013 really kind of expected to drop to the bottom line, if you will?\nChris Forsythe: Yes, that\u2019s a good question, Julien. I mean, at this point, we\u2019re sitting here in the middle of the winter heating season, which we\u2019re beginning to think about what we look like going into the summer months in terms of compliance work and other activities that\u2019s still all under evaluation right now. And we\u2019ll have a better update for you in May.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Okay. Yes, fair enough. I get it. You\u2019re not quite in the prime season. You got latitude here, curious to see what happens. To that end, though, if we can just \u2013 I know we\u2019ve talked about the O&M backdrop a few different times since we\u2019re talking about here. What are you seeing in terms of just as you plan ahead on this front, just being able to hold the line on the variety of different new customer costs and other factors that have driven up the inflationary bucket of late. I know that this inflation conversation is impacting over your peers. How are you thinking about that today here, especially within that range?\nKevin Akers: Yes, Julien, I mean, again, we stand by what we have out there in our deck and what we\u2019ve talked about before in our 3% to 3.5% range that\u2019s out there. Obviously, we have folks out on the system ensuring reliability this past winter storm with Heather, which I think we did an exceptional job of continuing to serve our customers out there in that historic winter storm. So we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities, whether those are hydrostatic tests on APT, compliance work across the system. So at this point, we\u2019re still comfortable with the range we have out there and where we set the first quarter into the fiscal year.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. All right. Well, guys, and just one quick follow-up here, if I can, since you mentioned, we\u2019re still here in the sort of winter season. Obviously we saw winter dynamics play themselves out in recent weeks across some of your \u2013 a good chunk of your service territory. Any considerations about how your system performed and/or commentary about how that positions you? Again, I get that a lot of this is ultimately just servicing your customers here and flow throughs, numerous set of riders across your jurisdictions. But any commentary about the experience in recent weeks, obviously in sharp contrast to some prior years here. \nKevin Akers: Yes, as I said at our opening, very proud of all 5000 Atmos Energy employees. I think we did an exceptional job with this winter storm. The severity that it came in, I think depending on where you want to look at for heating degree day data, it was some 78% colder than normal in some locations, 200% colder than last year. So again, this takes a sustained period of investment in infrastructure improvement across your system. Obviously we did a lot of projects from last year, but we've been at this now for over 12 years. Improving our infrastructure, that's what allows us to be able to serve during these historic periods when they come in. You just can't do that overnight. I think our team's done a good job of identifying opportunities throughout the years and executing on those projects, but also very proud of our product. Look, for that week, I think we set a record across the country at a 174 Bcf of natural gas, with a peak of 72 Bcf for residential and commercial. So again, very proud of natural gas and what it does. And I think if you look at the energy output for that week, according to EIA, natural gas, petroleum and coal consumed 85% of the energy demand for that period. So very proud of what we continue to do as an industry.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Well, we'll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, good morning and thank you for the time today. I'd like to circle back on the property tax item one more time, if I could, just to be clear on that benefit. Is what you quantified the full amount of the benefit, or is that net of any reserves for return to customers? How are you thinking about that latter portion?\nChris Forsythe: Yes. That number is the benefit relative to our guidance for fiscal 2024. We don\u2019t have I mean, what will happen is for accounting purposes; we recognize the impact in this fiscal year. Over the next couple two and a half years, we'll return that benefit back to our customers through our various mechanisms here in Texas. So it's really a temporary timing difference, if you will, but it does impact our financial results for fiscal 2024. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll have an update on what we think that will impact us for the full fiscal year later this fiscal year \u2013 I guess primarily in our next call. \nRichard Sunderland: Okay, understood. Very helpful color there. Thank you. And then just turning to the Fort Worth incident, I was curious if you could talk a little bit about the site status. Just seen some media headlines around debris removal. Any current color there would be helpful. Also, who is currently investigating?\nKevin Akers: The site, I believe has been turned over according to the articles that we're seeing. The information that's been related to us back to the owners of it, I believe, and they're in charge of the removal at this point. And obviously you've seen our statements out there, our press release that our system has been tested and was not involved.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Thank you very much.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Your line is open.\nNick Campanella: Hey everyone, thanks for taking my question and sorry to ask about property taxes, but I just wanted to triple check what's the negative offset to that $0.09 to $0.11 property tax in the guide for 2024?\nChris Forsythe: Well, right now, Nick, as we talked about a couple of minutes ago, we're still in the middle of the winter heating season. We need to see how our margins hold up as we move into January, February, March. We still evaluating our O&M needs for the fiscal year. So we felt it was prudent to maintain the guidance in this range at this point and provide a more thorough update once we get through the winter heating season.\nNick Campanella: Hey, I really appreciate that. And then Chris, I know you said in your prepared remarks you're fully priced for 2024 equity needs. How much is remaining left to do for 2025 before you've kind of taken care of that fully?\nChris Forsythe: Yes, we still have ways to go on that for legal reasons, I can't say precisely how much it's been priced, but under the terms of the agreements that we have in place. But we will just continue to stay ahead of our equity needs through the ATM throughout this fiscal year in preparation for FY 2025.\nNick Campanella: Got it. And then just one last one for me. I know that the LDC M&A market continues to be active and there's potentially even processes going around in states that are either adjacent or in your current territories. I\u2019m just \u2013 can you just remind everyone what your kind of \u2013 your message is around M&A and your philosophy there? Thank you.\nKevin Akers: Sure. Be glad to. Again, we've talked about our growth on every call here for several years now. We continue to grow at close to 2% or above 2%, particularly in our Mid-Tex Division there. So we have that mechanism with good organic growth. You couple that with the rate construct that we have, where we start to earn on 90% of our investment in six months, 99% in 12 months. It's hard for us to see any sort of deal that could compete with the growth and regulatory construct that we have. So we're very proud of our systems, what we do, our relationships, our execution on that. So at this point we are continuing to focus on and remain dedicated to system modernization.\nNick Campanella: All right. Can't say I expected a different answer. So that's very much in line. Thank you so much. Have a great day.\nKevin Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Your line is open.\nRyan Levine: Hi, everybody.\nKevin Akers: Morning.\nRyan Levine: Is there any color you could share around what you're seeing in the legislative sessions and across your service territories? Is there any bills that are being proposed that you're watching closely or that could have an impact on your business or outlook?\nKevin Akers: All right. I think it's still very early in a session. Those just really kicked off in some of our jurisdictions. We'll continue to monitor those, but at this point we'll let them go about their required activity and duties and we'll continue to monitor.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then in terms of the pipelines or LDC network itself, are you seeing any jurisdictions that are looking to rerate some types that may be classified as transmission to distribution or anything along those lines?\nKevin Akers: No, we're not is the short answer to the question? Again, I believe those are all business decisions based upon the regulations at the federal level and the state level.\nRyan Levine: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriel Moreen with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nChris Jeffrey: Hi, this is Chris Jeffrey on for Gabe. Just one quick one on the O&M side. Just seemed like there was a change in the bad debt expense treatment that came through on the quarter. Wondering, is that all kind of realized now? Or will that continue to flow through future periods? And was that contemplated in the original guide?\nChris Forsythe: Yes, so the \u2013 I\u2019m sorry property [ph] tax, too many questions are property tax on the bad debt expense that $14 million or so that we referenced, that was basically the impact for this fiscal year. We had hoped that that would come through. So that was basically reflecting in our guide. \nChris Jeffrey: Great. Thanks. That's it for me.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Dan Meziere for closing remarks.\nDan Meziere: We appreciate your interest in Atmos Energy. And again, thank you for joining us. A recording of this call is available for replay on our website through March 31. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.

I want to begin today's call by thanking all 5,000 Atmos Energy employees for their exceptional effort and dedication to serving our customers under very challenging weather conditions recently. And thank you for all that you do for our customers and our communities every day. You are truly the heart and soul of Atmos Energy. Our first quarter results reflect that effort, dedication and focus as we continue modernizing our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage systems on our journey to be the safest provider of natural gas services. Yesterday, we reported fiscal 2024 first quarter net income of $311 million or $2.08 per diluted share and our first fiscal quarter capital spending was $770 million to support continued system modernization and growth across our service territories. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, we added over 58,000 new customers with over 44,000 of those located here in Texas. And the Texas Workforce Commission reported in January that the seasonally adjusted number of employees reached a new record high at over $14.1 million. Texas once again added jobs at a faster rate than the nation over the last 12 months, adding nearly 370,000 jobs in calendar 2023, representing a 2.7% annual growth rate. Additionally, we added 11 new industrial customers, which when fully operational, we anticipate consuming approximately 2.5 Bcf of gas annually, that is volumetrically equivalent to 45,000 residential customers. Commercial customer growth remained solid as well with over 1,000 commercial customers connecting to the system during the first quarter. This growing demand from all of our customer classes demonstrates the value and vital role natural gas plays in economic development across our service territories. In APT, we completed several projects that will enhance the safety, reliability, versatility and supply diversification of our system and support the continued growth we are seeing in the local distribution companies behind APT system. During the quarter, we placed in service line PC which connected the southern end of APT system with a 42-inch Kinder Morgan Permian Highway line that runs from Waha to Katy. Our 22-mile 36-inch line PC supports the current demand and forecasted growth to the north of Austin in both Williamson and Travis Counties located in Texas as well as increases supply diversity in this service area. Additionally, we placed in service Phase 3 of our 4-phase 104-mile line S2 project. As a reminder, line S2 brings supply from the Haynesville and Cotton Valley shale place to the east side of the growing Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. This third phase replaced 22 miles a 14-inch and 20-inch pipeline with 36-inch pipeline. The final phase of this project is scheduled to be completed by the end of this calendar year. And we completed the first phase of our Line WA Loop project, 24 miles of 36-inch pipeline. This multiphase project will fortify APT system that serves the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex by installing approximately 80 miles of 36-inch transmission pipeline. Our customer support associates and service technicians continued their exceptional customer service and once again received a 98% satisfaction rating from customers during the first quarter. Our customer advocacy team and customer support agents continued their outreach efforts to energy assistance agencies and customers during the first quarter. Through those efforts, the team helped nearly 17,000 customers received over $5 million in funding assistance. As a reminder, during fiscal 2023, our energy assistance teams helped over 60,000 customers receive over $29 million of financial assistance to help with their monthly bill. Before I turn the call over to Chris, I want to comment on an incident that the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. The incident occurred at a Jackson, Mississippi residents on January 24 and resulted in one fatality. Atmos Energy is working with the National Transportation Safety Board and other federal and state regulators to help determine possible causes. We want to thank the first responders and emergency responders for their support and assistance. Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers have been and continue to be with the family. I will now turn the call over to Chris for his update. Good morning, David. Yes. In our conversations with our builders and developers, obviously we\u2019re still in the winter period, so connections on existing housing will continue through this period, but would anticipate that activity picking back up as you head into spring and construction picking back up. But again, if you look at some of the studies that have been out there for quite a while, we\u2019ve referenced on other calls, one in particular, there\u2019s an anticipated 1 million additional people projected to come to the Metroplex by 2028. So we think that\u2019ll definitely impact housing, which is already low on an existing home sale on the current market basis. I think the inventory right now is currently around two months or so. We\u2019re told they like to keep that somewhere north of about four to five months worth of inventory, so we could see the builders again trying to meet that demand, picking things back up in the spring as we head into that construction season. And again, we continue to see good diversified growth across the territory, particularly on the industrial side, with those 11 that we added this previous quarter, coming from fertilizer industry, vegetable oils, concrete, asphalt plants, a good mixture of a lot of things across all eight states. Thank you. Yes, Julien, I mean, again, we stand by what we have out there in our deck and what we\u2019ve talked about before in our 3% to 3.5% range that\u2019s out there. Obviously, we have folks out on the system ensuring reliability this past winter storm with Heather, which I think we did an exceptional job of continuing to serve our customers out there in that historic winter storm. So we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities, whether those are hydrostatic tests on APT, compliance work across the system. So at this point, we\u2019re still comfortable with the range we have out there and where we set the first quarter into the fiscal year. Yes, as I said at our opening, very proud of all 5000 Atmos Energy employees. I think we did an exceptional job with this winter storm. The severity that it came in, I think depending on where you want to look at for heating degree day data, it was some 78% colder than normal in some locations, 200% colder than last year. So again, this takes a sustained period of investment in infrastructure improvement across your system. Obviously we did a lot of projects from last year, but we've been at this now for over 12 years. Improving our infrastructure, that's what allows us to be able to serve during these historic periods when they come in. You just can't do that overnight. I think our team's done a good job of identifying opportunities throughout the years and executing on those projects, but also very proud of our product. Look, for that week, I think we set a record across the country at a 174 Bcf of natural gas, with a peak of 72 Bcf for residential and commercial. So again, very proud of natural gas and what it does. And I think if you look at the energy output for that week, according to EIA, natural gas, petroleum and coal consumed 85% of the energy demand for that period. So very proud of what we continue to do as an industry. Thank you. The site, I believe has been turned over according to the articles that we're seeing. The information that's been related to us back to the owners of it, I believe, and they're in charge of the removal at this point. And obviously you've seen our statements out there, our press release that our system has been tested and was not involved. Thank you. Sure. Be glad to. Again, we've talked about our growth on every call here for several years now. We continue to grow at close to 2% or above 2%, particularly in our Mid-Tex Division there. So we have that mechanism with good organic growth. You couple that with the rate construct that we have, where we start to earn on 90% of our investment in six months, 99% in 12 months. It's hard for us to see any sort of deal that could compete with the growth and regulatory construct that we have. So we're very proud of our systems, what we do, our relationships, our execution on that. So at this point we are continuing to focus on and remain dedicated to system modernization. Thank you. Morning. All right. I think it's still very early in a session. Those just really kicked off in some of our jurisdictions. We'll continue to monitor those, but at this point we'll let them go about their required activity and duties and we'll continue to monitor. No, we're not is the short answer to the question? Again, I believe those are all business decisions based upon the regulations at the federal level and the state level."

            "name": "Chris Forsythe",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. As Kevin mentioned, our fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings per share was $2.08, which represents an 8.9% increase over the $1.91 per share reported in the prior year quarter. Consolidated operating income increased to $399 million or 24% in the first quarter. This performance was driven by several factors. Rate increases in both of our operating segments totaled $84 million. Residential commercial customer growth, combined with higher industrial loads increased operating income by an additional $6 million. Consolidated O&M expense decreased $19 million, primarily driven by lower bad debt expense. In December, the Mississippi Public Service Commission modified how we recover uncollectible customer accounts. Previously, we have recovered these costs through a stable rate filing over a 12-month period. Effective April of 2022, we will now recur these costs for purchased gas cost mechanism over 24-month period, which will benefit our customers. As a result of this change, we reduced our bad debt expense by $14 million during the first quarter. Additionally, with this change, we now collect the bad debt portion of our uncollectible accounts through our purchased gas cost recovery mechanisms 88% of our customer base. O&M decreased an additional $5 million, primarily due to the timing of in-line inspection work at APT that we highlighted last fiscal year. Finally, operating income was favorably impacted by a legislative change in Texas to reduce property tax expenses. In the summer of 2023, the Texas legislature voted to allocate $18 million of the state's budget surplus to offset property taxes assessed on residential commercial property owners for calendar years 2023 and 2024. This legislation became effective during our first fiscal quarter after voters approved the legislation in November. In fiscal 2024, we expect this legislation will reduce our property tax expense by $20 million to $22 million. We recognize approximately $6 million of this impact during the first quarter. This reduction was not reflected in the fiscal 2024 earnings per share guidance we issued in November. We continued to execute our annual regulatory filing strategy. To date, we have implemented $167 million in annualized regulatory outcomes. This amount includes the $27 million associated with APT\u2019s general rate case that was approved in December. We currently have about $61 million in progress and plan to make additional filings this fiscal year seeking $340 million to $370 million in annualized operating income increase. During the quarter we completed over $1.1 billion of long-term debt and equity financing, highlighted by the $900 million long-term debt financing we completed in October 2023. Additionally, we settled $254 million in equity forward agreement. This financing provides the necessary funding for our operations, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and overall financial profile. Our equity capitalization as of December 31 was 60% and we did not have any short-term debt outstanding. We also had $3.2 billion in available liquidity. This amount includes approximately $433 million of net proceeds available under existing foreign sale agreements, which is expected to satisfy the remainder of our anticipated fiscal 2024 equity needs and a portion of our anticipated equity needs for fiscal 2025. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.1% and our weighted average maturity is approximately 18 years, with our next significant refinancing scheduled for June of 2027. And we continue to expect to have limited exposure to floating interest rates in fiscal 2024. Finally, we have $900 million in forward starting interest rate swaps in place to hedge portions or anticipated long-term debt issuances in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. As a reminder, the effective weighted average treasury rate of these swaps is 1.54%. In closing, we are off to a good start for the fiscal year. The execution of our operational, financial and regulatory plans by our employees positions us well to sustain our success. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 earnings per share to be in the range $6.45 and $6.65 per share, inclusive of the favorable impact of the property tax legislation changes in Texas. Thank you for your time this morning. I will now open the call up for questions. Yes. The property tax impact for the full fiscal year is expected to be between $20 million and $22 million pre-tax after taking into consideration the properties \u2013 the expected tax rates we put in our investor deck and the range of the share weighted average shares we have out there, we\u2019re anticipating that impact between \u2013 to be between $0.09 and $0.11. And currently that is reflected in our current guidance. It was not reflected in our guidance previously. No, there\u2019s nothing contentious or unusual. And as a reminder, these general rate cases are being filed because those jurisdictions are under our grit mechanism. Here in Texas, we have five consecutive filings that we have to make before we going back in to basically refresh and reset equity capitalization ROEs and the like. So we expect these to be fairly down the middle type of filings with nothing out of the ordinary unusual, and we\u2019re planning to make those filings sometime later this calendar year. Yes, that\u2019s a good question, Julien. I mean, at this point, we\u2019re sitting here in the middle of the winter heating season, which we\u2019re beginning to think about what we look like going into the summer months in terms of compliance work and other activities that\u2019s still all under evaluation right now. And we\u2019ll have a better update for you in May. Yes. That number is the benefit relative to our guidance for fiscal 2024. We don\u2019t have I mean, what will happen is for accounting purposes; we recognize the impact in this fiscal year. Over the next couple two and a half years, we'll return that benefit back to our customers through our various mechanisms here in Texas. So it's really a temporary timing difference, if you will, but it does impact our financial results for fiscal 2024. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll have an update on what we think that will impact us for the full fiscal year later this fiscal year \u2013 I guess primarily in our next call. Well, right now, Nick, as we talked about a couple of minutes ago, we're still in the middle of the winter heating season. We need to see how our margins hold up as we move into January, February, March. We still evaluating our O&M needs for the fiscal year. So we felt it was prudent to maintain the guidance in this range at this point and provide a more thorough update once we get through the winter heating season. Yes, we still have ways to go on that for legal reasons, I can't say precisely how much it's been priced, but under the terms of the agreements that we have in place. But we will just continue to stay ahead of our equity needs through the ATM throughout this fiscal year in preparation for FY 2025. Yes, so the \u2013 I\u2019m sorry property [ph] tax, too many questions are property tax on the bad debt expense that $14 million or so that we referenced, that was basically the impact for this fiscal year. We had hoped that that would come through. So that was basically reflecting in our guide."
