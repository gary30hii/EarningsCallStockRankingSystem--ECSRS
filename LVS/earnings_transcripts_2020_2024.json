At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs.\nDaniel Briggs: Thank you. Joining on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Also joining on the call are Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, Chief Operating Officer of Sands China. Before I turn the call over to Rob, please let me remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in these forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The last two weeks have been the most difficult in our company\u2019s history as we mourn the loss of our Founder, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon, as you know, was a visionary. He led the transformation of not one but three integrated resort markets, that being Las Vegas, Macao, and Singapore. He offered the MICE-based Integrated Resort model in Las Vegas. He pioneered the development of the Cotai Strip in Macao and reimagined the skyline of Singapore to the iconic Marina Bay Sands. His audacity to challenge the status quo transformed the entire market. In Las Vegas, Sheldon originated the convention-based Integrated Resort model when no one, and I mean no one, who believe in its viability or sustainability. Today, Las Vegas conventions are synonymous. In Macao community, it\u2019s not easy to forget how Sheldon\u2019s vision for Cotai defied the consensus thinking at that time. Every element of Venetian *Macao is questioned by the skeptics, and I mean every element. A 3,000 room all-suite hotel, when the overnight tours market almost didn\u2019t exist, existing hotel inventory was very limited. The Grand Canal Shoppes with over 300 retail stores in a market that had virtually no retail, a 15,000-seat arena and 1.2 million square foot convention center. He dreamt big but he also delivered, who * developed a critical mass of world-class integrated resorts at a record speed. Before others had * even dared to dream, he completed the Venetian Macao in 2007 and was the fifth year of our company\u2019s 20-year concession. His determination pushing forward diversification and investment in non-gaming in Macao, was unwavering and breathtaking to be part of. Our total investment account today exceeds US$15 billion. We know that Sheldon was a big believer of a strong, healthy, and cordial U.S.-China relationship. He believed it was to the benefit of both countries to maintain a bilateral relationship based on mutual respect. The company, the Board, and the family are absolutely committed to continuing Sheldon\u2019s efforts in this regard. Sheldon is irreplaceable as the visionary founder of our company of the unmatched portfolio of integrated resort assets, and the management team he assembled to operate and expand the business in the future remain here in place, ready to work. The DNA of the company that Sheldon founded will remain ever-present. The company with the full and wholehearted support of the Board and the family will continue to honor Sheldon\u2019s vision to protect and enhance his legacy. We look forward to the future and do so with a lot of confidence and optimism. While the pandemic continues to impact our business adversely, we have achieved positive EBITDA in both Macao and Singapore in the fourth quarter, and there\u2019s no doubt, in my mind, our business was down to pre-COVID levels in the future. In Macao, the Grand Suite Four Seasons is now open, and the first phase of Londoner Macao will officially open in February. We are very excited about the progressive unveiling of the Londoner Macao throughout the course of 2021. Sands China is well-positioned to capture a rebound in tourism when the pandemic finally does subside. We\u2019ve always believed there\u2019s no better market for our company to invest in than Macao. We will continue to invest in our resort product, nurture our local talent and, of course, support the local community, which we are grateful to. In Singapore, we remained very committed to long-term investment in Marina Bay Sands, including both the upgrading of our existing facilities and the expansion of that property. On a principal note, I\u2019ve spent more than two decades with Sheldon. And had both fun and pleasure of working for and with Sheldon. He was a great mentor, he was a great friend. And I guess what speaks volumes about his generosity and decency is reflected in the decision to continue to pay our team members, even after the pandemic dramatically impacted our business. He was adamant that team members continue to receive pay and health benefits, even while we\u2019re closing our buildings and it was abundantly clear that our business will be hampered for quite some time. In the days since he has passed, we received condolences from around the world from global leaders, elected officials, business partners, investors, customers and many of you joining us on the call today. We are touched by the outpouring of support, and we really appreciate that. I am honored to have been invited by the board with Las Vegas Sands and Sands China to become the Chairman and CEO of both companies. With the full support of the board and the family, I will work hard on upskilling team members, the management team to fulfill Sheldon\u2019s extraordinary vision. I am confident, as Sheldon was *in 1995 this company will go from strength to strength in the future. For one final thought before we turn to questions, I look forward to the day, we can say, yield dividends. Operator, * we are ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question, sir, we have Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Line is open.\nJoe Greff: Good afternoon, everybody. Before asking questions, I just I want to offer my condolences to all of you as well as the pair, man. Rob and Patrick, you were obviously particularly close. So it\u2019s a big loss and he truly was one of a kind. So my condolences.\nRob Goldstein: Thanks, Joe. We appreciate that. Thank you.\nJoe Greff: So my question and my follow-up, focus on Macao. And yeah, when we kind of look back at what\u2019s transpired with tourist investments from Mainland China into Macao, it\u2019s obviously been more slow \u2013 the progress has been more slow than maybe what all of us anticipated, though it has shown some progress. Other than the government having this intentional gradual easing of visas to obviously dealing with this little kind of thing called the global pandemic. Are there any other policy issues or things that are maybe weighing in on visitation other than just simplistically visas are kind of being granted in conjunction with infection rates and vaccination rates and the like? And when you talk to folks in China, what specifically are folks looking at or metrics and improving metrics to sort of see a further easing of tourist visas?\nRob Goldstein: We\u2019re fortunate to have both Wilfred and Grant on the call. I\u2019m going to ask them to address that question, Joe. Gentlemen?\nWilfred Wong: Yes. Grant, you want to talk first?\nRob Goldstein: Yes. Why don\u2019t you guys take it? Yes, Grant and Wilfred.\nGrant Chum: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Yes. I mean, Joe, I think following the resumption of the visa issuance from late September, the business volumes clearly did rebound during the fourth quarter. And the recovery was led primarily by premium mass and luxury retail. I think both segments actually did show good momentum throughout the quarter. So in December, we had a very encouraging month, especially the holiday season. We reached over 50% hotel occupancy during the month. And there were \u2013 the peak days, we were achieving 8,500, 9,000 room nights, which obviously we haven\u2019t done anywhere close to that since January. And if you look at the pace of recovery in retail, the luxury retail sales really took off during the quarter. And by December, Four Seasons\u2019 retail mall was up 16% over the prior year. Actually, we had the best ever month that we ever had in Four Seasons mall tenant sales. So that\u2019s pre and post-pandemic, a record month. So an issue here is what you referenced. There is just not sufficient visitation to power all segments of the business and to replace the volumes that we lost. So the base mass remains very subdued. Macao only had 20% of the prior year\u2019s visitations during the fourth quarter. So really, there\u2019s not a lot you can do about that. It\u2019s not a policy issue in the sense of they can do something now that they would not otherwise be doing in light of having to prioritize the control of the pandemic. And obviously, the authorities have done an excellent job in that regard. So what you have to remember is that during the fourth quarter, they had a number of many outbreaks, local cases in different provinces and cities in China. And in October, November, they were relatively muted, and even for the first half of [indiscernible] so the number of zones or districts that were classified as medium to high risk from a COVID perspective was relatively few. But from about, let\u2019s say, third week of December, the domestic cases started to rise in Northern China. And what we saw was that a lot more districts, a lot more zones and sometimes the whole cities were classified as medium to high risk, which immediately, obviously, puts a break on visitation from those affected zones or cities, but also the overall narrative and travel advisories related to COVID becomes, obviously, a lot more cautious, and that impacts forward bookings. So from about mid of December, where up to that point, we were getting very positive momentum in terms of forward bookings in January and obviously, into Chinese New Year. Obviously, things have started to moderate from a forward booking and the pace of new bookings and obviously, the increase in cancellations. So that is directly related to the trending of the pandemic and some of these isolated outbreaks that we\u2019ve seen, particularly in the Northern provinces. So with that in mind, it\u2019s not easy to see a relaxation of the current guidelines in terms of travel.\nJoe Greff: That\u2019s helpful. And then I have a follow-up, just, I guess, more on \u2013 so it may continue, this idea of Macao policy, and maybe this is a question for Wilfred or anybody on the call can answer. But do you think either Macao or the Central Government in Beijing want Mainland Chinese companies getting involved? With Macao casinos, either by existing states or having board representation, is this something that\u2019s a priority for the government? So important? Have there been discussions? I kind of remember hearing something along these lines maybe a couple of years ago as this potentially happening on the ground in Macao a couple of years ago, but we\u2019re getting more questions and commentary on that of late. So anything you can shed on that would be interesting. Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: Wilfred, Grant, or Patrick, you want to jump on that?\nWilfred Wong: Yes. I think the \u2013 obviously, we have not been told of anything at this stage. Consideration is now being given to what the conditions should be for the new concession. We have not picked up any nor have we been consulted on whether there should be the participation of Chinese companies. Now, but we have to bear in mind that Chinese companies are likely \u2013 I mean, real Chinese companies are likely to take part in gambling, which in China is considered not legal. So there were, in the past, some suggestions of people saying, state-owned enterprises might come in. I don\u2019t think this really in line for their policy consideration. Whether private Chinese companies would be allowed to participate in Macao, and under what circumstances, these are things that have not been brought to us at all. So the only thing I can say at this stage is that we will continue to do our best in Macao and show that we are a locally rooted company because we are listed on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, so we are just the same as any Hong Kong company and that we do everything, even better than other competitors.\nRob Goldstein: Joe, can I just jump on Wilfred\u2019s very, very thoughtful comments. We\u2019ve been going to Beijing for around 20 years in Macao, and having endless meetings. I know there\u2019s an outsized belief by some people who write these things, and they constantly opine their thoughts on how equity should be sold to Chinese companies, and they\u2019re jumping up and down. I\u2019ve never ever had a conversation with one person who mattered whoever said that to me or even made that comment, in fact, if anything, they kind of chuckle because to Wilfred\u2019s comment, there\u2019s not a big appetite to invest in gambling. So I know it\u2019s very prevalent in the market. I hear quite a bit. I know that somebody wrote to me recently about how we could guarantee our licensure if we sell x percent. It all sounded very good, but one thing no one\u2019s ever said that, the government to us. Never heard that from anybody actually understands how Macao and Beijing operate. In fact, I think what we do here, it is a complete affirmation of what Sheldon has always done, which is invest heavily, invest heavily in non-gaming activities, believe in Macao, support your employees, and think they can grow. That\u2019s been the exact direction for at least the last five years. And before that, we heard more from Macao officials. We\u2019ve never heard them say, hey, you got to sell stake the Chinese people or we\u2019ve heard please support your employees, Sheldon do that to achieve. We paid everybody through the pandemic. It costs a lot of money. We did it. Invest in the cap. I think Sheldon, we\u2019ve covered that already, $15 billion, invest in non-gaming. That\u2019s always been a direction. But not onetime, from no one I\u2019ve ever heard, oh, you\u2019re a cyclone. I want to hear that from these people who write these columns or have a belief that they understand the thinking over there. I did once knew a very, very good person, a very important guy in the Chinese world, a businessman. And I suggest, so he started laughing, he said no one is going to buy into a Chinese gambling company whether it\u2019s Macao or Las Vegas because that\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to do. We found it kind of humorous actually. So I know that\u2019s a common prevailing thought. But we don\u2019t hear it.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Next question, we have Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question, and I echo Joe\u2019s sentiments about the recent loss.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you for your kind words to us. We appreciate what you said. It was very kind and thoughtful. Really appreciate it.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thank you, Rob. If I could, just very simplistically. To the best of your understanding, how should we expect the concession renewal process to actually get moving? What do you guys foresee at the time line to when potentially, we could start to see some announcements as to the process and the time line for the process and et cetera? Just in its simplest form.\nRob Goldstein: I\u2019m going to turn back to the fellows in Macao. I think they\u2019re best suited to answer your query. Wilfred, Grant, help us.\nWilfred Wong: Yes. We are as eagerly waiting for the government\u2019s direction. Because, as you all know, we only have about 17 months left before the concession expires. And we only know that the government is adopting a process, which includes public consultation on the performance of the concession is and the targets of achieving diversification, that amendments to the legislation have to be introduced into the legislative council, and then the bidding process begins. So it\u2019s a very tight timetable that we are running against. We also know that there is a legislative council election scheduled for September this year. So all these are coming into play, and we are coming up against a very tight timetable. We don\u2019t know whether this will begin very soon because right now, the government is all involved in the fight against the pandemic. As we all know, Macao cannot afford a single case because it was a public announcement by the government that if there is even one case, Macao would be locked down again. So the government is putting all their energy into the fight against the pandemic to ensure that visitors can continue to come. So we don\u2019t know. The short answer is we don\u2019t know. And when asked about this publicly, the Chief Executive said that anything is possible. I think he was asked whether there could be an extension or how soon can this be done. And his response was, anything is possible.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Obviously, last quarter, you guys talked a little bit about the Las Vegas asset, potentially being open to entertain offers to that asset. Rob or Patrick, does that influence potentially the timing of the return of the dividend? Or do you think more about the dividend from the lens of when Macao is back and Marina Bay Sands is back, doing what they do, you\u2019ll be able to kind of reinstitute that?\nPatrick Dumont: Hi. It\u2019s Patrick. So a couple of things. We have a very positive view in Las Vegas. I think long term, it\u2019s irreplaceable in terms of a tourist destination. A huge amount of investment going into Las Vegas. We think there\u2019s a huge amount of potential pent-up demand just looking at other markets when there\u2019s been a return. And really, the restriction in Las Vegas now are based on the capacity constraints set by the government. On weekends, we\u2019re actually doing quite well. There are days where we\u2019re actually almost at 2019 slot levels. It\u2019s really an interesting thing to see, and I think we\u2019re very positive on Vegas outlook just generally. That being said, if there is a completion of the sale process, it\u2019s independent of the dividend. I think the key thing for us is that we need to see a return to operations. We\u2019ve had this discussion before on prior calls. We need to understand what the cash flow trajectory of the business is, the growth in that cash flow trajectory. You\u2019ve heard Grant mention the completion of some of the Londoner milestones. That\u2019s a phenomenal product, and we believe it will be very cash flow generative in the quarters and years to come as it addresses our most profitable and powerful segment in Macao. So the way we\u2019ll look at the dividend is to evaluate our cash flow trajectory and the profile of the business and then make an assessment about how to restart it and sort of what the trajectory of that dividend would look like. But we\u2019re very focused on the return of capital. We think it\u2019s been fundamental to our shareholder return story. We think we have a growth component in our key markets. We have a growth component and new growth opportunities and new developments. And I think as part of that, we look very heavily toward the dividend as our cornerstone and, of course, the share repurchases as well. So we\u2019re very focused, getting on the other side of the pandemic. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see some positive in the upcoming quarters. We have some green shoots in Macao. We have some positive results in Singapore and some positive results in Las Vegas here. And so I think over time, we\u2019ll have better visibility into the trajectory of the business. And then we\u2019ll make an assessment of the timing and the size of the dividend.\nRob Goldstein: Carlos, I just want to follow-up with Patrick. There\u2019s one other issue with that. And that is the return of Las Vegas. There\u2019s been recent commentary, it\u2019s been fun to read about how Las Vegas will never return to pre-pandemic levels. The best days are behind it. I\u2019ve heard all of this before over the last 20, 30 years, about this town is right now on the back foot. There\u2019s no question about it struggling. But you can\u2019t help but think, there\u2019s this thing that is the vaccine or whatever it\u2019s going to take to fix this problem someday. Again, I want to reensure that we believe Las Vegas has plenty of gas in the tank. Our demand for 2022 through 2027 convention is unbelievable. Our customers want to come, and we remain very bullish on the return of Las Vegas. It may take longer than we want it to. It may take till the end of this year, as we see a visitation spike. But please don\u2019t be among those people who have these ideas that this pandemic would put a hole in Las Vegas. And just the opposite, the demand will be there. This is a unique town. We\u2019re going to have all the digital products out there you want. People want the visitation, and this town has a lot to offer. So we remain very bullish on the return post-pandemic.\nCarlo Santarelli: Yeah. For sure, Rob and thank you for that. And I understand that a lot of us on the call are looking forward to making our next trip out there. I know I am. So thank you guys very much.\nRob Goldstein: You\u2019re going to, I believe. Looking forward to having you.\nOperator: Next question, we have Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nThomas Allen: Hey, and let me also send my condolence to you and the entire LVS and Adelson family. Mr. Adelson was a true visionary and his successes will never be forgotten, so\u2026\nRob Goldstein: Thank you. Thank you for your comments. Thanks.\nThomas Allen: So there have been a number of reports in the media over the past few weeks and months about you looking to support saying online gaming opportunities. Can you just discuss your strategy there in a bit more detail?\nRob Goldstein: Sure. We\u2019re looking at a few opportunities, a multitude of opportunities in both regional and the U.S. And yes, we\u2019ve looked at digital. And it\u2019s interesting, you can\u2019t deny the \u2013 what\u2019s happened in digital is quite a space. And we are exploring opportunities, looking at what might be out there. But with a caveat had, there\u2019s nothing to report today. There\u2019s nothing concrete. We\u2019re simply looking, learning, observing, and just \u2013 there\u2019s been some commentary that it\u2019s my suggestion. I want to assure you that Sheldon \u2013 this is another [indiscernible] Sheldon, who he was ethically, he understood digital, maybe too well before I did. And he believed in it. He just simply had this outsized ethical concern about people who couldn\u2019t afford it or people that were too young to use it. And he wasn\u2019t a believer in the technology could stop that. He never questioned the viability of it. He questioned the ability to police it properly. And so the same way he paid people, hundreds of millions of dollars last year because he wanted to. It\u2019s an ethical consideration to Sheldon. So we\u2019ve had this discussion prior to his passing, and we are going to explore it. And again, the cab is we are in the making-money business. So there\u2019s a way to make money, it\u2019s intelligent and prudent. And again, Sheldon would be in the room saying, I\u2019m laser-focused on returns and growth. As you know, his middle name was G for growth. He would have loved the opportunity whether it be in the U.S. or abroad to build more things and that we\u2019re not leaving the U.S. We want to build it. We\u2019ve been all over the paper, looking at different markets. So yes, visuals in the multitude of considerations we are learning and observing and talking to people. We are nowhere near a decision on that, and we will keep you apprised if something changes.\nThomas Allen: Thanks, Rob. And then just talking about U.S. developments on the brick-and-mortar front there\u2019s been some chat about New York and Texas. What do you think the chances are of those States? And then how would you expect \u2013 how would you like to be positioned in those markets?\nRob Goldstein: Well, we\u2019ve been looking at New York for about 100 years it seems like. We\u2019re having some secret, we\u2019re big believers in New York. We think it\u2019s extraordinary, the density of population ethnicity, like, it\u2019s a very good opportunity for anybody and you can see, I think almost, it\u2019s close to $2 billion right now just in the facilities are there, without table games or decent rooms and probably product. A good product there will be extraordinary. So we\u2019re definitely in the hunt. We\u2019ve been pushing it for again for four or five years. We\u2019re excited by what came out of the New York group last week in terms of what they impart considering. There\u2019s not a fly out there. So we\u2019re keeping hunt and looking seriously at New York on a whole bunch of levels. And it\u2019s still a long way to go before we understand where they want to build and what they want to build, but we are going to be fitters. If it\u2019s real and it\u2019s done properly, we think the returns could be Sheldon like. Okay. So that\u2019s interesting. On Texas, obviously, extraordinary market, we\u2019re kicking the tires down there too. And another extraordinary market, you can\u2019t deny the power of Texas and the size and scale. And then I was there last week and it was a fascinating couple of days. And again, we\u2019re having conversations. We\u2019re looking to kicking the tires, and we will advise you when something emerges infects us. It would be a great casino market for land-based store, whatever it could be a huge opportunity. So these are opportunities that we \u2013 with our balance sheet and strength, we would jumped with both feet. It was the right structure.\nThomas Allen: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question, we have Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks very much, and just echoing everyone else\u2019s thoughts about how sad it is to have this call without Sheldon. And just a follow-up question related to the sale of the LVS assets the Vegas assets, I mean, not specifically to the dividend, but just kind of how much of a priority it is. Is it where you just kind of answering an incoming call? Or is it something where you see that there may be some strategic reason why you would sell those assets, I guess? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: So I think from our standpoint, we\u2019re very returns focused. So as Rob just mentioned, we\u2019re always looking at new opportunities and always looking at our portfolio to see how we maximize shareholder returns. And as an entrepreneurial company, we\u2019re always accurate. So I think we should just look at this as, if there\u2019s a way to maximize shareholder returns, we\u2019re going to do it. And we constantly look at the assets that we have in our portfolio. We look at new growth opportunities, as Rob just mentioned, and we talk about them. This is something that our team is very focused on. So that\u2019s really how we think about it.\nRobin Farley: I guess if I could push a little more and I guess, what kind of appetite did you sounds to me. You sort of publicly confirmed it, which maybe would invade some interest, what kind of appetite? And you mentioned being returns focused, but almost anything that you would be interested in New York or Texas or other places would be kind of project-specific financing, right? So it wouldn\u2019t necessarily \u2013 you don\u2019t need the capital to free up to sort of put in to use in any other markets. So I guess just trying to think about, what kind of \u2013 in this environment, what kind of appetite you think there maybe for the assets? Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: So I think there\u2019s a couple of different question there. So first off, I think the way we think about our portfolio is, we sort of evaluate projects on a case-by-case basis. So Las Vegas is a standalone entity. We\u2019ve operated it for a long time. We think it\u2019s a great asset. We think it has a great future. So obviously, we\u2019re focused operating at this point. I think in terms of \u2013 if we have additional capital to deploy. As you know, we have an expansion opportunity in Singapore that we\u2019re very focused on. And we think Singapore is just a very special market. It\u2019s privileged the fact that we\u2019re there. We love Singapore and think the future for Singapore is very strong, both as a leisure and business tourism market. And we\u2019re happy to have helped the government there. support its goals and continue to invest there. So we have capital that we get deployed there in the near term. I think in terms of other opportunities, you hear some of the things that Rob is talking about, we also have return of capital consideration. So for us capital allocation is front and center. We have these discussions with the management team and the Board all the time. So it\u2019s something where we\u2019ll look at our opportunities, look for a way to maximize shareholder returns. And we have assets where we think our returns are increased by transacting while transact, and otherwise we\u2019ll look to the sort of historical actions that we\u2019ve taken in order to enhance returns. In the near term, it\u2019s also helpful to have additional liquidity, right? So I think from our standpoint as the pandemic recovers, it\u2019s nice to have additional liquidity on the balance sheet, which is the reason why we\u2019re running the amount of liquidity that we have today, right? We want to make sure that we have the opportunity to do whatever we need to do during this unprecedented time. So I think from that standpoint, that\u2019s kind of how we think about things. I hope this answers your question.\nRob Goldstein: Robin, just to piggyback on Patrick Dumont\u2019s thought. And that is obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet whether we sell Las Vegas or not. But we also have, I believe the next couple of years, as you know 2019, we did about $5.5 billion [ph] EBITDA, I know these miserable years of 2020 and perhaps even 2021 make that seem like a distant memory, but lenient comes back and comes back strong. And also, I believe when Macau makes his decision, there\u2019s going to be a requirement to invest more in Macau, which as Sheldon himself, well, I can\u2019t wait to invest $5 billion, $10 billion. That\u2019s a very \u2013 in my opinion that when the Macanese government makes this decision, ideally contingent upon a rather substantial capital investment, which we know exactly what Sheldon is doing that with both hands. And that may be something else you think about it. There\u2019s just no place like Macau. I think Grant and Wilfred gave you sense of London in four seasons, I hope we can all visit and be there, that we would see, what that team has achieved. But we\u2019re not done in Macau. Leads can be there for many more years. And when all this gets to over, it goes away, probably later this year or next, whenever, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not going to predict because I\u2019ve been wrong before. It won\u2019t be wrong again because I won\u2019t make a bet. But I bet one thing will happen is that the Macau\u2019s government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in Macau. And we want to be there, be ready, Patrick referenced Singapore. I mean, these are not small investments. They\u2019re in the billions of dollars. So I think we have to be prepared for outsized investments in our best markets, which are Macao and Singapore for crazy growth. And then there are other possibilities in the U.S. to reference. So as strong as we are, we can get stronger in growth.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question, we have Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Thanks for the question and condolences to everyone on the line. My first question is on Singapore, as it continues to be remarkably resilient. What are you learning from the reaching of results about serving domestic crowd that might inform your renovation plans? And does this make you more confident, the potential ROI on these investments? Will that ultimately require a full recovery in China consumers?\nRob Goldstein: Well, firstly, as we serve, we found as Singapore is remarkably resilient. You\u2019re right. And the slot business there is actually not quite at pre-pandemic levels, it\u2019s getting closed. So we\u2019ve learned that there\u2019s a local market, but more important than the local market, frankly, are the outsized contributions of foreigners, who were residing during the pandemic or full-time in Singapore. We have a lot of strong players inside the country from wealthy people that want to gamble. And that\u2019s a very positive sign. You saw the numbers, if we can run. Even though it\u2019s not the $1.7 billion we used to be at, not going to $2 billion, $3 billion or $4 billion like to be at. It\u2019s still a run rate of the $0.5 billion plus dollars in the most dramatic times. All it does for me is reinforced us how being powerful on Singapore, how wonderful the asset and frankly, who wonderful the government is to work with there, in terms of \u2013 they\u2019re still willing to talk and work with us. And we\u2019re hoping to get actually know there in March to continue our discussion, how to get phase two going. But it reinforces the enormous size and scale of that market and to think about having no foreign visitation yet to make that kind of money and perhaps even more, it\u2019s very encouraging. On the flip side, it also makes you wonder how important the airlift is as an island. It\u2019s hampered by the fact, unlike Macao, which could open the doors up if the government so chosen to relax the visitation requirements. In Singapore, the government is eager to open the doors, but it necessitates airlift, which means counterparty trading with other governments and other airlines. So we don\u2019t see it coming back in the short term, I think it stays in this $150 million a quarter or so level. And so there\u2019s no real growth opportunity, I think, to see until this airlift issue is resolved. But it certainly makes us very much want to invest in Singapore. It\u2019s a great place to do business. It\u2019s a great market. Obviously, we need a return of all consumers, foreign consumers to enhance it. But do we want to invest money in Singapore, we sure do. We should get our product better. We have a lot of work to do in the building right now. We\u2019re actually embarking on an ambitious reinvestment program in the current asset to bring it up to a better standard. And then we want to build our second phase and similarly resolve everything. So we\u2019re \u2013 just like Macao, we\u2019re lucky to be there. And the idea we did \u2013 we can do $5-plus billion post-pandemic is pretty encouraging. It can be more. We think it can be a lot more. Yes.\nStephen Grambling: And maybe a follow-up on digital and i-gaming, and I realize it\u2019s still early, and you said you\u2019ve been studying the industry, but are there any initial thoughts on what you think the company can bring to the table different than the existing players?\nRob Goldstein: I have very strong thoughts about it, but I don\u2019t want to talk about them at this time. I want to keep working towards our goals, which is understand, it fully complete the conversation, and frankly, we\u2019re undertaking to really understand how to get there. It\u2019s a very interesting business, as you know. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of money, but it sure has great valuations. The question is, can we bring something to the table to make a lot of money. And we\u2019re working through it, and we\u2019re exploring. It\u2019s best I can tell you. We have something of concrete to say to you at a certain point. But right now, it\u2019s simply exploratory. In the same way, we explore a lot of things all the time. You saw in Thailand, I think someone came out about the possibility of an opportunity to either in Thailand, we\u2019re exploring that as well. So everything is up for grabs. I think when we look at our company the balance sheet enables us to have a very curious appetite to grow. And again, we\u2019re going to adhere to the founders, Gary Growth Adelson, and he believed in it, and we\u2019re certainly going to adhere to that. And I think you\u2019ll hear some things from us, hopefully, in the next 12 months that will make you believe in that idea.\nStephen Grambling: Sounds great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next question, we have Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I also want to offer my condolences to you, Rob, Patrick, to the whole Adelson and Las Vegas Sands families.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you. Appreciate, Shaun. Thank you very much.\nShaun Kelley: So I guess I\u2019d like to maybe turn back to Macao for a quick minute if we could. I think Grant\u2019s comments start off as a little sobering about sort of expectations of when we can start thinking about a recovery relative to kind of what\u2019s going on with the pandemic in China. And if we step back for a second, maybe it\u2019s a little harder for us over here, sometimes to monitor exactly the nuances of some of the vaccine developments, but one thing that\u2019s increasingly separating the U.S. recovery narrative from overseas is probably that to some degree? So I\u2019m wondering, if we could get a little bit of thought around maybe some of the vaccination programs and what the expectations are around that for maybe within Macao, broader thoughts on the local area there, possibly Hong Kong, and then how that could branch out to China in terms of \u2013 is that what we may need to really see a more concrete reopening for this entire market at this stage?\nRob Goldstein: Is the sobering Mr. Chum still awake?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Okay. Yes. I think, Shaun, firstly, we have to stand back and look at the domestic Chinese economy during the course of especially the second half of 2020. So it is different from the western economies, largely the domestic economy was recovering very strongly. So this is without, obviously, vaccination being applied to the whole population. And that\u2019s obviously attributable to the fantastic control of the pandemic. So as you look into the fourth quarter, you\u2019re getting the 6.5% GDP growth in domestic China without the vaccination. So that\u2019s a very, very strong outcome. And obviously, the consumer is getting stronger across the board. So I think we have to look at China in a slightly different way. The strategy is to continue to control to basically zero local cases. And whether that is achieved through vaccination, whether that is achieved through what they\u2019ve already been doing. Clearly, there is a path either way to clearing the locations and localities from the virus. And that will enable travel to resume more normally between Mainland China and Macao. So I think that\u2019s the first and most important point. In terms of the vaccine strategy, locally, you\u2019ve seen comments from the local governments of both SARs, both Hong Kong and Macao, both have a strategy to procure a number of different vaccines, actually three from three different providers. And both cities are looking to procure the first batch during the first quarter as we understand. So the local populations in the SARs will also be looking at a vaccination program in the months ahead. But really, the most important thing is still controlling the pandemic in terms of the local cases inside China itself. And if Macao then can be part of the domestic travel bubble, in a bigger way, in an easier way in a more fluid way than has been the case up to now, then obviously, the tourism and the consumption spend will come back very strongly. And there has been progress. I think obviously, it\u2019s from a low base, but there has been progress. There has been a gradual easing up of the logistics and getting used to some of the guidelines throughout the course of the fourth quarter. But again, the central point is as the worldwide pandemic got worse in the winter months, there are more imported cases that leads to more isolated outbreaks in some of the provinces in China. Then obviously, that puts pressure on restrictions again and the travel advisories that are issued by various different local governments and entities, especially prior to Chinese New Year, which is, as you know, a period of huge migration of the population in travel. So that obviously rightly gives some consideration from the perspective of authorities that we need to be very careful at this stage, which is very delicate. So again, another important point is as the pandemic \u2013 obviously if it subsides in the rest of the world as well, then that imported risk reduces, and that obviously relieves the pressure inside China as well, which hopefully is another factor that would lead to a normalization of the travel between Macao and Mainland China.\nShaun Kelley: That\u2019s helpful, Grant. And then maybe just as a further follow-up, this is probably maybe more for Wilfred, if he is still on. But last quarter, there was a little bit of commentary about the overseas gambling law. And I think we\u2019re approaching a little bit more or a closer kind of the point of probably both where we know more things about that law and also its implementation, which I believe is set from March 1. So just wondering, do we know anything more about that today than we knew before, any changes or additions to that that we should be aware of?\nWilfred Wong: Yes. Actually, the amendment to Article 303 of the criminal law has been enacted. It was enacted about two weeks ago. And as you appreciate this law, this amendment deals with people organizing gambling, running casinos, and particularly organizing citizens of China to go outside of the country to participate in gambling. Now there were \u2013 the inactive version made two changes of the previous draft. First, the definition of the criminal actor, which they tried to come up with a definition was removed. So they just used a catch-all phrase of whoever organizes. So this is to avoid people arguing who falls into the net. The second change appears to be a bit positive, but it\u2019s still ambiguous for Macao is that in the legislation, they specifically say outside of the country, which, as you all appreciate, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan is generally considered within the country. But then they leave an ambiguity thereby putting the word, offshore, inside the bracket after, outside the country. Now this introduces the ambiguity, and I was discussing this with both our lawyers in Beijing and the local NPC, National People\u2019s Congress, people attending the session. And they said that while the central people\u2019s government recognizes the special status of Macao, they do not want Macao to be exploited as a base for organizing such activities to take people outside of the country, such as the Southeast Asian countries. And as we all know, the Ministry of Tourism has compiled and is compiling a blacklist of countries to which they are known to be accommodating gambling from Chinese citizens. So to us, there is certain ambiguity, which will ultimately be decided by the authorities and the courts going forward. But at this stage, it is for sure that any person or a junket trying to use Macao as a base to organize gambling to other countries would be condemned.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you for that.\nOperator: For the last question, we have David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Hi. My condolences as well, and the best part of this job is always the truly extraordinary people we get to meet, and that he was certainly a treasure and fun for sure.\nRob Goldstein: That\u2019s so true. People \u2013 one thing I miss with Sheldon is his humor. Everyone talks about everything else but he was \u2013 he loved a laugh in a good time. And he just would sing and this guy\u2019s humor. So what\u2019s your question, David? Thank you for your comments.\nDavid Katz: Look, I think one of the slides in your deck, it suggests or implies that some of the rolling volume that\u2019s gone away has been recaptured within the mass is premium mass. Among all of the unknowables that you\u2019ve done your best to address, are you able to look into what you have in the premium mass and measure how much of that is a recapture of potential VIP dollars? And what is your best guess about, if you were sitting down to model one to four years out, how you would think about modeling VIP, just given where we sit today? And that\u2019s it. Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: Grant?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thanks for the question, David. I think structurally \u2013 and this is not to do with the pandemic. Structurally, we\u2019ve seen, obviously, the power and the growth of the premium mass over the last several years, and that trend is going to continue, whether it\u2019s pre-pandemic, during and after. And the reality of that is because the players, the customers, they want to deal directly with the owners or operators of these great assets. And obviously, the great lifestyle destination that would provide the multitude of amenities and the services that we\u2019re able to offer is very, very appealing. So I think that will continue. So your reference to, is there a transfer from one segment to another? I think structurally, there has been over the last several years anyway. And that\u2019s one of the brilliant things about Sheldon\u2019s Integrated Resort model is that we can offer everything from entertainment to the retail, to the food and beverage, to the spas, all of these non-gaming lifestyle amenities. So that trend is structural, and that\u2019s why we strategically invested in products that serve this segment. In terms of specifically, what\u2019s happening now, the situation is \u2013 you referenced, it\u2019s more related to issues specific to the system in the junket segment, and that has stabilized at low levels of volumes. And obviously, as a result of some of those issues, you may see that as new demand resurfaces and resumes in the coming years, that new demand is captured directly by the operators rather than through intermediaries. That also is true. But I think the overarching trend was there before anyway and would have continued in that manner. It\u2019s just that what\u2019s happened in the last 12 months may somewhat accelerate that trend. But it was going to be a big structural trend and driver for years to come anyway.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that\u2019s all the time that we have for today. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "Hi. It's Patrick. So a couple of things. We have a very positive view in Las Vegas. I think long term, it's irreplaceable in terms of a tourist destination. A huge amount of investment going into Las Vegas. We think there's a huge amount of potential pent-up demand just looking at other markets when there's been a return. And really, the restriction in Las Vegas now are based on the capacity constraints set by the government. On weekends, we're actually doing quite well. There are days where we're actually almost at 2019 slot levels. It's really an interesting thing to see, and I think we're very positive on Vegas outlook just generally. That being said, if there is a completion of the sale process, it's independent of the dividend. I think the key thing for us is that we need to see a return to operations. We've had this discussion before on prior calls. We need to understand what the cash flow trajectory of the business is, the growth in that cash flow trajectory. You've heard Grant mention the completion of some of the Londoner milestones. That's a phenomenal product, and we believe it will be very cash flow generative in the quarters and years to come as it addresses our most profitable and powerful segment in Macao. So the way we'll look at the dividend is to evaluate our cash flow trajectory and the profile of the business and then make an assessment about how to restart it and sort of what the trajectory of that dividend would look like. But we're very focused on the return of capital. We think it's been fundamental to our shareholder return story. We think we have a growth component in our key markets. We have a growth component and new growth opportunities and new developments. And I think as part of that, we look very heavily toward the dividend as our cornerstone and, of course, the share repurchases as well. So we're very focused, getting on the other side of the pandemic. Hopefully, we'll see some positive in the upcoming quarters. We have some green shoots in Macao. We have some positive results in Singapore and some positive results in Las Vegas here. And so I think over time, we'll have better visibility into the trajectory of the business. And then we'll make an assessment of the timing and the size of the dividend. So I think from our standpoint, we're very returns focused. So as Rob just mentioned, we're always looking at new opportunities and always looking at our portfolio to see how we maximize shareholder returns. And as an entrepreneurial company, we're always accurate. So I think we should just look at this as, if there's a way to maximize shareholder returns, we're going to do it. And we constantly look at the assets that we have in our portfolio. We look at new growth opportunities, as Rob just mentioned, and we talk about them. This is something that our team is very focused on. So that's really how we think about it. So I think there's a couple of different question there. So first off, I think the way we think about our portfolio is, we sort of evaluate projects on a case-by-case basis. So Las Vegas is a standalone entity. We've operated it for a long time. We think it's a great asset. We think it has a great future. So obviously, we're focused operating at this point. I think in terms of \u2013 if we have additional capital to deploy. As you know, we have an expansion opportunity in Singapore that we're very focused on. And we think Singapore is just a very special market. It's privileged the fact that we're there. We love Singapore and think the future for Singapore is very strong, both as a leisure and business tourism market. And we're happy to have helped the government there. support its goals and continue to invest there. So we have capital that we get deployed there in the near term. I think in terms of other opportunities, you hear some of the things that Rob is talking about, we also have return of capital consideration. So for us capital allocation is front and center. We have these discussions with the management team and the Board all the time. So it's something where we'll look at our opportunities, look for a way to maximize shareholder returns. And we have assets where we think our returns are increased by transacting while transact, and otherwise we'll look to the sort of historical actions that we've taken in order to enhance returns. In the near term, it's also helpful to have additional liquidity, right? So I think from our standpoint as the pandemic recovers, it's nice to have additional liquidity on the balance sheet, which is the reason why we're running the amount of liquidity that we have today, right? We want to make sure that we have the opportunity to do whatever we need to do during this unprecedented time. So I think from that standpoint, that's kind of how we think about things. I hope this answers your question."

            "name": "Rob Goldstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The last two weeks have been the most difficult in our company's history as we mourn the loss of our Founder, Sheldon Adelson. Sheldon, as you know, was a visionary. He led the transformation of not one but three integrated resort markets, that being Las Vegas, Macao, and Singapore. He offered the MICE-based Integrated Resort model in Las Vegas. He pioneered the development of the Cotai Strip in Macao and reimagined the skyline of Singapore to the iconic Marina Bay Sands. His audacity to challenge the status quo transformed the entire market. In Las Vegas, Sheldon originated the convention-based Integrated Resort model when no one, and I mean no one, who believe in its viability or sustainability. Today, Las Vegas conventions are synonymous. In Macao community, it's not easy to forget how Sheldon's vision for Cotai defied the consensus thinking at that time. Every element of Venetian *Macao is questioned by the skeptics, and I mean every element. A 3,000 room all-suite hotel, when the overnight tours market almost didn't exist, existing hotel inventory was very limited. The Grand Canal Shoppes with over 300 retail stores in a market that had virtually no retail, a 15,000-seat arena and 1.2 million square foot convention center. He dreamt big but he also delivered, who * developed a critical mass of world-class integrated resorts at a record speed. Before others had * even dared to dream, he completed the Venetian Macao in 2007 and was the fifth year of our company's 20-year concession. His determination pushing forward diversification and investment in non-gaming in Macao, was unwavering and breathtaking to be part of. Our total investment account today exceeds US$15 billion. We know that Sheldon was a big believer of a strong, healthy, and cordial U.S.-China relationship. He believed it was to the benefit of both countries to maintain a bilateral relationship based on mutual respect. The company, the Board, and the family are absolutely committed to continuing Sheldon's efforts in this regard. Sheldon is irreplaceable as the visionary founder of our company of the unmatched portfolio of integrated resort assets, and the management team he assembled to operate and expand the business in the future remain here in place, ready to work. The DNA of the company that Sheldon founded will remain ever-present. The company with the full and wholehearted support of the Board and the family will continue to honor Sheldon's vision to protect and enhance his legacy. We look forward to the future and do so with a lot of confidence and optimism. While the pandemic continues to impact our business adversely, we have achieved positive EBITDA in both Macao and Singapore in the fourth quarter, and there's no doubt, in my mind, our business was down to pre-COVID levels in the future. In Macao, the Grand Suite Four Seasons is now open, and the first phase of Londoner Macao will officially open in February. We are very excited about the progressive unveiling of the Londoner Macao throughout the course of 2021. Sands China is well-positioned to capture a rebound in tourism when the pandemic finally does subside. We've always believed there's no better market for our company to invest in than Macao. We will continue to invest in our resort product, nurture our local talent and, of course, support the local community, which we are grateful to. In Singapore, we remained very committed to long-term investment in Marina Bay Sands, including both the upgrading of our existing facilities and the expansion of that property. On a principal note, I've spent more than two decades with Sheldon. And had both fun and pleasure of working for and with Sheldon. He was a great mentor, he was a great friend. And I guess what speaks volumes about his generosity and decency is reflected in the decision to continue to pay our team members, even after the pandemic dramatically impacted our business. He was adamant that team members continue to receive pay and health benefits, even while we're closing our buildings and it was abundantly clear that our business will be hampered for quite some time. In the days since he has passed, we received condolences from around the world from global leaders, elected officials, business partners, investors, customers and many of you joining us on the call today. We are touched by the outpouring of support, and we really appreciate that. I am honored to have been invited by the board with Las Vegas Sands and Sands China to become the Chairman and CEO of both companies. With the full support of the board and the family, I will work hard on upskilling team members, the management team to fulfill Sheldon's extraordinary vision. I am confident, as Sheldon was *in 1995 this company will go from strength to strength in the future. For one final thought before we turn to questions, I look forward to the day, we can say, yield dividends. Operator, * we are ready for questions. Thanks, Joe. We appreciate that. Thank you. We're fortunate to have both Wilfred and Grant on the call. I'm going to ask them to address that question, Joe. Gentlemen? Yes. Why don't you guys take it? Yes, Grant and Wilfred. Wilfred, Grant, or Patrick, you want to jump on that? Joe, can I just jump on Wilfred's very, very thoughtful comments. We've been going to Beijing for around 20 years in Macao, and having endless meetings. I know there's an outsized belief by some people who write these things, and they constantly opine their thoughts on how equity should be sold to Chinese companies, and they're jumping up and down. I've never ever had a conversation with one person who mattered whoever said that to me or even made that comment, in fact, if anything, they kind of chuckle because to Wilfred's comment, there's not a big appetite to invest in gambling. So I know it's very prevalent in the market. I hear quite a bit. I know that somebody wrote to me recently about how we could guarantee our licensure if we sell x percent. It all sounded very good, but one thing no one's ever said that, the government to us. Never heard that from anybody actually understands how Macao and Beijing operate. In fact, I think what we do here, it is a complete affirmation of what Sheldon has always done, which is invest heavily, invest heavily in non-gaming activities, believe in Macao, support your employees, and think they can grow. That's been the exact direction for at least the last five years. And before that, we heard more from Macao officials. We've never heard them say, hey, you got to sell stake the Chinese people or we've heard please support your employees, Sheldon do that to achieve. We paid everybody through the pandemic. It costs a lot of money. We did it. Invest in the cap. I think Sheldon, we've covered that already, $15 billion, invest in non-gaming. That's always been a direction. But not onetime, from no one I've ever heard, oh, you're a cyclone. I want to hear that from these people who write these columns or have a belief that they understand the thinking over there. I did once knew a very, very good person, a very important guy in the Chinese world, a businessman. And I suggest, so he started laughing, he said no one is going to buy into a Chinese gambling company whether it's Macao or Las Vegas because that's not what we're going to do. We found it kind of humorous actually. So I know that's a common prevailing thought. But we don't hear it. Thank you for your kind words to us. We appreciate what you said. It was very kind and thoughtful. Really appreciate it. I'm going to turn back to the fellows in Macao. I think they're best suited to answer your query. Wilfred, Grant, help us. Carlos, I just want to follow-up with Patrick. There's one other issue with that. And that is the return of Las Vegas. There's been recent commentary, it's been fun to read about how Las Vegas will never return to pre-pandemic levels. The best days are behind it. I've heard all of this before over the last 20, 30 years, about this town is right now on the back foot. There's no question about it struggling. But you can't help but think, there's this thing that is the vaccine or whatever it's going to take to fix this problem someday. Again, I want to reensure that we believe Las Vegas has plenty of gas in the tank. Our demand for 2022 through 2027 convention is unbelievable. Our customers want to come, and we remain very bullish on the return of Las Vegas. It may take longer than we want it to. It may take till the end of this year, as we see a visitation spike. But please don't be among those people who have these ideas that this pandemic would put a hole in Las Vegas. And just the opposite, the demand will be there. This is a unique town. We're going to have all the digital products out there you want. People want the visitation, and this town has a lot to offer. So we remain very bullish on the return post-pandemic. You're going to, I believe. Looking forward to having you. Thank you. Thank you for your comments. Thanks. Sure. We're looking at a few opportunities, a multitude of opportunities in both regional and the U.S. And yes, we've looked at digital. And it's interesting, you can't deny the \u2013 what's happened in digital is quite a space. And we are exploring opportunities, looking at what might be out there. But with a caveat had, there's nothing to report today. There's nothing concrete. We're simply looking, learning, observing, and just \u2013 there's been some commentary that it's my suggestion. I want to assure you that Sheldon \u2013 this is another [indiscernible] Sheldon, who he was ethically, he understood digital, maybe too well before I did. And he believed in it. He just simply had this outsized ethical concern about people who couldn't afford it or people that were too young to use it. And he wasn't a believer in the technology could stop that. He never questioned the viability of it. He questioned the ability to police it properly. And so the same way he paid people, hundreds of millions of dollars last year because he wanted to. It's an ethical consideration to Sheldon. So we've had this discussion prior to his passing, and we are going to explore it. And again, the cab is we are in the making-money business. So there's a way to make money, it's intelligent and prudent. And again, Sheldon would be in the room saying, I'm laser-focused on returns and growth. As you know, his middle name was G for growth. He would have loved the opportunity whether it be in the U.S. or abroad to build more things and that we're not leaving the U.S. We want to build it. We've been all over the paper, looking at different markets. So yes, visuals in the multitude of considerations we are learning and observing and talking to people. We are nowhere near a decision on that, and we will keep you apprised if something changes. Well, we've been looking at New York for about 100 years it seems like. We're having some secret, we're big believers in New York. We think it's extraordinary, the density of population ethnicity, like, it's a very good opportunity for anybody and you can see, I think almost, it's close to $2 billion right now just in the facilities are there, without table games or decent rooms and probably product. A good product there will be extraordinary. So we're definitely in the hunt. We've been pushing it for again for four or five years. We're excited by what came out of the New York group last week in terms of what they impart considering. There's not a fly out there. So we're keeping hunt and looking seriously at New York on a whole bunch of levels. And it's still a long way to go before we understand where they want to build and what they want to build, but we are going to be fitters. If it's real and it's done properly, we think the returns could be Sheldon like. Okay. So that's interesting. On Texas, obviously, extraordinary market, we're kicking the tires down there too. And another extraordinary market, you can't deny the power of Texas and the size and scale. And then I was there last week and it was a fascinating couple of days. And again, we're having conversations. We're looking to kicking the tires, and we will advise you when something emerges infects us. It would be a great casino market for land-based store, whatever it could be a huge opportunity. So these are opportunities that we \u2013 with our balance sheet and strength, we would jumped with both feet. It was the right structure. Patrick? Robin, just to piggyback on Patrick Dumont's thought. And that is obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet whether we sell Las Vegas or not. But we also have, I believe the next couple of years, as you know 2019, we did about $5.5 billion [ph] EBITDA, I know these miserable years of 2020 and perhaps even 2021 make that seem like a distant memory, but lenient comes back and comes back strong. And also, I believe when Macau makes his decision, there's going to be a requirement to invest more in Macau, which as Sheldon himself, well, I can't wait to invest $5 billion, $10 billion. That's a very \u2013 in my opinion that when the Macanese government makes this decision, ideally contingent upon a rather substantial capital investment, which we know exactly what Sheldon is doing that with both hands. And that may be something else you think about it. There's just no place like Macau. I think Grant and Wilfred gave you sense of London in four seasons, I hope we can all visit and be there, that we would see, what that team has achieved. But we're not done in Macau. Leads can be there for many more years. And when all this gets to over, it goes away, probably later this year or next, whenever, I don't know, I'm not going to predict because I've been wrong before. It won't be wrong again because I won't make a bet. But I bet one thing will happen is that the Macau's government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in Macau. And we want to be there, be ready, Patrick referenced Singapore. I mean, these are not small investments. They're in the billions of dollars. So I think we have to be prepared for outsized investments in our best markets, which are Macao and Singapore for crazy growth. And then there are other possibilities in the U.S. to reference. So as strong as we are, we can get stronger in growth. Well, firstly, as we serve, we found as Singapore is remarkably resilient. You're right. And the slot business there is actually not quite at pre-pandemic levels, it's getting closed. So we've learned that there's a local market, but more important than the local market, frankly, are the outsized contributions of foreigners, who were residing during the pandemic or full-time in Singapore. We have a lot of strong players inside the country from wealthy people that want to gamble. And that's a very positive sign. You saw the numbers, if we can run. Even though it's not the $1.7 billion we used to be at, not going to $2 billion, $3 billion or $4 billion like to be at. It's still a run rate of the $0.5 billion plus dollars in the most dramatic times. All it does for me is reinforced us how being powerful on Singapore, how wonderful the asset and frankly, who wonderful the government is to work with there, in terms of \u2013 they're still willing to talk and work with us. And we're hoping to get actually know there in March to continue our discussion, how to get phase two going. But it reinforces the enormous size and scale of that market and to think about having no foreign visitation yet to make that kind of money and perhaps even more, it's very encouraging. On the flip side, it also makes you wonder how important the airlift is as an island. It's hampered by the fact, unlike Macao, which could open the doors up if the government so chosen to relax the visitation requirements. In Singapore, the government is eager to open the doors, but it necessitates airlift, which means counterparty trading with other governments and other airlines. So we don't see it coming back in the short term, I think it stays in this $150 million a quarter or so level. And so there's no real growth opportunity, I think, to see until this airlift issue is resolved. But it certainly makes us very much want to invest in Singapore. It's a great place to do business. It's a great market. Obviously, we need a return of all consumers, foreign consumers to enhance it. But do we want to invest money in Singapore, we sure do. We should get our product better. We have a lot of work to do in the building right now. We're actually embarking on an ambitious reinvestment program in the current asset to bring it up to a better standard. And then we want to build our second phase and similarly resolve everything. So we're \u2013 just like Macao, we're lucky to be there. And the idea we did \u2013 we can do $5-plus billion post-pandemic is pretty encouraging. It can be more. We think it can be a lot more. Yes. I have very strong thoughts about it, but I don't want to talk about them at this time. I want to keep working towards our goals, which is understand, it fully complete the conversation, and frankly, we're undertaking to really understand how to get there. It's a very interesting business, as you know. It doesn't make a lot of money, but it sure has great valuations. The question is, can we bring something to the table to make a lot of money. And we're working through it, and we're exploring. It's best I can tell you. We have something of concrete to say to you at a certain point. But right now, it's simply exploratory. In the same way, we explore a lot of things all the time. You saw in Thailand, I think someone came out about the possibility of an opportunity to either in Thailand, we're exploring that as well. So everything is up for grabs. I think when we look at our company the balance sheet enables us to have a very curious appetite to grow. And again, we're going to adhere to the founders, Gary Growth Adelson, and he believed in it, and we're certainly going to adhere to that. And I think you'll hear some things from us, hopefully, in the next 12 months that will make you believe in that idea. Thank you. Appreciate, Shaun. Thank you very much. Is the sobering Mr. Chum still awake? That's so true. People \u2013 one thing I miss with Sheldon is his humor. Everyone talks about everything else but he was \u2013 he loved a laugh in a good time. And he just would sing and this guy's humor. So what's your question, David? Thank you for your comments. Grant? Thank you, David."

            "name": "Wilfred Wong",
            "content": "Yes. Grant, you want to talk first? Yes. I think the \u2013 obviously, we have not been told of anything at this stage. Consideration is now being given to what the conditions should be for the new concession. We have not picked up any nor have we been consulted on whether there should be the participation of Chinese companies. Now, but we have to bear in mind that Chinese companies are likely \u2013 I mean, real Chinese companies are likely to take part in gambling, which in China is considered not legal. So there were, in the past, some suggestions of people saying, state-owned enterprises might come in. I don't think this really in line for their policy consideration. Whether private Chinese companies would be allowed to participate in Macao, and under what circumstances, these are things that have not been brought to us at all. So the only thing I can say at this stage is that we will continue to do our best in Macao and show that we are a locally rooted company because we are listed on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, so we are just the same as any Hong Kong company and that we do everything, even better than other competitors. Yes. We are as eagerly waiting for the government's direction. Because, as you all know, we only have about 17 months left before the concession expires. And we only know that the government is adopting a process, which includes public consultation on the performance of the concession is and the targets of achieving diversification, that amendments to the legislation have to be introduced into the legislative council, and then the bidding process begins. So it's a very tight timetable that we are running against. We also know that there is a legislative council election scheduled for September this year. So all these are coming into play, and we are coming up against a very tight timetable. We don't know whether this will begin very soon because right now, the government is all involved in the fight against the pandemic. As we all know, Macao cannot afford a single case because it was a public announcement by the government that if there is even one case, Macao would be locked down again. So the government is putting all their energy into the fight against the pandemic to ensure that visitors can continue to come. So we don't know. The short answer is we don't know. And when asked about this publicly, the Chief Executive said that anything is possible. I think he was asked whether there could be an extension or how soon can this be done. And his response was, anything is possible. Yes. Actually, the amendment to Article 303 of the criminal law has been enacted. It was enacted about two weeks ago. And as you appreciate this law, this amendment deals with people organizing gambling, running casinos, and particularly organizing citizens of China to go outside of the country to participate in gambling. Now there were \u2013 the inactive version made two changes of the previous draft. First, the definition of the criminal actor, which they tried to come up with a definition was removed. So they just used a catch-all phrase of whoever organizes. So this is to avoid people arguing who falls into the net. The second change appears to be a bit positive, but it's still ambiguous for Macao is that in the legislation, they specifically say outside of the country, which, as you all appreciate, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan is generally considered within the country. But then they leave an ambiguity thereby putting the word, offshore, inside the bracket after, outside the country. Now this introduces the ambiguity, and I was discussing this with both our lawyers in Beijing and the local NPC, National People's Congress, people attending the session. And they said that while the central people's government recognizes the special status of Macao, they do not want Macao to be exploited as a base for organizing such activities to take people outside of the country, such as the Southeast Asian countries. And as we all know, the Ministry of Tourism has compiled and is compiling a blacklist of countries to which they are known to be accommodating gambling from Chinese citizens. So to us, there is certain ambiguity, which will ultimately be decided by the authorities and the courts going forward. But at this stage, it is for sure that any person or a junket trying to use Macao as a base to organize gambling to other countries would be condemned."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Yes. I mean, Joe, I think following the resumption of the visa issuance from late September, the business volumes clearly did rebound during the fourth quarter. And the recovery was led primarily by premium mass and luxury retail. I think both segments actually did show good momentum throughout the quarter. So in December, we had a very encouraging month, especially the holiday season. We reached over 50% hotel occupancy during the month. And there were \u2013 the peak days, we were achieving 8,500, 9,000 room nights, which obviously we haven't done anywhere close to that since January. And if you look at the pace of recovery in retail, the luxury retail sales really took off during the quarter. And by December, Four Seasons' retail mall was up 16% over the prior year. Actually, we had the best ever month that we ever had in Four Seasons mall tenant sales. So that's pre and post-pandemic, a record month. So an issue here is what you referenced. There is just not sufficient visitation to power all segments of the business and to replace the volumes that we lost. So the base mass remains very subdued. Macao only had 20% of the prior year's visitations during the fourth quarter. So really, there's not a lot you can do about that. It's not a policy issue in the sense of they can do something now that they would not otherwise be doing in light of having to prioritize the control of the pandemic. And obviously, the authorities have done an excellent job in that regard. So what you have to remember is that during the fourth quarter, they had a number of many outbreaks, local cases in different provinces and cities in China. And in October, November, they were relatively muted, and even for the first half of [indiscernible] so the number of zones or districts that were classified as medium to high risk from a COVID perspective was relatively few. But from about, let's say, third week of December, the domestic cases started to rise in Northern China. And what we saw was that a lot more districts, a lot more zones and sometimes the whole cities were classified as medium to high risk, which immediately, obviously, puts a break on visitation from those affected zones or cities, but also the overall narrative and travel advisories related to COVID becomes, obviously, a lot more cautious, and that impacts forward bookings. So from about mid of December, where up to that point, we were getting very positive momentum in terms of forward bookings in January and obviously, into Chinese New Year. Obviously, things have started to moderate from a forward booking and the pace of new bookings and obviously, the increase in cancellations. So that is directly related to the trending of the pandemic and some of these isolated outbreaks that we've seen, particularly in the Northern provinces. So with that in mind, it's not easy to see a relaxation of the current guidelines in terms of travel. Yes. Okay. Yes. I think, Shaun, firstly, we have to stand back and look at the domestic Chinese economy during the course of especially the second half of 2020. So it is different from the western economies, largely the domestic economy was recovering very strongly. So this is without, obviously, vaccination being applied to the whole population. And that's obviously attributable to the fantastic control of the pandemic. So as you look into the fourth quarter, you're getting the 6.5% GDP growth in domestic China without the vaccination. So that's a very, very strong outcome. And obviously, the consumer is getting stronger across the board. So I think we have to look at China in a slightly different way. The strategy is to continue to control to basically zero local cases. And whether that is achieved through vaccination, whether that is achieved through what they've already been doing. Clearly, there is a path either way to clearing the locations and localities from the virus. And that will enable travel to resume more normally between Mainland China and Macao. So I think that's the first and most important point. In terms of the vaccine strategy, locally, you've seen comments from the local governments of both SARs, both Hong Kong and Macao, both have a strategy to procure a number of different vaccines, actually three from three different providers. And both cities are looking to procure the first batch during the first quarter as we understand. So the local populations in the SARs will also be looking at a vaccination program in the months ahead. But really, the most important thing is still controlling the pandemic in terms of the local cases inside China itself. And if Macao then can be part of the domestic travel bubble, in a bigger way, in an easier way in a more fluid way than has been the case up to now, then obviously, the tourism and the consumption spend will come back very strongly. And there has been progress. I think obviously, it's from a low base, but there has been progress. There has been a gradual easing up of the logistics and getting used to some of the guidelines throughout the course of the fourth quarter. But again, the central point is as the worldwide pandemic got worse in the winter months, there are more imported cases that leads to more isolated outbreaks in some of the provinces in China. Then obviously, that puts pressure on restrictions again and the travel advisories that are issued by various different local governments and entities, especially prior to Chinese New Year, which is, as you know, a period of huge migration of the population in travel. So that obviously rightly gives some consideration from the perspective of authorities that we need to be very careful at this stage, which is very delicate. So again, another important point is as the pandemic \u2013 obviously if it subsides in the rest of the world as well, then that imported risk reduces, and that obviously relieves the pressure inside China as well, which hopefully is another factor that would lead to a normalization of the travel between Macao and Mainland China. Yes. Thanks for the question, David. I think structurally \u2013 and this is not to do with the pandemic. Structurally, we've seen, obviously, the power and the growth of the premium mass over the last several years, and that trend is going to continue, whether it's pre-pandemic, during and after. And the reality of that is because the players, the customers, they want to deal directly with the owners or operators of these great assets. And obviously, the great lifestyle destination that would provide the multitude of amenities and the services that we're able to offer is very, very appealing. So I think that will continue. So your reference to, is there a transfer from one segment to another? I think structurally, there has been over the last several years anyway. And that's one of the brilliant things about Sheldon's Integrated Resort model is that we can offer everything from entertainment to the retail, to the food and beverage, to the spas, all of these non-gaming lifestyle amenities. So that trend is structural, and that's why we strategically invested in products that serve this segment. In terms of specifically, what's happening now, the situation is \u2013 you referenced, it's more related to issues specific to the system in the junket segment, and that has stabilized at low levels of volumes. And obviously, as a result of some of those issues, you may see that as new demand resurfaces and resumes in the coming years, that new demand is captured directly by the operators rather than through intermediaries. That also is true. But I think the overarching trend was there before anyway and would have continued in that manner. It's just that what's happened in the last 12 months may somewhat accelerate that trend. But it was going to be a big structural trend and driver for years to come anyway."

I hope that all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy. While the business volumes continue to be impacted by the pandemic, we are pleased to see improving operating results, especially in Asia. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands had a profitable quarter as operations progressively resumed across the resort during the summer. In Macao, operating losses reduced sequentially over the second quarter. The third quarter results, however, are not representative of our current business trajectory. As the resumption of visa issuance across all provinces in China only commenced toward the end of September, the initial stages of recovery since then have been very encouraging. During the October Golden Week, we saw meaningful recovery across the different segments of our Macao operations. Importantly, business volumes in the Premium Mass segment enjoyed the most significant resurges. This vital segment is central to our ongoing investment program in Macao and has been leading our revenue generation at this stage of the recovery. We expect the base mass market to recover as visitation to the market increases. Consistent with the recovery in premium mass and overall domestic China consumption trends, we also experienced strong recovery in our retail malls with the Luxury Retail segment enjoying the strongest performance. We continue to make excellent progress in our US$2.2 billion capital investment for the Londoner Macao and Four Seasons budgets. The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, the largest all-suite Four Seasons hotel in the world, is now complete, licensed and hosting customers in the Premium Mass segment. These gorgeous full-suites have been receiving great customer feedback since the Golden Week. We will be introducing a variety of additional world-class integrated resort products and amenities as we complete the Londoner in Macao and other capital projects. The Londoner will include two new all-suite hotels, more than a dozen new restaurants, additional retail and new MICE and entertainment facilities. Our unwavering commitment to significant ongoing investments in Macao enables us to play our part in supporting local employment and the local economy. It also ensures Macao will be even better positioned to recapture and, over time, increase its share of leisure and business tourism from China and the rest of Asia. I remain steadfast in my belief that Macao has the potential to become one of the greatest business and leisure tourism destinations in the world and the MICE capital of Asia. As I've said on many occasions, we would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of additional investment dollars and extend our contributions to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. Now turning to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We encouraged that MBS was profitable in the third quarter despite the absence of overseas tourists. We hope to see the initiation of reciprocal travel arrangements in the coming months as health concerns permit. We remain committed to pursuing long-term investment in Singapore and our expansion of Marina Bay Sands, although there would be likely delays in the timing of the expansion given the challenges created by the pandemic. In addition to the expansion, we will continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands to enhance the customer experience and the tourism appeal of the resort. In Las Vegas, we are pleased to report that the recovery is well under way. Weekend occupancies have been as high as 70%. Together with our state and local government leadership and the entire Las Vegas community, our team members are working diligently to prepare to safely host convention and group meeting customers from throughout the world, throughout the country and around the world. We look forward to once again welcoming these customers back to Las Vegas, which will always be the most important convention and group meeting market in the United States. As we have said in the past, increased airlift and the resumption of the convention and group meeting business are both critical components to achieving a full recovery in Las Vegas. Now moving to our balance sheet. Maintaining a strong balance sheet makes great business sense while we weather the storm caused by this pandemic. Our balance sheet strength enables us to continue to execute our capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore, which we believe will position the company to deliver industry-leading growth and profitability in the years ahead. We're as confident as ever in the strength of our business model and the eventual recovery in travel and tourism spending in our markets. So thanks again for joining us on the call today. Now we'll take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoseph Greff: Good morning, everybody. Sheldon, your comments about recent trends in Macao on the premium mass and the luxury retail side are certainly encouraging. I was hoping maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on what you've seen since Golden Week. And would you say at this point you're \u2013 if you're run rating at these levels and these levels continue that you would be at EBITDA breakeven levels in Macao?\nSheldon Adelson: That's what we're shooting for.\nJoseph Greff: But not currently there as of yet.\nSheldon Adelson: The trajectory is heading in the right direction.\nRobert Goldstein: Sheldon, I'd like to make some comments. Joe, it's Rob. How are you doing?\nJoseph Greff: Hey Rob.\nRobert Goldstein: Let's begin with that. To answer your question, let's just begin with the obvious. Our confidence in Macao being the world's greatest gaming market and its principal source of customers coming from China, we know, adapting in China from a growing economy perspective, a favorable position vis-\u00e0-vis the COVID. The renminbi is as strong as it's been in many years. And of course, the Chinese consumer is not traveling to foreign countries. We think this fact pattern from a macro perspective is very favorable for Macao. And as you know, Macao has been a $40 billion to $50 billion revenue market for the past number of years and year in, year out performs. The COVID IVS obstacles are real. And we believe as they start to lessen, we'll go back to marching toward our goal of $4 billion annually. Our new Four Seasons is now open. It's quite a product. The Londoner will complete from the interior perspective by December. So we've never been stronger from an asset perspective. But there's no question, while demand from Macao is there, and it's there, we have big confidence. The visa and the testing issues have proven to be challenging and does limit the access. Now we are hoping the government will loosen restrictions and access to Macao will continue to improve. The truth is, the way Macao and China has handled the virus is very \u2013 is in a very capable manner. And Macao will be the beneficiary of reduced travel to other markets with Chinese consumers not traveling outside of China. So it's a domestic travel bubble we hope to be included in, surely. I'd like Grant to opine and talk about. I asked Grant to join the call and Wilfred Wong to give you color from the ground since we haven't been there in many, many months. I think they can give you \u2013 Grant maybe could begin by talking about your questions about October about profitability trends, et cetera. So Grant, are you awake there, Grant, in Macao?\nGrant Chum: We're well awake, yes. Thank you, Rob. Yes. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Yes. I mean, October was the first time since January that we've seen significant real business volumes in patronage. And as Mr. A mentioned in his opening remarks, premium mass has been the strongest segment by far, and that is really across all of the different tiers of premium mass. The patrons returning first to Macao are the high-quality, high-frequency customers. I think that reflects the pent-up demand that these guests have, and these are the ones who are used to staying overnight in Macao. They are used to having multiple-night stays in Macao, enjoying the destination, and these are the first customers to come back, and that's natural. In terms of the question about where we are on the volumes and profitability, I mean, principally based on the premium mass recovery, October month to date, our Non-Rolling drop per day is just over $20 million. That's about 30% of last year's level. And at this level of Non-Rolling drop, we are able to achieve and we are achieving a slight positive EBITDA month to date based on current cost structure and the business mix. I think what's particularly encouraging, to Joe's question about what's happening, after Golden Week, we had the expected lull in the second week of October, but then we saw a very notable rebound in the third week. In fact, in the third week, we are actually still averaging around or just under $20 million drop per day as well. So as Mr. A said, we are well onto that trajectory, and we hope we can maintain that. I think in tandem with the premium mass recovery, we've seen a resurgence in the retail mall sales, and that's especially true in the Four Seasons, in the Luxury Retail segment. The retail recovery actually began in September and has continued into October. In fact, some of our \u2013 a number of our top first-line brands within the Four Seasons mall is actually up year-on-year in terms of the retail tenant sales in the first two weeks of October. And obviously, in conjunction with that, at the Four Seasons, we've just opened the Grand Suites for Four Seasons. And these suites have received exceptional [indiscernible]. I think this is exactly the right product for this Premium Mass segment structurally. But also at this point in time, I think these Chinese consumers are looking for higher quality, looking for the premium experiences and also, obviously, in this time, an increased amount of personal space. So we're very happy of how that product has come through and, in fact, is really one of our best-performing hotels, if not the best-performing hotels, in October. The question on the other segments, I think base mass certainly is relatively low in terms of traffic right now. As you know, the overall visitation in Macao remains relatively low. And as Rob referenced, there are, obviously, impediments. Some are real, some are perceived, some more to do with awareness in terms of the policies. But obviously, there are some real logistical challenges relating to the COVID testing, as well as the visa application. But as the awareness builds, as the word of mouth spreads, as some of these visa application processes are shortened and become more abbreviated, some of these logistical challenges will be overcome or mitigated and we're confident that the base mass will follow as visitation recovers. As for the VIP segment, obviously, that's been slower in terms of the recovery. That's expected. A lot of those issues are well documented. But we are also seeing a reasonable amount of play coming through in that segment in October as well. So I hope that gives you some color on the October month.\nJoseph Greff: That's great, Grant. I hope you're on the next bunch of earnings conference calls. Just a quick follow-up. How much of your volume do you think are coming from outside of Guangdong since Golden Week? Or is it primarily this month all Guangdong?\nGrant Chum: Actually, the vast majority of the volumes and the room bookings are from non-Guangdong, but that ratio is actually consistent with what we saw in the past. So this is not out of the ordinary. Majority of the volume comes from outside of Guangdong, and that was the case in October already. But your question is still well made in the sense that, in the first week of October, I mean, a lot of these customers from outside of Guangdong either didn't have time to get the visa or they didn't want to leave their planning to such a last-minute time frame. So they already made alternative plans. So the nationwide visa resumption only occurred or started in September 23. So that really was not sufficient time or window for a lot of the customers to feel that they could confidently get the visa before Golden Week before the office is shutdown again for the holidays. So in that sense, we should hopefully be seeing the non-Guangdong visitation improve as the awareness and the logistics challenges are met and some of these people have time to get the visa to come to Macao.\nJoseph Greff: Great. Thank you very much everybody.\nSheldon Adelson: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.\nFelicia Hendrix: Hi. Thank you so much. And Grant, if we could keep you on the hot seat here, I think we are all excited to hear from you. So just getting back to some of the items that you just mentioned. On the visitation side, are you seeing any changes per se in the rate of visa application approvals or even the methodology? I mean, have the kiosks been coming back? Or is it still an in-person kind of more manual process? And on the testing, is there any sense that this will be extended to 14 days? I know that there has been some talk about that.\nGrant Chum: Sure. I think when the Guangdong visas resumed, I think most of the offices were operating on the physical application process and not using the kiosks. As the rest of the country has reopened for these applications, we see a variety \u2013 it's not uniform because different provinces have different procedures, and they always have had. So there are some significant provinces and cities where you can get a same-day application. But most of the others, I would say, range from \u2013 the manual process takes anywhere between three working days to seven working days, but there are a number of them that have a shorter application period. And then, I think going forward, hopefully, obviously, this gets smoothed out. And I think this is just part of the initial \u2013 I think quite rightly the authorities are cautious, and I think that's the right thing to do in the face of the pandemic, that we don't necessarily want a huge surge of people into Macao in a short space of time at the beginning.\nFelicia Hendrix: And then, just on the testing, do you think they'll extend that to 14 days versus seven? I know that's been a bit of a gating factor?\nGrant Chum: That has been discussed in Macao, and we are waiting for further development on that front.\nFelicia Hendrix: Okay. And then, just as my follow-up, and this could be for anybody, but on the VIP side, I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing in terms of junket liquidity. I know it's not a big part of your business, but junket liquidity is important for the market as a whole. So I just wanted to know what your thoughts were there?\nSheldon Adelson: Grant, do you want to take that or?\nGrant Chum: Sure. I think some of the challenges in that segment are well documented. The segment has been slower to recover in this initial stage of the recovery. But at the same time, as you quite rightly referenced, it's not a significant part of our business, only 4% of our contribution in 2019. And in the meantime, we have, obviously, very strong performance in the premium end of premium mass both across gaming and retail.\nFelicia Hendrix: I was just wondering if you thought that maybe some of your premium mass might be benefiting from folks moving segments as it was before COVID, but maybe seeing that more accelerated now.\nGrant Chum: I think it's too short a time period to ascertain that.\nFelicia Hendrix: Okay. Sorry Rob.\nRobert Goldstein: I think one is \u2013 maybe to point out to what Grant was saying, was I think the nice thing \u2013 it may not be important to our overall business but in terms of the synergies. But clearly, it is important to liquidity to marketplace. And I think what's nice to see is that the first segment out-of-box to recover has been premium mass. So there's speculation that it may be band-aided by liquidity issues. And what we're seeing in retail, I think Grant mentioned the strength of the retail premium; I was talking to our retail team this morning. It's hard to imagine that in this environment, our top six net new retailers \u2013 I won't name any names \u2013 and you imagine the French and Italian luxury brands are up year-on-year in total sales, which is kind of astounding. It shows the strength and liquidity of that premium mass segment, and it reflects both the gaming and the retail appetite. I think it's very exciting to realize that that segment is back, and that speaks to our Four Seasons and our Londoner. But also, when the day comes when they do lessen the restrictions and make it more accessible to base mass, you've got the two most important segments delivering. I think it's nice to see the current situation, premium mass, and perhaps the base mass is not too far down the road.\nFelicia Hendrix: Great. Thank you so much.\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. It seems like there's been just more news and perhaps noise around overseas gambling legislation in China and some of the restrictions potentially there? What is your interpretation of some of these laws or legislation and the implications for both Macao and Marina Bay Sands and how that might change how you position or market LVS properties?\nRobert Goldstein: I'll just take the first point as it relates to Marina Bay Sands and ask Dr. Wong to speak to Macao. But the concerns there don't concern us at least in Singapore. We do our job as best we can, and we carefully monitor as best we can all the restrictions and all the issues, money movement, etcetera to our best of our ability. We take that responsibly very seriously and applicable rules. Singapore continues to, obviously, be upside, like all of Asia, were negatively impacted by the inability of the Chinese customers to get to Singapore. However, we do see the opening \u2013 the initiatives taken by the Singapore government to open to Hong Kong. And hopefully, that will be a catalyst for other jurisdictions, other countries, other airlines to open the doors to more travel into Singapore. Dr. Wong, would you speak to the issue of cross-border casino from your perspective as it relates to Macao?\nWilfred Wong: Sure. We understand the National People's Congress is still debating the final form of that legislation. But we must remember that the main target is really gambling in foreign countries, including, particularly Internet and telephone betting. However, Macao has never been considered foreign in China. And all of concessionaires in Macao respect the law in China, and we never promote gaming in China, only our hospitality and MICE facilities and services. So we believe that Macao is \u2013 has a unique place under the one country, two systems in China and that we will continue to operate under the confine of the legislation.\nStephen Grambling: That's helpful. I'll jump back into the queue. Thanks so much.\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thank you. I just want to follow-up on I believe it was Felicia's question and talk a little bit about the VIP segment. And maybe, Grant, you're probably best positioned to answer this. But when you think about kind of the issues on the VIP side and, as you mentioned, kind of they've been well advertised, how much of it do you think it is a supply issue in terms of liquidity and supply of capital versus a demand issue? And I guess, part of that gets to some of the demand actually just showing up in your premium mass, which you kind of already addressed. So anything just on the supply and demand dynamics within the VIP segment?\nGrant Chum: Rob, do you want me to take that?\nRobert Goldstein: Grant, I want to finish a comment after you. If you're going to initiate, Grant, please.\nGrant Chum: Sure. Yes. I don't particularly see it as a demand issue. I think there are some issues specifically relating to that segment. But I think one contextual point is you have to remember that the system is \u2013 consists of the working capital cycle in that segment. And what we've had in 2020 is a seven-month, eight-month complete disruption of that business and that ecosystem with all the working capital issues associated with that. So we've never had that level of \u2013 essentially, the business stopped everywhere. But obviously, for that segment, given the particular dynamics, it's particularly damaging. So I think you're seeing some of the aftereffect of that disruption. But obviously, as gaming activity resumes and demand resumes, you hope that some of these issues will evolve in a positive way.\nRobert Goldstein: Yes, I've got to say this, and I'm saying the obvious, but I'm going to say it anyway. The aging customers, at least, our industry has the highest offense in the world. It's been that way for decades, and it will be that way for decades to come. I don't think the demand \u2013 the appetite of the consumer has diminished whatsoever. Obviously, the capital cycle's in jeopardy right now and will take time to adapt. But we've had this issue in the past years and back in 2014, and we know two things are intact. Demand remains intact, and that's a fact. And at some point, capital will become available again. I wouldn't count that segment out. It may be in a very, very tough spot right now. But again, demand will be there, and eventually, we'll figure out the supply on the capital side. We feel highly confident that's a fact.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you, guys. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up as it pertains to what you're kind of seeing, obviously, in a reduced demand environment across the board to an extent but, obviously, healthier in the premium mass segment. Are you guys seeing anything unique from competitors in the market just in terms of the way they're going about their business and trying to drive demand at their assets? Or is it pretty much business as usual across the board?\nRobert Goldstein: Carlo, you're talking about Macao, right?\nCarlo Santarelli: Yes. I'm sorry at Macao.\nGrant Chum: Yes. Actually, it's business as usual. We don't see anything out of the ordinary. Yes, this is not really a business where people are going to go out and do silly things. I think it's pretty rational right now.\nRobert Goldstein: I would add one thing, though, that I think we all agree on, and that is that this market has not been irrational in the past, but it has proven to be very, very susceptible to great products. And I do think our new Four Seasons product; our Londoner product will prove to be very, very advantageous in the years ahead. As we move back toward our quest for $4 billion annual EBITDA, those products are going to take front and center. And that's what drives this premium mass customer, not silly incentives and poor marketing. Great product wins the day over there, and we feel highly confident we have built an aesthetic product that will be very appealing to this customer.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thank you both very much.\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. Your line is open.\nSteven Wieczynski: Yes, good afternoon, guys. So Rob, can I ask you a Vegas question? And can you maybe help us think about forward bookings for group and convention traffic in Vegas next year and maybe how those bookings at this point are shaking out by quarter?\nRobert Goldstein: Sure. We still see some bright spots in the Vegas market vis-\u00e0-vis convention and group business. There's demand, and there's some recent \u2013 it's there in the market because some of these large shows still want to come in Q1. We have a couple of major impediments that I don't know how we're going to correct them. One is, as you know, the governor has imposed group restrictions and size restrictions. So it's very difficult to overcome that. We're hoping to he'll revisit those restrictions and enable the market to talk to some of these large shows. The second issue, of course, is airlift. Airlift is still not near pre-COVID levels. So that's a challenge. But I think to the positive side, we're getting calls from the group market. We're getting inquiries from people from all different parts of group market saying we want to come back and we're looking at this month, that month, throughout \u2013 scattered throughout the year, I guess, there's three things. The governor will revisit his restrictions, and that's pivotal. The airlift \u2013 most of these people require airlift. It's not drive-in business. I think that will come back when the market demand is there. And the third thing, I think, to really fully populate the market with group demand again is a change in \u2013 a catalyst to change how the consumer views being in a place with 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 people. It's obvious in Vegas that the weekend leisure market is surging, and we could probably get to 95% right now if we let it happen. We cap ours in the 65%, 70% range to keep Las Vegas safe, etcetera. But the leisure demand for Las Vegas weekend is very strong, not as much midweek, which has always been reliant upon more group. Also gaming, as you know, has come back to probably, I don't know, 75%, 80% of pre-COVID. So there's some bright spots. But to your point, that's what's really pivotal \u2013 the delta agreed in Las Vegas. We've got to see group come back. And there's just some impediments despite the demand, which seems to be growing. We get more calls every day for the group market, and people are itching to come back and be here. So I think both very large conventions, as well as small tech groups. That appears to be across-the-board demand is reoccurring for next year for 2021. And it's probably soft in April, May, June, and then, goes up the balance of the year.\nSteven Wieczynski: Okay, great. Thanks, Rob. And the second question, I'm not really sure how to ask this question. It's going to be a political question, so excuse me. But yes, I know. If you take your personal views out of the equation for a second, how should we think about the election coming up and maybe how each scenario might play out in terms of your China relationships moving forward? And I hope that makes sense.\nRobert Goldstein: I'm really not going to answer that question, with all due respect. I think it's \u2013 first of all, I don't know if there's a good answer anyone can give you since we don't have insight to the Chinese perspective. But I'm going to pass on that, respectfully. I don't know if Sheldon wants to weigh in, but I think that's the question I'll pass on.\nSteven Wieczynski: Okay. Thanks guys.\nSheldon Adelson: We don\u2019t answer political questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. I have a question for Grant Chum kind of circling back to some of the discussion earlier, and Grant, it's so nice to hear your voice. Just your take on whether junket's ability to operate in Mainland China, their interactions with customers, would that be impacted potentially by the blacklist regulation in your view, not that players won't come to Macao but the ability for junkets to maybe be providing capital for players from the Mainland? And kind of looking at your economic crystal ball, how long do you think capital control in Mainland China may be kind of front and center? Thanks.\nGrant Chum: Rob, shall I take that?\nRobert Goldstein: Yes, please.\nGrant Chum: Yes. Hi, Robin, yes, I think we should clarify that there's always been a prohibition on gambling on Mainland China and solicitation of gambling in Mainland China. And I think those rules and regulations are well understood by market participants. And I think that's the way it should remain. I think the currency issue, I mean, these are big, big issues. We're not in a position to opine on that. But obviously, the market has been operating without any issues for so many years, and we don't see any particular issues in that regard as the market starts to come back. But obviously, like everyone else, we'll watch with great interest the evolution of the system.\nRobin Farley: Thank you. Maybe just as a follow-up and I don't know, Rob, if this would be for you because it's sort of broader. I think in prior calls this year, you talked about potential M&A activity or that that would be a little bit of a departure for LVS, having expressed interest in that? Can you sort of update us on your thoughts on that at this point?\nRobert Goldstein: Patrick, are you in the call?\nPatrick Dumont: Yes. Do you want me to take that one? Is that okay?\nRobert Goldstein: Sure.\nPatrick Dumont: Hey, it's Patrick. I think what we said before in prior calls is consistent, that we view capital deployment pretty consistently and so that we have a very high return threshold. When that original commentary was made by the Chairman, it was really regarding certain conditions that existed really before all the stimulus went into the market. And I think where we are today is we are very focused on maintaining our investments in our existing markets. We've deployed a lot of capital in the last 12 months into these markets. As Grant and Rob mentioned, you're starting to see the benefits in the return of premium mass in Macao today and these very high-value investments. And we're also looking to maintain liquidity to ensure that we have the ability to take advantage of opportunities in the future. So I think we're looking around. I think we're optimistic about the future of our key markets. If an M&A opportunity comes up, we'll look at it. But again, our return thresholds are very high. And as of right now, there's nothing that's really compelling. So we'll continue to deploy capital in our markets and hopefully get the continued high returns that we've been seeing previously in these markets, but no M&A as of right now.\nRobin Farley: Thank you.\nRobert Goldstein: Thanks Robin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nThomas Allen: Thank you. Just following up on that last question. We've been getting a lot of questions about when you may resume your dividend. And would you go back to the kind of $0.79 you were paying at the beginning of the year? Can you just update us on your thinking there? Thank you.\nRobert Goldstein: Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: Hey, it's Patrick. I think return of capital has been a cornerstone for our shareholder value creation program. And I think we're very focused on getting back to being a dividend payer. You've heard our Chairman say \"yay dividends\" many times. I think he feels \u2013 still feels that way. I think the company is very motivated to grow its cash flow beyond where it was in 2019 and ultimately return to being a dividend payer. But I think the key thing right now is that we're in the early stages of recovery of COVID, and we are going to see how that trajectory goes before we make a determination about return of capital. We're very focused on growing the business back and exceeding the prior levels, and we'll evaluate where things are at that time as things progress and make an assessment about sort of dividend payouts at that time.\nThomas Allen: Helpful color. Thanks, Patrick. And then, just as my follow-up question, appreciate all the color you gave on Macao around Golden Week and how things have been progressing there? Can you give any more color around Vegas and Singapore? Obviously, sequentially, third quarter looks better than the second quarter, but was it similar in terms of a month-by-month progression? And have things continued to improve in October? And would you expect them to continue to improve? Or are there seasonal factors we should be thinking about, too? Thank you.\nRobert Goldstein: Do you want Singapore and Las Vegas? So in Las Vegas, I think things have \u2013 I'm not sure it's a seasonal issue. We're in a different place right now. I think it's not about summer versus fall. I think it's pretty much staying stable. But I'm curious to see what happens in the winter if the leisure business holds up as strongly. But I think things are staying where they're at until there's some type of a catalyst. I mean, we did see leisure travel, I think, getting stronger on weekends, not as strong midweek. I still think the airlift thing is very, very difficult to overcome. We still are operating as a regional market. I don't see how \u2013 like, the group business, I think there will be increasing demand, but how it'll get here and can it get here with the governmental restrictions. So I don't see a lot of change in Las Vegas for us until there's a change structurally and the governor's position, the airline position and the willingness again of consumers. I think people coming here on weekends and sitting in a room is one thing. But when they come with a 30,000 group convention or they come and watch a 20,000-seat hockey game, I don't know how people think about those kinds of large gatherings. So I think Vegas stays where it's at. I think that there's going to be demand, but we've got to change some things structurally to get people in the buildings. So that's Vegas. We're very encouraged with what's happening in MBS. We made some money this quarter, as you see. I think that will continue to grow. The growth in MBS will be contingent upon a few variables. For example, just in our building, we'll grow from 1,500 current slot machines to 2,000 as of the first of the year. The win per unit there is extraordinary. And that's driven mostly not by \u2013 people think it's a locals market, not really. It's a locals market for residents, Singapore residents. It's a very different thing because what we do mention \u2013 say that it's foreigners who achieve status as a permanent resident. That's probably the big driver of our very strong slot ETG win, not as strong on the table side, where the market is not as favorable with local residents. We need some airlift there. The other encouraging thing happening in Singapore, as you know, is the recent development with the Hong Kong airlift situation in the governments. We're very fortunate the government in Singapore is so proactive and recognized we need to rejuvenate our industry and its economy. That deal with between Cathay and Sing Air, I think, is very favorable. It bodes well for other jurisdictions to open up. The big catalyst for Singapore growth, obviously, is foreign travel, foreign visitation. That's necessitated by airlift, and that's lacking. But again, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, etcetera, Vietnam, as those markets open up, Singapore could easily grow from, right now, $25 million, $35 million a month to maybe $50 million or $75 million a month and keep going. It really depends on getting the airlift community for foreign visitation. We are comfortable in making money in Singapore. It's growing. October, Golden Week is \u2013 the business keeps continuing to feel better. It feels stronger. But the change will only happen there in a step-change way when you have access by air travel, obviously. And we're hopeful that in this quarter, we'll see some more developments, and we'll see even further as \u2013 again, unlike the U.S., the COVID situation appears to be pretty stable in most countries in Asia. So it makes us hopeful that more people will open their borders up and allow air travel. And that will drive Singapore back to the levels we're comfortable with.\nPatrick Dumont: And if I could just \u2013 hey it's Patrick, if I could just add one comment. I think it's an important thing to note that in Singapore, things really were opened in a phased way after the circuit breaker. And so we really didn't have our full hotel towers until August 1. And I think the other thing that's important to note is it did ramp across the quarter. So Singapore is slowly resuming operations in a more normal way, and we are starting to see the benefits of that as we resume the profitability. And so it was a ramp across the quarter in Singapore, and the trajectory is positive.\nThomas Allen: Very helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJared Shojaian: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. On Marina Bay Sands, can you tell us what percentage of your business historically has come from Mainland China? And then I guess, on the cross-border issues, I mean, is it possible that, for Macao, some of the cross-border issues, just the sentiment of that, could be a headwind in the near-term but potentially positive over the longer term if more demand ends up shifting to Macao?\nRobert Goldstein: It's not quite sure. We're not going to break out percentages as it relates to the profitability coming out of China into Singapore. But I will say it's a very important market for us. So there's no arguing that it's fundamental to our growth and our success as is most countries in Asia depending on China visitation. So it's \u2013 but we'll keep it at a very macro level. As far as \u2013 it's a double-edged sword, as I referenced, because I think it's very, very helpful in Macao that \u2013 the Chinese consumer. One of the reasons our retail business from the high end is booming according to our people on the ground is that they can't fly to France or the U.S. or wherever they travel to and buy their luxury goods. So they're buying it at home. And then, you see the surging retail numbers and the growth in the economy coming out of China. China's back to a pretty good place. Growth, I think, is back, and the renminbi is strong. And China is doing very well compared to the rest of the world, including the COVID situation. So that bodes very, very well. Once we can get inside the bubble, of the China bubble on the containment, I think our business in Macao is going to be just fine and dandy quickly. It's not so positive for Macao \u2013 I mean, for Singapore because there may be a hesitation of the meeting country to air travel. And I'm speculating, but we don't have any incoming out of China right now as far as opening up the balance of not just Singapore but Asia, Japan, Thailand, etcetera. So it will be helpful because demand in both gaming, retail, leisure travel will probably be very strong in Macao as those IVS and COVID barriers come down. And hopefully, it will come down because the health situation in both Macao and Mainland China is very positive. So it's very helpful in Macao, no question, and probably not as helpful in Singapore.\nJared Shojaian: Okay. Thanks Rob. And I'm curious, Rob, just to get your perspective on this. And I think I know the answer to this but curious to hear your response. Given that Vegas is recovering, we're a little bit closer to a vaccine today, hopefully. And Macao has been, I think, a lot slower to recover than people expected. Is it still your expectation that Macao could and should get back to prior peak revenue before Vegas?\nRobert Goldstein: I believe so. I think Macao \u2013 the countries are very \u2013 China is the market for Macao. China is in a very favorable position. I referenced earlier in the call the renminbi, the economy, the safety of COVID. They've done a great job and a sustainable recovery over there. And it feels that it's going to be transferred to Macao in the near future. I just don't know when. But I feel very good about the prospects in Macao in the future and hopefully in the near future. But we don't know. Again, it's not within our control. But I think the government took it slowly, and we got to hand it to the governments in China and Macao. They've been very \u2013 it's been frustrating, but they're taking it slow and you see them opening gradually. We see the recovery in premium mass with base mass to follow and probably junket after that. So Macao, I think, recovers quicker. Having said that, I, for the first time, feeling, Vegas has some bright spots, and we feel some \u2013 there's definitely leisure customer weekends, and it's packed here on the weekends, much more than had been previously. It's not so favorable midweek. But again, there's always a group area of strength. And we're seeing group calls. I mean, our team is getting response. People want to come back to Las Vegas. It just I think, takes longer. And as you referenced, I pray there's a vaccine for all of us. I do think that's the tipping point. The U.S. has to get healthy. We still have, what, 70,000 people affected one day last week. It's still staggering, the level of what's happening. So until people feel safe, they're not coming to Vegas. But when they do, they're going to come back, and we're very confident. But if I'm to make a bet, I'd bet on Macao, much quicker of a recovery than Las Vegas. Vegas has some challenges, where Macao just has to have that barrier come down and let people come in. That's all there is.\nJared Shojaian: All right. Thank you very much.\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to hear all of your voices and hope you are well. I just wanted to follow-up on the IVS circumstances. What we're seeing here is a negligible number of cases both in Macao and the relevant areas of China. What light can you shed on what the Chinese government and the Macao government might be looking for, for change to occur? Or is it just a function of taking the time administratively to convert back to the kiosks that we've known about in the past?\nRobert Goldstein: Mr. Chum, are you still awake?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Well, I think the way you have to look at it, and it refers back to what Rob said, what a great job I think the governments in China and the local government in Macao have done in terms of controlling the pandemic. But one result of that is, I think, each step of relaxation is handled very cautiously. So I think it's more the case that we need the passage of time where we can see that everything is working in order and there are no issues arising from people movements of large numbers. And I think your point about do they move from manual to kiosks, I mean, we already do have feedback from customers and consumers that, in different parts of China, you do have a much more abbreviated application process. So I think this will work its way out assuming that everything remains in order as it relates to the control of the pandemic.\nWilfred Wong: Rob, this is Wilfred. Can I jump in?\nRobert Goldstein: Please do.\nWilfred Wong: Now I think the current situation is the government know what needs to be done, including persuading the Chinese government to work on the kiosks rather than manual processes, extending the 14 days of validity of the test certificate. But we must remember one thing, what you want to avoid is a shutdown again. So that's why both the central government and Macao government been working very carefully because they don't want a resurgence or an outbreak of COVID in Macao, which has held its fort for so long. And that's why they're moving slowly, but surely. But what we are seeing is both the central government and the Macao government knows exactly what needs to be done and they're moving in the right direction.\nDavid Katz: Thank you for that. It seems like a fair plan. Sorry, go ahead, please.\nRobert Goldstein: No, I couldn't agree more. I think we're lucky that they're thinking long-term. It's frustrating for all of us who want it to happen yesterday. We want so badly to see this market open back up. We want to get back on track. And it's frustrating. But I think the comments of guys in Macao, it's going to pay off long-term with long sustainable growth and back to a better environment. It's hard for us in here to accept it without getting antsy. But I think when those restrictions are lifted or revisited, I think it'd be great for all of us.\nDavid Katz: I appreciate that. And if I can ask one detail follow-up. Within the context of the recovery in Macao, and I appreciate the color around October starting to approach or get to breakeven, how would you have us think about the Londoner and its ramp within the context of all that? Presumably, it's on a different track and a different trajectory given the capital.\nRobert Goldstein: Grant, why don't you take that now and [indiscernible]. Please take it.\nGrant Chum: Sorry, do you want to go first or?\nRobert Goldstein: No, go ahead. You initiate, Grant.\nGrant Chum: Yes. I think the first point is what Rob said earlier, that this is a product-driven market. And I don't know, it's hard for us to convey to you over the phone just how excited we are about the products that we are about to bring on. And of course, we have brought some of that on already through the Four Seasons, the new hotel at the Four Seasons. But obviously, the bigger piece will be the comprehensive product that we're going to put out there through the Londoner Macao. And I think when you think about the construction progress we've made there, obviously, we've taken full advantage of the pandemic cessation of some of this business in the SCC side, and we've accelerated much of our programming as a result of that. And I think when we see the segments that are recovering chiefly through premium mass, we really feel very good about the natural rollout progressively of a number of these new products. And that will start potentially toward the end of this year and will move on to the rest of the resort during the course of 2021. But we're very, very excited about what we're about to bring onto the market.\nRobert Goldstein: I just want to add one comment. We had the SCC for years. It was not a great product. It didn't deliver. And here, we've redone this product with 6,000 rooms and suites; a casino, if you can see it, the images are spectacular, a redone retail environment with the epicenter of the Cotai Strip across from the powerhouse, which is The Venetian, twice the key count. I don't think we couldn't be more excited to see it get fully open and operational. David Beckham will cut the key, and Sheldon will be over there hopefully to do this with him, and I think it's going to be an extraordinary product. And we think of how our products perform in the Macao it won't be a very underwhelming product to the one competitive to, I think, The Venetian. And we just we just can't wait to get back in Macao and see the impact. The same with the Four Seasons, which is now open, this is quite a product. And I think our future is tied to \u2013 not to overextending giveaways and promotions, but building great product that the customers in Macao come to. So we couldn't be more \u2013 I'm just very excited about the prospects of our new developments in Macao.\nDavid Katz: Look forward to seeing it. Thank you for taking my question.\nRobert Goldstein: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.

While the business volumes continue to be impacted by the pandemic, we are pleased to see improving operating results, especially in Asia. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands had a profitable quarter as operations progressively resumed across the resort during the summer. In Macao, operating losses reduced sequentially over the second quarter. The third quarter results, however, are not representative of our current business trajectory. As the resumption of visa issuance across all provinces in China only commenced toward the end of September, the initial stages of recovery since then have been very encouraging. During the October Golden Week, we saw meaningful recovery across the different segments of our Macao operations. Importantly, business volumes in the Premium Mass segment enjoyed the most significant resurges. This vital segment is central to our ongoing investment program in Macao and has been leading our revenue generation at this stage of the recovery. We expect the base mass market to recover as visitation to the market increases. Consistent with the recovery in premium mass and overall domestic China consumption trends, we also experienced strong recovery in our retail malls with the Luxury Retail segment enjoying the strongest performance. We continue to make excellent progress in our US$2.2 billion capital investment for the Londoner Macao and Four Seasons budgets. The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, the largest all-suite Four Seasons hotel in the world, is now complete, licensed and hosting customers in the Premium Mass segment. These gorgeous full-suites have been receiving great customer feedback since the Golden Week. We will be introducing a variety of additional world-class integrated resort products and amenities as we complete the Londoner in Macao and other capital projects. The Londoner will include two new all-suite hotels, more than a dozen new restaurants, additional retail and new MICE and entertainment facilities. Our unwavering commitment to significant ongoing investments in Macao enables us to play our part in supporting local employment and the local economy. It also ensures Macao will be even better positioned to recapture and, over time, increase its share of leisure and business tourism from China and the rest of Asia. I remain steadfast in my belief that Macao has the potential to become one of the greatest business and leisure tourism destinations in the world and the MICE capital of Asia. As I've said on many occasions, we would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of additional investment dollars and extend our contributions to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. Now turning to Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We encouraged that MBS was profitable in the third quarter despite the absence of overseas tourists. We hope to see the initiation of reciprocal travel arrangements in the coming months as health concerns permit. We remain committed to pursuing long-term investment in Singapore and our expansion of Marina Bay Sands, although there would be likely delays in the timing of the expansion given the challenges created by the pandemic. In addition to the expansion, we will continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands to enhance the customer experience and the tourism appeal of the resort. In Las Vegas, we are pleased to report that the recovery is well under way. Weekend occupancies have been as high as 70%. Together with our state and local government leadership and the entire Las Vegas community, our team members are working diligently to prepare to safely host convention and group meeting customers from throughout the world, throughout the country and around the world. We look forward to once again welcoming these customers back to Las Vegas, which will always be the most important convention and group meeting market in the United States. As we have said in the past, increased airlift and the resumption of the convention and group meeting business are both critical components to achieving a full recovery in Las Vegas. Now moving to our balance sheet. Maintaining a strong balance sheet makes great business sense while we weather the storm caused by this pandemic. Our balance sheet strength enables us to continue to execute our capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore, which we believe will position the company to deliver industry-leading growth and profitability in the years ahead. We're as confident as ever in the strength of our business model and the eventual recovery in travel and tourism spending in our markets. So thanks again for joining us on the call today. Now we'll take questions. That's what we're shooting for. The trajectory is heading in the right direction. Thanks, Joe. Grant, do you want to take that or? We don't answer political questions."

            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "Yes. Do you want me to take that one? Is that okay? Hey, it's Patrick. I think what we said before in prior calls is consistent, that we view capital deployment pretty consistently and so that we have a very high return threshold. When that original commentary was made by the Chairman, it was really regarding certain conditions that existed really before all the stimulus went into the market. And I think where we are today is we are very focused on maintaining our investments in our existing markets. We've deployed a lot of capital in the last 12 months into these markets. As Grant and Rob mentioned, you're starting to see the benefits in the return of premium mass in Macao today and these very high-value investments. And we're also looking to maintain liquidity to ensure that we have the ability to take advantage of opportunities in the future. So I think we're looking around. I think we're optimistic about the future of our key markets. If an M&A opportunity comes up, we'll look at it. But again, our return thresholds are very high. And as of right now, there's nothing that's really compelling. So we'll continue to deploy capital in our markets and hopefully get the continued high returns that we've been seeing previously in these markets, but no M&A as of right now. Hey, it's Patrick. I think return of capital has been a cornerstone for our shareholder value creation program. And I think we're very focused on getting back to being a dividend payer. You've heard our Chairman say \"yay dividends\" many times. I think he feels \u2013 still feels that way. I think the company is very motivated to grow its cash flow beyond where it was in 2019 and ultimately return to being a dividend payer. But I think the key thing right now is that we're in the early stages of recovery of COVID, and we are going to see how that trajectory goes before we make a determination about return of capital. We're very focused on growing the business back and exceeding the prior levels, and we'll evaluate where things are at that time as things progress and make an assessment about sort of dividend payouts at that time. And if I could just \u2013 hey it's Patrick, if I could just add one comment. I think it's an important thing to note that in Singapore, things really were opened in a phased way after the circuit breaker. And so we really didn't have our full hotel towers until August 1. And I think the other thing that's important to note is it did ramp across the quarter. So Singapore is slowly resuming operations in a more normal way, and we are starting to see the benefits of that as we resume the profitability. And so it was a ramp across the quarter in Singapore, and the trajectory is positive."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "We're well awake, yes. Thank you, Rob. Yes. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Yes. I mean, October was the first time since January that we've seen significant real business volumes in patronage. And as Mr. A mentioned in his opening remarks, premium mass has been the strongest segment by far, and that is really across all of the different tiers of premium mass. The patrons returning first to Macao are the high-quality, high-frequency customers. I think that reflects the pent-up demand that these guests have, and these are the ones who are used to staying overnight in Macao. They are used to having multiple-night stays in Macao, enjoying the destination, and these are the first customers to come back, and that's natural. In terms of the question about where we are on the volumes and profitability, I mean, principally based on the premium mass recovery, October month to date, our Non-Rolling drop per day is just over $20 million. That's about 30% of last year's level. And at this level of Non-Rolling drop, we are able to achieve and we are achieving a slight positive EBITDA month to date based on current cost structure and the business mix. I think what's particularly encouraging, to Joe's question about what's happening, after Golden Week, we had the expected lull in the second week of October, but then we saw a very notable rebound in the third week. In fact, in the third week, we are actually still averaging around or just under $20 million drop per day as well. So as Mr. A said, we are well onto that trajectory, and we hope we can maintain that. I think in tandem with the premium mass recovery, we've seen a resurgence in the retail mall sales, and that's especially true in the Four Seasons, in the Luxury Retail segment. The retail recovery actually began in September and has continued into October. In fact, some of our \u2013 a number of our top first-line brands within the Four Seasons mall is actually up year-on-year in terms of the retail tenant sales in the first two weeks of October. And obviously, in conjunction with that, at the Four Seasons, we've just opened the Grand Suites for Four Seasons. And these suites have received exceptional [indiscernible]. I think this is exactly the right product for this Premium Mass segment structurally. But also at this point in time, I think these Chinese consumers are looking for higher quality, looking for the premium experiences and also, obviously, in this time, an increased amount of personal space. So we're very happy of how that product has come through and, in fact, is really one of our best-performing hotels, if not the best-performing hotels, in October. The question on the other segments, I think base mass certainly is relatively low in terms of traffic right now. As you know, the overall visitation in Macao remains relatively low. And as Rob referenced, there are, obviously, impediments. Some are real, some are perceived, some more to do with awareness in terms of the policies. But obviously, there are some real logistical challenges relating to the COVID testing, as well as the visa application. But as the awareness builds, as the word of mouth spreads, as some of these visa application processes are shortened and become more abbreviated, some of these logistical challenges will be overcome or mitigated and we're confident that the base mass will follow as visitation recovers. As for the VIP segment, obviously, that's been slower in terms of the recovery. That's expected. A lot of those issues are well documented. But we are also seeing a reasonable amount of play coming through in that segment in October as well. So I hope that gives you some color on the October month. Actually, the vast majority of the volumes and the room bookings are from non-Guangdong, but that ratio is actually consistent with what we saw in the past. So this is not out of the ordinary. Majority of the volume comes from outside of Guangdong, and that was the case in October already. But your question is still well made in the sense that, in the first week of October, I mean, a lot of these customers from outside of Guangdong either didn't have time to get the visa or they didn't want to leave their planning to such a last-minute time frame. So they already made alternative plans. So the nationwide visa resumption only occurred or started in September 23. So that really was not sufficient time or window for a lot of the customers to feel that they could confidently get the visa before Golden Week before the office is shutdown again for the holidays. So in that sense, we should hopefully be seeing the non-Guangdong visitation improve as the awareness and the logistics challenges are met and some of these people have time to get the visa to come to Macao. Sure. I think when the Guangdong visas resumed, I think most of the offices were operating on the physical application process and not using the kiosks. As the rest of the country has reopened for these applications, we see a variety \u2013 it's not uniform because different provinces have different procedures, and they always have had. So there are some significant provinces and cities where you can get a same-day application. But most of the others, I would say, range from \u2013 the manual process takes anywhere between three working days to seven working days, but there are a number of them that have a shorter application period. And then, I think going forward, hopefully, obviously, this gets smoothed out. And I think this is just part of the initial \u2013 I think quite rightly the authorities are cautious, and I think that's the right thing to do in the face of the pandemic, that we don't necessarily want a huge surge of people into Macao in a short space of time at the beginning. That has been discussed in Macao, and we are waiting for further development on that front. Sure. I think some of the challenges in that segment are well documented. The segment has been slower to recover in this initial stage of the recovery. But at the same time, as you quite rightly referenced, it's not a significant part of our business, only 4% of our contribution in 2019. And in the meantime, we have, obviously, very strong performance in the premium end of premium mass both across gaming and retail. I think it's too short a time period to ascertain that. Rob, do you want me to take that? Sure. Yes. I don't particularly see it as a demand issue. I think there are some issues specifically relating to that segment. But I think one contextual point is you have to remember that the system is \u2013 consists of the working capital cycle in that segment. And what we've had in 2020 is a seven-month, eight-month complete disruption of that business and that ecosystem with all the working capital issues associated with that. So we've never had that level of \u2013 essentially, the business stopped everywhere. But obviously, for that segment, given the particular dynamics, it's particularly damaging. So I think you're seeing some of the aftereffect of that disruption. But obviously, as gaming activity resumes and demand resumes, you hope that some of these issues will evolve in a positive way. Yes. Actually, it's business as usual. We don't see anything out of the ordinary. Yes, this is not really a business where people are going to go out and do silly things. I think it's pretty rational right now. Rob, shall I take that? Yes. Hi, Robin, yes, I think we should clarify that there's always been a prohibition on gambling on Mainland China and solicitation of gambling in Mainland China. And I think those rules and regulations are well understood by market participants. And I think that's the way it should remain. I think the currency issue, I mean, these are big, big issues. We're not in a position to opine on that. But obviously, the market has been operating without any issues for so many years, and we don't see any particular issues in that regard as the market starts to come back. But obviously, like everyone else, we'll watch with great interest the evolution of the system. Yes. Well, I think the way you have to look at it, and it refers back to what Rob said, what a great job I think the governments in China and the local government in Macao have done in terms of controlling the pandemic. But one result of that is, I think, each step of relaxation is handled very cautiously. So I think it's more the case that we need the passage of time where we can see that everything is working in order and there are no issues arising from people movements of large numbers. And I think your point about do they move from manual to kiosks, I mean, we already do have feedback from customers and consumers that, in different parts of China, you do have a much more abbreviated application process. So I think this will work its way out assuming that everything remains in order as it relates to the control of the pandemic. Sorry, do you want to go first or? Yes. I think the first point is what Rob said earlier, that this is a product-driven market. And I don't know, it's hard for us to convey to you over the phone just how excited we are about the products that we are about to bring on. And of course, we have brought some of that on already through the Four Seasons, the new hotel at the Four Seasons. But obviously, the bigger piece will be the comprehensive product that we're going to put out there through the Londoner Macao. And I think when you think about the construction progress we've made there, obviously, we've taken full advantage of the pandemic cessation of some of this business in the SCC side, and we've accelerated much of our programming as a result of that. And I think when we see the segments that are recovering chiefly through premium mass, we really feel very good about the natural rollout progressively of a number of these new products. And that will start potentially toward the end of this year and will move on to the rest of the resort during the course of 2021. But we're very, very excited about what we're about to bring onto the market."

            "name": "Robert Goldstein",
            "content": "Sheldon, I'd like to make some comments. Joe, it's Rob. How are you doing? Let's begin with that. To answer your question, let's just begin with the obvious. Our confidence in Macao being the world's greatest gaming market and its principal source of customers coming from China, we know, adapting in China from a growing economy perspective, a favorable position vis-a\u0300-vis the COVID. The renminbi is as strong as it's been in many years. And of course, the Chinese consumer is not traveling to foreign countries. We think this fact pattern from a macro perspective is very favorable for Macao. And as you know, Macao has been a $40 billion to $50 billion revenue market for the past number of years and year in, year out performs. The COVID IVS obstacles are real. And we believe as they start to lessen, we'll go back to marching toward our goal of $4 billion annually. Our new Four Seasons is now open. It's quite a product. The Londoner will complete from the interior perspective by December. So we've never been stronger from an asset perspective. But there's no question, while demand from Macao is there, and it's there, we have big confidence. The visa and the testing issues have proven to be challenging and does limit the access. Now we are hoping the government will loosen restrictions and access to Macao will continue to improve. The truth is, the way Macao and China has handled the virus is very \u2013 is in a very capable manner. And Macao will be the beneficiary of reduced travel to other markets with Chinese consumers not traveling outside of China. So it's a domestic travel bubble we hope to be included in, surely. I'd like Grant to opine and talk about. I asked Grant to join the call and Wilfred Wong to give you color from the ground since we haven't been there in many, many months. I think they can give you \u2013 Grant maybe could begin by talking about your questions about October about profitability trends, et cetera. So Grant, are you awake there, Grant, in Macao? I think one is \u2013 maybe to point out to what Grant was saying, was I think the nice thing \u2013 it may not be important to our overall business but in terms of the synergies. But clearly, it is important to liquidity to marketplace. And I think what's nice to see is that the first segment out-of-box to recover has been premium mass. So there's speculation that it may be band-aided by liquidity issues. And what we're seeing in retail, I think Grant mentioned the strength of the retail premium; I was talking to our retail team this morning. It's hard to imagine that in this environment, our top six net new retailers \u2013 I won't name any names \u2013 and you imagine the French and Italian luxury brands are up year-on-year in total sales, which is kind of astounding. It shows the strength and liquidity of that premium mass segment, and it reflects both the gaming and the retail appetite. I think it's very exciting to realize that that segment is back, and that speaks to our Four Seasons and our Londoner. But also, when the day comes when they do lessen the restrictions and make it more accessible to base mass, you've got the two most important segments delivering. I think it's nice to see the current situation, premium mass, and perhaps the base mass is not too far down the road. Thank you. I'll just take the first point as it relates to Marina Bay Sands and ask Dr. Wong to speak to Macao. But the concerns there don't concern us at least in Singapore. We do our job as best we can, and we carefully monitor as best we can all the restrictions and all the issues, money movement, etcetera to our best of our ability. We take that responsibly very seriously and applicable rules. Singapore continues to, obviously, be upside, like all of Asia, were negatively impacted by the inability of the Chinese customers to get to Singapore. However, we do see the opening \u2013 the initiatives taken by the Singapore government to open to Hong Kong. And hopefully, that will be a catalyst for other jurisdictions, other countries, other airlines to open the doors to more travel into Singapore. Dr. Wong, would you speak to the issue of cross-border casino from your perspective as it relates to Macao? Thank you. Grant, I want to finish a comment after you. If you're going to initiate, Grant, please. Yes, I've got to say this, and I'm saying the obvious, but I'm going to say it anyway. The aging customers, at least, our industry has the highest offense in the world. It's been that way for decades, and it will be that way for decades to come. I don't think the demand \u2013 the appetite of the consumer has diminished whatsoever. Obviously, the capital cycle's in jeopardy right now and will take time to adapt. But we've had this issue in the past years and back in 2014, and we know two things are intact. Demand remains intact, and that's a fact. And at some point, capital will become available again. I wouldn't count that segment out. It may be in a very, very tough spot right now. But again, demand will be there, and eventually, we'll figure out the supply on the capital side. We feel highly confident that's a fact. Carlo, you're talking about Macao, right? I would add one thing, though, that I think we all agree on, and that is that this market has not been irrational in the past, but it has proven to be very, very susceptible to great products. And I do think our new Four Seasons product; our Londoner product will prove to be very, very advantageous in the years ahead. As we move back toward our quest for $4 billion annual EBITDA, those products are going to take front and center. And that's what drives this premium mass customer, not silly incentives and poor marketing. Great product wins the day over there, and we feel highly confident we have built an aesthetic product that will be very appealing to this customer. Thank you. Sure. We still see some bright spots in the Vegas market vis-a\u0300-vis convention and group business. There's demand, and there's some recent \u2013 it's there in the market because some of these large shows still want to come in Q1. We have a couple of major impediments that I don't know how we're going to correct them. One is, as you know, the governor has imposed group restrictions and size restrictions. So it's very difficult to overcome that. We're hoping to he'll revisit those restrictions and enable the market to talk to some of these large shows. The second issue, of course, is airlift. Airlift is still not near pre-COVID levels. So that's a challenge. But I think to the positive side, we're getting calls from the group market. We're getting inquiries from people from all different parts of group market saying we want to come back and we're looking at this month, that month, throughout \u2013 scattered throughout the year, I guess, there's three things. The governor will revisit his restrictions, and that's pivotal. The airlift \u2013 most of these people require airlift. It's not drive-in business. I think that will come back when the market demand is there. And the third thing, I think, to really fully populate the market with group demand again is a change in \u2013 a catalyst to change how the consumer views being in a place with 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 people. It's obvious in Vegas that the weekend leisure market is surging, and we could probably get to 95% right now if we let it happen. We cap ours in the 65%, 70% range to keep Las Vegas safe, etcetera. But the leisure demand for Las Vegas weekend is very strong, not as much midweek, which has always been reliant upon more group. Also gaming, as you know, has come back to probably, I don't know, 75%, 80% of pre-COVID. So there's some bright spots. But to your point, that's what's really pivotal \u2013 the delta agreed in Las Vegas. We've got to see group come back. And there's just some impediments despite the demand, which seems to be growing. We get more calls every day for the group market, and people are itching to come back and be here. So I think both very large conventions, as well as small tech groups. That appears to be across-the-board demand is reoccurring for next year for 2021. And it's probably soft in April, May, June, and then, goes up the balance of the year. I'm really not going to answer that question, with all due respect. I think it's \u2013 first of all, I don't know if there's a good answer anyone can give you since we don't have insight to the Chinese perspective. But I'm going to pass on that, respectfully. I don't know if Sheldon wants to weigh in, but I think that's the question I'll pass on. Yes, please. Patrick, are you in the call? Sure. Thanks Robin. Patrick? Do you want Singapore and Las Vegas? So in Las Vegas, I think things have \u2013 I'm not sure it's a seasonal issue. We're in a different place right now. I think it's not about summer versus fall. I think it's pretty much staying stable. But I'm curious to see what happens in the winter if the leisure business holds up as strongly. But I think things are staying where they're at until there's some type of a catalyst. I mean, we did see leisure travel, I think, getting stronger on weekends, not as strong midweek. I still think the airlift thing is very, very difficult to overcome. We still are operating as a regional market. I don't see how \u2013 like, the group business, I think there will be increasing demand, but how it'll get here and can it get here with the governmental restrictions. So I don't see a lot of change in Las Vegas for us until there's a change structurally and the governor's position, the airline position and the willingness again of consumers. I think people coming here on weekends and sitting in a room is one thing. But when they come with a 30,000 group convention or they come and watch a 20,000-seat hockey game, I don't know how people think about those kinds of large gatherings. So I think Vegas stays where it's at. I think that there's going to be demand, but we've got to change some things structurally to get people in the buildings. So that's Vegas. We're very encouraged with what's happening in MBS. We made some money this quarter, as you see. I think that will continue to grow. The growth in MBS will be contingent upon a few variables. For example, just in our building, we'll grow from 1,500 current slot machines to 2,000 as of the first of the year. The win per unit there is extraordinary. And that's driven mostly not by \u2013 people think it's a locals market, not really. It's a locals market for residents, Singapore residents. It's a very different thing because what we do mention \u2013 say that it's foreigners who achieve status as a permanent resident. That's probably the big driver of our very strong slot ETG win, not as strong on the table side, where the market is not as favorable with local residents. We need some airlift there. The other encouraging thing happening in Singapore, as you know, is the recent development with the Hong Kong airlift situation in the governments. We're very fortunate the government in Singapore is so proactive and recognized we need to rejuvenate our industry and its economy. That deal with between Cathay and Sing Air, I think, is very favorable. It bodes well for other jurisdictions to open up. The big catalyst for Singapore growth, obviously, is foreign travel, foreign visitation. That's necessitated by airlift, and that's lacking. But again, Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, etcetera, Vietnam, as those markets open up, Singapore could easily grow from, right now, $25 million, $35 million a month to maybe $50 million or $75 million a month and keep going. It really depends on getting the airlift community for foreign visitation. We are comfortable in making money in Singapore. It's growing. October, Golden Week is \u2013 the business keeps continuing to feel better. It feels stronger. But the change will only happen there in a step-change way when you have access by air travel, obviously. And we're hopeful that in this quarter, we'll see some more developments, and we'll see even further as \u2013 again, unlike the U.S., the COVID situation appears to be pretty stable in most countries in Asia. So it makes us hopeful that more people will open their borders up and allow air travel. And that will drive Singapore back to the levels we're comfortable with. It's not quite sure. We're not going to break out percentages as it relates to the profitability coming out of China into Singapore. But I will say it's a very important market for us. So there's no arguing that it's fundamental to our growth and our success as is most countries in Asia depending on China visitation. So it's \u2013 but we'll keep it at a very macro level. As far as \u2013 it's a double-edged sword, as I referenced, because I think it's very, very helpful in Macao that \u2013 the Chinese consumer. One of the reasons our retail business from the high end is booming according to our people on the ground is that they can't fly to France or the U.S. or wherever they travel to and buy their luxury goods. So they're buying it at home. And then, you see the surging retail numbers and the growth in the economy coming out of China. China's back to a pretty good place. Growth, I think, is back, and the renminbi is strong. And China is doing very well compared to the rest of the world, including the COVID situation. So that bodes very, very well. Once we can get inside the bubble, of the China bubble on the containment, I think our business in Macao is going to be just fine and dandy quickly. It's not so positive for Macao \u2013 I mean, for Singapore because there may be a hesitation of the meeting country to air travel. And I'm speculating, but we don't have any incoming out of China right now as far as opening up the balance of not just Singapore but Asia, Japan, Thailand, etcetera. So it will be helpful because demand in both gaming, retail, leisure travel will probably be very strong in Macao as those IVS and COVID barriers come down. And hopefully, it will come down because the health situation in both Macao and Mainland China is very positive. So it's very helpful in Macao, no question, and probably not as helpful in Singapore. I believe so. I think Macao \u2013 the countries are very \u2013 China is the market for Macao. China is in a very favorable position. I referenced earlier in the call the renminbi, the economy, the safety of COVID. They've done a great job and a sustainable recovery over there. And it feels that it's going to be transferred to Macao in the near future. I just don't know when. But I feel very good about the prospects in Macao in the future and hopefully in the near future. But we don't know. Again, it's not within our control. But I think the government took it slowly, and we got to hand it to the governments in China and Macao. They've been very \u2013 it's been frustrating, but they're taking it slow and you see them opening gradually. We see the recovery in premium mass with base mass to follow and probably junket after that. So Macao, I think, recovers quicker. Having said that, I, for the first time, feeling, Vegas has some bright spots, and we feel some \u2013 there's definitely leisure customer weekends, and it's packed here on the weekends, much more than had been previously. It's not so favorable midweek. But again, there's always a group area of strength. And we're seeing group calls. I mean, our team is getting response. People want to come back to Las Vegas. It just I think, takes longer. And as you referenced, I pray there's a vaccine for all of us. I do think that's the tipping point. The U.S. has to get healthy. We still have, what, 70,000 people affected one day last week. It's still staggering, the level of what's happening. So until people feel safe, they're not coming to Vegas. But when they do, they're going to come back, and we're very confident. But if I'm to make a bet, I'd bet on Macao, much quicker of a recovery than Las Vegas. Vegas has some challenges, where Macao just has to have that barrier come down and let people come in. That's all there is. Thank you. Appreciate it. Mr. Chum, are you still awake? Please do. No, I couldn't agree more. I think we're lucky that they're thinking long-term. It's frustrating for all of us who want it to happen yesterday. We want so badly to see this market open back up. We want to get back on track. And it's frustrating. But I think the comments of guys in Macao, it's going to pay off long-term with long sustainable growth and back to a better environment. It's hard for us in here to accept it without getting antsy. But I think when those restrictions are lifted or revisited, I think it'd be great for all of us. Grant, why don't you take that now and [indiscernible]. Please take it. No, go ahead. You initiate, Grant. I just want to add one comment. We had the SCC for years. It was not a great product. It didn't deliver. And here, we've redone this product with 6,000 rooms and suites; a casino, if you can see it, the images are spectacular, a redone retail environment with the epicenter of the Cotai Strip across from the powerhouse, which is The Venetian, twice the key count. I don't think we couldn't be more excited to see it get fully open and operational. David Beckham will cut the key, and Sheldon will be over there hopefully to do this with him, and I think it's going to be an extraordinary product. And we think of how our products perform in the Macao it won't be a very underwhelming product to the one competitive to, I think, The Venetian. And we just we just can't wait to get back in Macao and see the impact. The same with the Four Seasons, which is now open, this is quite a product. And I think our future is tied to \u2013 not to overextending giveaways and promotions, but building great product that the customers in Macao come to. So we couldn't be more \u2013 I'm just very excited about the prospects of our new developments in Macao. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chum, Dr. Wong, great thanks for joining the call. We really appreciate it. Great color."

            "content": "Sure. We understand the National People's Congress is still debating the final form of that legislation. But we must remember that the main target is really gambling in foreign countries, including, particularly Internet and telephone betting. However, Macao has never been considered foreign in China. And all of concessionaires in Macao respect the law in China, and we never promote gaming in China, only our hospitality and MICE facilities and services. So we believe that Macao is \u2013 has a unique place under the one country, two systems in China and that we will continue to operate under the confine of the legislation. Rob, this is Wilfred. Can I jump in? Now I think the current situation is the government know what needs to be done, including persuading the Chinese government to work on the kiosks rather than manual processes, extending the 14 days of validity of the test certificate. But we must remember one thing, what you want to avoid is a shutdown again. So that's why both the central government and Macao government been working very carefully because they don't want a resurgence or an outbreak of COVID in Macao, which has held its fort for so long. And that's why they're moving slowly, but surely. But what we are seeing is both the central government and the Macao government knows exactly what needs to be done and they're moving in the right direction. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs. \nDaniel Briggs: Thank you. Joining me on the call today are Sheldon Adelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Goldstein, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Mr. Adelson.\nSheldon Adelson: Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy during these challenging times. While the company is facing COVID-19 challenges, we're excited that we are seeing the first signs of recovery. We're happy to report that Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is now open. And that since July 15, certain visit is returning to Guangdong Province from Macao and no longer subject to quarantine. This is a critical first step towards the relaxation of quarantine restrictions in provinces outside of Guangdong, as well as the eventual resumption of tourist visa issuance to Macao. While the recovery in our local communities is now in its early stages, we will remain steadfast in our commitments to the health and safety of our employees and customers and to providing assistance in our host markets. We remain confident that travel and tourism spending in each of our markets will eventually fully recover. My 70 -- my over 70 years of business experience are the basis from my unbridled optimism that people will travel again, shop again and come together again to enjoy entertainment and social interaction, to exchange ideas and to conduct business. Our optimism about an eventual recovery, coupled with our financial strength enables us to continue the execution of our capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore. We believe these investments will strengthen our leadership position in each of these markets and will provide a larger platform for future growth as travel and tourism spending return. In Macao, we continue to make great progress in the execution of our US$ 2.2 billion capital investment program for the London and Macao and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons. As we complete these and other capital projects during the year and in 2021, we will be introducing a variety of world-class integrated results of elements. This includes three new all suite hotels, more than a dozen new restaurants, additional retail and new MICE and entertainment facilities. We're very confident that these new developments will help Macao to recapture and overturn increase its share of leisure and business tourism from China and the rest of Asia. We remain unwavering in our commitment to long-term investment in Macao. The scale of our existing and ongoing investments enables us to play our part in supporting the local economy of Macao today, including our support of local employment, as well as our support to small- and medium-sized businesses. I remain steadfast in my belief that Macao has the potential to become one of the greatest business and leisure tourism destinations in the world and the MICE capital of Asia. We would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of additional investment dollars and extend our contributions to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. Now turning to our investment in the expansion of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We remain excited to be part of Singapore's continued growth as a leading leisure and business tourism destination. We continue to make progress on the MBS expansion. We believe that delays in the timing of the project are likely to occur. These delays are principally related to the impact of the pandemic, and we will provide additional updates in the future, as conditions are continuing to evolve. In advance of the expansion, we will also continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands, to enhance the customer experience and the tourism appeal of the resort. Finally, turning to Las Vegas. The eventual recovery could take more time here than in Asia, particularly because of our reliance on group meeting business. We remain confident that Las Vegas will remain the greatest leisure and business tourism destinations in the United States. Regarding our balance sheet, maintaining a strong balance sheet makes great businesses, where we weather with the storm caused by this pandemic. Our balance sheet strength enables us to invest in promising future growth opportunities, and positions the company to deliver industry-leading growth in the years ahead. We're deeply confident that the eventual recovery in travel and tourism spending and the strength of our business model will enable us to deliver both growth and the return of capital to shareholders in the future. Thank you again for joining us on the call today, and now we'll take questions. Faith, we're ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoe Greff: Good afternoon, everybody. My first question relates to Macao. I was hoping you could give us some sense of your anticipated benefit and what you have seen over the last week or so since the Guangdong quarantine requirement was lifted. So a two-part related question. One, do you think this travel easing if isolation, so without any other travel restrictions, easing, new visa issuance can get you to EBITDA breaking even in Macao? And two, when you look at -- second part of this question, when you look at the last 8 to 10 days, how similar was this period's performance to the performance just over between February 20 when the casinos reopened and March 20 when Guangdong initiated quarantine requirement? And then I have related follow-up.\nRob Goldstein: Yes. Joe, hi, it's Rob. I think there's a big difference between the dates you mentioned in the current period. We believe Macao is our biggest upside potential, but I think it's critical to realize that I think you know that without the IVS, Individual Visitation Scheme, being resurrected, there's not much hope for the casinos to come back. The visitation is, I think, 2,000, 3,000 -- there is three steps. We took the first big step for the quarantine being taken away. The second step will be the IVS resurrection. Hopefully, that happens we don't know when, but that's critical. Of course, then finally beyond Guangdong, we need to see the other provinces open as well. It's not really that impactful financially, or the income of Macao, the quarantine disappearing without a reservation of the IVS. And I think that subsequent, the Guangdong will be helpful. But as you know, we need other provinces come back as well. So I don't think there's much use to compare the period you mentioned. And today, it's very different. Only left is non-expired IVS, and those are dwindling. So the impact is negligible. I think the victory is puric in terms of the financial results, but very helpful in terms of once the IVS comes down or it comes back, and of course, more importantly, that we get beyond Guangdong since Macao is the only provinces that contributed to its income. So we feel -- we're very excited about the potential. When it does happen, we're still strong believers in the pent-up demand theory. We're still strong believers that our business will come back quite well. The problem is I can't nor anyone else give you a date certain. It could be next month. It could be in the fall. It could be late in the fall. So we have to remain patient. We remain steadfast and I believe the business will come back, and we'll wait for that day.\nSheldon Adelson: So those -- this is Sheldon. Those who believe that it'll take a couple of weeks for each step, the Guangdong waiver of the quarantine upon return of Guangdong Province might take two weeks and then they'll open up another province, and they'll do it gradually until we get to most or all of the provinces. The IVS game, they know -- the Macao government knows that the IVS game is important and that we need that. So we're also hopeful that, that will take place in the -- sooner rather than later. But there's no guarantee, but it's our hope.\nJoe Greff: Great. That's helpful, Sheldon. Thank you. And then sorry to ask the Las Vegas question so early in the queue here. But Rob, can you give us a sense of group and convention, activity cancellations, attrition rates for the fall and the rest of 2020, what you're seeing for the first half of next year and then maybe, importantly, what you're seeing with respect to Las Vega your airlift capacity for the end of this year for October through December. Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: Sure, Joe. As you know, we're running three very different businesses, very distinct business to Singapore, Macao versus Las Vegas, of all of them, I view Las Vegas lease favorably. And for the reasons you mentioned, Las Vegas, especially our company, but the whole city, is dependent upon group and convention and banquet segment return. I see nothing indicates that 2020 would return at all. There's nothing in the horizon group here, group there, but nothing of consequence. And we cannot -- Las Vegas cannot perform without return of these segments. It cannot make money with limited hotel occupancy or in negligible occupancy midweek, maybe 50% capacity weekend. In essence, we're running a regional casino predicated upon driving businesses. We have airlift somewhere around 40% of what it was. And about 40% the occupancy, the plans is much less than it was previously. So we're in a world of hurt here in terms of Vegas. As far as looking ahead, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball into 2021. I remain pessimistic about group and convention. And the reason I say that is, if you believe in a -- if you believe in a vaccine or you believe this thing will eventually just burn off, whatever you believe. I still think the longest -- the slowest return of our business will be large deal group business because it tends to skew younger, it's more tech driven, and those people are more reluctant to travel. So I think we have to take a zero, in my opinion, for the rest of the year in terms of the return on group business and banquet business or any consequence. Could it be a one or two here and there, yes, but nothing material. I don't want to predict 2021 because I don't feel I have enough insight into what might happen to the vaccine or the virus and no way to forecast that. But I would be less than honest if I didn't tell you that Las Vegas is in a very difficult place. Unlike Macao, where there's a real, real strong desire and belief that we'll see things return much quicker in Macao this fall and I feel -- well, Singapore will talk about shortly. But Vegas is dependent on airlift, it's dependent on group and convention. It's not a casino-driven market anymore. So we're struggling here. I think I speak for Las Vegas Venetian and Palazzo but I assume that may translate to other properties as well. It's an amazing transition from -- we're making $0.5 billion a year, and we are hitting on all cylinders. And today, it's painful. And I think it remains painful for the immediate future. 20'21, I think you have to look to that as the turning point, and that would -- that depends on how you view this virus, vaccine situation. But I also caution you that large-scale businesses, like we are big-box businesses, may be the most troubled in terms of the customer consuming us to return to it. So in all the years as I've been here in Las Vegas, I've never felt more gloomier effect [ph] about what's happening in Las Vegas short term, hope. Long term, we can see a better day.\nJoe Greff: Thanks, Rob, thanks, Sheldon.\nOperator: Your next question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. On last quarter's call, you had expressed some interest in potential M&A activity. And I just wonder what your current thoughts on that are? Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: Rob, do you want to take that one? Yes, sure.\nRob Goldstein: Please. So as we've said, as a consistent theme over the last quarters, we're very focused on returns. Our Chairman is a very returns-focused guy. And I think his mandate has always been to maximize those returns. And I think you heard him on the last earnings call, and he's here today, so we'll probably have some additional commentary. You mentioned M&A, but I think that was done in the context before the benefit of the massive government stimulus programs were seen. And there was a belief that there might be an opportunistic way to take advantage of the environment and capitalize on great assets that could be purchased perhaps below replacement cost or perhaps in a cyclical trough where the acquisition could make our required returns work. And I think in this environment, given where we are today, there aren't a lot of those opportunities available. That being said, I think we'll continue to look. I think we have an opportunity if something comes around, and we'll continue to keep our eyes open. But at this point, we're still very returns-focused. I think we're not going to be an M&A driven shop. But at the same time, if something comes up that's incredibly compelling; I think we'll be happy to take a look at it.\nRobin Farley: Great. And I appreciate that. And just as a follow-up question. Just given how disruptive the pandemic has been, is your expectations that concession in Macao will be extended for a year, that the whole process of the rebid would be pushed out? Is that something that -- do you think maybe likely or has been communicated in any way to you?\nRob Goldstein: Robin, it's Rob. Nothing has been communicated by the government, whatsoever. And we'll remain -- waiting for their advice and counsel. But as of this time, nothing all has been said about extension or timetables.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nSheldon Adelson: I want to bring up something from two questions ago. The withholding of the groups was a non-attendance of the groups is both the state and a federal requirement. The state and the federal could say, you can't have a gathering of any more than, say, 50 people. You can't have conferences and trade shows with gatherings prohibited of more than 50 people. So we got to wait until the state and the federal government opens the door for that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey guys, thank you very much. Rob, on the last call, you talked a little bit about the cadence of how provinces would come online, and I was just wondering if anything has changed with respect to your, you talked it about being a staggered province by province, IVS, kind of release, so to speak, or if there's anything further beyond Guangdong. I know you touched on it a little bit earlier, but is it still your expectation that it will be a staggered process?\nRob Goldstein: Yes. Again, I don't have the insight beyond what it's all hearsay. Just be clear, we're not getting official words from the government. But the consensus among those who seem to understand how the government thinks about this is, obviously, we're much more careful than we are here in the U.S., the tolerance is much lower for the spread of virus. But what we hear from various sources that the IVS, when it happens, it stays limited to Guangdong. And then the eventual movement into other provinces will gradual throughout the course of the fall. That's what we're being told. It won't be a green light and all thing opens up onetime. I think they're going to -- I think they're doing very orderly, and you see that with the quarantine. I think the IVS will be the next issue whenever that happens, hopefully soon later. But yes, I believe it's staggered throughout the fall, perhaps even beyond the fall. But I don't -- I've never even say this will be lights go on one day, and boom, China opens up to Macao. We've never heard that from anybody, and we heard from a lot of people.\nSheldon Adelson: Rob, I'll give it a try.\nRob Goldstein: Yes. Well, you got one, please click it quickly, Sheldon. If you want more of the advice, bring all -- get your bazooka and click it. So, look, we're hopeful, Macao -- I think of all the places we operate, Singapore is one in the middle. Vegas is in the deep part of the pool. But Macao is such potential, we believe. So we're so excited to see that light switch go off and -- but we have to be patient and just wait for that day. That's one thing we should -- I mean, I think I'd say the obvious to you is because you've followed this space forever. But again, this is the world's greatest regional market. It's not air dependent. We don't need airlift. There's 10% of the customers come from air, the rest is sea and land. So, it's fascinating to me how people -- I mean, Macao is so accessible by land and by sea and not air dependent. In essence, what you see in regional markets, which is a quicker recovery, mimic, so I think you'll see in Macao. The minute those barriers come down, I think you'll see a lot of people coming in. They don't need airplanes. They'll need the social distance on the airplanes. It's a huge advantage of Macao, especially when the governments feel comfortable opening the borders. Next question? I'm sorry.\nCarlo Santarelli: Sorry. I just -- as it pertains to Marina Bay Sands, obviously, you guys -- really when everything is clicking, I mean, it's just a cash flow machine. And right now, given some of the limitations of the social distancing aspects and, obviously, the airlift into Singapore and that being somewhat compromised, do you guys feel the property right now is able to with kind of the patronage that you presumably will get before things change more broadly is able kind of get to a breakeven? I think the operating loss was something like $65 million a month is what you guys had in the slide deck. With maybe what you expect to see now that development are coming back online, is it possible to get that property back towards a breakeven level in the near-term?\nRob Goldstein: Yes, it is. Very much so. I mean -- but we're hoping -- just to be clear, you may have know this, but the casino is open, you know that. Now, we're handicap, in a sense, there's only 300 live table games and 1,500 slot ETGs. But we reclaim all that is happening on the 27 this month. Obviously, we're -- that's a market hampered by airlift because -- it's kind of -- it's a hybrid market. It's got this local business because of all the affluent foreigners who reside in Singapore, which there are many, fortunately. Singapore being such extraordinary country to live and conduct the business, we're very fortunate of a strong foreign clientele that has PR status inside the Singapore borders who reside there permanently. Having said that, we love to have more airlift and love to see Malaysia come out. But yes, to answer your question, we feel very, very lucky, very fortunate what's happening in Singapore as we speak. The casino seeing customers, our occupancy was driven by -- mostly by casino next month. And obviously, a very strong casino occupancy month, and there'll be some cash demand as well from staycations from Singaporeans. The border is still closed to Malaysia, except for limited high visibility business folks. So, Singapore has handicapped, but they can make money. And it will make money. It's going to be a nice turnaround, more premature very fortunate that Singapore is coming back online. It's our most -- our best prospect as we speak today, a much better position than we are in Las Vegas. So yes -- but obviously, the maximum potential of that property to get back to $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion days. We need to see the airlift return. We need to see the casino fully operational. But we feel positive about what's happening in Singapore. We feel very fortunate that we've come out of this, and we're open and operational. And we're seeing customers, and we feel good about it. \nCarlo Santarelli: Thank you very much guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi everyone. Rob, maybe just a follow-up on Singapore. I mean I think it's a little harder for us to track just some of the local policies in that market about the reopening and what needs to be done in the airlift side. So, anything you could point to as it relates to either agreements on creating local travel bubbles, be it Malaysia or China? And could you just remind us of what are the key source markets that you really need to see open up to make that property look a little bit more like normal? \nRob Goldstein: Yes. Well, we need -- the first thing obviously is the airlift, which I don't have any color -- any insight to help you with it. I hope it opens up. I don't see airlift being a real help to the Singapore property probably for the balance of this year. It remains pretty much a market within the borders of Singapore. There is a chance Malaysia opens up. They have COVID under control because they're very similar measures to Singapore. Given the relationship between the JV board and the two countries, there's a possibility of some limited leisure business travel opening up probably in Q4 to Malaysia. I don't see Indonesia. There is talk -- there's hope that they can open some business lanes up through China, but that's not happening today. But I will remind you, we're fortunate again, have a very affluent clientele of foreign people live in Singapore. I think we'll be pleased with the results of Singapore in the fall. But I don't see 2020 being a lot of air traffic in Singapore, foreign visitation. It doesn't seem to me to be in the cards for the foreseeable four or five months. \nShaun Kelley: Great. Thank you. And just as my follow-up, as it relates to Las Vegas, obviously, one of the biggest questions we get is on the corporate and convention side across the whole global hotel business. And I was curious, as you talk to some of the bigger convention and groups or you break down your own business, just any thoughts about some sort of structural change as it relates to any of that activity? I mean, there\u2019s so many barriers that it\u2019s really hard for people to probably extrapolate too much right now, but just any thoughts you have about just demand levels more permanently changing due to conference calls and activity levels or just how do you think about that? \nSheldon Adelson: No. \nRob Goldstein: We'll get first Sheldon on that. \nSheldon Adelson: Thank you. This is Sheldon. Having been in that business in the conference and trade show business. It's a staycation [ph] business for 40 years, I could tell you that there are different constituencies. There were associations that run the events, there are private entities that run the events and there are companies that run their own events. One of our biggest customers is a company that brings several big conferences to our properties in Las Vegas during the course of the year. They can't give up on that. The fact that people are working from home and communicating from home, that is never going to give up on the trade show business, to meet people, to do research, to do recruitment, to announce -- to make announcements and product introductions. There won't be a substitute for that. \nShaun Kelley: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Your line is open.\nFelicia Hendrix: Hi, thank you so much. First, just wanted to touch on your CapEx. It looks like spend on the London are seems to have been pushed out. So I was wondering if you could walk us through that. \nRob Goldstein: From the timing of the financial side? What do you want to hear? Patrick will take you through the financial side. On the timing, we are moving quickly on getting it completed, Felicia. It'll be pretty much done. Four Seasons done this fall. London are done interior wise Q1 of 2020, but a lot more work on exterior wise and there's other pieces to be done. We're going as fast as we can with the constraints of COVID. We've not pulled back in terms of trying to get it done. We're not holding back. We just have some constraints construction wise, but perhaps Patrick will take you through financial side. \nPatrick Dumont: So there's a couple of things here. Some of this related to permitting, but I think the key thing is we've completed the Grand Suites at Four Seasons, so that's done. The London hotel, which is 580 suites, excluding some high-end suites is done. And then between now and the end of the year, we're going to complete the Londoner Macao, which is 368 suites together with gaming and restaurants. The Londoner casino will be done at the main gaming four level. Paiza gaming will be done. We'll finish the rest of the high-end suites for the Londoner. And we're going to add the Crystal Palace space, which is like the wow space entrants and then 10 new restaurants. So we'll also, throughout the rest of -- part of '21, which is what you see in the CapEx schedule that's in the presentations on Page eight, is really external works and effort to share, Big Ben, some retail areas and some other public spaces. And then -- so I think that's really the shifting in the CapEx that you see was related to permitting. But the project from this customer standpoint, aside from the exterior works still continues to be on the schedule that we expect. \nFelicia Hendrix: Okay. Okay. So the $100 million shift from '21 and then the roughly $700 million shift from '22 that you would say most of that's permitting and maybe some COVID-related delays? \nPatrick Dumont: That's right. \nFelicia Hendrix: Okay. Helpful. And then just on Vegas and full disclosure, we may have completely modeled this strong, but -- because you've given us the cash burn for property. But even like knowing that, you still did better than we expected in Vegas in terms of costs. I mean we're all looking at big negative numbers, so either take that. But just wondering, was there anything like surprising in Vegas where you were able to just mitigate the lower revenues or anything that kind of came up in the quarter that you may not have thought about? \nPatrick Dumont: I will take the different side of that I'll turn it over to you. So as they kind of look at Page 5, it's really a near 0 revenue scenario. So when we're making revenue, we're actually able to benefit a little bit. So that's what you saw in Las Vegas. And so we were able to take some cost side of the business as we continue to focus on costs. As a team, we've been very focused on trying to reduce costs across all of our jurisdictions during this time. And we were able to make certain headway in Vegas. But as a practical matter, it's really just based on the revenue that we achieved during the quarter. \nFelicia Hendrix: Yes. It kind of sounds like, we're just going to ramp up that -- ramp down the cost as much, so thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, thank you for taking the question. I guess on -- I was hoping you could give a little more color on margins in Macao. And given you expect some pent-up demand in the market, how are you generally evaluating marketing and/or lending to coax the customer back? And where would you see the health of the junkets are as we prep for an eventual recovery? \nRob Goldstein: I think the question about what you market, the building is just open the doors and watch the customers come in. I feel very confident that pent-up demand will cover a lot of our marketing. We don't think an incent or do much more we've ever done. Macao is a frothy market when the barriers come down. So I don't see that need to incent or do things differently. There's open the doors, let it come. As far as the junkets remains a question mark. What does happen there, there's been all kinds of things, there's been issues that you read about in the press and you've covered in your discussion, Steve. And I think it remains to be seen what the trends that junkets to what the demand is. I know this is not the common thinking, but I'd want to believe the average customer, the mass business and pre-mass will come back strong and heavy from day one. And as the junkets will -- just let the market show us what it has and what the customer demand is and how much the junkets want to participate. I think that remains a question mark in my mind. But we are really confident that this is a market that doesn't need airlift, just needs to open the doors and watch people come back in and we can't wait for that day. \nStephen Grambling: That's great. And as you learn from ramping down, I guess for the change in demand, are there things that you maybe will keep holding back as it relates to costs that could influence margins versus where they used to be on the recovery? \nRob Goldstein: I think the door is open. I think once you see a demand, you can make this -- in the blind that taking visibility as to how strong it comes back. I wouldn't do anything to execute demand and what it looks like in Macao because again, we have one advantage as no one talks about, but the Chinese customers not -- doesn't have optionality in terms of coming to the U.S. or going to Europe. So even leaving -- Singapore, so I think Macao, it becomes even more desirable in terms of the Chinese visitation. I wouldn't try to figure out the market until I see the demand side and the customers. Once that happens, they will make decisions. \nPatrick Dumont: So just one comment on the margin structure, if you think about the run rate business prior to COVID, more than 60% in Macao of our expenses were really variable, gaming taxes and sort of things related to the activity of the business. And so when you think about our controllable operating expenses, we have taken cost out of the business, but the margin structure you should expect is going to be related to the mix of business more than it is on the incremental costs we've taken out. So if we can start achieving the premium mass business that we think we can achieve with the opening of the Londoner and the Four Seasons and grow that business with this new product that is incredibly compelling, the margin structure will improve just because it's -- it will overweight towards this high-value customer. So I think I'd like to believe in the long run that the base mass business comes back and the premium mass business comes back, and we get this volume that takes advantage of some of the benefits that we've had in the margin structure. But the long run rate margins should look similar to what we've done in the past, assuming the business returns as normal. \nStephen Grambling: Super helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nThomas Allen: Thank you. So you obviously have one of the leading mall portfolios in the world. Can you just update us on your conversations with the tenants, both in terms of rent payments and renewals? And just help us think about that for the future.\nRob Goldstein: Patrick, you're right -- what do you want to? \nPatrick Dumont: Why don't you start, and I'm happy to add if there's anything that's helpful. \nRob Goldstein: I think, we've worked very well with our -- Thomas, to your point, our retail portfolio is a very important part of the mix of our business. We remain believers and that will come back in a big way in Asia. But MBS has started to ramp already. Obviously, Macao is not. We've been very -- we've worked very hard to foster strong relationships with the tenants in both jurisdictions, and we did rent reduction, et cetera. We'll take a wait and see attitude once again. The tenants have worked hard to be - to work with us and not -- we all try to work in the same manner, a fair, open dialogue about how we see the future. I assume that this will mimic the casino hotel demand. As Singapore gets stronger day by day, the tenants are coming back. We've had a lot less business than we wanted to have, as compared to Orchard Road. That's sort of change. Now, the mix is coming back to us now the hotel is open. So I think it's very simple. We have 200-plus tenancies in Singapore. I think 800 tenancies in Macao. We take them one by one based on how we see the market treating them. There'll be some casualties. There's been some casualties already in some of these places, because of, obviously, the shutdown. But just like we will at the gaming side and the hotel side, I'd like to wait and see what demand looks like and until we renew those relationships, sort of, base rents, percentage rents. But something tells me that in both markets, we're going to see return to normalcy rather quickly. I think it mimics again what we're going to see in the gaming side. And as long as that hotel is still up, it will take time, especially, I think, in Singapore, because without the airlift, it's a local retail market. I think Macao will come back much quicker, because the airlift issue, once the borders open up, I think Macao should return to normalcy rather quickly.\nPatrick Dumont: And just one other thought. We've spent a lot of time with our tenants in order to help -- get them through this time, which is unprecedented, with the goal of having them be able to trade again when the recovery that Rob was just discussing comes to fruition. So from our standpoint, we view the mall as a very important asset, very important for our customers' experience. We have relationships with some of the leading brands in the world and in Asia. And we want to ensure the continuity of those relationships, and we've been working with them to ensure that they continue to trade in the recovery. \nThomas Allen: Helpful. Thank you. And then, respecting that your Asian properties aren't as MICE intensive as your Vegas properties, it does seem like there is some signs of recovery in group business in Asia. Are you seeing that in the bookings heading into 2021 through Singapore, Macao properties at all?\nRob Goldstein: We're seeing -- there's still things on books -- we see Singapore as a starting point. We are seeing demand in Singapore, but I think people are very tend about committing. People are call -- there is inquiries, there's definitely bookings. But the caveat being that they can -- they can bow out within 90 days, there's plenty of room to quit, if they don't see demand. So I think the group is different. Corporate stuff is different than obviously the large-scale groups that require attendees. And I think what we're seeing is people are tend to be putting a foot in the order. But even Singapore, since you can't get there, how do you really make real commitments? I mean, if you want to come to Singapore with a large group, you can't fly into Singapore. So it's a Singapore-driven market only at this point. I think it's too murky, too unclear to talk about 2021 in Singapore. And same applies to Macao. Macao has a short booking window. And as you know, the challenge in Macao is that the gaming piece goes back strong, and I anticipate it will. It negates the need for much MICE business. If anything, it's an impediment to MICE because gaming demand is so strong. It takes the majority of the rooms. You can't put large-scale groups in Macao, because of rooming capacity. Our competitors won't participate anyway. So I think it's unfair to -- this far out to say what happens in Singapore without airlift being determined, I still think it's too early to call that situation. Yes there's inquiries. There's people talking to us, but everyone's scratched their heads saying what does happen, how do we get there, when do we get there? So I think it's too early to take the call.\nThomas Allen: Thank you.\nSheldon Adelson: Thanks, Thomas.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jared Shojaian from Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is open.\nJared Shojaian: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just talk about what's changed over the last few months in terms of your thinking on Japan? And then I guess going back to the M&A topic. I mean, have you had any inbound calls, any substantive discussions with anyone? And in your slide deck, you list Macao, Singapore and South Korea as areas of potential development interest. Are you kind of agnostic to location? Are you more focused on the return? I mean, how are you sort of thinking about that?\nRob Goldstein: I think Japan, no one wanted to be in Japan more than Sheldon and the team here. We were very bullish in Japan. We spent a lot of time and money, and we're very hopeful. But the environment there just wasn't suitable to make kind of investment that this company demands in terms of returns. It didn't make -- we couldn't make it work. We sure tried. We spent endless time and endless dollars pursuing Japan. We wish we could have stayed. We wish the construct was more welcoming to the investor, but it wasn't. And I feel comfortable that we made the right choice. I think Shel was extremely -- the business there for decades was the biggest proponent. We're all disappointed, what's happened in Japan. But it didn't make economic sense. So, we're keen to invest. Obviously, when this all works out and things get better, especially in Asia, we're keen to be back looking for opportunities to be in Korea or other countries. We'd like to be investing. But it has the right environment. It has to be a country wants us to invest and wants to do the model that Sheldon has -- well, he's authored is a unique model. It's a unique -- it's a huge capital-intense model. It calls for a cooperative government understands all these investments and the needs for return. So, we continue to look at everything in Asia, and we're keen to do it. Sheldon, do you want to comment? \nSheldon Adelson: The regulations that were promulgated by the Japanese government that went through the dialog were not conducive to attracting the kind of investment that it requires. The cost of construction and the cost of land in Japan is very high. And it didn't justify if it was down, like another jurisdiction. If it were down to $3 billion, $4 billion, it's -- well, I'm not sure that it would have -- that would have made much of a difference because some of the rules, they're talking about withholding income tax from foreign winners. So, player comes in from another country, he wins. They want us -- the government wants the operator to withhold the taxes to pay the Japanese government. That will never attract one foreigner. So, the taxes were 30% gaming taxes, 30% income taxes, and there was no assurance that they won't raise the taxes from there. So, there were just too many negative regulations that we couldn't live with. Listen, if they change it, our mind is open to go back.\nJared Shojaian: Okay. Thank you. It's very helpful. And then just going back to Las Vegas, realizing it's obviously, much smaller piece of your business, but can you talk about what type of customer you're seeing initially, would say it's primarily a lower-yielding drive to customers? Anything you can share there? And is there a revenue percentage you need in order to get to breakeven? \nRob Goldstein: We need more, more customers -- we need lots more. The truth is the hotels are running in this down mid-week, 20%, 25%, 30%; weekends, 50%, 60%. That doesn't work. They are only coming unless you can drive in market, so along the markets, such as international, but throughout the U.S. -- actually, we've had a very high-yielding, very strong customers because our marketing team has incented. We bought some great business in using our airplanes and our marketing, our lists. We see actually a very strong high end play in both slots and tables. Extraordinary amounts of players gone through here. The problem is, as you know, it takes a lot of different segments to make this company make a $0.5 billion in Las Vegas we did last year. We don't have any convention business, there's no yield on the week -- mid-week on the rumor side. You're seeing strong FIT demand weakened, but there's nothing else in there but FIT. Strong high-end casino demand. Our numbers might surprise you because you know how good they are in terms of the slot machines and the table yields. We're not -- yes, there's things in driving business, which is not very high demand gaming side. But again, Vegas has morphed into a hospitality-driven market. And I think a lot of people is confusing. Even people operate here surprised me sometimes that they're surprised how soft it is. Without the hotel being full, without the convention driving the rates midweek, without the bankrupt piece, we did here almost $200 million in banquet sales and massive margins. It's just very hard for our model to work, and I assume that's true in the entire marketplace. If you're running a large-scale building, like most of these buildings are, you're not getting by on gaming win, no matter how good it is. You're not getting by with 30%, 40% occupancy. If you're making money on a weekend, which we can, you're losing it back midweek, which we all do. And I don't think that picture is different from most. Just this company has been such an incredible success story in the convention banquet segments. We've driven so much business here. I mean, last year, again, I think we broke a 0.5 billion of EBITDA. But to do that, you can't run a hotel with these kind of occupancies. You can't run a no banquet facility. You can't rely on high rollers. It just doesn't work. Those days, in 1967 left. And so this is a new business in Las Vegas. And what allows you to build these multibillion-dollar buildings is the true IR nature of what Sheldon authored 20 years ago. I mean this town has moved away from the gaming dependent to a very diversified plan. And I don't know how you fix it until you get airlift that enables you and groups that feel comfortable coming back here and banquets coming back here, and that's just a fact of life, and I don't think we're alone in this thinking. So we remain hopeful that things will turn. But the Las Vegas year in July of 2020 is a very difficult place. And I hope it gets better, but that's the truth of the market today.\nJared Shojaian: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We're now down to our last question of the day from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Hi, good morning -- good afternoon, I should say. Look, we all may have our own set of beliefs as to why the demand will be there once the access is available. Can you just talk about what discussions, or any data you've collected? What -- why you're convinced that the demand will be there as many of us are? \nRob Goldstein: Are you talking about, David, Macao? \nDavid Katz: Yes, in Macao.\nRob Goldstein: Look, you're talking to -- has been going to Macao for almost 40 years. And I don't think anybody is going there and see what I've seen could have any other rational belief. There's a number of factors. One is the propensity of gamble remains among the highest in the world. Two, Macao is a very seductive place. It has all the things you want. It's got high quality retail, high quality restaurants, high quality lodging. It's got enormous casino. They're plentiful and diverse. It's very accessible. And they can't go anywhere else. I mean, frankly, they're locked down, just like we are. No one's going to Europe. No one is going to the U.S. So if you're an affluent Chinese person, and Macao is such a -- it's become such a compelling place to visit. I mean, when I went there in the 1980s, it was all different world. In 2019, it's a stunning world of opulence, food, entertainment, retail. It has all the things that are seductive to tourists. So I have no doubt in my mind, not a -- I always doubt that Macao, when those doors open up, we'll see a lot of crane towards come back. The only good point to is do you believe the economy has weakened the consumer's ability to gamble, that's the call all you can make individually. I believe that will come back strong, again convinced Macao reservoir\u2019s quickly. Also, you should be advised, and I think you know this, that this virus for the U.S. is very difficult, I hear all the time, Americans wearing a mask, having your temperature, it's all so foreign to people in the U.S. It's so confusing. I was -- the story of there was that we got mask, they may put a mask, particular Walgreens was wearing mask and she was screaming about her first member right. It was a bizarre situation. It's not the case in Asia. People are very comfortable in mask, it's normal part of life there. So you have that factor, which is they're more comfortable with this virus environment. They've lived through it. They understand it. They wear a mask to comply and walk around Hong Kong today. So I think that bodes well as well. But again, I would land on Macao itself. It's such a wonderful place for the Chinese tours. They offer so many wonderful amenities. I have no concern at all, saying that wall comes down, that border wall comes down in terms of IVS, and they allow provinces open back up, I remain completely convinced that, that business will come back very quickly, and it'll come back in multiple segments. The two caveats, I think, would be, one, higher view of the junket business is a bit confusing right now. And two, do you believe the consumer has adequate spending money in their pocket to partake. I think they do. So I feel very -- as good as I feel about Macao, I just wait for that day to happen to be validated. But that's one person's opinion, but I believe it's a shared sentiment among those who have been to Macao many, many times and watch that place in action. \nDavid Katz: And, as I have and I would agree that Macao is far more exciting than Walgreens. If I can just follow that up and -- if there are ways in which you're discussing what the new normal will look like or any aspects of the business that may change, that may have an impact or benefit on your ability to operate once it does open, that may incur some costs or maybe not, I'd love your updated perspective on that.\nRob Goldstein: I think it will look like a lot of things here in the U.S. Won\u2019t look that different, will it. You'll see we're wearing masks. You're going to see temperature checks. You'll see extreme cleaning. But by the way, it happened pretty much -- it's been happening for years in Asia with the -- since the SARS times. It's a much different -- one of the most fascinating things I ever saw in Macao was, the smoking rooms. When I first went there, everyone was worried smoking would decimate the market and you can't smoke. They're not going to come, and everyone's was convinced. Well, what's hilarious to me was, they all stood in the smoking room smoking, making best of smoking room, dictating to a guy, that, this, that, that. It didn't deter Macau people from gambling. It didn't deter the Chinese consumer. The COVID virus, they'll accept the fact there's risk, they\u2019ll wear the mask, they're very compliant and they'll do right thing as far as being respectful of social distancing. It may be impactful in terms of the table counts, table occupancies, and that will be an issue. We're fortunate we have 1,500, 1,600 table games there and thousands and thousands slot machines. So, do I think it's going to be hurtful? Maybe in weekends when we're full capacity, and the place is jammed, yes, possibly. But I look forward to addressing those problems when they happen.\nDavid Katz: All right. Thank you for taking my questions.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "Rob, do you want to take that one? Yes, sure. So there's a couple of things here. Some of this related to permitting, but I think the key thing is we've completed the Grand Suites at Four Seasons, so that's done. The London hotel, which is 580 suites, excluding some high-end suites is done. And then between now and the end of the year, we're going to complete the Londoner Macao, which is 368 suites together with gaming and restaurants. The Londoner casino will be done at the main gaming four level. Paiza gaming will be done. We'll finish the rest of the high-end suites for the Londoner. And we're going to add the Crystal Palace space, which is like the wow space entrants and then 10 new restaurants. So we'll also, throughout the rest of -- part of '21, which is what you see in the CapEx schedule that's in the presentations on Page eight, is really external works and effort to share, Big Ben, some retail areas and some other public spaces. And then -- so I think that's really the shifting in the CapEx that you see was related to permitting. But the project from this customer standpoint, aside from the exterior works still continues to be on the schedule that we expect. That's right. I will take the different side of that I'll turn it over to you. So as they kind of look at Page 5, it's really a near 0 revenue scenario. So when we're making revenue, we're actually able to benefit a little bit. So that's what you saw in Las Vegas. And so we were able to take some cost side of the business as we continue to focus on costs. As a team, we've been very focused on trying to reduce costs across all of our jurisdictions during this time. And we were able to make certain headway in Vegas. But as a practical matter, it's really just based on the revenue that we achieved during the quarter. So just one comment on the margin structure, if you think about the run rate business prior to COVID, more than 60% in Macao of our expenses were really variable, gaming taxes and sort of things related to the activity of the business. And so when you think about our controllable operating expenses, we have taken cost out of the business, but the margin structure you should expect is going to be related to the mix of business more than it is on the incremental costs we've taken out. So if we can start achieving the premium mass business that we think we can achieve with the opening of the Londoner and the Four Seasons and grow that business with this new product that is incredibly compelling, the margin structure will improve just because it's -- it will overweight towards this high-value customer. So I think I'd like to believe in the long run that the base mass business comes back and the premium mass business comes back, and we get this volume that takes advantage of some of the benefits that we've had in the margin structure. But the long run rate margins should look similar to what we've done in the past, assuming the business returns as normal. Why don't you start, and I'm happy to add if there's anything that's helpful. And just one other thought. We've spent a lot of time with our tenants in order to help -- get them through this time, which is unprecedented, with the goal of having them be able to trade again when the recovery that Rob was just discussing comes to fruition. So from our standpoint, we view the mall as a very important asset, very important for our customers' experience. We have relationships with some of the leading brands in the world and in Asia. And we want to ensure the continuity of those relationships, and we've been working with them to ensure that they continue to trade in the recovery."

            "name": "Sheldon Adelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope that all of you are staying safe and healthy during these challenging times. While the company is facing COVID-19 challenges, we're excited that we are seeing the first signs of recovery. We're happy to report that Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is now open. And that since July 15, certain visit is returning to Guangdong Province from Macao and no longer subject to quarantine. This is a critical first step towards the relaxation of quarantine restrictions in provinces outside of Guangdong, as well as the eventual resumption of tourist visa issuance to Macao. While the recovery in our local communities is now in its early stages, we will remain steadfast in our commitments to the health and safety of our employees and customers and to providing assistance in our host markets. We remain confident that travel and tourism spending in each of our markets will eventually fully recover. My 70 -- my over 70 years of business experience are the basis from my unbridled optimism that people will travel again, shop again and come together again to enjoy entertainment and social interaction, to exchange ideas and to conduct business. Our optimism about an eventual recovery, coupled with our financial strength enables us to continue the execution of our capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore. We believe these investments will strengthen our leadership position in each of these markets and will provide a larger platform for future growth as travel and tourism spending return. In Macao, we continue to make great progress in the execution of our US$ 2.2 billion capital investment program for the London and Macao and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons. As we complete these and other capital projects during the year and in 2021, we will be introducing a variety of world-class integrated results of elements. This includes three new all suite hotels, more than a dozen new restaurants, additional retail and new MICE and entertainment facilities. We're very confident that these new developments will help Macao to recapture and overturn increase its share of leisure and business tourism from China and the rest of Asia. We remain unwavering in our commitment to long-term investment in Macao. The scale of our existing and ongoing investments enables us to play our part in supporting the local economy of Macao today, including our support of local employment, as well as our support to small- and medium-sized businesses. I remain steadfast in my belief that Macao has the potential to become one of the greatest business and leisure tourism destinations in the world and the MICE capital of Asia. We would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of additional investment dollars and extend our contributions to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination. Now turning to our investment in the expansion of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We remain excited to be part of Singapore's continued growth as a leading leisure and business tourism destination. We continue to make progress on the MBS expansion. We believe that delays in the timing of the project are likely to occur. These delays are principally related to the impact of the pandemic, and we will provide additional updates in the future, as conditions are continuing to evolve. In advance of the expansion, we will also continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands, to enhance the customer experience and the tourism appeal of the resort. Finally, turning to Las Vegas. The eventual recovery could take more time here than in Asia, particularly because of our reliance on group meeting business. We remain confident that Las Vegas will remain the greatest leisure and business tourism destinations in the United States. Regarding our balance sheet, maintaining a strong balance sheet makes great businesses, where we weather with the storm caused by this pandemic. Our balance sheet strength enables us to invest in promising future growth opportunities, and positions the company to deliver industry-leading growth in the years ahead. We're deeply confident that the eventual recovery in travel and tourism spending and the strength of our business model will enable us to deliver both growth and the return of capital to shareholders in the future. Thank you again for joining us on the call today, and now we'll take questions. Faith, we're ready for questions. So those -- this is Sheldon. Those who believe that it'll take a couple of weeks for each step, the Guangdong waiver of the quarantine upon return of Guangdong Province might take two weeks and then they'll open up another province, and they'll do it gradually until we get to most or all of the provinces. The IVS game, they know -- the Macao government knows that the IVS game is important and that we need that. So we're also hopeful that, that will take place in the -- sooner rather than later. But there's no guarantee, but it's our hope. I want to bring up something from two questions ago. The withholding of the groups was a non-attendance of the groups is both the state and a federal requirement. The state and the federal could say, you can't have a gathering of any more than, say, 50 people. You can't have conferences and trade shows with gatherings prohibited of more than 50 people. So we got to wait until the state and the federal government opens the door for that. Rob, I'll give it a try. No. Thank you. This is Sheldon. Having been in that business in the conference and trade show business. It's a staycation [ph] business for 40 years, I could tell you that there are different constituencies. There were associations that run the events, there are private entities that run the events and there are companies that run their own events. One of our biggest customers is a company that brings several big conferences to our properties in Las Vegas during the course of the year. They can't give up on that. The fact that people are working from home and communicating from home, that is never going to give up on the trade show business, to meet people, to do research, to do recruitment, to announce -- to make announcements and product introductions. There won't be a substitute for that. Thanks, Thomas. The regulations that were promulgated by the Japanese government that went through the dialog were not conducive to attracting the kind of investment that it requires. The cost of construction and the cost of land in Japan is very high. And it didn't justify if it was down, like another jurisdiction. If it were down to $3 billion, $4 billion, it's -- well, I'm not sure that it would have -- that would have made much of a difference because some of the rules, they're talking about withholding income tax from foreign winners. So, player comes in from another country, he wins. They want us -- the government wants the operator to withhold the taxes to pay the Japanese government. That will never attract one foreigner. So, the taxes were 30% gaming taxes, 30% income taxes, and there was no assurance that they won't raise the taxes from there. So, there were just too many negative regulations that we couldn't live with. Listen, if they change it, our mind is open to go back."

            "name": "Rob Goldstein",
            "content": "Yes. Joe, hi, it's Rob. I think there's a big difference between the dates you mentioned in the current period. We believe Macao is our biggest upside potential, but I think it's critical to realize that I think you know that without the IVS, Individual Visitation Scheme, being resurrected, there's not much hope for the casinos to come back. The visitation is, I think, 2,000, 3,000 -- there is three steps. We took the first big step for the quarantine being taken away. The second step will be the IVS resurrection. Hopefully, that happens we don't know when, but that's critical. Of course, then finally beyond Guangdong, we need to see the other provinces open as well. It's not really that impactful financially, or the income of Macao, the quarantine disappearing without a reservation of the IVS. And I think that subsequent, the Guangdong will be helpful. But as you know, we need other provinces come back as well. So I don't think there's much use to compare the period you mentioned. And today, it's very different. Only left is non-expired IVS, and those are dwindling. So the impact is negligible. I think the victory is puric in terms of the financial results, but very helpful in terms of once the IVS comes down or it comes back, and of course, more importantly, that we get beyond Guangdong since Macao is the only provinces that contributed to its income. So we feel -- we're very excited about the potential. When it does happen, we're still strong believers in the pent-up demand theory. We're still strong believers that our business will come back quite well. The problem is I can't nor anyone else give you a date certain. It could be next month. It could be in the fall. It could be late in the fall. So we have to remain patient. We remain steadfast and I believe the business will come back, and we'll wait for that day. Sure, Joe. As you know, we're running three very different businesses, very distinct business to Singapore, Macao versus Las Vegas, of all of them, I view Las Vegas lease favorably. And for the reasons you mentioned, Las Vegas, especially our company, but the whole city, is dependent upon group and convention and banquet segment return. I see nothing indicates that 2020 would return at all. There's nothing in the horizon group here, group there, but nothing of consequence. And we cannot -- Las Vegas cannot perform without return of these segments. It cannot make money with limited hotel occupancy or in negligible occupancy midweek, maybe 50% capacity weekend. In essence, we're running a regional casino predicated upon driving businesses. We have airlift somewhere around 40% of what it was. And about 40% the occupancy, the plans is much less than it was previously. So we're in a world of hurt here in terms of Vegas. As far as looking ahead, I don't have a crystal ball into 2021. I remain pessimistic about group and convention. And the reason I say that is, if you believe in a -- if you believe in a vaccine or you believe this thing will eventually just burn off, whatever you believe. I still think the longest -- the slowest return of our business will be large deal group business because it tends to skew younger, it's more tech driven, and those people are more reluctant to travel. So I think we have to take a zero, in my opinion, for the rest of the year in terms of the return on group business and banquet business or any consequence. Could it be a one or two here and there, yes, but nothing material. I don't want to predict 2021 because I don't feel I have enough insight into what might happen to the vaccine or the virus and no way to forecast that. But I would be less than honest if I didn't tell you that Las Vegas is in a very difficult place. Unlike Macao, where there's a real, real strong desire and belief that we'll see things return much quicker in Macao this fall and I feel -- well, Singapore will talk about shortly. But Vegas is dependent on airlift, it's dependent on group and convention. It's not a casino-driven market anymore. So we're struggling here. I think I speak for Las Vegas Venetian and Palazzo but I assume that may translate to other properties as well. It's an amazing transition from -- we're making $0.5 billion a year, and we are hitting on all cylinders. And today, it's painful. And I think it remains painful for the immediate future. 20'21, I think you have to look to that as the turning point, and that would -- that depends on how you view this virus, vaccine situation. But I also caution you that large-scale businesses, like we are big-box businesses, may be the most troubled in terms of the customer consuming us to return to it. So in all the years as I've been here in Las Vegas, I've never felt more gloomier effect [ph] about what's happening in Las Vegas short term, hope. Long term, we can see a better day. Please. So as we've said, as a consistent theme over the last quarters, we're very focused on returns. Our Chairman is a very returns-focused guy. And I think his mandate has always been to maximize those returns. And I think you heard him on the last earnings call, and he's here today, so we'll probably have some additional commentary. You mentioned M&A, but I think that was done in the context before the benefit of the massive government stimulus programs were seen. And there was a belief that there might be an opportunistic way to take advantage of the environment and capitalize on great assets that could be purchased perhaps below replacement cost or perhaps in a cyclical trough where the acquisition could make our required returns work. And I think in this environment, given where we are today, there aren't a lot of those opportunities available. That being said, I think we'll continue to look. I think we have an opportunity if something comes around, and we'll continue to keep our eyes open. But at this point, we're still very returns-focused. I think we're not going to be an M&A driven shop. But at the same time, if something comes up that's incredibly compelling; I think we'll be happy to take a look at it. Robin, it's Rob. Nothing has been communicated by the government, whatsoever. And we'll remain -- waiting for their advice and counsel. But as of this time, nothing all has been said about extension or timetables. Yes. Again, I don't have the insight beyond what it's all hearsay. Just be clear, we're not getting official words from the government. But the consensus among those who seem to understand how the government thinks about this is, obviously, we're much more careful than we are here in the U.S., the tolerance is much lower for the spread of virus. But what we hear from various sources that the IVS, when it happens, it stays limited to Guangdong. And then the eventual movement into other provinces will gradual throughout the course of the fall. That's what we're being told. It won't be a green light and all thing opens up onetime. I think they're going to -- I think they're doing very orderly, and you see that with the quarantine. I think the IVS will be the next issue whenever that happens, hopefully soon later. But yes, I believe it's staggered throughout the fall, perhaps even beyond the fall. But I don't -- I've never even say this will be lights go on one day, and boom, China opens up to Macao. We've never heard that from anybody, and we heard from a lot of people. Yes. Well, you got one, please click it quickly, Sheldon. If you want more of the advice, bring all -- get your bazooka and click it. So, look, we're hopeful, Macao -- I think of all the places we operate, Singapore is one in the middle. Vegas is in the deep part of the pool. But Macao is such potential, we believe. So we're so excited to see that light switch go off and -- but we have to be patient and just wait for that day. That's one thing we should -- I mean, I think I'd say the obvious to you is because you've followed this space forever. But again, this is the world's greatest regional market. It's not air dependent. We don't need airlift. There's 10% of the customers come from air, the rest is sea and land. So, it's fascinating to me how people -- I mean, Macao is so accessible by land and by sea and not air dependent. In essence, what you see in regional markets, which is a quicker recovery, mimic, so I think you'll see in Macao. The minute those barriers come down, I think you'll see a lot of people coming in. They don't need airplanes. They'll need the social distance on the airplanes. It's a huge advantage of Macao, especially when the governments feel comfortable opening the borders. Next question? I'm sorry. Yes, it is. Very much so. I mean -- but we're hoping -- just to be clear, you may have know this, but the casino is open, you know that. Now, we're handicap, in a sense, there's only 300 live table games and 1,500 slot ETGs. But we reclaim all that is happening on the 27 this month. Obviously, we're -- that's a market hampered by airlift because -- it's kind of -- it's a hybrid market. It's got this local business because of all the affluent foreigners who reside in Singapore, which there are many, fortunately. Singapore being such extraordinary country to live and conduct the business, we're very fortunate of a strong foreign clientele that has PR status inside the Singapore borders who reside there permanently. Having said that, we love to have more airlift and love to see Malaysia come out. But yes, to answer your question, we feel very, very lucky, very fortunate what's happening in Singapore as we speak. The casino seeing customers, our occupancy was driven by -- mostly by casino next month. And obviously, a very strong casino occupancy month, and there'll be some cash demand as well from staycations from Singaporeans. The border is still closed to Malaysia, except for limited high visibility business folks. So, Singapore has handicapped, but they can make money. And it will make money. It's going to be a nice turnaround, more premature very fortunate that Singapore is coming back online. It's our most -- our best prospect as we speak today, a much better position than we are in Las Vegas. So yes -- but obviously, the maximum potential of that property to get back to $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion days. We need to see the airlift return. We need to see the casino fully operational. But we feel positive about what's happening in Singapore. We feel very fortunate that we've come out of this, and we're open and operational. And we're seeing customers, and we feel good about it. Yes. Well, we need -- the first thing obviously is the airlift, which I don't have any color -- any insight to help you with it. I hope it opens up. I don't see airlift being a real help to the Singapore property probably for the balance of this year. It remains pretty much a market within the borders of Singapore. There is a chance Malaysia opens up. They have COVID under control because they're very similar measures to Singapore. Given the relationship between the JV board and the two countries, there's a possibility of some limited leisure business travel opening up probably in Q4 to Malaysia. I don't see Indonesia. There is talk -- there's hope that they can open some business lanes up through China, but that's not happening today. But I will remind you, we're fortunate again, have a very affluent clientele of foreign people live in Singapore. I think we'll be pleased with the results of Singapore in the fall. But I don't see 2020 being a lot of air traffic in Singapore, foreign visitation. It doesn't seem to me to be in the cards for the foreseeable four or five months. We'll get first Sheldon on that. From the timing of the financial side? What do you want to hear? Patrick will take you through the financial side. On the timing, we are moving quickly on getting it completed, Felicia. It'll be pretty much done. Four Seasons done this fall. London are done interior wise Q1 of 2020, but a lot more work on exterior wise and there's other pieces to be done. We're going as fast as we can with the constraints of COVID. We've not pulled back in terms of trying to get it done. We're not holding back. We just have some constraints construction wise, but perhaps Patrick will take you through financial side. I think the question about what you market, the building is just open the doors and watch the customers come in. I feel very confident that pent-up demand will cover a lot of our marketing. We don't think an incent or do much more we've ever done. Macao is a frothy market when the barriers come down. So I don't see that need to incent or do things differently. There's open the doors, let it come. As far as the junkets remains a question mark. What does happen there, there's been all kinds of things, there's been issues that you read about in the press and you've covered in your discussion, Steve. And I think it remains to be seen what the trends that junkets to what the demand is. I know this is not the common thinking, but I'd want to believe the average customer, the mass business and pre-mass will come back strong and heavy from day one. And as the junkets will -- just let the market show us what it has and what the customer demand is and how much the junkets want to participate. I think that remains a question mark in my mind. But we are really confident that this is a market that doesn't need airlift, just needs to open the doors and watch people come back in and we can't wait for that day. I think the door is open. I think once you see a demand, you can make this -- in the blind that taking visibility as to how strong it comes back. I wouldn't do anything to execute demand and what it looks like in Macao because again, we have one advantage as no one talks about, but the Chinese customers not -- doesn't have optionality in terms of coming to the U.S. or going to Europe. So even leaving -- Singapore, so I think Macao, it becomes even more desirable in terms of the Chinese visitation. I wouldn't try to figure out the market until I see the demand side and the customers. Once that happens, they will make decisions. Patrick, you're right -- what do you want to? I think, we've worked very well with our -- Thomas, to your point, our retail portfolio is a very important part of the mix of our business. We remain believers and that will come back in a big way in Asia. But MBS has started to ramp already. Obviously, Macao is not. We've been very -- we've worked very hard to foster strong relationships with the tenants in both jurisdictions, and we did rent reduction, et cetera. We'll take a wait and see attitude once again. The tenants have worked hard to be - to work with us and not -- we all try to work in the same manner, a fair, open dialogue about how we see the future. I assume that this will mimic the casino hotel demand. As Singapore gets stronger day by day, the tenants are coming back. We've had a lot less business than we wanted to have, as compared to Orchard Road. That's sort of change. Now, the mix is coming back to us now the hotel is open. So I think it's very simple. We have 200-plus tenancies in Singapore. I think 800 tenancies in Macao. We take them one by one based on how we see the market treating them. There'll be some casualties. There's been some casualties already in some of these places, because of, obviously, the shutdown. But just like we will at the gaming side and the hotel side, I'd like to wait and see what demand looks like and until we renew those relationships, sort of, base rents, percentage rents. But something tells me that in both markets, we're going to see return to normalcy rather quickly. I think it mimics again what we're going to see in the gaming side. And as long as that hotel is still up, it will take time, especially, I think, in Singapore, because without the airlift, it's a local retail market. I think Macao will come back much quicker, because the airlift issue, once the borders open up, I think Macao should return to normalcy rather quickly. We're seeing -- there's still things on books -- we see Singapore as a starting point. We are seeing demand in Singapore, but I think people are very tend about committing. People are call -- there is inquiries, there's definitely bookings. But the caveat being that they can -- they can bow out within 90 days, there's plenty of room to quit, if they don't see demand. So I think the group is different. Corporate stuff is different than obviously the large-scale groups that require attendees. And I think what we're seeing is people are tend to be putting a foot in the order. But even Singapore, since you can't get there, how do you really make real commitments? I mean, if you want to come to Singapore with a large group, you can't fly into Singapore. So it's a Singapore-driven market only at this point. I think it's too murky, too unclear to talk about 2021 in Singapore. And same applies to Macao. Macao has a short booking window. And as you know, the challenge in Macao is that the gaming piece goes back strong, and I anticipate it will. It negates the need for much MICE business. If anything, it's an impediment to MICE because gaming demand is so strong. It takes the majority of the rooms. You can't put large-scale groups in Macao, because of rooming capacity. Our competitors won't participate anyway. So I think it's unfair to -- this far out to say what happens in Singapore without airlift being determined, I still think it's too early to call that situation. Yes there's inquiries. There's people talking to us, but everyone's scratched their heads saying what does happen, how do we get there, when do we get there? So I think it's too early to take the call. I think Japan, no one wanted to be in Japan more than Sheldon and the team here. We were very bullish in Japan. We spent a lot of time and money, and we're very hopeful. But the environment there just wasn't suitable to make kind of investment that this company demands in terms of returns. It didn't make -- we couldn't make it work. We sure tried. We spent endless time and endless dollars pursuing Japan. We wish we could have stayed. We wish the construct was more welcoming to the investor, but it wasn't. And I feel comfortable that we made the right choice. I think Shel was extremely -- the business there for decades was the biggest proponent. We're all disappointed, what's happened in Japan. But it didn't make economic sense. So, we're keen to invest. Obviously, when this all works out and things get better, especially in Asia, we're keen to be back looking for opportunities to be in Korea or other countries. We'd like to be investing. But it has the right environment. It has to be a country wants us to invest and wants to do the model that Sheldon has -- well, he's authored is a unique model. It's a unique -- it's a huge capital-intense model. It calls for a cooperative government understands all these investments and the needs for return. So, we continue to look at everything in Asia, and we're keen to do it. Sheldon, do you want to comment? We need more, more customers -- we need lots more. The truth is the hotels are running in this down mid-week, 20%, 25%, 30%; weekends, 50%, 60%. That doesn't work. They are only coming unless you can drive in market, so along the markets, such as international, but throughout the U.S. -- actually, we've had a very high-yielding, very strong customers because our marketing team has incented. We bought some great business in using our airplanes and our marketing, our lists. We see actually a very strong high end play in both slots and tables. Extraordinary amounts of players gone through here. The problem is, as you know, it takes a lot of different segments to make this company make a $0.5 billion in Las Vegas we did last year. We don't have any convention business, there's no yield on the week -- mid-week on the rumor side. You're seeing strong FIT demand weakened, but there's nothing else in there but FIT. Strong high-end casino demand. Our numbers might surprise you because you know how good they are in terms of the slot machines and the table yields. We're not -- yes, there's things in driving business, which is not very high demand gaming side. But again, Vegas has morphed into a hospitality-driven market. And I think a lot of people is confusing. Even people operate here surprised me sometimes that they're surprised how soft it is. Without the hotel being full, without the convention driving the rates midweek, without the bankrupt piece, we did here almost $200 million in banquet sales and massive margins. It's just very hard for our model to work, and I assume that's true in the entire marketplace. If you're running a large-scale building, like most of these buildings are, you're not getting by on gaming win, no matter how good it is. You're not getting by with 30%, 40% occupancy. If you're making money on a weekend, which we can, you're losing it back midweek, which we all do. And I don't think that picture is different from most. Just this company has been such an incredible success story in the convention banquet segments. We've driven so much business here. I mean, last year, again, I think we broke a 0.5 billion of EBITDA. But to do that, you can't run a hotel with these kind of occupancies. You can't run a no banquet facility. You can't rely on high rollers. It just doesn't work. Those days, in 1967 left. And so this is a new business in Las Vegas. And what allows you to build these multibillion-dollar buildings is the true IR nature of what Sheldon authored 20 years ago. I mean this town has moved away from the gaming dependent to a very diversified plan. And I don't know how you fix it until you get airlift that enables you and groups that feel comfortable coming back here and banquets coming back here, and that's just a fact of life, and I don't think we're alone in this thinking. So we remain hopeful that things will turn. But the Las Vegas year in July of 2020 is a very difficult place. And I hope it gets better, but that's the truth of the market today. Are you talking about, David, Macao? Look, you're talking to -- has been going to Macao for almost 40 years. And I don't think anybody is going there and see what I've seen could have any other rational belief. There's a number of factors. One is the propensity of gamble remains among the highest in the world. Two, Macao is a very seductive place. It has all the things you want. It's got high quality retail, high quality restaurants, high quality lodging. It's got enormous casino. They're plentiful and diverse. It's very accessible. And they can't go anywhere else. I mean, frankly, they're locked down, just like we are. No one's going to Europe. No one is going to the U.S. So if you're an affluent Chinese person, and Macao is such a -- it's become such a compelling place to visit. I mean, when I went there in the 1980s, it was all different world. In 2019, it's a stunning world of opulence, food, entertainment, retail. It has all the things that are seductive to tourists. So I have no doubt in my mind, not a -- I always doubt that Macao, when those doors open up, we'll see a lot of crane towards come back. The only good point to is do you believe the economy has weakened the consumer's ability to gamble, that's the call all you can make individually. I believe that will come back strong, again convinced Macao reservoir's quickly. Also, you should be advised, and I think you know this, that this virus for the U.S. is very difficult, I hear all the time, Americans wearing a mask, having your temperature, it's all so foreign to people in the U.S. It's so confusing. I was -- the story of there was that we got mask, they may put a mask, particular Walgreens was wearing mask and she was screaming about her first member right. It was a bizarre situation. It's not the case in Asia. People are very comfortable in mask, it's normal part of life there. So you have that factor, which is they're more comfortable with this virus environment. They've lived through it. They understand it. They wear a mask to comply and walk around Hong Kong today. So I think that bodes well as well. But again, I would land on Macao itself. It's such a wonderful place for the Chinese tours. They offer so many wonderful amenities. I have no concern at all, saying that wall comes down, that border wall comes down in terms of IVS, and they allow provinces open back up, I remain completely convinced that, that business will come back very quickly, and it'll come back in multiple segments. The two caveats, I think, would be, one, higher view of the junket business is a bit confusing right now. And two, do you believe the consumer has adequate spending money in their pocket to partake. I think they do. So I feel very -- as good as I feel about Macao, I just wait for that day to happen to be validated. But that's one person's opinion, but I believe it's a shared sentiment among those who have been to Macao many, many times and watch that place in action. I think it will look like a lot of things here in the U.S. Won't look that different, will it. You'll see we're wearing masks. You're going to see temperature checks. You'll see extreme cleaning. But by the way, it happened pretty much -- it's been happening for years in Asia with the -- since the SARS times. It's a much different -- one of the most fascinating things I ever saw in Macao was, the smoking rooms. When I first went there, everyone was worried smoking would decimate the market and you can't smoke. They're not going to come, and everyone's was convinced. Well, what's hilarious to me was, they all stood in the smoking room smoking, making best of smoking room, dictating to a guy, that, this, that, that. It didn't deter Macau people from gambling. It didn't deter the Chinese consumer. The COVID virus, they'll accept the fact there's risk, they'll wear the mask, they're very compliant and they'll do right thing as far as being respectful of social distancing. It may be impactful in terms of the table counts, table occupancies, and that will be an issue. We're fortunate we have 1,500, 1,600 table games there and thousands and thousands slot machines. So, do I think it's going to be hurtful? Maybe in weekends when we're full capacity, and the place is jammed, yes, possibly. But I look forward to addressing those problems when they happen. Thank you. Appreciate it."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope all of you, your friends and families are in good health during these challenging times. The COVID-19 pandemic is unlike anything I've ever seen in my business career. While this pandemic brings many challenges, it also presents each of us with an opportunity to make a difference and to provide assistance to all those who have been impacted.  Our company is fortunate to have the financial strength to enable us to focus our efforts on the safety and security of our team members and customers, and are making a difference to those in need in each of our host communities in Macao, Singapore and Las Vegas.  We don't know how long this pandemic will last, but we are confident that travel and tourism spending in each of our markets and around the world will eventually recover. As surely as day follows night, people will travel again, shop again, come together again to enjoy entertainment and social interaction, to exchange ideas and to conduct business. Focusing on the support for our team members and communities today will position us to recover more quickly as the impact of the pandemic eventually subsides; it is also the right thing to do.  Our optimism about an eventual recovery, coupled with our financial strength enables us to continue the execution of our previously announced capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore. We believe these investments will strengthen our leadership position in each of these markets and will provide a larger platform for future growth with travel and tourism spending eventually recovering.  In Macao we are making great progress in our $2.2 billion capital investment program with The Londoner Macao and The Grand Suites at Four Seasons. In addition to these large projects with which you are already familiar, we\u2019re moving full speed ahead with a number of other investments which we think will increase both the effectiveness and the diversification of our integrated resorts portfolio.  Now is not the time to pause or slow down investment in Macao. We see the opportunity and possess both the financial strength and the strategic commitment to make additional investments. With our effort to accelerate investment in Macao, we intend to play our part in supporting the local economy in the short term and ensure we are in the leading position to capture the eventual recovery in tourism spending. I remain steadfast in my belief that Macao has the opportunity to become one of the greatest business and leisure tourism destinations in the world, and the MICE capital of Asia.  As I've said on many occasions, we welcome the opportunity to invest billions of dollars and additional investment and contribute to Macao\u2019s diversification and evolution into Asia\u2019s leading leisure and business tourism destination.  Turning to our investment in the expansion of Marina Bay Sands, Singapore, we remain excited to be a part of Singapore's continued growth, as a leading business and tourism \u2013 and leisure tourism destination. We continue to make progress on the MBS expansion. We\u2019ll provide additional updates in the future. We will also continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands to enhance the customer experience in advance of the expansion.  Finally, turning to Las Vegas, the eventual recovery could take more time here than in Asia, but we are confident that Las Vegas\u2019s best days are ahead of it and that Las Vegas will remain the greatest leisure and business tourism destination in the United States.  Let me now spend a moment on capital allocation. Maintaining a strong balance sheet makes great business sense, while we weather the storm caused by this pandemic. The balance sheet strength will enable us to invest in promising future growth opportunities and we\u2019re positioning our company to deliver industry leading growth in the years ahead.  While we have suspended our dividend program, we remain confident that the recovery in travel and tourism spending, and the strength of our business model will enable us to deliver both growth and the return of capital to shareholders in the future. I assure you I have not said \u2018yay dividends and yay buybacks\u2019 for the last time. I'm looking forward to saying them again and hopefully very soon.  Thank you for joining us on the call today and now we\u2019ll take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan. You may now ask your question.\nJoe Greff: Good afternoon everybody.\nA - Sheldon Adelson: Yeah, hi Joe.\nJoe Greff: Hope all of you and your families are well and healthy. So my first question relates I guess to things that we would Macao travel impediments or restrictions, IBS, Airlift, Ferry, the quarantine imposition by Guangdong. I know this is a tough question, but do you have a sense of when those things start to get relaxed and then maybe more importantly than timing on those four buckets, more on how those things will eventually roll out. \nA - Sheldon Adelson: This is Sheldon. I can only quote some of the rumors that we've heard. We have nothing positive and nothing definite, but the rumors we've heard that it's going to start in sometimes the middle or end of May. \nRobert Goldstein: Joe just to elaborate. I think to Sheldon's point, we follow the same sources you do, perhaps ours a little better. We do believe there'll be some opening in May perhaps or June we're hopeful, but as you know it won't be a flick of the switch and it\u2019s all different timing to which provinces.  We\u2019re hoping for first the IBS is reinstated, that\u2019s pivotal, and then the 14 day quarantine for re-entry into China is equally important as you know. I think the IBS, the first place in the 14 day quarantine, the first place we\u2019ll see some bright lights will be in Guangdong and then provinces will follow throughout the summer. It won't be one flick of the switch and all provinces open equally. I think though as you know Guangdong is pivotal. Once that's open, it opens the door for others to follow.  It will be a gradual process and the one thing we're grateful for is that the majority of our income is derived from Asia, which as you know has been through these situations, be it SARS or be it Swine Flu or in the past they are more conversant with the problems and so we think the recovery there is going to be back to gambling, back to visitation, will come rather quickly, but it will come in gradual phases throughout the summer. It will be Guangdong and then other provinces to follow. Airlift maybe still muted for a while in terms of how much - I think trains will be running.  We feel pretty confident we\u2019ll be back to a much better place this summer and then a much better place in the fall, and we have seen evidence of pent up demand like crazy from our customers who are asking when and we talk to them pretty regularly. So we feel pretty good about the return of Macao first, far beyond what we're going to see in the U.S.\nJoe Greff: Excellent! Great! And then just another question related to Macao and maybe this is a question for Patrick or Dan on the call. Thank you for including in the slide deck the monthly OpEx for Macao, the $110 million. How much of that $110 million relate to the premium and base mass segment? And so in other words, you know when that \u2013 those segment's come back, you're looking at incremental margins much higher than say the 35% to 36% that the margins are overall. So in other words, what would those margins be at that 35% plus be without those fixed charges that you're currently sustaining without much revenue growth or much revenue? \nPatrick Dumont : Hey Joe, it\u2019s Patrick; thanks for the question. I think if you look back at our margin over the last couple of years, as the premium mass and mass business grew, those margin areas are probably appropriate for a recovery under normal run rate conditions. And so if you think about our expenses broken into categories, our largest expense is really gaming tax, which is variable, followed by our payroll which is not, and then a whole host of other things related to property operations, fixed property costs and things related to just general consumables.  And so some of those things are variables, but it will be very hard to characterize and say a particular market segment would result when it started back in you know call it higher margins because of this trough. And I think the way to think about it is, we've been very focused on managing towards margins over the last couple of years anyway. And so the team there and through our work together, we've been very focused on increasing our cash flow as we grew revenue in higher margin segments.  So I don't think you should look at a rebound through a particular segment and say that will expand margins. I think what you can do is take a look at this and say our business already had plenty of leverage in it. We have plenty of liquidity to manage through this very difficult time, and then when things do rebound we\u2019ll continue to be focused on margins as we were before and look to control the costs that we can control. And I think to look at it on a segment basis would be difficult, because in reality we have to open the properties.  And so you know we're going to have strength in every segment. I'd like to believe that when things recover we're going to see that strength that we saw in 2019 and 2018 and the years before. We had a great trajectory heading into 2020 and I'd like to believe that we\u2019ll continue to maintain the very strong operating leverage that we had on a run rate basis when things recover. \nJoe Greff: Great, thank you so much guys. \nPatrick Dumont : Thanks Joe. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. You may now ask your question.\nFelicia Hendrix: Hi! Thank you so much. Great to hear you all, and Sheldon, definitely wanted to thank you and the company for all you've done to get important PPE to the healthcare workers out there. So Patrick\u2026\nA - Sheldon Adelson: I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hear what you said.\nFelicia Hendrix: I just \u2013 I was thanking you for all that you and the company have done to get the important PPE to healthcare workers. \nA - Sheldon Adelson: Great, thank you. \nFelicia Hendrix: Yeah, thank you.\nSheldon Adelson: We\u2019re still doing it. We got a plane \u2013 we have sent four more 747 trips to go to China to pick up more of the masks and PPE. So listen, something we do like that potentially saves lives and it's nothing for us, particularly the fuel \u2013 the cost of fuel is nothing. So we could fly over there and come back at a very low cost. \nFelicia Hendrix: That's great. Patrick, just to stay on the topic of the OpEx and the monthly cash burn, one of the things that we've kind of struggled with as we\u2019ve tried to model in you know a gradual recovery is kind of how to flex that cash burn. So you know obviously you're not going to go from 110 back to your full run rate, right, and it's going to ramp up. So is the right way to think about it is just kind of like \u2013 and I know that most of its \u2013 a lot of it\u2019s variable, so the way we\u2019re thinking about it is like to just kind of like pro-rata, like run it, rate it versus in terms of how like you're ramping up.  So is that the right way to think about it and more importantly I'm wondering you know, as you kind of work to really mitigate costs as you've been in almost like shutdown mode, are there things that are going to kind of stick or are there going to be cost mitigation efforts that you've made now that are going to benefit you in the future. \nPatrick Dumont : So, kind of a two part question there. You know, I appreciate the detail. I think the way to think about margin recovery is that when you look as it part of an uncontrolled operating expenses, you know call it across \u201919. That represents a little bit more than 60% of our total expense structure. And so when you think about that and you think about sort of our controlling operating expenses, that was kind of in the 38% context.  And so what you'll see is that those uncontrollable expenses which are mostly gaming tax, which actually was about 60% of that, you know of that little more than 60, about 60% of that is gaming tax, that's really going to drive the way the margins look, because we will start getting operating leverage. So if you think about that other 38% that's controllable, some of that\u2019s variable.  Our payroll, although you\u2019d say that it was something that is under control, you know we've taken the [doctor] [ph] and that we want to keep our team together, and so that's something that we're very focused on. So when you think of our two largest expenses as the gaming tax and as the payroll, you can kind of walk into what that margin might look like during this, call it transition period of ramp up.  So will we run, you know call it the 33% EBITDA margin we were running before right out the gate? Unless there's an immediate snapback recovery, that might be a little challenged. But when you look at the expenses that we have controlled and you look at the marketing expenses and the way that we look at the other parts of the business, we've been able to control costs in a very disciplined way. You know we went \u2013 you know the business has experienced other troughs before and we've always managed expenses to ensure liquidity and to ensure the proper recovery when it comes around.  And so I think, are there some margin opportunities? Sure, but I think it also depends on what segment comes back and when. As you know that the junket segment is obviously much lower margin and less contribution, providing then the mass and premium mass segment. So if we get huge volumes of mass business, our margins are going to look tremendous right out of the gate.  So I think for us a lot of it depends on what segment of the business you call the recovery on first. So I think given that expense structure, given the \u2013 your view that you may have on recovery of the business, you can kind of formulate a transitional margin process for the business. \nFelicia Hendrix: Okay, that's really helpful, thank you. And Patrick, this is probably also for you as well. You know obviously you guys have been doing a lot of stress testing on the company, led you to the dividend decision. Just wondering, you know how deeply have the stress tests cut into the liquidity cushion, and would you be willing to take on more debt? And if so, where would you see that maxing out and then what milestones would you have to reach to reinstate the dividend? \nPatrick Dumont : So I'll leave the last part of the question for the Chairman, since that's really something that falls to him, but I think the key thing for us here is that as we mentioned before in prior earnings calls, is we\u2019re very focused on looking at the liquidity of the company; very focused on looking at the long term objectives of the Chairman.  Our highest and best use of capital is reinvestment in high-growth projects, and if you look at our track record on return on invested capital and the projects that our Chairman has led, it's tremendous. And so our goal is to preserve that liquidity and also to continue and invest in our key markets to drive that high ROIC, and so if you look at the Chairman's notes and the strategies he\u2019s laid out, we are continuing to invest in these markets to ensure that we get the high returns going forward when the market does recover.  That being said, we look at a variety of scenarios. We have a lot of different downside cases, a lot of different liquidity scenarios, a lot of different CapEx scenarios, so that we ensure we can analyze things to a satisfactory in which the Board feels comfortable making a decision with the Chairman and that's what we've done here.  So if you look at page eight in the deck, you can see that we\u2019ve laid out the cash and available liquidity. You can see that right now under the current conditions as we presented them, we can go more than 18 months and invest in completing the projects in Macao and continue along with Marina Bay Sands new developments, and so that's very encouraging for us. We feel very strong about our balance sheet position, our Board feels very confident in our ability to weather the storm.  And that being said, if for some reason we felt like we needed access to the capital markets, we spend a lot of time working to ensure that we had access to the most deep and most liquid market in the world, which is the high grade bond market, and so as an investment grade company, the investment grade bond market opened very quickly after the impacts of coronavirus hit the capital markets, and issuers do have access, and we feel very comfortable at our ability.  We feel great about the high grade markets and at some point if the Board makes a determination with management that it makes sense to raise additional equity, we\u2019ll have the ability to do so, we're very confident about that. But at this time we're very comfortable with our liquidity on-hand; we\u2019ve shown the analysis on page eight and you know we're looking forward to a strong recovery, so we can benefit from the huge CapEx developments that we've been undertaking during this time.  And then one last question, I think the second part of that, was that you directed something that would probably best be answered by the Chairman, which is kind of view on dividends and when the dividends may come back and what that looks like. And so if that\u2019s okay, Sheldon, I\u2019ll turn the call back to you. \nA - Sheldon Adelson: Thank you, Patrick. We will reinstate the dividend after discussing it with the Board of Directors. When things get back to where we were, it\u2019s very simple. I don't think it's a long time away. If the rumors are \u2013 Macao is a big percentage of our, both GGI, Gross Gaming Income and our EBITDA, and I think that is the level that will come back first. Then probably Singapore and Vegas, in that order perhaps.  So if what Rob says is true, the people are dying and anxious to get back to \u2013 no, we don't want them to die \u2013 get back to Macao to enjoy themselves, then it should come back sooner rather than later.  Listen, I'm the largest shareholder, my family and I, and we want the dividend reinstated more than you do. So if you could see the amount of money that we're not getting, I would certainly like to have that in our savings account, so we\u2019ll reinstate the dividend as soon as we get back to earning some money. \nFelicia Hendrix: Okay, thank you very much. \nSheldon Adelson: You're welcome. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line as Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question.\nThomas Allen: Thank you. So I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out what the business is going to look like in the future when things come back. Macao reopened at the end of February and there were a couple weeks there before the travel restrictions went to place in Guangdong and got stricter Macao. Can you just qualitatively talk to us about what business was like then and how social distancing measure has impacted your business?  And on a similar vein, can you just talk about how Singapore was performing? I know you put the monthly numbers on slide seven, but just qualitatively how social distancing measures were impacting Singapore during the time period before it closed. Thank you. \nRobert Goldstein: Thomas, it's Rob. I think in Singapore social distancing did have an impact, because we\u2019re limited there in terms of size of the operation. I think we\u2019ll have an impact on Singapore in the future. The question is how long those social distancing [inaudible] stay in place and we just don't know, but it will have an impact, negative in terms of Singapore. In Macao I think we\u2019re in a much different position because the scale and size of operations enable us to \u2013 we have so much square footage there and so many more slots and tables that I think we can do much better business in Macao than in Singapore vis-\u00e0-vis social distancing. But I think that the area you talked about, the time periods obviously were impacted not just by social distancing, but you know demand slowed because it was more difficult to get there and there was more concerns about access and it was a confusing time in both markets in terms of visas getting in, getting out of quarantine. I don't think it's an adequate snapshot when rebound comes.  I think once in Macao we opened the doors back up in the 14 day quarantine and the IBS team is back in place. I think we'll be able to do quite well and the social distance will have a minimal impact in Macao, again the size and scale of our operations in the numerous table slots and square footage.  I think in Singapore we\u2019re going to have a lot of demand. I spoke to the team this morning and they were laughing about the amount of people calling to complain about the fact we\u2019re closed and want to come gamble. I do believe we'll see a lot of demand in Singapore. I am concerned that may have a negative impact. I cannot tell you obviously what that'll be, but I think we\u2019ll have more demand come this summer, especially come fall, and Singapore could be adversely impacted by social distancing, so it remains to be seen. \nThomas Allen: Nice job. And then just as my follow up, when you announced the dividend cut, in the prepared commented it said miscellaneous [ph] and I think you wrote, \u2018I see many strategic opportunities for our company precisely because our financial strength.\u2019 Could we just have some more detail on this comment? I think some people are interpreting it to imply that you would be interested in M&A. Is that the right perception? I think Patrick talked about high growth opportunities earlier. I just want to clarify those comments.\nA - Sheldon Adelson: I'd like to reaffirm what you're thinking. It does mean that we're interested in M&A. One of the reasons why we're the biggest and we've got the best balance sheet in the industry, our market cap up until this \u2013 till this virus came, was equal to the combined market capital of all our competitors in the U.S. combined. So it's \u2013 I'm not going to give up on developing integrated resorts. I'm going to add on to our strategic thinking or strategic priorities that we can acquire, because most of the other companies, one, don't have the balance sheet that we do, and they don't have the potential market that we do, and we can go in and acquire one or more operations that if \u2013 of course the price has to be right and so are now taken on the strategy of both acquiring and building and developing. \nThomas Allen: And if I can just quickly follow up on that, any changes to your views on what markets you'd like to be in? \nSheldon Adelson: Not really, but we've always wanted \u2013 we\u2019ve always said that Asia is the best place for us. Because number one, in this virus shutdown the agents have been through this for a long time, for several times, so they are used to it. And when it opens up again, they're just going to come back and continue, maybe at a higher pace to make up for lost time that they have experienced. So Asia has got the population, is the most inclined to play, to gamble than other populations. So it looks like if we can find something good in Asia we'd certainly like to do that. \nThomas Allen: Thank you. \nSheldon Adelson: Either to acquire or to build. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Steven Wieczynski with Stifel. You may now ask your question. \nSteven Wieczynski: Yeah you guys, good afternoon. Rob so maybe you can help us think about the Vegas market a little bit at this point, but obviously with what's going on, you probably have seen a drastic slowdown in convention traffic. But wanted to you know understand what you're seeing in terms of the folks that did have convention meetings on the book. Are they willing to rebook at a later date or are they holding out at this point? \nRob Goldstein : Yeah, good question. We see a different path in Vegas than in Asia. Again, Sheldon referenced not the comfort, but the exposure Asia\u2019s had to the viruses and these kinds of things. As you know when your applying to Asia, you know temperature testing and mass are kind of the way it works over there anyway. So I think that the U.S. has never experienced on our shores these kinds of thing.  So as it relates to the group market, I'm surprised. I just talked to George this morning, who runs our building here, George Markantonis. He's saying strong demand in August from multiple groups and he feels the demand is there. The question is going to be Airlift in the Las Vegas. I don't know how Airlift will look in the 90 days. I don't know how you know the economic impact in terms of how Americans will spend money to think about being here, but group business appears to be out there for August and into the fall. They are not canceling the 21; they are rebooking into late summer and fall. I think demands there \u2013 I spoke to some of our competitors, the same thinking applies there.  I don\u2019t think Vegas has a problem with getting whose back into place. That we have the proper social distancing, the proper etiquette in place to protect people, and I think that's going to be, it looked like Asia which is a lot of social distance, a lot of controls to make sure it's as safe as we can make it, cleanliness and etcetera. But apparently George thinks the demand is there and I've heard that from multiple companies in town. I thought they\u2019ll push back in \u201921, but they haven\u2019t. Its August, September, October and November pretty strong demand, so\u2026\nSheldon Adelson: I can tell your coming from that business myself. This is Sheldon. They can't \u2013 a lot of the companies, both private and association wise are relying upon their shows to expand their own businesses and to do what it is they usually do with the show; research, recruitment, etcetera, and so they don't want to give up on that. It\u2019s not - we can only have it at this time, and we can \u2013 if we don\u2019t have it at this time, we are not going to ever have it again, that's not the case at all. We don\u2019t have it and make up for the loss of time as soon as they possibly can. \nSteven Wieczynski: Okay, got you. And then Patrick, you give a lot of color around the dividend, the dividend cut and maybe this is for you or Sheldon, but was there ever the thought \u2013 I mean it seems like your liquidity position is very strong, your balance is very strong. Was there every the thought of keeping some small dividend in place just to maybe keep a little bit of a different investor base included in your stock for the time being or is it always just kind of 100% cut or keep it? \nSheldon Adelson : This is not \u2013 this is Sheldon. We haven't eliminated the dividend, we\u2019ve just suspended it, and yes, we could come down to a cut rather than a total suspension. We'll see what happens; how fast we open places and what kind of income we are going to experience.  Listen, I\u2019m in your \u2013 we are all in the same boat. As I said, I own the largest amount of stock, my family and I, of anybody and I want to see the dividend recover and to maintain it as long as possible. \nSteven Wieczynski: Okay, great. Thanks guys, I appreciate it. \nSheldon Adelson: You\u2019re welcome. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. You may now ask your question. \nShaun Kelley : Hi, good afternoon and I want to echo the sentiments that I hope everybody's safe and healthy. Just wanted to follow-up on maybe the Singapore recovery, because this market is \u2013 you know it's relatively unique to Las Vegas Sands. I appreciate all the extra color and disclosure you gave there. Can you maybe Rob give us a little bit more color on just sort of the current customer mix there and how you expect maybe that to trend as Asia kind of reopens, maybe between you know kind of your VIP customers and a little bit of the mass market there. Where's it coming from and how do you think the source markets are going to react in that market. \nRobert Goldstein: Well, currently as you know the customer mix there is zero since we are closed till June 1. The team is pretty confident that we'll get opened in June. It doesn't pretty much concern that it will be extended beyond this. They seem like they can \u2013 had you saw the journal this morning, the majority of the problem is in the \u2013 has been isolated. I think Paul and Andrew and all the guys there told me this morning, they feel pretty confident we\u2019ll open in June. So local market was thriving and they think we\u2019ll thrive. In fact they were talking about the amount of people calling to complain that they couldn't gambles. We feel pretty confident that the local market will bounce back immediately, and be pretty strong actually because it's an activity people enjoy being part of in Singapore and we are very confident that rebounds really quickly in June too.  The local market, these foreign local markets, meeting Indonesia, Malaysia, I\u2019m not too strong on, because I think that those countries are facing challenges. I'm not sure the borders will even be open to those people, but I feel less aggressive in terms of rebound of our local market thus far and meeting again the countries nearby. Indonesia, Malaysia, a bit of struggle right now. I think we\u2019ll be slow to see t that return. I think we\u2019ll be quick to see return to China, if we get open, the border is open and the Chinese are able to come. I think that will cover rather quickly.  I think Singapore becomes positive right away in June, and then ramps up throughout the summer, but it will miss some key elements of local foreign markets surrounding the neighborhood.  I don't think Malaysia or Indonesia will be simple to get back to Singapore for the summer. I do think China and local play will be strong. I know local play will be strong because it drove our business prior to closing and we hear anecdotally that people are really frustrated and want to go back to gambling in the casinos.  Well, also as you mentioned, you know Shaun you know, you've been to Asia enough, but the idea of wearing a mask or social distancing or thermometer checks will not be difficult for the customers in local Singaporeans, nor Chinese's visitors, they'll except it, they\u2019ll deal with it and as you know the high end bankrupt business anyway is people in rooms two or three and in large rooms, so no problem there.  The only thing I'm concerned about is, if we get into a mass business, there again quickly is what we may lose \u2013 the spread can be difficult vis-\u00e0-vis the main gaming floor, because we'll be social distancing the slot machines etcetera. But once again, like a lot of markets we have a lot of very high end who play both slot ETG and table. I think we accommodate.  We may be at risks where it relates to masses of people coming in and the slot machines not having enough capacity and saying the tables mass. No risk on the high end mass or risk on the mass.  And again, I think Singapore is going to be like Macao, quick to recover. Unlike the U.S. which I think is more drastic and slower. Their ability to acclimate to this environment has improved in the past. They've lived through SARS, they\u2019ve lived through Swine Flu, they\u2019ve lived through a lot of things and they always are going to come back and they come back much quicker than we anticipate.  So we feel bullish with the caveat that you know our foreign business around us, our neighbor's foreign business might be pushed back into the fall and not be there. We feel strongly our high end Chinese business will cover rather quickly. We know it will, because the demand is there. \nShaun Kelley : Great! I really appreciate all the detail on that Rob. And then sort of the other way to split out the trajectory recovery in Macao, I think you talked a little bit about the restrictions there and the difficult read in March, but did you see so what we were able to see in March. I mean was it really that VIP was the only thing or was the primary market that was available at that time, just given the broader travel restrictions, is that kind of the way to read the data that we have thus far. Is that kind of what \u2013 a little bit of what you saw in that market just so we can characterize it for investors?\nRobert Goldstein : Yeah, I wish I can give you a better color, but we just saw such a turn down, now that the business has turned out. People \u2013 I read these things, at the high end people will come back first or the premium mass to come back to the mass mass. I don't think we saw evidence of that in those two weeks. I think is was so confusing and the restrictions etcetera.  I just don\u2019t think there was good evidence of what\u2019s going to happen in the future. What I do believe is that China is going back to work, they're going back to travel and when the IVS and the 14 day quarantine are taken away, I think all segments come back and come back rather healthy. I think by \u2013 you know by late summer, early fall we are going to see some nice profitability out of our Asia properties. By late fall, by you know thanksgiving or October, I think you\u2019ll see very strong return to a better time over there.  We feel just extremely confident that Asia gets better quicker and you are seeing already in China with the travel restrictions being eased. What I don't know is the province by province access into Macao, how that will happen, but it will happen and I think there's been a strong claim made by the Macao government to get started, they're hoping to see the restrictions eased.  I just don't think the two weeks, three weeks could be really a strong indicator of how it\u2019s going to come back. I think it comes back across all segments. I'm not a believer it's just going to be the high end. I believe it\u2019s going to need plenty of mass people as well. \nShaun Kelley : Thanks Rob. The optimism is definitely refreshing, so I appreciate it. \nRobert Goldstein : Thank you, we're optimistic. The world will recover. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line in Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. \nStephen Grambling: Hi, good afternoon. I\u2019ll eco the well wishes to all of you and your families and also Felicia\u2019s on the personal protective equipment as my wife is actually one of those healthcare workers needing it, so thank you.  My first question is a follow-up on the comments around M&A. Can you elaborate on the guidelines that may dictate whether you would pursue individual assets versus whole companies? How willing regulators may or may not be to these types of transactions and where you generally would expect the biggest synergy potential? \nRobert Goldstein : Sheldon, you want to take that or do you want us to take it here in the office. \nSheldon Adelson: Take it there. \nPatrick Dumont : Okay. So its Patrick, and thanks for the question. I think you know one thing that you should sort of look at in terms of the lens we might examine M&A up through \u2013 it\u2019s just on our long term views on returns, and so you the Chairman has been very strict about the way we deploy capital in order to ensure that we get the right returns to justify things and that's always been true in developments and it will certainly be true through any M&A transactions.  And so I think the way we are thinking about it is, and from the discussions that we've had, just around trying to be opportunistic, we are looking to see high quality assets where they are in key markets where it may be cheaper to buy them to build, and you may find something that is attractive and fits into our overall strategy in the long run, and I think we're going to be very returns focused.  Clearly our industry is heavily regulated and we're going to have to ensure a proper compliance as we always do, and we are going to have to look very carefully at those opportunities in that context. And I think you know it's not as if this is something that will happen immediately. This is going to evolve over time and we\u2019re going to have an opportunity to take a very hard and disciplined look and see if any of those opportunities are attractive to the Chairman of the board. And so I think that's kind of how we'll think about it. \nStephen Grambling: Thanks and then maybe a follow-up on Shaun\u2019s question around Marina Bay Sands. You talked to the revenue trajectory, but can you just remind us of the puts and takes that might impact that property's margins relative to others as we think about the reramp since it looks like you had very solid margins this quarter and it looks like even the OpEx per day in the zero revenue is better than peers. Thanks. \nPatrick Dumont: So I think overall in Marina Bay Sands, the margins in that property are really tremendous. I think a lot of that has to do with the original strategy that goes back to the Chairman\u2019s view that creating a very high quality with integrated resorts and multi-amenities to the highest level would produce high margins, and you see the results since the history of the opening of the property. That strategy has been spot on and it\u2019s really delivered. It's been a tremendous asset and has driven tourism and has really contributed to the market of Singapore, and I think it's been great.  I think to Rob's comments earlier, we know that there's a lot of pent-up demand and you know I think the opportunity here for us is to look at it for the long run. I think we're very focused on deploying capital there. We have a bunch of projects to help it enhance and improve the offering at Marina Bay Sands that we think will be margin enhancing and cash flow enhancing.  I think we're very focused on the development in Tower 2. You know the Chairman's vision there is great and we're very excited to get that arena open. We think that will add to the tourism offering of Singapore. We already have some market test about that, because we have the \u2013 you know we obviously have the arena in Macao that we operate and it's a great tourism asset and it works very well with the mass business and premium mass business. So we see a corollary there in Singapore where we can drive significant visitation from the around and catchment area out of that arena.  So I think if you look at Singapore over the next couple years, we're going to see what we hope is very high value returns on the new deployed capital, in a market that continues to maintain very high margin structure. And so, while we don\u2019t know exactly the pace of recovery that we\u2019ll see today, we do know that in the long run and as Rob said when things were covered because of the demand, we're going to be poised to take advantage of it and continue to deliver very high margins and strong cash flow. So that's kind of how we think of that. \nStephen Grambling: Thanks so much for all the color and perspectives. Best of luck! \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. You may now ask your question. \nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, thank you. Thanks everyone for the comments. I think this one\u2019s probably best for you, as you think about kind of the near to medium term and maybe make the assumption that specifically in the Macao I would imagine the two sub-segments of your gaming business will ramp at different speeds. Have you guys adjust strategically at all to maybe pivot business over more towards a VIP customer that might be more pronounced [inaudible] or do not see it that way. \nRobert Goldstein : We had a little problem hearing you. Are you saying that \u2013 we couldn\u2019t catch all that. But you are saying that you think VIPs are going to ramp much quicker than mass? \nCarlo Santarelli : Well, I'm asking if that is your opinion and then if you came in the business at all differently. So I kind of wanted to read your perspective on that? \nRobert Goldstein : No, we\u2019re not going to think that way. We believe the mass premium \u2013 we believe the pent-up demand is real in all segments and if anything, I think it will be a mistake to think that way. We believe this is going to open up to a lot of business come this summer and the fall.  The social distance, we\u2019ll have to work through, but I think Asians and Chinese are as they open that market up, open their country up, as those quarantine barriers come down and the IBS comes up, I do think we are going to see a return on all segments. We are pretty confident the Macao is also making some money this summer, and a lot of money come fall. And again I'll be redundant here, but the Asians, we've never seen this kind of a virus on our shores here in the U.S. where we\u2019ve kind of taken aback and shell shocked by it. Asia has seen it numerous times, they understand it, they dealt with it.  You guys Hong Kong is open and operating. It never closed in terms of retail and restaurants and they're walking around with gloves and mask and sanitizers and temperature checks. Everything is open in Hong Kong in terms of the restaurants retail and I think their statistics are pretty excellent relative to the rest of the world. They can deal with it and Macao will deal with it and I think visitation will be \u2013 I think it'll be a mistake to try to handicap which segment is back first. I think they all come back and we're pretty anxious to see that happen in the 60 days with the first phase and then hopefully by late summer it really kicks in all the way.  Our job is to provide a safe environment for our employees and for our customers, so they keep coming and there is no reinfection. But again, unlike the U.S. which I think people are concerned, even Nevada are having a hard time getting opened again, because the people are so scared and don\u2019t have any idea.  Hong Kong, right now you can go out for dinner, you can go shopping. So they\u2019ve kind of come to terms with much more comfortably than we have. But I think it's a mistake to try to figure out which segment resurrects quickest. I think they all come back pretty quickly. \nCarlo Santarelli : Great! Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. And just one follow-up as it pertains to Marina Bay Sands. It looks like just timing of CapEx has shifted a little bit up to where it was. Could you guys just kind of provide an outline for maybe the key milestones of that project and how you kind of foresee the construction process? \nRobert Goldstein : Sorry, are you referring \u2013 so page 11 has our CapEx expectations in the slide presentation. You\u2019re referring to the expansion, so the new Tower for Marina Bay Sands? \nCarlo Santarelli : Yeah, just in terms of the timeline of construction and what not. \nRobert Goldstein : So I think what we\u2019ve laid out here is pretty consistent with our thinking today. I think we're really not going to start any heavy expenditure until the back half of \u201921, and then we'll sort of follow as quick an execution schedule as we can follow. It's funny, the Chairman always says to us, \u2018You know I build a Venetian in less than two years. You guys should do the same.\u2019 So we are going to do the best that we can do to be as aggressive as we can be, because really we want to add these assets to the tourism portfolio of Singapore as quickly as possible.  Tokyo, I think if you look in Macao, and you look at kind of the trajectory of our latest projects, which was really from the ground up the Parisian, you can kind of see the distribution there in some of our prior presentations about how CapEx progressed. Some of that is influenced by labor availability. You know in Singapore we\u2019d like to believe that in this particular market we\u2019ll have the ability to pursue the schedule we\u2019ve kind of laid out there where the majority is coming across \u201922, clean up in \u201823 and then we'll see what happens. Maybe there\u2019ll be some in \u201824 as of right now, we're not sure.  So I think our goal is to try to get this thing open as quickly as possible once we get the proper approvals from the government of Singapore, you know with obviously with their support. And just to highlight, we do have a delayed draw financing for that project and so that project is financed in advance and it's the same bank group that we've been with for years that also holds the credit facility there in Singapore.  So we're continuing to make progress; we are working on a time line there; we are trying to work as quickly as we can given the current environment and you know we'll continue to keep you updated in upcoming quarters, but we\u2019d like to pursue the schedule as aggressively as we can. \nPatrick Dumont: For what it's worth Carlo, we also built and when we do open-up this summer, our Four Seasons is fully opened, operational to a 90 keys and then by the end we\u2019ll have the London done as far as the outside and not the fa\u00e7ade. So we're moving quickly. We have 3,000 workers on site right now to finish those projects. \nCarlo Santarelli: Great! Thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Instinet. You may now ask your question. \nHarry Curtis: Good afternoon everyone. First question had to \u2013 is with respect to building margins back in Macao. Going back to the old adage, never let a crisis go by without learning from it, as you look at your, at some of your larger expenses ex-labor. So for example, marketing food and beverage, are there opportunities here to tweak the way that you operate to bring your margins back faster, so that you'll be running actually more efficiently, even with fewer guests for example? \nRobert Goldstein : Harry, I guess my confidence may be misguided, but I believe business in Macao is going to be strong enough we don\u2019t have to worry about you know cutting some restaurant workers or cutting some \u2013 I just don't think there's enough margin in cutting costs if the revenues are there; I think the revenues will be there. I just feel like we're overplaying this in terms of how Asia thinks and how Asia rebounds. I think that's an appropriate commentary in question, vis-\u00e0-vis Las Vegas. I think it's a very fair question.  But in Macao and Singapore, I think we have great pent-up demand. We hear it; we feel it and we think that unless we\u2019re misguided in that thinking, it will be a mistake to pull back our F&B, pull back on a lot of things that we do there, because again you can't overcome the enormous top-line. These are top-line businesses over there in Asia and I think they need those kinds of services, goods and services to be successful.  I don't see and may be Patrick sees it, but I just don\u2019t see enough. Unless a business comes back to levels we believe this year, in Asia I think it would be mistaken to try to shave a few points of cost and drive margin, because the revenue should be there in my estimation. \nPatrick Dumont: And just one additional thing to think about. Before the start of this disruption, the beginning in the first quarter of this year, this was a very well-functioning, very well-oiled machine that ran high margins and was incredibly efficient and continually look to make itself more efficient each quarter.  And so I think we won\u2019t look at this purely from the transition standpoint. We're going to look at this from the way we always look at it, which is to Rob's point, we've got to grow revenue and we believe that it will happen, and then we're going to continue to manage the business in a very cost efficient manner, ensuring that we generate as much cash flow and keep our margins strong.  And so I think it's difficult from where we sit today, to tell you all the things that we\u2019ll do going forward, because we've looked very carefully at our business each quarter and we've taken costs out of it appropriately, and so I think we'll just continue to do that and try to run as efficient a business as possible. \nHarry Curtis: Fair enough. Let me move on to a broader topic that looks out five to 10 years and is tied to your \u2013 to Sheldon's comments about addition spending in Macao. There\u2019s a new Chief Executive. Some investors are questioning the relationship that the concessionaires might have going forward with the new Chief Executive, but it seems to me his most recent comments has actually been somewhat encouraging that the concessionaires have been positive for Vegas.  So my question of Vegas, Macao rather \u2013 so my question is, as you think about the future and spending in Macao, what partnerships might develop with the government or other companies or in the hospitality industry or in completely different industries that would position Las Vegas Sands to get a high return on incremental investment?\nRobert Goldstein : First I\u2019ll say \u2013 I\u2019ll repeat Sheldon's comments at the top of the call. We love to investment in Macao; we are keen to invest in Macao. I don't know you saw the Chief Executive calling us out for participating in the quarantine with our hotel rooms and commending our actions there, but we are pleased to see the recognition on that.  But I think we\u2019ve always been consistent and Sheldon has been consistent. We want to invest as much as we can in Macao, as often as we can in Macao, and we're anxious for that day to come Harry. The minute we get the go-ahead, I think Mr. Adelson and our Board would be predisposed to write very large checks very quickly.  We've always been believers. We believe the market just has so much potential growth there. There is so much opportunity. You know the future of Macro is very bright and very diversified and we are very anxiously a part of that. I think Sheldon\u2019s always been unequivocal in his willingness to invest, invest, invest in the future Macao. Sheldon, do you want to echo those sentiments? \nSheldon Adelson: Yeah, I\u2019ll echo those. \nRobert Goldstein : Echo. \nSheldon Adelson: Ditto. Listen, we\u2019ve \u2013 Macao is, will be the best, if not one of the best. It will be the best and the best gaming and leisure destination anywhere in the world. So there's no reason why it should grow. While Rob was taking, I was thinking about potentially it could only grow as big as Vegas does. It actually \u2013 the population that it serves is much greater than what Vegas serves and it could grow into that, but it will take a long time to go into that. We\u2019ve got 150,000 rooms. Its only about 35,000, 40,000 rooms in Macao. So it will take quite a while for it to grow well beyond that. \nHarry Curtis: Okay, thanks very much everyone. \nSheldon Adelson: It certainly has the growth potential. \nRobert Goldstein: Thanks Harry. \nHarry Curtis: I appreciate it everyone. \nRobert Goldstein : Thank you. \nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. You may now ask your question. \nDavid Katz: Hi! Evening everyone, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just go back to the reopening and trying and envision, and Rob you touched on this on the mass side. You know what operationally it could look like from people taking ferry, border crossings etcetera. You know, are we envisioning gloves, masks and you know temperature. And I suppose I would ask the same question about Las Vegas, and you know given as you point out aptly we may not be as used to it here. What that potentially could look like, we saw some release from the Nevada Gaming Commission this afternoon. \nRobert Goldstein : Right, right. David, I think if you look at \u2013 I think I turn to Hong Kong as a guideline. I think the Asian people will adapt. Well yes, the answer is there\u2019ll be temperature checks, there\u2019ll be masks, there\u2019ll be gloves. We are going to do whatever we can do to ensure our employees and our customers are in an environment they can have fun in and visit us and all that, but they are not going to be at risk as best we can prevent that. The rooms will be clean beyond clean, the wiping down of surfaces, the social distancing. They're doing it in Hong Kong.  I think the last time I looked Hong Kong had less than a dozen deaths and again, retails are opened. You go into Hong Kong; the restaurants you sit in are five to 10 feet apart. You get a temp check coming in, you wear gloves, wear a mask and it\u2019s a different world, but the Asians are \u2013 there\u2019s all kind of sanitizer, but they're doing it as we speak in Hong Kong today. I envision a similar environment here in Las Vegas and in Macao.  The difference is going to be the ability to acclimate is much higher in Asia, because for years I've been going to the airports via Tokyo or Hong Kong, Macao. When you do a temperature check and people are wearing masks, it\u2019s not that far in that thinking. So I don't think the Asian people have a problem at all. In fact I think they are going to welcome it and be anxious to get back to having fun in casinos. I believe that from the bottom of my heart the recovery in Asia is going to happen rather quickly.  I'm not as comfortable and Vegas one of the reasons I'm concerned is because this foreign door thinking, this is I've been wearing a mask now for a while and its different, you know it is different, and I think it will be a little bit difficulty. I also wore it at the Airlift and how the airlines will be able to fly into Las Vegas, because the Airlift is an important part of our success. So although it's going to take some time, some comfort to get people to acclimate, I think it's going to happen and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any problem at all that it\u2019s going to happen in Macao.  The minute they open doors in Macao, we're ready. We have the gloves, the mask, the sanitizer, the temperature checks, but I think your best example is what's happening in Hong Kong as we speak. It\u2019s pretty amazing. You can go shopping, you can go eating, you can do a lot of things there and life there is not usual, but it\u2019s ongoing and that\u2019s what we hope we can do in Las Vegas as well and adapt to the new environment until the day comes when a vaccine or cure, I believe that's going to happen.  How did we live through so many of these things? The stock market crash in \u201980\u2019s to 2001 to 2008, 2009 to SARS. People will say, \u2018Oh! That\u2019s going to change everything. It\u2019s going to be all different. It\u2019ll never be the same. I\u2019ll agree. I think this thing will get fixed at some point. There will be some remedy, be it a vaccine or be it some way of getting \u2013 the medical people, there\u2019s too many smart people out looking, but I think the world will return, but Asian will return quicker and will rebound much faster than here and there'll be no aversion to wearing a mask and gloves and social distancing. In fact they\u2019ll welcome it as long as they can come back to Macao and Singapore. \nSheldon Adelson: Rob, you\u2019re not old. You remember all those past times. \nRobert Goldstein : What\u2019s that? \nSheldon Adelson: You are not that old that you remember all those incidents in the past. \nRobert Goldstein : I was much younger, so I remember them. \nDavid Katz: Dinner out sounds great. Be well everyone and thanks for taking my question. \nRobert Goldstein : Thanks David. See you one of these days. \nOperator: Thank you presenters and thank you ladies and gentlemen for joining Las Vegas Sands, first quarter 2020 earnings call. That concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day!",

            "name": "Sheldon Adelson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope all of you, your friends and families are in good health during these challenging times. The COVID-19 pandemic is unlike anything I've ever seen in my business career. While this pandemic brings many challenges, it also presents each of us with an opportunity to make a difference and to provide assistance to all those who have been impacted.  Our company is fortunate to have the financial strength to enable us to focus our efforts on the safety and security of our team members and customers, and are making a difference to those in need in each of our host communities in Macao, Singapore and Las Vegas.  We don't know how long this pandemic will last, but we are confident that travel and tourism spending in each of our markets and around the world will eventually recover. As surely as day follows night, people will travel again, shop again, come together again to enjoy entertainment and social interaction, to exchange ideas and to conduct business. Focusing on the support for our team members and communities today will position us to recover more quickly as the impact of the pandemic eventually subsides; it is also the right thing to do.  Our optimism about an eventual recovery, coupled with our financial strength enables us to continue the execution of our previously announced capital investment programs in both Macao and Singapore. We believe these investments will strengthen our leadership position in each of these markets and will provide a larger platform for future growth with travel and tourism spending eventually recovering.  In Macao we are making great progress in our $2.2 billion capital investment program with The Londoner Macao and The Grand Suites at Four Seasons. In addition to these large projects with which you are already familiar, we're moving full speed ahead with a number of other investments which we think will increase both the effectiveness and the diversification of our integrated resorts portfolio.  Now is not the time to pause or slow down investment in Macao. We see the opportunity and possess both the financial strength and the strategic commitment to make additional investments. With our effort to accelerate investment in Macao, we intend to play our part in supporting the local economy in the short term and ensure we are in the leading position to capture the eventual recovery in tourism spending. I remain steadfast in my belief that Macao has the opportunity to become one of the greatest business and leisure tourism destinations in the world, and the MICE capital of Asia.  As I've said on many occasions, we welcome the opportunity to invest billions of dollars and additional investment and contribute to Macao's diversification and evolution into Asia's leading leisure and business tourism destination.  Turning to our investment in the expansion of Marina Bay Sands, Singapore, we remain excited to be a part of Singapore's continued growth, as a leading business and tourism \u2013 and leisure tourism destination. We continue to make progress on the MBS expansion. We'll provide additional updates in the future. We will also continue to reinvest in Marina Bay Sands to enhance the customer experience in advance of the expansion.  Finally, turning to Las Vegas, the eventual recovery could take more time here than in Asia, but we are confident that Las Vegas's best days are ahead of it and that Las Vegas will remain the greatest leisure and business tourism destination in the United States.  Let me now spend a moment on capital allocation. Maintaining a strong balance sheet makes great business sense, while we weather the storm caused by this pandemic. The balance sheet strength will enable us to invest in promising future growth opportunities and we're positioning our company to deliver industry leading growth in the years ahead.  While we have suspended our dividend program, we remain confident that the recovery in travel and tourism spending, and the strength of our business model will enable us to deliver both growth and the return of capital to shareholders in the future. I assure you I have not said \u2018yay dividends and yay buybacks' for the last time. I'm looking forward to saying them again and hopefully very soon.  Thank you for joining us on the call today and now we'll take questions. We're still doing it. We got a plane \u2013 we have sent four more 747 trips to go to China to pick up more of the masks and PPE. So listen, something we do like that potentially saves lives and it's nothing for us, particularly the fuel \u2013 the cost of fuel is nothing. So we could fly over there and come back at a very low cost. You're welcome. Thank you. Not really, but we've always wanted \u2013 we've always said that Asia is the best place for us. Because number one, in this virus shutdown the agents have been through this for a long time, for several times, so they are used to it. And when it opens up again, they're just going to come back and continue, maybe at a higher pace to make up for lost time that they have experienced. So Asia has got the population, is the most inclined to play, to gamble than other populations. So it looks like if we can find something good in Asia we'd certainly like to do that. Either to acquire or to build. I can tell your coming from that business myself. This is Sheldon. They can't \u2013 a lot of the companies, both private and association wise are relying upon their shows to expand their own businesses and to do what it is they usually do with the show; research, recruitment, etcetera, and so they don't want to give up on that. It's not - we can only have it at this time, and we can \u2013 if we don't have it at this time, we are not going to ever have it again, that's not the case at all. We don't have it and make up for the loss of time as soon as they possibly can. This is not \u2013 this is Sheldon. We haven't eliminated the dividend, we've just suspended it, and yes, we could come down to a cut rather than a total suspension. We'll see what happens; how fast we open places and what kind of income we are going to experience.  Listen, I'm in your \u2013 we are all in the same boat. As I said, I own the largest amount of stock, my family and I, of anybody and I want to see the dividend recover and to maintain it as long as possible. You're welcome. Take it there. Yeah, I'll echo those. Ditto. Listen, we've \u2013 Macao is, will be the best, if not one of the best. It will be the best and the best gaming and leisure destination anywhere in the world. So there's no reason why it should grow. While Rob was taking, I was thinking about potentially it could only grow as big as Vegas does. It actually \u2013 the population that it serves is much greater than what Vegas serves and it could grow into that, but it will take a long time to go into that. We've got 150,000 rooms. Its only about 35,000, 40,000 rooms in Macao. So it will take quite a while for it to grow well beyond that. It certainly has the growth potential. Rob, you're not old. You remember all those past times. You are not that old that you remember all those incidents in the past."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "Hey Joe, it's Patrick; thanks for the question. I think if you look back at our margin over the last couple of years, as the premium mass and mass business grew, those margin areas are probably appropriate for a recovery under normal run rate conditions. And so if you think about our expenses broken into categories, our largest expense is really gaming tax, which is variable, followed by our payroll which is not, and then a whole host of other things related to property operations, fixed property costs and things related to just general consumables.  And so some of those things are variables, but it will be very hard to characterize and say a particular market segment would result when it started back in you know call it higher margins because of this trough. And I think the way to think about it is, we've been very focused on managing towards margins over the last couple of years anyway. And so the team there and through our work together, we've been very focused on increasing our cash flow as we grew revenue in higher margin segments.  So I don't think you should look at a rebound through a particular segment and say that will expand margins. I think what you can do is take a look at this and say our business already had plenty of leverage in it. We have plenty of liquidity to manage through this very difficult time, and then when things do rebound we'll continue to be focused on margins as we were before and look to control the costs that we can control. And I think to look at it on a segment basis would be difficult, because in reality we have to open the properties.  And so you know we're going to have strength in every segment. I'd like to believe that when things recover we're going to see that strength that we saw in 2019 and 2018 and the years before. We had a great trajectory heading into 2020 and I'd like to believe that we'll continue to maintain the very strong operating leverage that we had on a run rate basis when things recover. Thanks Joe. So, kind of a two part question there. You know, I appreciate the detail. I think the way to think about margin recovery is that when you look as it part of an uncontrolled operating expenses, you know call it across '19. That represents a little bit more than 60% of our total expense structure. And so when you think about that and you think about sort of our controlling operating expenses, that was kind of in the 38% context.  And so what you'll see is that those uncontrollable expenses which are mostly gaming tax, which actually was about 60% of that, you know of that little more than 60, about 60% of that is gaming tax, that's really going to drive the way the margins look, because we will start getting operating leverage. So if you think about that other 38% that's controllable, some of that's variable.  Our payroll, although you'd say that it was something that is under control, you know we've taken the [doctor] [ph] and that we want to keep our team together, and so that's something that we're very focused on. So when you think of our two largest expenses as the gaming tax and as the payroll, you can kind of walk into what that margin might look like during this, call it transition period of ramp up.  So will we run, you know call it the 33% EBITDA margin we were running before right out the gate? Unless there's an immediate snapback recovery, that might be a little challenged. But when you look at the expenses that we have controlled and you look at the marketing expenses and the way that we look at the other parts of the business, we've been able to control costs in a very disciplined way. You know we went \u2013 you know the business has experienced other troughs before and we've always managed expenses to ensure liquidity and to ensure the proper recovery when it comes around.  And so I think, are there some margin opportunities? Sure, but I think it also depends on what segment comes back and when. As you know that the junket segment is obviously much lower margin and less contribution, providing then the mass and premium mass segment. So if we get huge volumes of mass business, our margins are going to look tremendous right out of the gate.  So I think for us a lot of it depends on what segment of the business you call the recovery on first. So I think given that expense structure, given the \u2013 your view that you may have on recovery of the business, you can kind of formulate a transitional margin process for the business. So I'll leave the last part of the question for the Chairman, since that's really something that falls to him, but I think the key thing for us here is that as we mentioned before in prior earnings calls, is we're very focused on looking at the liquidity of the company; very focused on looking at the long term objectives of the Chairman.  Our highest and best use of capital is reinvestment in high-growth projects, and if you look at our track record on return on invested capital and the projects that our Chairman has led, it's tremendous. And so our goal is to preserve that liquidity and also to continue and invest in our key markets to drive that high ROIC, and so if you look at the Chairman's notes and the strategies he's laid out, we are continuing to invest in these markets to ensure that we get the high returns going forward when the market does recover.  That being said, we look at a variety of scenarios. We have a lot of different downside cases, a lot of different liquidity scenarios, a lot of different CapEx scenarios, so that we ensure we can analyze things to a satisfactory in which the Board feels comfortable making a decision with the Chairman and that's what we've done here.  So if you look at page eight in the deck, you can see that we've laid out the cash and available liquidity. You can see that right now under the current conditions as we presented them, we can go more than 18 months and invest in completing the projects in Macao and continue along with Marina Bay Sands new developments, and so that's very encouraging for us. We feel very strong about our balance sheet position, our Board feels very confident in our ability to weather the storm.  And that being said, if for some reason we felt like we needed access to the capital markets, we spend a lot of time working to ensure that we had access to the most deep and most liquid market in the world, which is the high grade bond market, and so as an investment grade company, the investment grade bond market opened very quickly after the impacts of coronavirus hit the capital markets, and issuers do have access, and we feel very comfortable at our ability.  We feel great about the high grade markets and at some point if the Board makes a determination with management that it makes sense to raise additional equity, we'll have the ability to do so, we're very confident about that. But at this time we're very comfortable with our liquidity on-hand; we've shown the analysis on page eight and you know we're looking forward to a strong recovery, so we can benefit from the huge CapEx developments that we've been undertaking during this time.  And then one last question, I think the second part of that, was that you directed something that would probably best be answered by the Chairman, which is kind of view on dividends and when the dividends may come back and what that looks like. And so if that's okay, Sheldon, I'll turn the call back to you. Okay. So its Patrick, and thanks for the question. I think you know one thing that you should sort of look at in terms of the lens we might examine M&A up through \u2013 it's just on our long term views on returns, and so you the Chairman has been very strict about the way we deploy capital in order to ensure that we get the right returns to justify things and that's always been true in developments and it will certainly be true through any M&A transactions.  And so I think the way we are thinking about it is, and from the discussions that we've had, just around trying to be opportunistic, we are looking to see high quality assets where they are in key markets where it may be cheaper to buy them to build, and you may find something that is attractive and fits into our overall strategy in the long run, and I think we're going to be very returns focused.  Clearly our industry is heavily regulated and we're going to have to ensure a proper compliance as we always do, and we are going to have to look very carefully at those opportunities in that context. And I think you know it's not as if this is something that will happen immediately. This is going to evolve over time and we're going to have an opportunity to take a very hard and disciplined look and see if any of those opportunities are attractive to the Chairman of the board. And so I think that's kind of how we'll think about it. So I think overall in Marina Bay Sands, the margins in that property are really tremendous. I think a lot of that has to do with the original strategy that goes back to the Chairman's view that creating a very high quality with integrated resorts and multi-amenities to the highest level would produce high margins, and you see the results since the history of the opening of the property. That strategy has been spot on and it's really delivered. It's been a tremendous asset and has driven tourism and has really contributed to the market of Singapore, and I think it's been great.  I think to Rob's comments earlier, we know that there's a lot of pent-up demand and you know I think the opportunity here for us is to look at it for the long run. I think we're very focused on deploying capital there. We have a bunch of projects to help it enhance and improve the offering at Marina Bay Sands that we think will be margin enhancing and cash flow enhancing.  I think we're very focused on the development in Tower 2. You know the Chairman's vision there is great and we're very excited to get that arena open. We think that will add to the tourism offering of Singapore. We already have some market test about that, because we have the \u2013 you know we obviously have the arena in Macao that we operate and it's a great tourism asset and it works very well with the mass business and premium mass business. So we see a corollary there in Singapore where we can drive significant visitation from the around and catchment area out of that arena.  So I think if you look at Singapore over the next couple years, we're going to see what we hope is very high value returns on the new deployed capital, in a market that continues to maintain very high margin structure. And so, while we don't know exactly the pace of recovery that we'll see today, we do know that in the long run and as Rob said when things were covered because of the demand, we're going to be poised to take advantage of it and continue to deliver very high margins and strong cash flow. So that's kind of how we think of that. For what it's worth Carlo, we also built and when we do open-up this summer, our Four Seasons is fully opened, operational to a 90 keys and then by the end we'll have the London done as far as the outside and not the fac\u0327ade. So we're moving quickly. We have 3,000 workers on site right now to finish those projects. And just one additional thing to think about. Before the start of this disruption, the beginning in the first quarter of this year, this was a very well-functioning, very well-oiled machine that ran high margins and was incredibly efficient and continually look to make itself more efficient each quarter.  And so I think we won't look at this purely from the transition standpoint. We're going to look at this from the way we always look at it, which is to Rob's point, we've got to grow revenue and we believe that it will happen, and then we're going to continue to manage the business in a very cost efficient manner, ensuring that we generate as much cash flow and keep our margins strong.  And so I think it's difficult from where we sit today, to tell you all the things that we'll do going forward, because we've looked very carefully at our business each quarter and we've taken costs out of it appropriately, and so I think we'll just continue to do that and try to run as efficient a business as possible."

            "content": "Yeah, hi Joe. This is Sheldon. I can only quote some of the rumors that we've heard. We have nothing positive and nothing definite, but the rumors we've heard that it's going to start in sometimes the middle or end of May. I'm sorry. I didn't hear what you said. Great, thank you. Thank you, Patrick. We will reinstate the dividend after discussing it with the Board of Directors. When things get back to where we were, it's very simple. I don't think it's a long time away. If the rumors are \u2013 Macao is a big percentage of our, both GGI, Gross Gaming Income and our EBITDA, and I think that is the level that will come back first. Then probably Singapore and Vegas, in that order perhaps.  So if what Rob says is true, the people are dying and anxious to get back to \u2013 no, we don't want them to die \u2013 get back to Macao to enjoy themselves, then it should come back sooner rather than later.  Listen, I'm the largest shareholder, my family and I, and we want the dividend reinstated more than you do. So if you could see the amount of money that we're not getting, I would certainly like to have that in our savings account, so we'll reinstate the dividend as soon as we get back to earning some money. I'd like to reaffirm what you're thinking. It does mean that we're interested in M&A. One of the reasons why we're the biggest and we've got the best balance sheet in the industry, our market cap up until this \u2013 till this virus came, was equal to the combined market capital of all our competitors in the U.S. combined. So it's \u2013 I'm not going to give up on developing integrated resorts. I'm going to add on to our strategic thinking or strategic priorities that we can acquire, because most of the other companies, one, don't have the balance sheet that we do, and they don't have the potential market that we do, and we can go in and acquire one or more operations that if \u2013 of course the price has to be right and so are now taken on the strategy of both acquiring and building and developing."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Robert Goldstein",
            "content": "Joe just to elaborate. I think to Sheldon's point, we follow the same sources you do, perhaps ours a little better. We do believe there'll be some opening in May perhaps or June we're hopeful, but as you know it won't be a flick of the switch and it's all different timing to which provinces.  We're hoping for first the IBS is reinstated, that's pivotal, and then the 14 day quarantine for re-entry into China is equally important as you know. I think the IBS, the first place in the 14 day quarantine, the first place we'll see some bright lights will be in Guangdong and then provinces will follow throughout the summer. It won't be one flick of the switch and all provinces open equally. I think though as you know Guangdong is pivotal. Once that's open, it opens the door for others to follow.  It will be a gradual process and the one thing we're grateful for is that the majority of our income is derived from Asia, which as you know has been through these situations, be it SARS or be it Swine Flu or in the past they are more conversant with the problems and so we think the recovery there is going to be back to gambling, back to visitation, will come rather quickly, but it will come in gradual phases throughout the summer. It will be Guangdong and then other provinces to follow. Airlift maybe still muted for a while in terms of how much - I think trains will be running.  We feel pretty confident we'll be back to a much better place this summer and then a much better place in the fall, and we have seen evidence of pent up demand like crazy from our customers who are asking when and we talk to them pretty regularly. So we feel pretty good about the return of Macao first, far beyond what we're going to see in the U.S. Thomas, it's Rob. I think in Singapore social distancing did have an impact, because we're limited there in terms of size of the operation. I think we'll have an impact on Singapore in the future. The question is how long those social distancing [inaudible] stay in place and we just don't know, but it will have an impact, negative in terms of Singapore. In Macao I think we're in a much different position because the scale and size of operations enable us to \u2013 we have so much square footage there and so many more slots and tables that I think we can do much better business in Macao than in Singapore vis-a\u0300-vis social distancing. But I think that the area you talked about, the time periods obviously were impacted not just by social distancing, but you know demand slowed because it was more difficult to get there and there was more concerns about access and it was a confusing time in both markets in terms of visas getting in, getting out of quarantine. I don't think it's an adequate snapshot when rebound comes.  I think once in Macao we opened the doors back up in the 14 day quarantine and the IBS team is back in place. I think we'll be able to do quite well and the social distance will have a minimal impact in Macao, again the size and scale of our operations in the numerous table slots and square footage.  I think in Singapore we're going to have a lot of demand. I spoke to the team this morning and they were laughing about the amount of people calling to complain about the fact we're closed and want to come gamble. I do believe we'll see a lot of demand in Singapore. I am concerned that may have a negative impact. I cannot tell you obviously what that'll be, but I think we'll have more demand come this summer, especially come fall, and Singapore could be adversely impacted by social distancing, so it remains to be seen. Well, currently as you know the customer mix there is zero since we are closed till June 1. The team is pretty confident that we'll get opened in June. It doesn't pretty much concern that it will be extended beyond this. They seem like they can \u2013 had you saw the journal this morning, the majority of the problem is in the \u2013 has been isolated. I think Paul and Andrew and all the guys there told me this morning, they feel pretty confident we'll open in June. So local market was thriving and they think we'll thrive. In fact they were talking about the amount of people calling to complain that they couldn't gambles. We feel pretty confident that the local market will bounce back immediately, and be pretty strong actually because it's an activity people enjoy being part of in Singapore and we are very confident that rebounds really quickly in June too.  The local market, these foreign local markets, meeting Indonesia, Malaysia, I'm not too strong on, because I think that those countries are facing challenges. I'm not sure the borders will even be open to those people, but I feel less aggressive in terms of rebound of our local market thus far and meeting again the countries nearby. Indonesia, Malaysia, a bit of struggle right now. I think we'll be slow to see t that return. I think we'll be quick to see return to China, if we get open, the border is open and the Chinese are able to come. I think that will cover rather quickly.  I think Singapore becomes positive right away in June, and then ramps up throughout the summer, but it will miss some key elements of local foreign markets surrounding the neighborhood.  I don't think Malaysia or Indonesia will be simple to get back to Singapore for the summer. I do think China and local play will be strong. I know local play will be strong because it drove our business prior to closing and we hear anecdotally that people are really frustrated and want to go back to gambling in the casinos.  Well, also as you mentioned, you know Shaun you know, you've been to Asia enough, but the idea of wearing a mask or social distancing or thermometer checks will not be difficult for the customers in local Singaporeans, nor Chinese's visitors, they'll except it, they'll deal with it and as you know the high end bankrupt business anyway is people in rooms two or three and in large rooms, so no problem there.  The only thing I'm concerned about is, if we get into a mass business, there again quickly is what we may lose \u2013 the spread can be difficult vis-a\u0300-vis the main gaming floor, because we'll be social distancing the slot machines etcetera. But once again, like a lot of markets we have a lot of very high end who play both slot ETG and table. I think we accommodate.  We may be at risks where it relates to masses of people coming in and the slot machines not having enough capacity and saying the tables mass. No risk on the high end mass or risk on the mass.  And again, I think Singapore is going to be like Macao, quick to recover. Unlike the U.S. which I think is more drastic and slower. Their ability to acclimate to this environment has improved in the past. They've lived through SARS, they've lived through Swine Flu, they've lived through a lot of things and they always are going to come back and they come back much quicker than we anticipate.  So we feel bullish with the caveat that you know our foreign business around us, our neighbor's foreign business might be pushed back into the fall and not be there. We feel strongly our high end Chinese business will cover rather quickly. We know it will, because the demand is there. Yeah, I wish I can give you a better color, but we just saw such a turn down, now that the business has turned out. People \u2013 I read these things, at the high end people will come back first or the premium mass to come back to the mass mass. I don't think we saw evidence of that in those two weeks. I think is was so confusing and the restrictions etcetera.  I just don't think there was good evidence of what's going to happen in the future. What I do believe is that China is going back to work, they're going back to travel and when the IVS and the 14 day quarantine are taken away, I think all segments come back and come back rather healthy. I think by \u2013 you know by late summer, early fall we are going to see some nice profitability out of our Asia properties. By late fall, by you know thanksgiving or October, I think you'll see very strong return to a better time over there.  We feel just extremely confident that Asia gets better quicker and you are seeing already in China with the travel restrictions being eased. What I don't know is the province by province access into Macao, how that will happen, but it will happen and I think there's been a strong claim made by the Macao government to get started, they're hoping to see the restrictions eased.  I just don't think the two weeks, three weeks could be really a strong indicator of how it's going to come back. I think it comes back across all segments. I'm not a believer it's just going to be the high end. I believe it's going to need plenty of mass people as well. Thank you, we're optimistic. The world will recover. Sheldon, you want to take that or do you want us to take it here in the office. We had a little problem hearing you. Are you saying that \u2013 we couldn't catch all that. But you are saying that you think VIPs are going to ramp much quicker than mass? No, we're not going to think that way. We believe the mass premium \u2013 we believe the pent-up demand is real in all segments and if anything, I think it will be a mistake to think that way. We believe this is going to open up to a lot of business come this summer and the fall.  The social distance, we'll have to work through, but I think Asians and Chinese are as they open that market up, open their country up, as those quarantine barriers come down and the IBS comes up, I do think we are going to see a return on all segments. We are pretty confident the Macao is also making some money this summer, and a lot of money come fall. And again I'll be redundant here, but the Asians, we've never seen this kind of a virus on our shores here in the U.S. where we've kind of taken aback and shell shocked by it. Asia has seen it numerous times, they understand it, they dealt with it.  You guys Hong Kong is open and operating. It never closed in terms of retail and restaurants and they're walking around with gloves and mask and sanitizers and temperature checks. Everything is open in Hong Kong in terms of the restaurants retail and I think their statistics are pretty excellent relative to the rest of the world. They can deal with it and Macao will deal with it and I think visitation will be \u2013 I think it'll be a mistake to try to handicap which segment is back first. I think they all come back and we're pretty anxious to see that happen in the 60 days with the first phase and then hopefully by late summer it really kicks in all the way.  Our job is to provide a safe environment for our employees and for our customers, so they keep coming and there is no reinfection. But again, unlike the U.S. which I think people are concerned, even Nevada are having a hard time getting opened again, because the people are so scared and don't have any idea.  Hong Kong, right now you can go out for dinner, you can go shopping. So they've kind of come to terms with much more comfortably than we have. But I think it's a mistake to try to figure out which segment resurrects quickest. I think they all come back pretty quickly. Sorry, are you referring \u2013 so page 11 has our CapEx expectations in the slide presentation. You're referring to the expansion, so the new Tower for Marina Bay Sands? So I think what we've laid out here is pretty consistent with our thinking today. I think we're really not going to start any heavy expenditure until the back half of '21, and then we'll sort of follow as quick an execution schedule as we can follow. It's funny, the Chairman always says to us, \u2018You know I build a Venetian in less than two years. You guys should do the same.' So we are going to do the best that we can do to be as aggressive as we can be, because really we want to add these assets to the tourism portfolio of Singapore as quickly as possible.  Tokyo, I think if you look in Macao, and you look at kind of the trajectory of our latest projects, which was really from the ground up the Parisian, you can kind of see the distribution there in some of our prior presentations about how CapEx progressed. Some of that is influenced by labor availability. You know in Singapore we'd like to believe that in this particular market we'll have the ability to pursue the schedule we've kind of laid out there where the majority is coming across '22, clean up in \u201823 and then we'll see what happens. Maybe there'll be some in \u201824 as of right now, we're not sure.  So I think our goal is to try to get this thing open as quickly as possible once we get the proper approvals from the government of Singapore, you know with obviously with their support. And just to highlight, we do have a delayed draw financing for that project and so that project is financed in advance and it's the same bank group that we've been with for years that also holds the credit facility there in Singapore.  So we're continuing to make progress; we are working on a time line there; we are trying to work as quickly as we can given the current environment and you know we'll continue to keep you updated in upcoming quarters, but we'd like to pursue the schedule as aggressively as we can. Harry, I guess my confidence may be misguided, but I believe business in Macao is going to be strong enough we don't have to worry about you know cutting some restaurant workers or cutting some \u2013 I just don't think there's enough margin in cutting costs if the revenues are there; I think the revenues will be there. I just feel like we're overplaying this in terms of how Asia thinks and how Asia rebounds. I think that's an appropriate commentary in question, vis-a\u0300-vis Las Vegas. I think it's a very fair question.  But in Macao and Singapore, I think we have great pent-up demand. We hear it; we feel it and we think that unless we're misguided in that thinking, it will be a mistake to pull back our F&B, pull back on a lot of things that we do there, because again you can't overcome the enormous top-line. These are top-line businesses over there in Asia and I think they need those kinds of services, goods and services to be successful.  I don't see and may be Patrick sees it, but I just don't see enough. Unless a business comes back to levels we believe this year, in Asia I think it would be mistaken to try to shave a few points of cost and drive margin, because the revenue should be there in my estimation. First I'll say \u2013 I'll repeat Sheldon's comments at the top of the call. We love to investment in Macao; we are keen to invest in Macao. I don't know you saw the Chief Executive calling us out for participating in the quarantine with our hotel rooms and commending our actions there, but we are pleased to see the recognition on that.  But I think we've always been consistent and Sheldon has been consistent. We want to invest as much as we can in Macao, as often as we can in Macao, and we're anxious for that day to come Harry. The minute we get the go-ahead, I think Mr. Adelson and our Board would be predisposed to write very large checks very quickly.  We've always been believers. We believe the market just has so much potential growth there. There is so much opportunity. You know the future of Macro is very bright and very diversified and we are very anxiously a part of that. I think Sheldon's always been unequivocal in his willingness to invest, invest, invest in the future Macao. Sheldon, do you want to echo those sentiments? Echo. Thanks Harry. Thank you. Right, right. David, I think if you look at \u2013 I think I turn to Hong Kong as a guideline. I think the Asian people will adapt. Well yes, the answer is there'll be temperature checks, there'll be masks, there'll be gloves. We are going to do whatever we can do to ensure our employees and our customers are in an environment they can have fun in and visit us and all that, but they are not going to be at risk as best we can prevent that. The rooms will be clean beyond clean, the wiping down of surfaces, the social distancing. They're doing it in Hong Kong.  I think the last time I looked Hong Kong had less than a dozen deaths and again, retails are opened. You go into Hong Kong; the restaurants you sit in are five to 10 feet apart. You get a temp check coming in, you wear gloves, wear a mask and it's a different world, but the Asians are \u2013 there's all kind of sanitizer, but they're doing it as we speak in Hong Kong today. I envision a similar environment here in Las Vegas and in Macao.  The difference is going to be the ability to acclimate is much higher in Asia, because for years I've been going to the airports via Tokyo or Hong Kong, Macao. When you do a temperature check and people are wearing masks, it's not that far in that thinking. So I don't think the Asian people have a problem at all. In fact I think they are going to welcome it and be anxious to get back to having fun in casinos. I believe that from the bottom of my heart the recovery in Asia is going to happen rather quickly.  I'm not as comfortable and Vegas one of the reasons I'm concerned is because this foreign door thinking, this is I've been wearing a mask now for a while and its different, you know it is different, and I think it will be a little bit difficulty. I also wore it at the Airlift and how the airlines will be able to fly into Las Vegas, because the Airlift is an important part of our success. So although it's going to take some time, some comfort to get people to acclimate, I think it's going to happen and I don't think there's any problem at all that it's going to happen in Macao.  The minute they open doors in Macao, we're ready. We have the gloves, the mask, the sanitizer, the temperature checks, but I think your best example is what's happening in Hong Kong as we speak. It's pretty amazing. You can go shopping, you can go eating, you can do a lot of things there and life there is not usual, but it's ongoing and that's what we hope we can do in Las Vegas as well and adapt to the new environment until the day comes when a vaccine or cure, I believe that's going to happen.  How did we live through so many of these things? The stock market crash in '80's to 2001 to 2008, 2009 to SARS. People will say, \u2018Oh! That's going to change everything. It's going to be all different. It'll never be the same. I'll agree. I think this thing will get fixed at some point. There will be some remedy, be it a vaccine or be it some way of getting \u2013 the medical people, there's too many smart people out looking, but I think the world will return, but Asian will return quicker and will rebound much faster than here and there'll be no aversion to wearing a mask and gloves and social distancing. In fact they'll welcome it as long as they can come back to Macao and Singapore. What's that? I was much younger, so I remember them. Thanks David. See you one of these days."

Again, Sheldon referenced not the comfort, but the exposure Asia's had to the viruses and these kinds of things. As you know when your applying to Asia, you know temperature testing and mass are kind of the way it works over there anyway. So I think that the U.S. has never experienced on our shores these kinds of thing.  So as it relates to the group market, I'm surprised. I just talked to George this morning, who runs our building here, George Markantonis. He's saying strong demand in August from multiple groups and he feels the demand is there. The question is going to be Airlift in the Las Vegas. I don't know how Airlift will look in the 90 days. I don't know how you know the economic impact in terms of how Americans will spend money to think about being here, but group business appears to be out there for August and into the fall. They are not canceling the 21; they are rebooking into late summer and fall. I think demands there \u2013 I spoke to some of our competitors, the same thinking applies there.  I don't think Vegas has a problem with getting whose back into place. That we have the proper social distancing, the proper etiquette in place to protect people, and I think that's going to be, it looked like Asia which is a lot of social distance, a lot of controls to make sure it's as safe as we can make it, cleanliness and etcetera. But apparently George thinks the demand is there and I've heard that from multiple companies in town. I thought they'll push back in '21, but they haven't. Its August, September, October and November pretty strong demand, so..."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Mr. Daniel Briggs. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Briggs: Thank you. Joining me on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Also joining us on the call are Grant Chum, our Chief Operating Officer of Sands China; and Dr. Wilfred Wong, who are about to get connected and I apologize for starting late. Before I turn the call over to Rob, please let me remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides in our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon and good morning to our colleagues in Asia, a very good morning for our colleagues in Asia. Thank you for joining our call today. We will have some brief comments and then we will go right to Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic\u2019s impact. Travel restrictions continue to affect visitation and our financial results in both Macao and Singapore this quarter. We did generate some positive EBITDA for the quarter in both markets. We remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore. The good news in Singapore, the travel restrictions and travel carters were established with many important source markets during the quarter. Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Australia, Thailand were all part of the initial rollout of the DTO program. And obviously, emergence of Omicron variant impacted the DTO program in late December. The DTO should contribute to a more robust recovery over time. Our confidence in the long-term opportunity in Singapore remains deep, and I am pleased to announce we have embarked to a $1 billion U.S. renovation project at MBS that will introduce luxurious new suite product to the resort. The program will meaningfully expand our room suite offerings and significantly enhance our appeal to premium customers. In Macao, the Londoner is near completion. As the market recovers, both the Four Seasons and Londoner will provide growth opportunities -- material growth opportunities in both the premium and mass customer segments. We continue to have the largest footprint in the world\u2019s greatest market, Macao, and appreciate the opportunity to provide input in the public consultation process ongoing. We look forward to participating in the tendering process as it proceeds to fruition. Customer demand and spending in Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective, as outlined, I think, on pages 29 and 30 in your deck. We continue to have great optimism about our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns. You may know our company is divided primarily into three material areas, the most important being Asia, the portfolio in Macao and Singapore. We remain confident we will return to strong positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover. The sale of Las Vegas creates liquidity and optionality as we pursue additional large-scale, land-based destination resorts in the U.S. and Asia. And we continue to build our digital presence. We are exploring multiple opportunities at this time and we will provide some color at the appropriate time. So let\u2019s go to your questions and thank you for listening.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff: Good afternoon. Good morning, everyone.\nRob Goldstein: Hi, Joe\nJoe Greff: Rob and Patrick, I\u2019d like to start off on the topic of capital return and how you are thinking about that, particularly in light of $5 million in gross cash proceeds coming in the next couple of months. Does that cause you to probably rethink that capital return is more of a near-term event? Or do you really need to see a recovery in both Macao and Singapore before you initiate some sort of capital return? I know you mentioned liquidity/optionality for new jurisdictions in the U.S. and Asia, so in that that\u2019s part of the calculus. But if you can refresh your thinking on capital return, I think, that would be helpful for us?\nRob Goldstein: Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: I am happy to. Yeah. Hey, Joe. I appreciate the question. I think we have been pretty consistent in our thinking. It\u2019s been part of our long-term strategic plan, how to create additional capacity to really grow this business. Sheldon has really started from the beginning as you know, you followed us since day one that he\u2019s really been a developer of large-scale projects, and I think that ethos continues today within our company. And I think we are very excited about some of the opportunities that we have in front of us. Rob and the rest of the development team and our entire group has been working very hard. It\u2019s great opportunities to grow with large-scale development in the future. So I think the way we see the capital that\u2019s going to come into our system from the consummation of Vegas sale is really to grow the business. As we have always said before, the dividend and share repurchases really do represent part of our shareholder return strategy, the dividend being the cornerstone. We are looking forward to the opportunity of restarting the dividend program. But as we have said, and I think, we have been consistent about the idea that we really want to see a steady return to operational cash flow, understanding what those cash flow levels are from a trajectory, and call it, a sensitivity scenario perspective and then make an assessment about the profit return of capital at that time. We really view the dividend as something that needs to return on a stable and long-term basis. And so that\u2019s something that we will look to do when our cash flows return and we get out of pandemic operations, which unfortunately, during this quarter we were still in.\nJoe Greff: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe the gentleman from Macao can chime in on my follow-up question. Just a clarification on the draft bill on the amendments to the gaming law. Can you talk about how the government is thinking about you and others in the market maintaining specific levels of gross gaming revenues in order to maintain your table count? Can you talk about how they are broadly or specifically thinking how this will work and what the broad framework is here? And that\u2019s it for me? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: Grant, you there?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. I think the amendment to the gaming is still work in progress. It\u2019s working its way through the legislature. We need to wait further details in terms of the final form that the amendments would take and there will be additional regulatory measures that will be potentially issued thereafter. So, in general, to your question, we have always efficiently used our table allocation, and in general, we welcome the direction of linking table allocation with productivity, but specifics, I think, are yet to be outlined.\nJoe Greff: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: Hi, Carlo.\nCarlo Santarelli: Rob, maybe if you could kind of shine some light, I know Singapore, obviously, it was kind of a tale of a couple of months. But as you have seen things starting to normalize over the course of the period, could you comment a little bit about how you felt during the better periods of the quarter as it pertains to restrictions and stuff like that when some of them were more loose?\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. We were very excited to see when there\u2019s rays of light and you can get in and the VTL is established, it was extraordinary. And I think it indicates -- it\u2019s a real predictor, Carlo, what\u2019s going to happen. That place opens back up. Hopefully, we see it in the first half of the year. Clearly, demand is going to be there. The VTL -- the government\u2019s thinking is very positive for us. I think Singapore probably gets there quicker than I think Macao might be later. But citing Singapore, the demand is clearly evident when the VTLs were open. It\u2019s a shame. I think we had a real - a positive momentum going that got crushed by the Omicron concerns. But I think that\u2019s just inevitable. The market is around us. I mean the important source markets are opening up, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, all improving. So we have a lot of hope to see a big bounce in Singapore. I would like to reference we had some non-recurring income in that quarter you should be aware of. Patrick, can you illuminate, just we are clear on the numbers on the\u2026\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. Sure. Happy to do it. So\u2026\nRob Goldstein: \u2026Singapore, of course?\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. Of course, happy to do it. And Carlo, thanks for the question. One thing we did want to highlight is that we were positively impacted by approximately $70 million of non-recurring items during this quarter, including bonus reversals, job support scheme and some other items. So I wouldn\u2019t look at this as a run rate quarter. I think I would point you back to some of the comments that Rob made on some of our prior calls about that run rate envelope during these conditions, call it, the $500 million run rate EBITDA context. The real problem is things have kind of been switched on and switched off so much. It\u2019s hard to get a real read on the quarter. I think what is really encouraging is the vaccine travel lanes, the public health posture of the government, which really has been a leader in both vaccinations and the way they approach public health. And we are very encouraged about their approach towards long-term tourism and we are very excited to see how that plays out in the upcoming quarters. But I think, overall, the vaccine travel lanes were a big step.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Patrick, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And just one point of clarity, that $70 million, was that all in the EBITDA result for the quarter?\nPatrick Dumont: It was. It was. That\u2019s why I referred back to the run rate that we talked about previously.\nCarlo Santarelli: Yeah. Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: We\u2026\nCarlo Santarelli: Thank you, Pat.\nRob Goldstein: We have referenced $0.5 billion run rate until things get better over there. Until these travelings become real, we are still in the same range as our point not to get over exuberant about the $170 that it was. It is impacted by non-recurring?\nCarlo Santarelli: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you. \nPatrick Dumont: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about, you have said for a while you are evaluating online gaming and sports betting options and there\u2019s been a little bit of a change in valuation over the last year. Can you talk a little bit about how kind of what your current thoughts are and how that may be impacted by changing valuations?\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. I think we have said in the past, we have always been interested in digital and all these interests that\u2019s happening in the market. But two things are happening at the same time. Our business, I think, is coming back to a stronger place. I think 2022 finally, especially in Singapore, and I think, as well in Macao, we will see that getting better. Our balance sheet speaks for itself and we have all followed what\u2019s happening in digital equities and the struggle there. So I believe there will be a day when sports betting and online gaming are very successful businesses and we will continue to look at the opportunity. We will wait patiently. It hasn\u2019t been a bad idea to wait for the last six months to eight months to see how this shakes out and there\u2019s done a lot of blood spill. But I think we will continue to evaluate is there an entry point that makes sense for LVS. We remain consistent, Robin, as you know and you have known for years, our bread and butter is still going to be Asia land-based as we will make -- we can\u2019t replicate a $5 billion business, which we think will come back in place in next year or so. So that\u2019s our first order of business and making sure our balance sheet is pristine, which now will be following the closing. But we will continue to monitor as the difficulties continue, the equity markets and the valuations change. The question is when does that situation get better? And I think it will and is an entry point for us and we will keep our eyes and ears open for that possibility. But waiting hasn\u2019t been the worst idea to see things shake out.\nRobin Farley: Yeah. Definitely not. Also a follow-up question is, can you remind us what your kind of latest thinking is on the size of the investment when you go to re-bid for the new license term? At times, you talked about things in the past, obviously, you are looking forward to investing more in Macao. Can you kind of remind us what your latest thoughts are on the size of that? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: I am not sure I understand. Patrick, I may have been missing it. I don\u2019t think we have a -- I mean we continue to be very bullish on Macao market despite the last 24 difficult months. We like what we are seeing, the retendering process. We are respectful of the process. We are continuing to help and be involved with the government. I don\u2019t think we have a dollar amount in mind or a specific approach at this time. Patrick or Grant, do you want to chime in?\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. I will just say one comment and then I will turn it over to Grant. But I think the important thing to note, it\u2019s still very early stages yet. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any details that we can really talk about in terms of our approach, because it\u2019s not known sort of where things are going to shake out. Grant, I don\u2019t know if you have any other comments that you want to add.\nGrant Chum: No. I think that\u2019s right. I think we just reiterate our general approach, which is continued reinvestment in our asset base and it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves we are coming to the end of our $2.3 billion CapEx program in Grand Suites at Four Seasons and The Londoner Macao. And we have really stayed the course during the pandemic. We have accelerated the works where we can, we have overcome all the challenges related to supply chain during this pandemic and we are coming well within budget. And we are delighted with the outcome. So I think that gives you a pretty good indicator both of our appetite, but also of our resolve to continue to reinvest, in particular, in the direction that the government is pointing towards across the various domains of diversification.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nRob Goldstein: Thanks, Robin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: Hi. Thanks. I guess two follow-ups. And the first is really a follow-up on Robin\u2019s question and Joe\u2019s earlier question on the legislative proposal. You mentioned it is still a work in progress, obviously, but I am wondering if you could just walk us through where you feel like you do have incremental clarity and where specifically there may still be pockets of uncertainty based on the language and your conversations.\nRob Goldstein: Grant, that\u2019s yours.\nGrant Chum: Thank you for the question. I think the main -- the key aspects of the legislation have been laid out in terms of the number of concessionaires and the duration of the future concession. But there are a lot of details in that to be worked out through the legislature. We just encapsulated one through the first meeting with the legislative, but firmly and we are now moving to the winning stage. So I think we can say at this point that it is still in draft form, but we really welcome the progress that\u2019s been made. So issue in so rapidly since the launch of the first public observation in September, it\u2019s only been a short 12 months since that time and we are already at this stage where we are going into the committee review of the draft. So I think the government has done an outstanding job in getting us to this stage of the process so quickly with a lot of framework being clarified. But it is important to remember that this is still draft legislation and we await the final outcome, hopefully, in the coming months.\nStephen Grambling: Fair enough. Maybe as an unrelated follow-up here, you continue to have impressive cost control despite a pretty difficult environment. How are you thinking about margins and labor inflation in Macao, as well as Singapore as we think about ultimate recovery versus maybe some of the cost reductions you have made?\nPatrick Dumont: So, hey, it\u2019s Patrick. It\u2019s something that we look at a lot with our team. And I think one of the focuses that we had during this pandemic over the last really two years has been to keep the core team together. So when we do recover, we have the ability to service our customers and get right back to business. And I think it\u2019s to credit to Grant, to the team in Singapore and really to everyone at the local teams that we are able to keep the group together, continue to focus, continue working and keep everyone healthy and safe. And I think where we are today, as we look about -- look at margins upon the recovery, we were in a pretty efficient business both at Sands China and in Singapore prior to the pandemic. If you look at our margins in the years leading up to the pandemic, Sands China team did an unbelievable job taking a lot of costs out of the business and becoming more efficient as we grew our business there. And so I think if you look over a series of years, we have always been cost focused. I don\u2019t want to say that there was really room in the prior operating level. What is true is that I\u2019d like to believe that the run rate margins for the business will be consistent with those margins prior to the pandemic. The one thing to note is that in Singapore, there is going to be a tax rate change, which will impact -- a gaming tax rate will impact margins at Marina Bay Sands when that happens. There will be some slight margin impact from that going forward. But as a practical matter, we would expect to have the same margins given the same level of volumes even taking into account mix. Because if you recall in Macao, our exposure to lower margin business such as junket and VIP is less, we are more premium mass focused. So we would like to believe our margin structure will be fairly consistent upon the recovery.\nStephen Grambling: Helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: Hey. Thanks. Can you just talk about potential future investments? I know that you have been looking at Florida and New York, any comments on those markets? And then when announced the project in UAE yesterday, have you considered that market? Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: I will take the U.S. and I will leave Patrick to discuss the UAE. Tom, as you know, we have been for years talking about -- maybe four-year time it\u2019s been so long. New York, we are big believers in that market. The recent announcement by Governor Hochul about three licenses is encouraging. We are in the hunt. I wouldn\u2019t want to overplay our hand, so we have -- what opportunity it might be. But it\u2019s a massive market underserved by the current product and by any metric that should be a massive market for us. So we are deep into it. We were there last week. We have a team on the ground working through it and we are hoping to get a license. That\u2019s all I will say about that. You have followed in the newspapers our efforts in Florida. We are in a signature gathering mode. It\u2019s a struggle down there. It\u2019s not an easy process to go through. But we are trying very much to be in the hunt in Florida. We really appreciate how underserved that market is and the material opportunities exist for a top-tier land-based opportunity in Florida would be wonderful. Same goes for Texas, all Texas a few years away from it. We have been down there. We have spent time in the market. We have people trying to find our place in that market if it does happen, but I think that\u2019s probably the farthest away from the decision. Patrick, do you want to address the Wynn [ph] that you raised the UAE, what happened over there yesterday?\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. Happy to. So a couple of thoughts. First off, as someone who\u2019s in the tourism business, our company is very focused on looking at markets, evaluating them and what different markets present in terms of both competition and things that customers like. And I would tell you, if you go to UAE and you go to -- and you see the investments that are going on there, it\u2019s really remarkable. The scale of investment, the quality of the investment is really unique to the world. It\u2019s a very special place. And I understand why Wynn would have interest going there. It is a tremendous tourism market, has a lot of potential. And to be fair, it is an economic center for that region. So in terms of opportunity, we all understood why there would be interest there for them to go. So it\u2019s something that we will continue to watch and look at. But there are a lot of high quality markets that are available to our company, Rob just referenced a few. And we are going to keep all of our options open and continue looking for opportunities for Las Vegas Sands to deploy capital in high quality developments. So that\u2019s really sort of our view on that situation.\nThomas Allen: Perfect. Thank you, Pat. And then just on the MBS $1 billion renovation. It\u2019s something you guys have been talking about for a long time, but you just added it to your slide deck this quarter. Is that just because now it\u2019s ready, any more details on the potential disruption or time line? Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. Well, it\u2019s a step that it\u2019s moving forward. I think the point we talked about a long time, Thomas, we have underinvested at times in these rooms and suites are deep into the renovation. I think we all know with the COVID environment. You always have the risk of either labor or supply chain risk. But we are moving nicely and the team, we have not been there, so I can\u2019t say we have seen it. But the images we see are very positive and I think it\u2019s moving at a really good pace assuming that there\u2019s no interruptions we can\u2019t control. Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: So, I think, what\u2019s interesting about it and you have heard Rob reference it before, and I think our team is very focused on using this time to the pandemic to enhance our product offerings and our attractiveness to our customers. And we have always been working with the Singapore Tourism Board to help achieve their goals while we invest. And I think there\u2019s been a focus in Singapore over the last few years on increasing high quality tourism and we believe the MBS is a leader in that area. We wanted to reinvest in the property to really enhance our suite of products and some of the other amenities that we have for our customers while we have some downtime. And so this is something that we have been looking at for many years. We have a high quality design team that will really create some of the best suites we have ever had in our system. We have had some great success with some of our efforts in Macao and some renovations with some of the new products we brought online during the pandemic and so we feel like our design level is really at a high level now and we are really looking forward to investing this amount of capital into Marina Bay Sands to create a level of suite product we never had there before, both in terms of account and in terms of quality. So this will address some of the goals that have been laid out by the Singapore Tourism Board and the government there, as well as help us address and grow our business in high value tourism. So that\u2019s really the objective. It\u2019s something that will happen really over the next two years. We are underway now and we hope to be complete as soon as possible. But in reality due to the labor and materials it looks like it\u2019s going to take two years.\nThomas Allen: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one, because it actually hasn\u2019t come up, I guess, it\u2019s a sign of the times really that, I was just wondering from either Grant or Wilfred if we could get a little color. Just on the COVID conditions and signaling on the ground in terms of possible reopening milestones you might be looking for? I believe there was actually a little bit of press from the government talking about the tourism industry and its importance. So maybe just a couple of your high level thoughts about things we can look forward to there?\nGrant Chum: Sure. Thanks for the question, Shaun. I think in the last few months, if you could describe it sequentially, we have come through some local cases on COVID that occurred in Macao at the end of September to early October. So obviously, the business environment was heavily impacted during the month of October. In fact, that was the lowest month in the entire year for the GGR for the city. As we move toward the end of the year, things improved in terms of the travel board policies around Zhuhai and Macao and then you saw the business volumes and visitations recouped accordingly. Most recently, we have had some local cases in Zhuhai, which has impacted the border again, and hopefully, we are going to be coming through the other side of that as they get that under control and as they have done. So I would describe it as not a lot has changed in terms of the overall environment. The government, both central government and local government continue to control the COVID cases exceptionally well in accordance with their policies. And as we move forward, we obviously have the Chinese New Year and also the Winter Olympics. And understandably, everyone is being more cautious in terms of traveling, and obviously, it\u2019s possible that beyond these events, as things improve in terms of the domestic cases in the various provinces and these big events are out of the way, we can look forward to a more positive picture in terms of travel.\nShaun Kelley: Great. Thank you. And then, just one probably for Patrick. But Patrick, you mentioned the Singapore tax rate. I think we picked that up in some of the local press as well. Just I was curious if you could give us a little bit more color on how that plays through. Is this the change that was actually tied back to the license extension or is this something that\u2019s incremental or different from that, because I think there was a tie-in to that, if I recall correctly, but it\u2019s -- frankly, it\u2019s been a couple of years?\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. It\u2019s just been a couple of years. This is the implementation of what was tied into the development agreements. So nothing has changed consistent with prior disclosure or prior discussions. But I just wanted to highlight it as something that may have an impact on margins going forward. That\u2019s all.\nShaun Kelley: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.\nDan Politzer: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So a quick follow-up on just the sports betting and i-gaming endeavors or analysis that you are doing. Have you given any thought or consideration to opportunities that would involve markets outside the U.S., such as Europe, are you really just focused on U.S. sports betting at this point?\nRob Goldstein: We consider all markets, yeah. We have markets that are on the table.\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. I think one thing to highlight\u2026\nDan Politzer: Okay. And just...\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. Sorry. One thing to highlight. So I think we are not just looking at sports betting. I think we are looking at a variety of opportunities in the digital space. And to Rob\u2019s point, in a variety of different markets, but we are not rushed. So we are building teams. We are making long-term investments. We are thinking about opportunities. We are focused on return on invested capital. And we are really looking at it through the lens of a long-term strategy that can blossom into something meaningful. And so, we are not just sort of chasing certain specific areas that may have valuations that are peaked at the day. I think we are looking for long-term high growth opportunities that present really positive returns. And so it\u2019s not just in sports wagering, it\u2019s a variety of different things, we are looking at different markets.\nDan Politzer: Got it. And then just a clarification on the capital allocation question from earlier and as you think about a repurchase versus the dividend, I mean, do you really need to see a more sustained recovery in Macao before returning capital or is there a scenario where you get the proceeds from the Venetian sale and Singapore starts to recover and you could be more active on that front beforehand?\nPatrick Dumont: I think from our standpoint, we sort of view return of capital for a very long-term shareholder enhancing process. And I think for us, we are going to want to see a return in our markets with a stable level of cash flow and post-pandemic conditions, where there\u2019s operational clarity before we begin return of capital. I think it\u2019s very important for the sustainability of any dividend and a return of capital program and it\u2019s something that we hope will come soon. There\u2019s been a lot of investment in public health initiatives and a lot of things that are incrementally making progress in both of our markets, and we are hopeful that this occurs in the near-term. And so, once that happens, we will start to evaluate potential return of capital. But, again, we sort of view the proceeds from the Las Vegas sale as permitting us to develop large scale destination resorts in new jurisdictions to help grow our business.\nDan Politzer: Got it. Understood. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. David, your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Just I am doing myself\u2026\nOperator: David, your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to, if I may, follow-up on two of the details from earlier where you talked about the $70 million and that sounds like it\u2019s in the EBITDA line. Is that solely in Macao, is that spread, does that include Singapore\u2026\nRob Goldstein: It\u2019s just Singapore.\nDavid Katz: \u2026and it just, Rob, with respect to the $500 million run rate, which is Macao, that is excluding what may or may not have occurred with respect to Omicron in January, correct?\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. I think, Dave, we mentioned apples and oranges [ph]. I think, first of all, the $70 million Patrick referenced was solely at MBS. And my $0.5 billion reference was on previous calls, I said, I think, the current situation which runs up and down every day. We -- I think in Singapore today is $0.5 billion EBITDA annual run rate until we get further VTL and stabilization. My point is I want to -- as you are aware, we are running that same $0.5 billion. We have a lot of optimism that that will change in 2022, perhaps, first half. But that\u2019s all Singapore related, the one-time non-recurring and that $500 million was referred to Singapore as well. We are not making any -- it\u2019s impossible in Macao to rationally predict anything until the government makes decisions on the visitation. It would be silly for us to speculate something that\u2019s so speculative. We have no underpinning of fact. I think once, look, we believe that market will explode when it opens back up again. But I think it\u2019s more of the second half of the year, but then again, who\u2019s to know? So we are not making any speculative decisions on a run rate in Macao.\nDavid Katz: Understood. If I can just follow-up very quickly, with respect to the makeup of business in Macao, not looking for a guide or a range, but any insight around\u2026\nRob Goldstein: Yeah.\nDavid Katz: \u2026 how VIP business, which may go away, could be recaptured through premium mass? Any tools or thoughts and perspectives to help us think about what portion of that would be really helpful?\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. I will just give you my quick look, and I want Grant to opine as well. I think we all believe that the junket -- having done this for many years in Macao, in the U.S., these customers in that segment are going to just disappear and when they read the other junket businesses not happening. Therefore, demand will go away. It\u2019s not going to go away. It will just resurrect in different segments and find new ways of materializing in the casino and it always is that way in any business. It goes back to any segment doesn\u2019t necessarily just go away, because the mechanism goes away. It just evolves to a different segmentation. So we are pretty bullish that a business that was yielding 8%, 10% could be much more positively profitable as a resurrection of the segments and so that\u2019s my take. I think any belief that the junket business segment is only just not thoughtful. Grant, do you want to add?\nGrant Chum: Sure. Yeah. I think, Rob, has just spot on on that, because you have to distinguish between the end demand and the distribution of it. So, I think, clearly, some portion of the end demand and we are not going to get drawn into exactly what the proportion will shift into the other segments and that\u2019s just natural because the end demand is there. Now, will some portion of it also dissipate and disappear. Sure, but that\u2019s probably the portion that was not in the first place, that\u2019s sustainable in any event. So I think the core underlying end demand that will find its way through other segments over time and we should distinguish between the end customer as opposed to the distribution system.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation today. This does conclude the Las Vegas Sands fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "I am happy to. Yeah. Hey, Joe. I appreciate the question. I think we have been pretty consistent in our thinking. It's been part of our long-term strategic plan, how to create additional capacity to really grow this business. Sheldon has really started from the beginning as you know, you followed us since day one that he's really been a developer of large-scale projects, and I think that ethos continues today within our company. And I think we are very excited about some of the opportunities that we have in front of us. Rob and the rest of the development team and our entire group has been working very hard. It's great opportunities to grow with large-scale development in the future. So I think the way we see the capital that's going to come into our system from the consummation of Vegas sale is really to grow the business. As we have always said before, the dividend and share repurchases really do represent part of our shareholder return strategy, the dividend being the cornerstone. We are looking forward to the opportunity of restarting the dividend program. But as we have said, and I think, we have been consistent about the idea that we really want to see a steady return to operational cash flow, understanding what those cash flow levels are from a trajectory, and call it, a sensitivity scenario perspective and then make an assessment about the profit return of capital at that time. We really view the dividend as something that needs to return on a stable and long-term basis. And so that's something that we will look to do when our cash flows return and we get out of pandemic operations, which unfortunately, during this quarter we were still in. Yeah. Sure. Happy to do it. So... Yeah. Of course, happy to do it. And Carlo, thanks for the question. One thing we did want to highlight is that we were positively impacted by approximately $70 million of non-recurring items during this quarter, including bonus reversals, job support scheme and some other items. So I wouldn't look at this as a run rate quarter. I think I would point you back to some of the comments that Rob made on some of our prior calls about that run rate envelope during these conditions, call it, the $500 million run rate EBITDA context. The real problem is things have kind of been switched on and switched off so much. It's hard to get a real read on the quarter. I think what is really encouraging is the vaccine travel lanes, the public health posture of the government, which really has been a leader in both vaccinations and the way they approach public health. And we are very encouraged about their approach towards long-term tourism and we are very excited to see how that plays out in the upcoming quarters. But I think, overall, the vaccine travel lanes were a big step. It was. It was. That's why I referred back to the run rate that we talked about previously. Thank you. Yeah. I will just say one comment and then I will turn it over to Grant. But I think the important thing to note, it's still very early stages yet. So I don't think there's any details that we can really talk about in terms of our approach, because it's not known sort of where things are going to shake out. Grant, I don't know if you have any other comments that you want to add. So, hey, it's Patrick. It's something that we look at a lot with our team. And I think one of the focuses that we had during this pandemic over the last really two years has been to keep the core team together. So when we do recover, we have the ability to service our customers and get right back to business. And I think it's to credit to Grant, to the team in Singapore and really to everyone at the local teams that we are able to keep the group together, continue to focus, continue working and keep everyone healthy and safe. And I think where we are today, as we look about -- look at margins upon the recovery, we were in a pretty efficient business both at Sands China and in Singapore prior to the pandemic. If you look at our margins in the years leading up to the pandemic, Sands China team did an unbelievable job taking a lot of costs out of the business and becoming more efficient as we grew our business there. And so I think if you look over a series of years, we have always been cost focused. I don't want to say that there was really room in the prior operating level. What is true is that I'd like to believe that the run rate margins for the business will be consistent with those margins prior to the pandemic. The one thing to note is that in Singapore, there is going to be a tax rate change, which will impact -- a gaming tax rate will impact margins at Marina Bay Sands when that happens. There will be some slight margin impact from that going forward. But as a practical matter, we would expect to have the same margins given the same level of volumes even taking into account mix. Because if you recall in Macao, our exposure to lower margin business such as junket and VIP is less, we are more premium mass focused. So we would like to believe our margin structure will be fairly consistent upon the recovery. Sure. Happy to. So a couple of thoughts. First off, as someone who's in the tourism business, our company is very focused on looking at markets, evaluating them and what different markets present in terms of both competition and things that customers like. And I would tell you, if you go to UAE and you go to -- and you see the investments that are going on there, it's really remarkable. The scale of investment, the quality of the investment is really unique to the world. It's a very special place. And I understand why Wynn would have interest going there. It is a tremendous tourism market, has a lot of potential. And to be fair, it is an economic center for that region. So in terms of opportunity, we all understood why there would be interest there for them to go. So it's something that we will continue to watch and look at. But there are a lot of high quality markets that are available to our company, Rob just referenced a few. And we are going to keep all of our options open and continue looking for opportunities for Las Vegas Sands to deploy capital in high quality developments. So that's really sort of our view on that situation. So, I think, what's interesting about it and you have heard Rob reference it before, and I think our team is very focused on using this time to the pandemic to enhance our product offerings and our attractiveness to our customers. And we have always been working with the Singapore Tourism Board to help achieve their goals while we invest. And I think there's been a focus in Singapore over the last few years on increasing high quality tourism and we believe the MBS is a leader in that area. We wanted to reinvest in the property to really enhance our suite of products and some of the other amenities that we have for our customers while we have some downtime. And so this is something that we have been looking at for many years. We have a high quality design team that will really create some of the best suites we have ever had in our system. We have had some great success with some of our efforts in Macao and some renovations with some of the new products we brought online during the pandemic and so we feel like our design level is really at a high level now and we are really looking forward to investing this amount of capital into Marina Bay Sands to create a level of suite product we never had there before, both in terms of account and in terms of quality. So this will address some of the goals that have been laid out by the Singapore Tourism Board and the government there, as well as help us address and grow our business in high value tourism. So that's really the objective. It's something that will happen really over the next two years. We are underway now and we hope to be complete as soon as possible. But in reality due to the labor and materials it looks like it's going to take two years. Yeah. It's just been a couple of years. This is the implementation of what was tied into the development agreements. So nothing has changed consistent with prior disclosure or prior discussions. But I just wanted to highlight it as something that may have an impact on margins going forward. That's all. Yeah. I think one thing to highlight... Yeah. Sorry. One thing to highlight. So I think we are not just looking at sports betting. I think we are looking at a variety of opportunities in the digital space. And to Rob's point, in a variety of different markets, but we are not rushed. So we are building teams. We are making long-term investments. We are thinking about opportunities. We are focused on return on invested capital. And we are really looking at it through the lens of a long-term strategy that can blossom into something meaningful. And so, we are not just sort of chasing certain specific areas that may have valuations that are peaked at the day. I think we are looking for long-term high growth opportunities that present really positive returns. And so it's not just in sports wagering, it's a variety of different things, we are looking at different markets. I think from our standpoint, we sort of view return of capital for a very long-term shareholder enhancing process. And I think for us, we are going to want to see a return in our markets with a stable level of cash flow and post-pandemic conditions, where there's operational clarity before we begin return of capital. I think it's very important for the sustainability of any dividend and a return of capital program and it's something that we hope will come soon. There's been a lot of investment in public health initiatives and a lot of things that are incrementally making progress in both of our markets, and we are hopeful that this occurs in the near-term. And so, once that happens, we will start to evaluate potential return of capital. But, again, we sort of view the proceeds from the Las Vegas sale as permitting us to develop large scale destination resorts in new jurisdictions to help grow our business."

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon and good morning to our colleagues in Asia, a very good morning for our colleagues in Asia. Thank you for joining our call today. We will have some brief comments and then we will go right to Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic's impact. Travel restrictions continue to affect visitation and our financial results in both Macao and Singapore this quarter. We did generate some positive EBITDA for the quarter in both markets. We remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore. The good news in Singapore, the travel restrictions and travel carters were established with many important source markets during the quarter. Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Australia, Thailand were all part of the initial rollout of the DTO program. And obviously, emergence of Omicron variant impacted the DTO program in late December. The DTO should contribute to a more robust recovery over time. Our confidence in the long-term opportunity in Singapore remains deep, and I am pleased to announce we have embarked to a $1 billion U.S. renovation project at MBS that will introduce luxurious new suite product to the resort. The program will meaningfully expand our room suite offerings and significantly enhance our appeal to premium customers. In Macao, the Londoner is near completion. As the market recovers, both the Four Seasons and Londoner will provide growth opportunities -- material growth opportunities in both the premium and mass customer segments. We continue to have the largest footprint in the world's greatest market, Macao, and appreciate the opportunity to provide input in the public consultation process ongoing. We look forward to participating in the tendering process as it proceeds to fruition. Customer demand and spending in Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective, as outlined, I think, on pages 29 and 30 in your deck. We continue to have great optimism about our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns. You may know our company is divided primarily into three material areas, the most important being Asia, the portfolio in Macao and Singapore. We remain confident we will return to strong positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover. The sale of Las Vegas creates liquidity and optionality as we pursue additional large-scale, land-based destination resorts in the U.S. and Asia. And we continue to build our digital presence. We are exploring multiple opportunities at this time and we will provide some color at the appropriate time. So let's go to your questions and thank you for listening. Hi, Joe Patrick? Grant, you there? Hi, Carlo. Yeah. We were very excited to see when there's rays of light and you can get in and the VTL is established, it was extraordinary. And I think it indicates -- it's a real predictor, Carlo, what's going to happen. That place opens back up. Hopefully, we see it in the first half of the year. Clearly, demand is going to be there. The VTL -- the government's thinking is very positive for us. I think Singapore probably gets there quicker than I think Macao might be later. But citing Singapore, the demand is clearly evident when the VTLs were open. It's a shame. I think we had a real - a positive momentum going that got crushed by the Omicron concerns. But I think that's just inevitable. The market is around us. I mean the important source markets are opening up, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, all improving. So we have a lot of hope to see a big bounce in Singapore. I would like to reference we had some non-recurring income in that quarter you should be aware of. Patrick, can you illuminate, just we are clear on the numbers on the... ...Singapore, of course? We... We have referenced $0.5 billion run rate until things get better over there. Until these travelings become real, we are still in the same range as our point not to get over exuberant about the $170 that it was. It is impacted by non-recurring? Thank you. Yeah. I think we have said in the past, we have always been interested in digital and all these interests that's happening in the market. But two things are happening at the same time. Our business, I think, is coming back to a stronger place. I think 2022 finally, especially in Singapore, and I think, as well in Macao, we will see that getting better. Our balance sheet speaks for itself and we have all followed what's happening in digital equities and the struggle there. So I believe there will be a day when sports betting and online gaming are very successful businesses and we will continue to look at the opportunity. We will wait patiently. It hasn't been a bad idea to wait for the last six months to eight months to see how this shakes out and there's done a lot of blood spill. But I think we will continue to evaluate is there an entry point that makes sense for LVS. We remain consistent, Robin, as you know and you have known for years, our bread and butter is still going to be Asia land-based as we will make -- we can't replicate a $5 billion business, which we think will come back in place in next year or so. So that's our first order of business and making sure our balance sheet is pristine, which now will be following the closing. But we will continue to monitor as the difficulties continue, the equity markets and the valuations change. The question is when does that situation get better? And I think it will and is an entry point for us and we will keep our eyes and ears open for that possibility. But waiting hasn't been the worst idea to see things shake out. I am not sure I understand. Patrick, I may have been missing it. I don't think we have a -- I mean we continue to be very bullish on Macao market despite the last 24 difficult months. We like what we are seeing, the retendering process. We are respectful of the process. We are continuing to help and be involved with the government. I don't think we have a dollar amount in mind or a specific approach at this time. Patrick or Grant, do you want to chime in? Thanks, Robin. Grant, that's yours. I will take the U.S. and I will leave Patrick to discuss the UAE. Tom, as you know, we have been for years talking about -- maybe four-year time it's been so long. New York, we are big believers in that market. The recent announcement by Governor Hochul about three licenses is encouraging. We are in the hunt. I wouldn't want to overplay our hand, so we have -- what opportunity it might be. But it's a massive market underserved by the current product and by any metric that should be a massive market for us. So we are deep into it. We were there last week. We have a team on the ground working through it and we are hoping to get a license. That's all I will say about that. You have followed in the newspapers our efforts in Florida. We are in a signature gathering mode. It's a struggle down there. It's not an easy process to go through. But we are trying very much to be in the hunt in Florida. We really appreciate how underserved that market is and the material opportunities exist for a top-tier land-based opportunity in Florida would be wonderful. Same goes for Texas, all Texas a few years away from it. We have been down there. We have spent time in the market. We have people trying to find our place in that market if it does happen, but I think that's probably the farthest away from the decision. Patrick, do you want to address the Wynn [ph] that you raised the UAE, what happened over there yesterday? Yeah. Well, it's a step that it's moving forward. I think the point we talked about a long time, Thomas, we have underinvested at times in these rooms and suites are deep into the renovation. I think we all know with the COVID environment. You always have the risk of either labor or supply chain risk. But we are moving nicely and the team, we have not been there, so I can't say we have seen it. But the images we see are very positive and I think it's moving at a really good pace assuming that there's no interruptions we can't control. Patrick? We consider all markets, yeah. We have markets that are on the table. It's just Singapore. Yeah. I think, Dave, we mentioned apples and oranges [ph]. I think, first of all, the $70 million Patrick referenced was solely at MBS. And my $0.5 billion reference was on previous calls, I said, I think, the current situation which runs up and down every day. We -- I think in Singapore today is $0.5 billion EBITDA annual run rate until we get further VTL and stabilization. My point is I want to -- as you are aware, we are running that same $0.5 billion. We have a lot of optimism that that will change in 2022, perhaps, first half. But that's all Singapore related, the one-time non-recurring and that $500 million was referred to Singapore as well. We are not making any -- it's impossible in Macao to rationally predict anything until the government makes decisions on the visitation. It would be silly for us to speculate something that's so speculative. We have no underpinning of fact. I think once, look, we believe that market will explode when it opens back up again. But I think it's more of the second half of the year, but then again, who's to know? So we are not making any speculative decisions on a run rate in Macao. Yeah. Yeah. I will just give you my quick look, and I want Grant to opine as well. I think we all believe that the junket -- having done this for many years in Macao, in the U.S., these customers in that segment are going to just disappear and when they read the other junket businesses not happening. Therefore, demand will go away. It's not going to go away. It will just resurrect in different segments and find new ways of materializing in the casino and it always is that way in any business. It goes back to any segment doesn't necessarily just go away, because the mechanism goes away. It just evolves to a different segmentation. So we are pretty bullish that a business that was yielding 8%, 10% could be much more positively profitable as a resurrection of the segments and so that's my take. I think any belief that the junket business segment is only just not thoughtful. Grant, do you want to add?"

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. I think the amendment to the gaming is still work in progress. It's working its way through the legislature. We need to wait further details in terms of the final form that the amendments would take and there will be additional regulatory measures that will be potentially issued thereafter. So, in general, to your question, we have always efficiently used our table allocation, and in general, we welcome the direction of linking table allocation with productivity, but specifics, I think, are yet to be outlined. No. I think that's right. I think we just reiterate our general approach, which is continued reinvestment in our asset base and it's worth reminding ourselves we are coming to the end of our $2.3 billion CapEx program in Grand Suites at Four Seasons and The Londoner Macao. And we have really stayed the course during the pandemic. We have accelerated the works where we can, we have overcome all the challenges related to supply chain during this pandemic and we are coming well within budget. And we are delighted with the outcome. So I think that gives you a pretty good indicator both of our appetite, but also of our resolve to continue to reinvest, in particular, in the direction that the government is pointing towards across the various domains of diversification. Thank you for the question. I think the main -- the key aspects of the legislation have been laid out in terms of the number of concessionaires and the duration of the future concession. But there are a lot of details in that to be worked out through the legislature. We just encapsulated one through the first meeting with the legislative, but firmly and we are now moving to the winning stage. So I think we can say at this point that it is still in draft form, but we really welcome the progress that's been made. So issue in so rapidly since the launch of the first public observation in September, it's only been a short 12 months since that time and we are already at this stage where we are going into the committee review of the draft. So I think the government has done an outstanding job in getting us to this stage of the process so quickly with a lot of framework being clarified. But it is important to remember that this is still draft legislation and we await the final outcome, hopefully, in the coming months. Sure. Thanks for the question, Shaun. I think in the last few months, if you could describe it sequentially, we have come through some local cases on COVID that occurred in Macao at the end of September to early October. So obviously, the business environment was heavily impacted during the month of October. In fact, that was the lowest month in the entire year for the GGR for the city. As we move toward the end of the year, things improved in terms of the travel board policies around Zhuhai and Macao and then you saw the business volumes and visitations recouped accordingly. Most recently, we have had some local cases in Zhuhai, which has impacted the border again, and hopefully, we are going to be coming through the other side of that as they get that under control and as they have done. So I would describe it as not a lot has changed in terms of the overall environment. The government, both central government and local government continue to control the COVID cases exceptionally well in accordance with their policies. And as we move forward, we obviously have the Chinese New Year and also the Winter Olympics. And understandably, everyone is being more cautious in terms of traveling, and obviously, it's possible that beyond these events, as things improve in terms of the domestic cases in the various provinces and these big events are out of the way, we can look forward to a more positive picture in terms of travel. Sure. Yeah. I think, Rob, has just spot on on that, because you have to distinguish between the end demand and the distribution of it. So, I think, clearly, some portion of the end demand and we are not going to get drawn into exactly what the proportion will shift into the other segments and that's just natural because the end demand is there. Now, will some portion of it also dissipate and disappear. Sure, but that's probably the portion that was not in the first place, that's sustainable in any event. So I think the core underlying end demand that will find its way through other segments over time and we should distinguish between the end customer as opposed to the distribution system."

Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Goldstein: Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon and good morning to our colleagues in Asia and thank you for joining our call today. I'll provide some brief comments then we'll go to the Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic's impact. Heightened restrictions directly impacted our results in both Macao and Singapore this quarter. We did generate positive EBITDA for the quarter in both markets. We remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore. Singapore gaming operations are closed for a portion of the quarter, enhanced restrictions were in place throughout the remainder of the quarter. The good news in Singapore, the travel quarters are being established with the number of source markets, which hopefully will contribute to the strong recovery of the time. Our considerable investments in Macao continues to take shape. As the market recovers, we believe that Four Seasons in London will present a growth opportunity in the future. The spend in Macao has proven both resilient, the premium mass level from both the gaming and retail perspective you can see on Page 29, 30 in your deck. We have great optimism about our ability to perform to a pre -pandemic level once visitation has returned. Our Company is divided in 3 areas. Most importantly, the Asia portfolio, Macao and Singapore, remain confident we will return to a strong positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as restrictions or fees in traveling tours recover. The sale of our Las Vegas assets create liquidity and optionality as we pursue large-scale land-based destination resorts in both U.S. and Asia. We will continue to build out our digital presence and we're exploring multiple opportunities we'll achieve in the appropriate time in future. So thanks for your time again, say let's go to the questions. Dan?\nDaniel Briggs : Operator, we're ready to go.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli : Hey, everybody, hope everyone's well. Rob, obviously, not going to spend a lot of time discussing the results as we all know that numerous impacting results right now. But what menu -- when you think about the progress as it pertains to Macao and what you're hearing around potential using of Visa stuff, whether it's on a province by province basis or whatever the latest is that you could share would be appreciated.\nRob Goldstein: Sure. We woke up 2 guys and they were nice so I'll let them speak to it. But, Grant and Wilfred, why don't you take that since you're on the ground, living and breathing them -- these issues every day.\nGrant Chum: Yes, let me do that.\nRob Goldstein: [Indiscernible]\nGrant Chum: Thanks, Rob. On the basis -- I think the main point is the Visa channels for the individual business game remains open. I think if you look at the quarter in the third quarter, what really impacted results during the quarter, month by month is really the conditions on the ground in terms of domestic COVID cases. So you will see that in July we had at 1 point for about 3 weeks in July, we had a pretty significant recovery in the visitation and also room occupancy. And we were starting to get a good momentum for the summer after the issues we had in the Guangdong outbreak in June. And then as we moved into late July and early August, we had more local cases starting with the Nanjing airport outbreak. And eventually in early August, we did have 4 local cases. So that obviously curtailed the traffic immediately. And as we move into September, again, we were recovering well, especially in the second and third week of September. And we were building up, ready for the October Golden Week again. And unfortunately, we did have some local cases towards the last week of September, which, again, reduced the traffic immediately as it led to additional restrictions around the border. So that really explains how the traffic flow evolve during the quarter.\nCarlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. Rob, you guys, did disclose, and I think this is different from how you've disclosed historically around capital expenditures in the period. The one line in there was $24 million of Corporate and Other. Does that -- what exactly does that pertain to and does that have anything to do with the comments that you made on the digital piece of the business?\nRob Goldstein: Sure. Pat, you want to take that?\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. I think there's a bunch of stuff in there. Some of the stuff relate to digital, but some of it relates to Capex associated with moving.\nCarlo Santarelli : Got it. And could you just update your latest thoughts on the learnings of the last couple of months, quarters as it pertains to the digital initiative to any degree, Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah, sure, happy to do it. I think for us, we take a very long-term approach. We mentioned it last quarter, I think this is something that's going to invest over quarters and years. We're really investing for the future. I think for us, we're looking to be mindful of the way we deploy capital. We've always had a history of investing in things that we think provide a very high level of returns in the future. And that's where we're thinking about it today. We think there's a great opportunity in digital and a variety of different areas. You see some of the valuations that the market is giving to certain areas today. We think it's very compelling, especially for the long-term. So right now we're just sort of moving along slowly and when we have more things to report, we will, as Rob said, his opening remarks, but we're very confidence. We have capital to deploy against that. We're excited about the future. And we have more things to talk about. We certainly well for right now, it's very early stages.\nCarlo Santarelli : Understood. Thank you, guys.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you, Carlo.\nOperator: Thank you.Your next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\nStephen Grambling : Hey, thank you. Maybe changing gears to look at Singapore, It looks like that market was also obviously impacting the quarter VIP, particularly soft. If we look out further once restrictions ease, I guess, how do you think about the potential EBITDA potential of that asset if VIP in Macao remains pressured. In other words, what kind of overlap do you typically see in Singapore from the Chinese traveler, and could that be impacted if VIP is permanently restricted?\nRob Goldstein: Sure. First, I think the fascinating part to me is we operate in 3 markets currently and Las Vegas is the blueprint and include recovery of Asia. We said -- about a year ago, I was coming to work and someone told me, here in Las Vegas we wouldn't see normal returns here, total revenue till '24, '25. We are already in the fall of '21 and the market's loan wide open. And what's the path? The path is pent-up demand vaccinations and doors get open. And I think Las Vegas will be the blueprint release, that's the path. So vaccinations in Asia are booming. If you can look at the what's happening in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, China, Korea, it's all above the percentage-wise what's happening in the U.S. So first, we have extremely strong vaccination rates in Asia, surpassing U.S. Number 2, I think you've got, obviously, the government that wants to open the doors in Singapore as evidenced by their actions they want just that. I think you'll see a big turn in '22. Your recovery will begin in '22. When do we get back to 1.7 and maybe beyond that EBITDA, I don't know. The exact date I can't tell you. I can tell you this, it's going to be a lot better in '22, if the government continues their path, which is shown a lot of leadership and thoughtfulness, the acceleration --vaccination rates, I think are actually approaching 80 plus percent. The market over there feels it's ready to come back in '22. As the government opens those travelings and we look at, again, the demand issues here in Las Vegas have been I think very instructive. It's great to walk through it and see the numbers that's kicking out through the city. Why wouldn't that happen in Asia? If Singapore has been a hugely important market to us. Your point about Macao versus the Chinese market, obviously, part of our business is dependent upon access to Chinese market, but it's not dependent. In fact, it still make a lot of money, maybe as much as a billion net dollars without a lot of Chinese inputs. So if Korea opens up and Singapore opens up, Malaysia opens up and Korea -- and Japan, those markets are very, very fat and happy for us. And I believe, the scenes are opening up throughout '22. That's the pick. If a vaccination rate is slowing, its open traveling, it's open your doors up and then watching what's happened in Vegas happen in Singapore. And I feel I don't want to identify a month or a quarter, but I think you're going to see a nice turn in '22. And then the same will happen in Macao when the government decides to open those doors up. I know there's people are -- people are saying '25, Macao opens up '27. But the truth is, Vegas has put about 30 minutes. Once they open their doors up, it just recovers. And base recovery is not a convention bank was based recovery out yet to come. I think the future in Vegas remains, as we voiced that very bright. And there's no reason why it can't be anyway it, in both Singapore and Macao as vaccination rates takeoff and government get more confident and travel lanes re open. So we're highly confident this will happen in Singapore in '22. To what degree? I don't I won't predict, but it's just a question for MVAS goes right back where it was pre - COVID it's just another -- so we're very confident.\nStephen Grambling : That's helpful. And perhaps as a follow-up, going back to Macao, what -- we'll love it just if you could provide any additional color on the consultation process. And what are the key points of clarification that you are watching for as you think about how to strategically position the business? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. We've been -- I've been involved in, well, my colleagues in the country over two decades. We've seen, I mean, we've been through everything and starting 20 years ago, and people tell you, you can't do business in Macao and then Cotai wouldn't be successful. Now, we have the incredibly crippling crisis in the 8 and 9. We had smoking issues. It always worked out. And we're very proud of what we've done in Macao over the years. I think our activities, our investments speak for themselves. I have faith in the process. They've always treat us fairly, and we responded with the largest investment in any gaming market in the world. So we believe -- we remain believers. We wait for the government's advice in direction. We've submitted our responses. But looking at our history on success, I believe, will be instructive to the future of our business in Macao. And so no more beyond that. I think it's clear to say that we have a lot of lead in this market.\nStephen Grambling : Fair enough. Thanks so much.\nRob Goldstein: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoe Greff : Hello, everybody. Rob and gang --\nRob Goldstein: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Greff : On Macao 's recovery and the potential for more meaningful, increased travel and mobility between Mainland China and Macao, do you get the impression, whether it's from conversations with the government and otherwise, that this is more likely after the Olympics in Beijing in February?\nRob Goldstein: I will defer them to the fellows in the ground up. I don't think we heard these points of Golden Week and it's going to happen when the Olympics are -- I don't think we know. I think it'd be silly for us to predict, Joe. I don't think we can really give you confidence that we have great insights when the doors will reopen. But we just know they will at some point. I think '22 will be a turn year. But I don't want to get into the game of saying it's to happen this date. I think we said in previous calls, we don't know when, we just know when it does happens to be very powerful and it's going to limit Las Vegas. I mean, anybody hasn't seen that, hasn't spend time in Macao. It's going to be quite a storm of activity over there. But I don't want the Olympics or Golden Week or -- because we -- obviously we've been wronged by those who predicted has fallen on a sort is no reason to. Grant, Wilfred, do you have a different approach to this? Speak up.\nGrant Chum: Agree.\nRob Goldstein: Sorry Grant. Go ahead.\nGrant Chum: Sorry Rob go ahead We see we see underlying demand continues to be very strong when the opportunity arises. Now, the opportunity has -- maybe has been relatively brief, one month here, a few weeks there. we can definitely see the underlying demand actually across all the different segments as very strong. And I think Rob referenced the pent-up demand that we've seen in Las Vegas coming through. And I think it's not going to be dissimilar in Macao. But I agree with Rob that we can't be really drawn into predicting timing. But we definitely see the evidence on the pent-up demand for sure.\nJoe Greff : Great. And then --\nRob Goldstein: Wilfred?\nDr. Wilfred Wong: And I think that China will open up to the world when they feel confident that they can control any community outbreak situations. And that depends a lot on the vaccination rate, which at this stage stands at about 80% and the availability of medicinal cure. They are now testing with all kinds of cure methods including Chinese herbal methods, and there's a lot of research going into it. So we're quite hopeful that very soon with -- they are vaccinating at about 1.3 million, 1.4 million people a day. So if they continue like this in another 200 days, it will be another 10% of the population. So I think as China's vaccination rate goes up, the government's confidence increases. And we are hopeful that Macao, as part of China, adopting similar policies will benefit from the opening up.\nJoe Greff : Great. Thank you. Patrick, on the investments on the digital side, can you talk about how you envision maybe the size of those investments over the next couple of years, are we talking about relatively small, more modest investments or could we see investments in hundreds of millions or a billion-dollar range, depending on what's available and what you like.\nPatrick Dumont: So it's something we talk about a lot internally. I think some of it's going to be related to the value of the opportunity that we see. I think it sort of our thoughts right now is that we're really thinking earlier stage or mid-stage. But again, it was fit into a larger strategy and that's kind of how we'll think about being effective for the long-term and how we think will create long-term value. I don't know that we'll necessarily look at something that's transformational right away. That's something that we may consider in the future depending on where things go and what market opportunity we see. But I think the good news is we've got plenty of firepower. We've got a strong management team and expertise in the industry and we think we can be really helpful to grow in technology. So from our standpoint, we're going to be opportunistic and we'll see how it goes. But in the beginning we're going to start small and sort of build from there.\nJoe Greff : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about one of the proposals in the new legislation. Is that it would require government approval for dividends. And if that were enacted, I realize it's just in the discussion stages now. But if that were enacted into law, would you think twice about investing if you -- if then there would be a chance that you wouldn't be approved to get a return on that investment? In other words, how much of a concern would that be for you? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: Patrick, you want to take that?\nPatrick Dumont: I'm sorry.\nRob Goldstein: Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: Grant, yes. I think from our standpoint, I think we're obviously very much focused on building on our past. As Rob mentioned, I think we have a great track record of investing in Macao, in scale and non-gaming amenities. And I think from our standpoint, we have confidence that we'll ultimately will result from this process will be a good path forward. And so we're very confident, we're eagerly waiting instructions on how to proceed. But in our mind, Macao is the best market in the world, we continue to invest. We're very excited about the long term in Macao and wait and see how things go. But from our standpoint, we're very confident about the future.\nGrant Chum: Rob, one thing I think we tried to reference is, after 2 decades of being there, we've never found the government to be not thoughtful. They're very thoughtful, and they're going to take these issues and make it reasonable for all of us. We're not that concerned. I mean, I saw initially the response was putting like that, they're concerned. We don't have this concerns, and yes, we're eager to reinvest in Macao. We were assuming that the process will be fair and equal, and we're also assuming that they want us to invest as well. The government there wants the growth in Macao. So we're not that concerned about that issue at all.\nRobin Farley : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Just in terms of timing or potential extension of your existing concession, is there a point at which you feel the indication is that it's going to be extended for at least another 12 months? I mean, just given the timing already seems would be -- seems very challenging to do anything before June of '22, given the inability to travel into the country. Is that safe to assume that, at this point, it's not something that you would expect to come up for bid before June? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: I don't think -- we're not going to voice their opinion because we just, again, we remain confident the process will work out. Again, we have 2 decades of history with this government, and it's been a very good 2 decades. This Company built a great business base on it. We've had, like every business you have stops and starts, and good days and bad days. In the 2 decades since we started doing business in Macao, we've always found the government very reasonable, very thoughtful, and very fair. And we're not concerned when they make that decision next month or month after or make it in June. I don't know when they're going to make that decision. I'll let them make that decision and tell us. We'll respond accordingly, but we have no trepidation or bring fear that will be an issue to us. We knew this was coming. I mean, it is a lease, so we knew this day was coming and we're prepared for it. And we're also prepared to wait till the government tells us how they want to proceed and will respect for that process.\nRobin Farley : Okay. great. Thank you very much.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley : Hi, good morning and afternoon, everyone. Just to maybe follow-up on the whole licensing process. I mean, I think one thing we've all thought about is the requirement or the idea that they're probably incremental capital that would need to be invested either in Macao, theoretically in non-gaming amenities which you knew well, or in somewhere in greater Mainland China, I just wanted to ask about that last point. Any thoughts on your desire, your ability to invest directly in mainland China? Is that something you'd be prepared to do and sort of how would you kind of underwrite returns or thinking about underwriting those given some of your return focus. If that was the ask.\nRob Goldstein: A lot of other factors, but I'm going to preempt up by saying we, again, you know we have the ability to invest as clear based on our balance sheet. We have the appetite to invest. We have a track record that was -- that obviously we invested 15 billion. We invested a few billion dollars right before the pandemic hit, which people thought, oh gee, you want the clarity of the license, we did it. So we remain willing and eager to invest in Macao and perhaps other parts Macao, and just waiting for that day to happen. Patrick, you want to jump in?\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. Thanks, Rob. We're very happy, very proud of Sheldon's long-term vision for Macao and for our Company's investments. We're proud of what Sheldon and the Company in the team has accomplished over many years there, the amount of investment, the high-quality of tours and assets that we've created, the tours and drivers, the non-gaming diversification. And really to be fair, a lot of the tourism innovation that we brought to Macao we've all been saying things that have been complementary and follow through with the original goal of the first concession. And so we're very proud about that and we're very confident about the future and our ability to invest in or support these long-term goals of the government and for the Company. And so I think as we look to potential things that we may have to do in terms of future investment, we welcome the opportunity. We would love to invest more. We're very eager to deploy capital into these markets. We think they're very high quality and we really believe in the future. So there's just been a lot of commentary around things that may happen to occur or may have to occur. I don't think anyone really knows. I think the only thing that we're very confident about is our ability to invest, to innovate from the tourism side, and to drive really the support of the initiatives that have been asked about. So from that standpoint, we're ready to do it. But until we have clear direction, there's not really much more we can say.\nShaun Kelley : Great. And maybe just as the follow-up, sticking with the investment team, probably for you, Patrick, but just thinking about the same question for Singapore. Obviously, there you have a little bit more of a developed path on dollars that have been allocated and when you want to get going. But can you just give us the latest on when you think you'd actually be moving on some of the investments you, guys, have committed to make there and building out the additional hotel tower and expansion?\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. As we've said before, I think we're very excited to do it. It represents a tremendous opportunity to support Singapore 's goals, to deploy a significant amount of capital in the most privileged market in the world, which is really one of the great cities in the world. Singapore is growing. It was growing tremendously before the pandemic and they've really been leaders in their public health initiatives to support their population during the pandemic. So we're very proud to be there. I think we would love to get started soon as possible. But right now they're dealing with a lot of things that have a higher priority. So we're waiting patiently. We have a long-term partnership with the government and we're looking forward to working through new open remaining items so that we can begin. But our plan is to begin and we're very excited about it. So the question is when and I think that's going to be dictated by necessary public health responses around timing and opening.\nShaun Kelley : Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question -- your next question is from Ben Chaiken from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Chaiken: Hey, everyone. There's been lots of -- there's been lots of conversation understandably about investing in digital and 2, to investments that maybe required in Singapore and Macao. But at the same time, you spoke about pent-up demand in Macao and Singapore, which seems to make a share buyback at these levels, potentially a more compelling ROI. I guess, how do you balance the optionality of those different options, I guess? Yeah.\nPatrick Dumont: So we think about this a lot. We spend a lot of time on it as a management team. We run a lot of sensitivities and scenarios around potential returns. And it's interesting. We have a lot of opportunity as the Company, we're really excited about it. And I think our highest and best use of capital and to create the best shareholder returns really is to develop new projects from the ground up. That's how we built the Company. That's how we've always created the return profile that has made our equity very compelling. And so from our standpoint, that's our focus. Rob and the rest of the team spent a lot of time looking into development opportunities in many different jurisdictions. And so we're focused on deploying capital into those jurisdictions to grow the business. At the same time, we recognize there's opportunity in the equity. And in the past, we've always returned excess capital through share repurchases. And so that's something that we'll look to do in the future. But at this point, I think we're evaluating a lot of opportunities for real growth. And so from that standpoint, we're very excited, but we'll always look at the return potential of buy equity. Do we believe the equity is at a compelling level? Absolutely. But at the same time, we also like to believe that we have some real significant available opportunities in the future that will create very significant returns as well. So to your point, it is balanced. But we look at it and we're trying to allocate capital in the best way that we can.\nBenjamin Chaiken: Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDan Politzer: Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So on Singapore, how do you think about margins for this property over the next couple of years? I think there is a higher tax rate that goes into effect and potentially impact from construction disruption, and possibly some of the costs you were able to optimize over the past 18 months. Going forward over the next couple of years, how do you think about that given the expectation for pent-up demand to come back in 2022?\nRob Goldstein: Firstly, I look at what's happened. Again, it's instructive look in Las Vegas. The so-called four-year recovery took again about less than a year. I think Singapore is in arrival. Las Vegas becomes the pre -COVID recovery being stronger, which means stronger margins for us and bigger growth. I think -- there's this market in Singapore is proving very resilient in the past, especially when the government's come to open traveling, to open the doors up. I think margin will be just fine. We didn't -- by the way, we didn't furlough people or lay off. Lots of people -- we didn't squeeze people out the door. We stood by our employees and I think we didn't necessarily maximize -- we could have, we decided not to do that. And I think that's to our credit. But on the other hand, I think our business there will currently reoccur back to pre -COVID levels and probably beyond pre -COVID. And again, if Vegas is instructive and I believe it is, the demand is going to be extraordinary in Asia. The Lock down here in Las Vegas is much shorter. than the lock-down in Asia. Yet the gaming proclivity for lot of Asian countries is solid in Las Vegas. So anybody things Singapore is not going to come back with a vengeance, I think is mistake, the same Macao. And of course those revenues will drive our margins. So I have no fear that were returned to pre-COVID and margins and pre-COVID revenues exceed both. Really voice on Singapore will be the first and the best place open next year for the gamer, or for the tourist or for the leisure leisure travel is going to be exceptional plans to revisit. You see where the government is going. They've indicated they're anxious being open. Their vaccination rates are soaring. The traveling is being established. The neighbor is getting better in Malaysia, Korea, Japan. Indonesia is still lagging, but coming on. So I use this question time, '22 is return year till we see margins and revenues, and EBITDA has been much more back to normal than they've been the last 24 months.\nDan Politzer: Got it. Thanks. And then just one more on Macao. I mean, when Macao does eventually recover, how do you think about your share of GGR evolving given the opening of the London area, which we didn't have back in 2019? And also, I know how to target different customer, but how do you anticipate any impact from Lisboa Palace on your properties? And if so, if there's an impact, which ones?\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. Mr. Chum, are you still here?\nGrant Chum: Yeah, Rob. I think history of Macao shows every time we have large-scale high-quality product coming in on Cotai, it helps the market. And I think when the demand comes back, it's going to be to the market's benefit and to the whole industry's benefit that we've got good new product that customers can patronize. And that applies to Lisboa Palace, that applies to with some buck, other competitors will be -- will have open by then. And, obviously, we think first and foremost is going to apply to what we've completed in Grand Suites at Four Seasons, and also to London and Macao. So we're very excited and confident that when the demand returns, all these new projects but I would say, especially all projects is going to be a growth driver for the industry. And by implication, we hope that we will achieve good market share. But I think it's much more about as the history and 2 decades of shan growing the overall pie. And I think in terms of segments, again, I wouldn't hesitate to say that it's going to be positive across a very broad base of segmentation of the mass -- the premium mass and so forth.\nDan Politzer: Got it. Thanks so much, guys.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nRob Goldstein: Hi, David.\nPatrick Dumont: David, you there?\nRob Goldstein: David? We lost Mr. Katz.\nOperator: Okay. We'll go to the next question. It's from the line of Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is open.\nSteve Wieczynski : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just one question here for me -- good afternoon, Rob. Just one question for me. And Rob, I know you're probably tired of answering a bunch of hear-say questions about the renewal process. And this one is probably going to be a bit more direct. I guess the simple question is, do you guys see a scenario out there where you are not operating any casino assets in Macao at some point in the near future? And I'm sorry to be so blunt, but it's a question I think a lot of investors are pondering right now given the bigness that has come out of the Chinese government about what they're actually looking for.\nRob Goldstein: I do not -- I see no chance of that whatsoever. I think we're -- but I -- I'll refer as I -- I apologize by singing a broken record, but the truth is we've been doing this for a couple of decades, we have unparalleled track record. The whole Cotai development would be -- one guy did that and it's Sheldon. One guy put $15 billion around the non-gaming and gaming assets. One Company made almost $4 billion EBITDA, and I think we have been stellar with our employees. So I remain beyond confident that we'll be operating in Macao. I don't think chance whatsoever that we wouldn't be. I'm not saying that rhetorically. I mean that sincerely. Our -- every indication we have gotten is to the opposite. So we, again, I'm very proud of our track record throughout profitable development, profitable investment, but I think the government is recognize we've been a lawfully good licensee and partner and friend China and Macao. And we're eagerly back there. So no, I don't believe that's a possibility.\nSteve Wieczynski : Okay. Great. Thanks, Grant and Rob.\nRob Goldstein: Sure. Anything else?\nOperator: Your final question is from the line of David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz : Hi, can you hear me now?\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. We thought you fell asleep on us because you're in Macao.\nDavid Katz : There is no sleeping at Jefferies. What I was really hoping to have the team's perspective on is really VIP gaming. Because we do spend a fair amount of time talking with investors, with people on the ground, et cetera, around what the VIP -- what the future of the VIP business really looks like. There have been some public pressures on it. Talk about currency, changes, and things like that, that presumably would have some impact. What is the real growth solid recovery core look like in VIP?\nRob Goldstein: I just want to let Grant take that question, you listened and read. You talking Macao, I assume in the whole track of this discover, right?\nDavid Katz : Yes.\nRob Goldstein: Okay. So let's begin with a little bit of historical perspective. Again, for the 20 plus years we've been doing business in Macao, we incurred this, this isn't going to work, that's not going to work. The revenues will never go anywhere. I believe this is for off one. Segments are going to fall apart. The latest thing is to say the VIP is not always the junket side. I just remain a huge believer in that market of all segments. Obviously, we've made our strength in the mass -- premium mass has been our bread and butter and will continue to be. But I don't think you'll ever discount, those who have discount, this segment has done it at their own parallel. I think it can -- it could move to a different channel, the different way of being available. But gamers are going to keep happening in all segments in Macao. I just -- as a precursor to Grant's comments, I think you have to realize how awful this market has been, the growth has been unbelievable. Those of us who started back in 2002, 2003, and 2004, never dreamed the way every segment just developed in the 2010, 2011, 2012 era. It was the junk as we drove Macao to sent and morph into our premium mass market -- our premium mass market. And again, our Company has been more focused on the base mass and premium mass segments. But the VIP had served the market very well. So I think it will re-merge in different form with different channels of distribution. And that's my take. Grant, you're much closer to this, so please speak up.\nGrant Chum: I think you said it very well, Rob. I think it's important to remember, again, the proportion of profit coming from that segment, especially, I think, you have more referencing the junket segment versus our own VIP business. It's very, very small. It's really low single-digit pre-COVID. So I know people spend a lot of time talking about it, but our business is really geared to that large scale destination resort with premium mass, mass, the leisure, the FIT, and the future is going to be that structural growth in those segments, as well as the non-gaming, the retail, the MICE. And so that's where really our re-investments and asset base has really focused on.\nRob Goldstein: I think the driver gets Grant's point -- the driver that market is always going to be or work focuses lifestyle. Extraordinary entertainment, restaurants, retail, rooms, that's where investors -- we see the London, that's where the focus was. The Four Seasons is more towards the very high-end premium mass. But no matter what form it takes, the gamble is that it'll just keep growing over there and the desire to come to will grow. So whether it be the new -- as we built another Company, it just enhances the market. And I don't think there'll ever be a lack of customers, a lack of visitors to Macao. The problem's going to be when the market comes flooring back in, whenever, it's '22 or whenever. I think the problem's going to be lack of capacity, going to be lack of rooms. That part is always going to be burdened by needs new capacity, needs new lodging because whether it be based mask, pre-mask, it is no longer a Hong-Kong dependent overnight market. It's a stay-overnight market, it's a leisure market, it's a business market, it's a spectacular market. And we're going to be there with everybody else, trying to get our fair share, and I think our new assets, if we ever get to see them,? next year, are going to surprise you. What we've done with the London or Four Seasons is the best thing we've ever done, in my opinion. So we look forward to getting back to Macao and getting back to business. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you, speakers. There are no more questions. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. That you all for joining. You may not disconnect.",

            "content": "And I think that China will open up to the world when they feel confident that they can control any community outbreak situations. And that depends a lot on the vaccination rate, which at this stage stands at about 80% and the availability of medicinal cure. They are now testing with all kinds of cure methods including Chinese herbal methods, and there's a lot of research going into it. So we're quite hopeful that very soon with -- they are vaccinating at about 1.3 million, 1.4 million people a day. So if they continue like this in another 200 days, it will be another 10% of the population. So I think as China's vaccination rate goes up, the government's confidence increases. And we are hopeful that Macao, as part of China, adopting similar policies will benefit from the opening up."

            "content": "Sure. I think there's a bunch of stuff in there. Some of the stuff relate to digital, but some of it relates to Capex associated with moving. Yeah, sure, happy to do it. I think for us, we take a very long-term approach. We mentioned it last quarter, I think this is something that's going to invest over quarters and years. We're really investing for the future. I think for us, we're looking to be mindful of the way we deploy capital. We've always had a history of investing in things that we think provide a very high level of returns in the future. And that's where we're thinking about it today. We think there's a great opportunity in digital and a variety of different areas. You see some of the valuations that the market is giving to certain areas today. We think it's very compelling, especially for the long-term. So right now we're just sort of moving along slowly and when we have more things to report, we will, as Rob said, his opening remarks, but we're very confidence. We have capital to deploy against that. We're excited about the future. And we have more things to talk about. We certainly well for right now, it's very early stages. So it's something we talk about a lot internally. I think some of it's going to be related to the value of the opportunity that we see.

And in the past, we've always returned excess capital through share repurchases. And so that's something that we'll look to do in the future. But at this point, I think we're evaluating a lot of opportunities for real growth. And so from that standpoint, we're very excited, but we'll always look at the return potential of buy equity. Do we believe the equity is at a compelling level? Absolutely. But at the same time, we also like to believe that we have some real significant available opportunities in the future that will create very significant returns as well. So to your point, it is balanced. But we look at it and we're trying to allocate capital in the best way that we can. David, you there?"

            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon and good morning to our colleagues in Asia and thank you for joining our call today. I'll provide some brief comments then we'll go to the Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic's impact. Heightened restrictions directly impacted our results in both Macao and Singapore this quarter. We did generate positive EBITDA for the quarter in both markets. We remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore. Singapore gaming operations are closed for a portion of the quarter, enhanced restrictions were in place throughout the remainder of the quarter. The good news in Singapore, the travel quarters are being established with the number of source markets, which hopefully will contribute to the strong recovery of the time. Our considerable investments in Macao continues to take shape. As the market recovers, we believe that Four Seasons in London will present a growth opportunity in the future. The spend in Macao has proven both resilient, the premium mass level from both the gaming and retail perspective you can see on Page 29, 30 in your deck. We have great optimism about our ability to perform to a pre -pandemic level once visitation has returned. Our Company is divided in 3 areas. Most importantly, the Asia portfolio, Macao and Singapore, remain confident we will return to a strong positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as restrictions or fees in traveling tours recover. The sale of our Las Vegas assets create liquidity and optionality as we pursue large-scale land-based destination resorts in both U.S. and Asia. We will continue to build out our digital presence and we're exploring multiple opportunities we'll achieve in the appropriate time in future. So thanks for your time again, say let's go to the questions. Dan? Sure. We woke up 2 guys and they were nice so I'll let them speak to it. But, Grant and Wilfred, why don't you take that since you're on the ground, living and breathing them -- these issues every day. [Indiscernible] Sure. Pat, you want to take that? Thank you, Carlo. Sure. First, I think the fascinating part to me is we operate in 3 markets currently and Las Vegas is the blueprint and include recovery of Asia. We said -- about a year ago, I was coming to work and someone told me, here in Las Vegas we wouldn't see normal returns here, total revenue till '24, '25. We are already in the fall of '21 and the market's loan wide open. And what's the path? The path is pent-up demand vaccinations and doors get open. And I think Las Vegas will be the blueprint release, that's the path. So vaccinations in Asia are booming. If you can look at the what's happening in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, China, Korea, it's all above the percentage-wise what's happening in the U.S. So first, we have extremely strong vaccination rates in Asia, surpassing U.S. Number 2, I think you've got, obviously, the government that wants to open the doors in Singapore as evidenced by their actions they want just that. I think you'll see a big turn in '22. Your recovery will begin in '22. When do we get back to 1.7 and maybe beyond that EBITDA, I don't know. The exact date I can't tell you. I can tell you this, it's going to be a lot better in '22, if the government continues their path, which is shown a lot of leadership and thoughtfulness, the acceleration --vaccination rates, I think are actually approaching 80 plus percent. The market over there feels it's ready to come back in '22. As the government opens those travelings and we look at, again, the demand issues here in Las Vegas have been I think very instructive. It's great to walk through it and see the numbers that's kicking out through the city. Why wouldn't that happen in Asia? If Singapore has been a hugely important market to us. Your point about Macao versus the Chinese market, obviously, part of our business is dependent upon access to Chinese market, but it's not dependent. In fact, it still make a lot of money, maybe as much as a billion net dollars without a lot of Chinese inputs. So if Korea opens up and Singapore opens up, Malaysia opens up and Korea -- and Japan, those markets are very, very fat and happy for us. And I believe, the scenes are opening up throughout '22. That's the pick. If a vaccination rate is slowing, its open traveling, it's open your doors up and then watching what's happened in Vegas happen in Singapore. And I feel I don't want to identify a month or a quarter, but I think you're going to see a nice turn in '22. And then the same will happen in Macao when the government decides to open those doors up. I know there's people are -- people are saying '25, Macao opens up '27. But the truth is, Vegas has put about 30 minutes. Once they open their doors up, it just recovers. And base recovery is not a convention bank was based recovery out yet to come. I think the future in Vegas remains, as we voiced that very bright. And there's no reason why it can't be anyway it, in both Singapore and Macao as vaccination rates takeoff and government get more confident and travel lanes re open. So we're highly confident this will happen in Singapore in '22. To what degree? I don't I won't predict, but it's just a question for MVAS goes right back where it was pre - COVID it's just another -- so we're very confident. Yeah. We've been -- I've been involved in, well, my colleagues in the country over two decades. We've seen, I mean, we've been through everything and starting 20 years ago, and people tell you, you can't do business in Macao and then Cotai wouldn't be successful. Now, we have the incredibly crippling crisis in the 8 and 9. We had smoking issues. It always worked out. And we're very proud of what we've done in Macao over the years. I think our activities, our investments speak for themselves. I have faith in the process. They've always treat us fairly, and we responded with the largest investment in any gaming market in the world. So we believe -- we remain believers. We wait for the government's advice in direction. We've submitted our responses. But looking at our history on success, I believe, will be instructive to the future of our business in Macao. And so no more beyond that. I think it's clear to say that we have a lot of lead in this market. Sure. Thank you. Hi, Joe. I will defer them to the fellows in the ground up. I don't think we heard these points of Golden Week and it's going to happen when the Olympics are -- I don't think we know. I think it'd be silly for us to predict, Joe. I don't think we can really give you confidence that we have great insights when the doors will reopen. But we just know they will at some point. I think '22 will be a turn year. But I don't want to get into the game of saying it's to happen this date. I think we said in previous calls, we don't know when, we just know when it does happens to be very powerful and it's going to limit Las Vegas. I mean, anybody hasn't seen that, hasn't spend time in Macao. It's going to be quite a storm of activity over there. But I don't want the Olympics or Golden Week or -- because we -- obviously we've been wronged by those who predicted has fallen on a sort is no reason to. Grant, Wilfred, do you have a different approach to this? Speak up. Sorry Grant. Go ahead. Wilfred? Patrick, you want to take that? Patrick? I don't think -- we're not going to voice their opinion because we just, again, we remain confident the process will work out. Again, we have 2 decades of history with this government, and it's been a very good 2 decades. This Company built a great business base on it. We've had, like every business you have stops and starts, and good days and bad days. In the 2 decades since we started doing business in Macao, we've always found the government very reasonable, very thoughtful, and very fair. And we're not concerned when they make that decision next month or month after or make it in June. I don't know when they're going to make that decision. I'll let them make that decision and tell us. We'll respond accordingly, but we have no trepidation or bring fear that will be an issue to us. We knew this was coming. I mean, it is a lease, so we knew this day was coming and we're prepared for it. And we're also prepared to wait till the government tells us how they want to proceed and will respect for that process. Thank you. A lot of other factors, but I'm going to preempt up by saying we, again, you know we have the ability to invest as clear based on our balance sheet. We have the appetite to invest. We have a track record that was -- that obviously we invested 15 billion. We invested a few billion dollars right before the pandemic hit, which people thought, oh gee, you want the clarity of the license, we did it. So we remain willing and eager to invest in Macao and perhaps other parts Macao, and just waiting for that day to happen. Patrick, you want to jump in? Thank you. Firstly, I look at what's happened. Again, it's instructive look in Las Vegas. The so-called four-year recovery took again about less than a year. I think Singapore is in arrival. Las Vegas becomes the pre -COVID recovery being stronger, which means stronger margins for us and bigger growth. I think -- there's this market in Singapore is proving very resilient in the past, especially when the government's come to open traveling, to open the doors up. I think margin will be just fine. We didn't -- by the way, we didn't furlough people or lay off. Lots of people -- we didn't squeeze people out the door. We stood by our employees and I think we didn't necessarily maximize -- we could have, we decided not to do that. And I think that's to our credit. But on the other hand, I think our business there will currently reoccur back to pre -COVID levels and probably beyond pre -COVID. And again, if Vegas is instructive and I believe it is, the demand is going to be extraordinary in Asia. The Lock down here in Las Vegas is much shorter. than the lock-down in Asia. Yet the gaming proclivity for lot of Asian countries is solid in Las Vegas. So anybody things Singapore is not going to come back with a vengeance, I think is mistake, the same Macao. And of course those revenues will drive our margins. So I have no fear that were returned to pre-COVID and margins and pre-COVID revenues exceed both. Really voice on Singapore will be the first and the best place open next year for the gamer, or for the tourist or for the leisure leisure travel is going to be exceptional plans to revisit. You see where the government is going. They've indicated they're anxious being open. Their vaccination rates are soaring. The traveling is being established. The neighbor is getting better in Malaysia, Korea, Japan. Indonesia is still lagging, but coming on. So I use this question time, '22 is return year till we see margins and revenues, and EBITDA has been much more back to normal than they've been the last 24 months. Yeah. Mr. Chum, are you still here? Thank you. Hi, David. David? We lost Mr. Katz. I do not -- I see no chance of that whatsoever. I think we're -- but I -- I'll refer as I -- I apologize by singing a broken record, but the truth is we've been doing this for a couple of decades, we have unparalleled track record. The whole Cotai development would be -- one guy did that and it's Sheldon. One guy put $15 billion around the non-gaming and gaming assets. One Company made almost $4 billion EBITDA, and I think we have been stellar with our employees. So I remain beyond confident that we'll be operating in Macao. I don't think chance whatsoever that we wouldn't be. I'm not saying that rhetorically. I mean that sincerely. Our -- every indication we have gotten is to the opposite. So we, again, I'm very proud of our track record throughout profitable development, profitable investment, but I think the government is recognize we've been a lawfully good licensee and partner and friend China and Macao. And we're eagerly back there. So no, I don't believe that's a possibility. Sure. Anything else? Yeah. We thought you fell asleep on us because you're in Macao. I just want to let Grant take that question, you listened and read. You talking Macao, I assume in the whole track of this discover, right? Okay. So let's begin with a little bit of historical perspective. Again, for the 20 plus years we've been doing business in Macao, we incurred this, this isn't going to work, that's not going to work. The revenues will never go anywhere. I believe this is for off one. Segments are going to fall apart. The latest thing is to say the VIP is not always the junket side. I just remain a huge believer in that market of all segments. Obviously, we've made our strength in the mass -- premium mass has been our bread and butter and will continue to be. But I don't think you'll ever discount, those who have discount, this segment has done it at their own parallel. I think it can -- it could move to a different channel, the different way of being available. But gamers are going to keep happening in all segments in Macao. I just -- as a precursor to Grant's comments, I think you have to realize how awful this market has been, the growth has been unbelievable. Those of us who started back in 2002, 2003, and 2004, never dreamed the way every segment just developed in the 2010, 2011, 2012 era. It was the junk as we drove Macao to sent and morph into our premium mass market -- our premium mass market. And again, our Company has been more focused on the base mass and premium mass segments. But the VIP had served the market very well. So I think it will re-merge in different form with different channels of distribution. And that's my take. Grant, you're much closer to this, so please speak up. I think the driver gets Grant's point -- the driver that market is always going to be or work focuses lifestyle. Extraordinary entertainment, restaurants, retail, rooms, that's where investors -- we see the London, that's where the focus was. The Four Seasons is more towards the very high-end premium mass. But no matter what form it takes, the gamble is that it'll just keep growing over there and the desire to come to will grow. So whether it be the new -- as we built another Company, it just enhances the market. And I don't think there'll ever be a lack of customers, a lack of visitors to Macao. The problem's going to be when the market comes flooring back in, whenever, it's '22 or whenever. I think the problem's going to be lack of capacity, going to be lack of rooms. That part is always going to be burdened by needs new capacity, needs new lodging because whether it be based mask, pre-mask, it is no longer a Hong-Kong dependent overnight market. It's a stay-overnight market, it's a leisure market, it's a business market, it's a spectacular market. And we're going to be there with everybody else, trying to get our fair share, and I think our new assets, if we ever get to see them,? next year, are going to surprise you. What we've done with the London or Four Seasons is the best thing we've ever done, in my opinion. So we look forward to getting back to Macao and getting back to business. Thanks, David."

            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yes, let me do that. Thanks, Rob. On the basis -- I think the main point is the Visa channels for the individual business game remains open. I think if you look at the quarter in the third quarter, what really impacted results during the quarter, month by month is really the conditions on the ground in terms of domestic COVID cases. So you will see that in July we had at 1 point for about 3 weeks in July, we had a pretty significant recovery in the visitation and also room occupancy. And we were starting to get a good momentum for the summer after the issues we had in the Guangdong outbreak in June. And then as we moved into late July and early August, we had more local cases starting with the Nanjing airport outbreak. And eventually in early August, we did have 4 local cases. So that obviously curtailed the traffic immediately. And as we move into September, again, we were recovering well, especially in the second and third week of September. And we were building up, ready for the October Golden Week again. And unfortunately, we did have some local cases towards the last week of September, which, again, reduced the traffic immediately as it led to additional restrictions around the border. So that really explains how the traffic flow evolve during the quarter. Agree. Sorry Rob go ahead We see we see underlying demand continues to be very strong when the opportunity arises. Now, the opportunity has -- maybe has been relatively brief, one month here, a few weeks there. we can definitely see the underlying demand actually across all the different segments as very strong. And I think Rob referenced the pent-up demand that we've seen in Las Vegas coming through. And I think it's not going to be dissimilar in Macao. But I agree with Rob that we can't be really drawn into predicting timing. But we definitely see the evidence on the pent-up demand for sure. Rob, one thing I think we tried to reference is, after 2 decades of being there, we've never found the government to be not thoughtful. They're very thoughtful, and they're going to take these issues and make it reasonable for all of us. We're not that concerned. I mean, I saw initially the response was putting like that, they're concerned. We don't have this concerns, and yes, we're eager to reinvest in Macao. We were assuming that the process will be fair and equal, and we're also assuming that they want us to invest as well. The government there wants the growth in Macao. So we're not that concerned about that issue at all. Yeah, Rob. I think history of Macao shows every time we have large-scale high-quality product coming in on Cotai, it helps the market. And I think when the demand comes back, it's going to be to the market's benefit and to the whole industry's benefit that we've got good new product that customers can patronize. And that applies to Lisboa Palace, that applies to with some buck, other competitors will be -- will have open by then. And, obviously, we think first and foremost is going to apply to what we've completed in Grand Suites at Four Seasons, and also to London and Macao. So we're very excited and confident that when the demand returns, all these new projects but I would say, especially all projects is going to be a growth driver for the industry. And by implication, we hope that we will achieve good market share. But I think it's much more about as the history and 2 decades of shan growing the overall pie. And I think in terms of segments, again, I wouldn't hesitate to say that it's going to be positive across a very broad base of segmentation of the mass -- the premium mass and so forth. I think you said it very well, Rob. I think it's important to remember, again, the proportion of profit coming from that segment, especially, I think, you have more referencing the junket segment versus our own VIP business. It's very, very small. It's really low single-digit pre-COVID. So I know people spend a lot of time talking about it, but our business is really geared to that large scale destination resort with premium mass, mass, the leisure, the FIT, and the future is going to be that structural growth in those segments, as well as the non-gaming, the retail, the MICE. And so that's where really our re-investments and asset base has really focused on."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs.\nDaniel Briggs: Thank you, operator. Joining me on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Also joining us on the call today are Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, Chief Operating Officer of Sands China. Before I turn the call over to Rob, please let me remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we\u2019re making under the Safe Harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website and we may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of this call. And finally, those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, and a very good early morning to our colleagues in Asia. Just a brief comment then we\u2019ll go right to Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemic\u2019s impact. We did generate positive EBITDA of $244 million a quarter, about the same as the first quarter. Our Macao performance reflected sequential improvement, but pandemic-related travel restrictions continued to impact our performance. We do remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore, and we cannot define the timing of the full recovery, but it\u2019s underway and will continue in 2021. Singapore remains in the $500 million to $600 million range annually, although the second quarter was impacted by heightened pandemic-related restrictions for a portion of the quarter. We will also be subject to closures of both portions of MBS from today to August 5th as part of COVID-19-related protocols. This will obviously have a negative impact on Q3 results. In addition, there remains no visibility as to when air traffic will return in Singapore. Unlike Macao, it is difficult to project additional EBITDA from MBS until the resumption of air travel. Our considerable investment in Macao continues to take shape. As the market recovers Four Seasons and the Londoner will represent growth opportunities, and we continue to have the largest footprint in this incredible market. China continues to demonstrate economic resilience. The spending in Macao is very strong at the premium mass level for both in gaming and retail perspective you may want to reference Page 29 and 30 in your deck. We do have great optimism about our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns, and our company is dividing into three areas, the Asian portfolio in Macao and Singapore. While we believe Macao will accelerate in the second half of this year and lead the recovery, Singapore will follow upon the resumption of air travel. We are confident we\u2019ll return to a $5 billion-plus EBITDA from Asia in the future. The sale of the Las Vegas assets creates liquidity and vast optionality to explore large land-based destination resorts in the United States and Asia. And finally, we\u2019re in the early innings of building out our digital presence. We\u2019re exploring multiple opportunities at the present and we are eager to have this effort become material to our company in the years ahead and we\u2019ll update you at the appropriate time. Let\u2019s take some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on your announcement about your online strategy and kind of pursuing B2B investments? And just if you could help us think about kind of how the brand that you have would help in the B2B effort or how -- just in terms of what that does for Sands as well in a reciprocal way? And then also, if that -- is that going to be the full extent or are you still looking also at B2C options in the online market? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: Pat, do you want to take that?\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. Happy too. Thanks, Robin. So a few points. I think our brand is very strong. I think we have decades of established brand and high-quality operations and a great relationship with customers. We think that\u2019s very powerful to your point. One thing we\u2019re thinking about is we\u2019re really investing for the future. We take a very long-term approach. We\u2019re still evaluating a lot of different opportunities. I think B2B presents a very significant opportunity for us. Davis has a great history and we\u2019re really looking forward to him getting started and we\u2019re happy that he joined us. I think we\u2019ll provide updates as we make progress. It\u2019s still very early stages. But we\u2019re looking forward to be able to deploy capital over many years and really look at this from the long-term and create a lot of long-term shareholder value. And I think in the future, you\u2019ll see us looking at other things and other opportunities. As Rob said on other calls, we\u2019re going to be very patient. We\u2019re going to be prudent and we\u2019re going to look for opportunities where we see ways to create real value in the long-term. So I don\u2019t think this is the last thing you\u2019ll see from us. But I think it\u2019s really just the beginning and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing this thing evolve over time. So as we make progress, we\u2019ll definitely provide more updates.\nRobin Farley: Okay. And I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s -- just as a follow-up, just thinking about the B2B, many of the B2B providers out there kind of working with those that would technically be your competitors in land-based. And so, I guess, how do you think about framing that, how they would see Sands\u2019 presence in the online business as somebody that they would partner with versus a competitor? Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: It\u2019s a very fair point. And I think, interestingly, our company has seen a lot of changes in the last 12 months. And I think one of the things that we thought about when we considered this is that we really are conflicting. The operation, which we -- the markets in which we operate going forward are going to be Singapore and Macao. And so from that standpoint, it\u2019s really a limited universe of people who are our true competitive set clearly in some of the larger geographies where a B2B services model could really be productive. So I think from our standpoint, we are a little bit neutral. Like we believe we are from the sense that in a lot of the markets that we might look to target, we don\u2019t have any land-based operations and don\u2019t have any B2C operations where we could find customers from a B2B business model standpoint. So we feel pretty good about it.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nRob Goldstein: Thanks, Robin.\nOperator: Your next question is from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJoe Greff: Good afternoon, guys. Nice to hear your voices. We probably kind of said it mostly, just in terms of Macao\u2019s reliance on travel and mobility enhancing measures and timing there. So I am not going to waste my time on that. But I think that the last call, Wilfred gave a decent amount of detail and I would say a decent amount of optimism in terms of your license potentially markets getting extended sometime middle of this year and that timeframe has sort of passed with it. But now I was hoping you could just give us an update on your conversations or your thinking renewal/extension process in Macao?\nRob Goldstein: Wilfred, are you there?\nDr. Wilfred Wong: Yes. Thank you. Yeah. I think the situation has not changed. The -- obviously, the extension, it\u2019s a very complicated issue. It\u2019s something that the Macao Government and the Chinese Government will have to look at very carefully. They also have their own preoccupation at this stage. For example, the Macao Government apart from still working very hard on making sure that Macao remains a safe city in all the precautionary measures against COVID. They are now preparing for the mixed legislative council election, which is due on the 12th of September. So the government is operating at a pace where they feel they want to launch the public consultation for the concession renewal towards the second half of this year, which we believe might mean that it will only happen after the legislative council election. Now I don\u2019t think the government is in a rush to renew the license, because they want to do things right. And as we all know, there are many legal issues they have to attend to such as the concession and sub-concession issue and this -- they can only go to the legislative council when the new council is in place. And then so, for -- at this stage, we are really focusing on doing our best, aligning our interest with the government, such as focusing on investment and reinvestment opportunities, building out our properties, improving our operational efficiencies, maintaining a stable workforce, which is very important during this pandemic. And I think that things will pan itself out eventually, because as we\u2019ve moved closer to the expiry of the concession, naturally that the extension of the concession is an option, which the government will have to look at. But at this stage, there is nothing official and we have no privy information.\nRob Goldstein: And just to follow-up, Joe, on Wilfred\u2019s comments, we remain very comfortable with our position. We have to be patient, but there will be resolution. As you know, we\u2019ve said numerous times, we\u2019ve led the efforts in Macao for a diversified approach to development. We\u2019ve gone above and beyond. Sheldon was the guy behind the Cotai development. We invested US$15-plus and we continue to follow the government\u2019s advice and direction. So we remain very confident and very patient waiting for the government\u2019s decision. But no real change, nothing new, but we\u2019ve not altered our belief that we\u2019re in a very good position, very comfortable.\nJoe Greff: I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you, guys.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Good afternoon and good morning. Rob, could you talk a little bit about the project at MBS, obviously, 2025 is the deadline or, sorry, is the expected opening. As you kind of have this amount of setbacks and acknowledging that you guys kind of pushed it earlier, given COVID back in 2020. Does 2025 still seem kind of realistic as a target? And what are kind of the goalposts for some of the construction work along the way?\nRob Goldstein: I am going to give it to Patrick, except for one. I\u2019ll say this before Patrick jumps in. We remain very committed to Singapore to withstand our presence and footprint. Obviously, COVID has thrown a monkey wrench, a big monkey wrench in this whole thing. But this is an extraordinary market. We are going to invest in Singapore. We\u2019ve done very well there and the addition is going to happen. I think the timeframe really depends on the ability to go back to work in the construction area and getting things back in line. I think we\u2019ve lost 2021, we\u2019re heading to 2022. So, again, we\u2019re committed and I\u2019ll ask Patrick to provide more color because he\u2019s dealt with the government directly.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Rob. I think the key thing is what Rob just said, which is there\u2019s a certain amount of uncertainty around the timing and availability of when we can actually get things done. A lot of the early parts of this project required us to work with certain government agencies to seek their approval and to work with them collaboratively to ensure that we fulfill the obligations and their desires as well as part of this project. It\u2019s a very tight sight. It\u2019s eight acres. There\u2019s a lot of programming, a lot of density and a lot of things that have to be worked through, and a lot of things have to be integrated into the current environment to make it right. And so we\u2019re starting to work with some of those things. But as a practical matter, the nature of the construction project of this complexity and size would always be challenging in a normal environment. So I think we\u2019re just trying to be cautious and make sure that we understand all of the different parameters around labor and construction timelines before we say that this is a schedule that is not achievable or is achievable. I think a lot of it depends on the environment and how things go in terms of concession, excuse me, COVID recovery over the next couple of months. We\u2019ll have a much better view at that time. But right now, I think, we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. We\u2019re going to continue to work with the government and hopefully have an opportunity to get going sooner rather than later.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thanks, Rob and Patrick. If I could just one quick one, has there been any thought, obviously, now given that the sale of Venetian Las Vegas and the proceeds that are on the comp for that, can you potentially revisiting the bidding process in Japan?\nRob Goldstein: Not at this time, Carlo. We\u2019ve had inquiries from a lot of parties there. We tried very hard. There\u2019s a lot of money and a lot of human capital worked there in the last 10 years, 15 years and we left with a feeling that there was just too much uncertainty for us. We can always revisit something based on a change in circumstance, but at this point, we remain on the sidelines.\nCarlo Santarelli: Understood. Thanks, Rob.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, thanks. Could you just talk a little bit about some of the different expansion opportunities for land-based resorts in the U.S. or even other broader markets that we haven\u2019t touched base on so far and how you prioritize to evaluate those different markets?\nRob Goldstein: Well, in the U.S., you know of our efforts in New York, which we shutdown because New York did not resolve that issue. So that\u2019s not available at this time. Texas, we remain very committed to pursuing. I think it\u2019s a couple years away. But I think there\u2019s a real chance down the road back in Texas doing something down there. There\u2019s some recent news there in Florida. We put a new order in Florida. If we can get some opportunity, we\u2019re going to look past there in 2022, because we\u2019re successfully gathering signatures to get a vote in the fall of 2022 for a land-based opportunity. In the U.S., that\u2019s all at this point we\u2019re looking at. Obviously, we\u2019ve discussed Japan, although, previously. Our best opportunities are to reinvest in Macao and Singapore because those places have proven huge successes. And I think when you\u2019re as fortunate as we are to have made $5-plus billion when we build out there, who knows what, but there\u2019s a lot of running room in both Singapore and Macao. Frankly, they remain our biggest focus, because they\u2019re so extraordinary and hard to duplicate anywhere in the world. And I think that\u2019s our focus right now is getting MBS things to up, and hopefully, late in the fall, we can invest more in Macao. The Londoner will be completed later this year or 2022, Four Seasons. We would love to deploy more capital in Asia. I think the broad opportunity is interesting. We\u2019ll see when we have the ability to get there. But it\u2019s hard to find things as extraordinary as the two places we operate today.\nStephen Grambling: Makes sense. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.\nRob Goldstein: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe a question for either Grant or Wilfred, but I was wondering, I think, we have a pretty good sight line on the core premium mass market and how that\u2019s performing and how the spending behavior is going. But I was wondering if there\u2019s any color insights you guys have gleaned just from what you\u2019re seeing on more of the base mass or the lower end mass market. I am sure the sample set is small, just kind of curious on how the customer is behaving when they are in the market and what you\u2019ve seen in some of your properties if you could provide anything there?\nRob Goldstein: Grant?\nGrant Chum: Yeah. Hi, Shaun. Good morning. I think the trends have been pretty consistent in the last six months. You see, I think, very strong consumption propensity, great strength in spending power for those who have returned to Macao for leisure trips and I think that applies across the different segments. But, obviously, clearly, the premium mass, the segment has returned in greater volume, greater number of patrons. But when you go farther down to mid level and the base mass, the spending power is definitely prominent. However, we can see from the visitations, they are still around, let\u2019s say, low 20% of where we were before the pandemic. So the base mass is clearly impacted by just the drastic reduction in the number of people visiting. But the people who are coming are actually staying longer and in most cases, more. And I think what was encouraging sequentially, although, June was somewhat of a temporary hiccup, what was encouraging was we saw the greatest amount of sequential growth in the base mass in the FRT segments versus Q1. Although premium mass continued to cover. The bigger bounce back was actually in the base mass. So we hope to see some of those makes encouraging trends continue into the summer holidays and beyond.\nShaun Kelley: Great. And maybe change here for a quick follow-up on the online topic, if I could. For Patrick or Rob, just kind of want to get your quick sense on maybe the build versus buy equation, right? So, obviously, some of these technologies and things are out there, but they could be quite expensive. Just how do you kind of weigh maybe some of the options that are around acquisitions and sizing relative to possibly things that could be done maybe more organically?\nRob Goldstein: Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: So it\u2019s a very interesting question. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been looking at for a while and we continue to look at. It\u2019s an interesting comment about valuations. I think there\u2019s been a lot of optimism in the market, call it, the last six months to 12 months, and valuations have definitely moved around a lot in the last few weeks. I think the key thing for us is we\u2019re really building for the long-term and so when we look at things we\u2019re really going to take a long-term view of value and if we do acquire something, it\u2019s going to be for the reason that it fits into a much larger broader strategy and something where we see long-term value creation by owning it. I also think we\u2019re not necessarily looking to take big bites right away. I think this is something we\u2019re going to look to develop it over time in the prudent manner and sort of build more and then maybe buy where it makes sense. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us go out and make a splash by using Las Vegas sale proceeds in any large transformational acquisition unless there\u2019s some really compelling reason why we have to do it. But that\u2019s not our focus. Our focus is to build the product, get the culture right, get the opportunity right and then make acquisitions as they fit in with the overall strategy.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nThomas Allen: Yeah. Patrick, just a follow-up to that question. Respect that you\u2019re not going to do a transformational deal, but how are you thinking about the size of the deal, like, are you thinking of being kind of an incubator for startups or are you thinking of like hundreds of millions, low billions, how are you thinking about the sizes?\nPatrick Dumont: It\u2019s a pretty broad range. I\u2019ll tell you that, our goal is really, I don\u2019t know that we provide a lot of value at the angel stage. We might be able to help some people, but I am not really sure that that\u2019s where we provide sort of the most value. I think from our standpoint, if we can get kind of earlier-stage and mid-stage, but again fitting into a larger strategy, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll look to be really effective. I think things that are much larger that would be transformational in the $1 billion range. We would have to have a really good reason to do it and I think we would want to be operating for a while to understand why that would make sense for us. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to buy our way into a business. I think we\u2019re going to develop our way into a business and look to see how acquisitions help enhance that approach.\nThomas Allen: Helpful color. That makes sense. And then just on Macao and Singapore, respecting that the majority of your business and the majority of your future is really around the mass market. VIP came in really light. Only $600 million of rolling chip volumes in Singapore stood out. Just can you talk about what\u2019s going on there and your expectations?\nRob Goldstein: Well, I think, you\u2019re saying, you\u2019re looking at Singapore as opposed to Macao you said right, Thomas? I think\u2026\nThomas Allen: I think Macao was down quarter-over-quarter too, Rob, so like, I mean, Singapore was what really stood out, but just talk about VIP in general and kind of your expectations there?\nRob Goldstein: Well, VIP, as you know, right now it\u2019s a closed market, just locals only. So you do trading mostly exclusively on people who are living in Singapore and that maybe people residing during the pandemic. You might get an extra push from some of the folks who have moved to Singapore to wait out the pandemic as part of the reason. But I don\u2019t think you can look at our numbers at this point and really make a whole lot of inference as a future, because it\u2019s so -- without having -- look at the slot business there, it\u2019s so outsized and yet it\u2019s surprising us how well it\u2019s doing because that never was the case that kind of performance. You have people that can\u2019t leave, they are stuck in Singapore. The same way people can\u2019t leave, they are stuck in Singapore right now on the high end. So I think it\u2019s hard to make inferences looking into the future. It\u2019s probably a trend. It\u2019s just an anomaly. I think that\u2019s going to be the case until this thing resolves and there\u2019s air traffic in and out of Singapore. You\u2019ll see these trends both good and bad that are confusing. And I think in the case of it\u2019s very difficult to look at Singapore\u2019s numbers and come up with a clear direction where it goes and the slot performance confused all of us initially and now you realize a lot of people who travel outside Singapore are staying to gamble. The same probably holds true on the high end on the Chinese nationals to be residing in Singapore during the pandemic. So I am not sure you can make a whole lot of long-term trends based on what we\u2019re seeing today in Singapore.\nPatrick Dumont: There\u2019s one other comment that might be helpful, which is the way we\u2019re sort of thinking about it, is that the investment in the product really matter. And so if you look at what we\u2019ve done during the pandemic, we spent a lot of time and deployed a lot of capital in sort of enhancing the offering that we have. So when there is a recovery, we have better capacity and a more competitive product. It is a product driven industry. And so from our standpoint, the way we think about the long-term is the level of investment that we put in during the pandemic, so we can position ourselves in a more strong way when the recovery happens. So I wouldn\u2019t look at the rolling volumes now and you -- to indicate anything. I think you should look at the fact that we\u2019ve been able to deploy capital, create higher quality products, create higher quality experience for our customers and that way we\u2019re stronger positioned on the other side and that\u2019s how we\u2019re really approaching it.\nThomas Allen: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Your line is open.\nSteve Wieczynski: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. So probably going back to Wilfred with this question, but I guess for Americans and investors that we talk to, it\u2019s tough for us to understand where China is with respect to their vaccination progress. And case counts continue to look pretty promising, but China is still having issues. But is it -- China still having issues with lack of availability with the vaccine or is it the vaccine that\u2019s being used hasn\u2019t been effective or is it just something else? I am just trying to get more color around that if all that makes sense?\nRob Goldstein: Well, thank you for the question. Actually, China is not lacking in vaccines. Actually, they export quite a lot of vaccines. But the truth, if you look at the statistics, China today has already administered 1.5 billion doses of vaccine. Now that really means that over 50%, 60% of the population has been vaccinated and if you assume everyone has two doses, then that represents 53%. And they are still vaccinating at over 10 million doses a day. So what it means is, every 25 days, they can increase that vaccination rate by 10%. Now, that is also to some extent true for Hong Kong and Macao. Hong Kong already administered 5 million doses and its vaccination rate is already over 40%. Macao administered 460,000 doses. That\u2019s also over 40% of the population. So we\u2019re quite confident that if China continues in that rate and with the increase of vaccination rate by about 10% per 25 days, when you come to winter, almost the whole population like 90%, 80%, would be vaccinated. Now, I think once we reach that level, that travel bubble within China, including Hong Kong and Macao is really possible. Now what you have seen in the news is that because China adopts a non-tolerance policy towards COVID, so whenever there\u2019s some outbreak in certain areas in the country, it\u2019s widely reported and they immediately go back to lockdown. And that\u2019s why I think the best scenario in the short-term is a travel bubble between China, Hong Kong and Macao, because they are so concerned about the importation of COVID cases, especially with the variant cases.\nSteve Wieczynski: That\u2019s great color. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your last question is from David Katz from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You covered a lot of\u2026\nRob Goldstein: Hi.\nDavid Katz: You covered a lot of ground. What I wanted to ask was just kind of a broader question. You\u2019re taking in everything about the U.S. and what you\u2019ve said in Asia. If we were to think about what LVS looks like in say three years to five years out or two years to five years out. What\u2019s that picture look like? What\u2019s the vision for that? What are the -- and obviously that can be as qualitative and high level as you\u2019re thinking about it? But I\u2019d love to just hear your perspectives on that.\nRob Goldstein: Well, it\u2019s pretty simple from our perspective. I mean, first and foremost, we return to $5 billion or $6 billion EBITDA in our Macao and Singapore markets. We see a renewed investment in both Macao and Singapore to grow that from $5 billion to $6 billion and beyond. We still see a one or two land-based facility in the United States [Audio Gap] maybe Florida and Texas and last we have a strong regional presence. And reflecting our balance sheet, we have the ability to do all these things. I think we\u2019re convinced in Asia that the most important thing in this company is the timing is uncertain of a return to more normal environment in Asia, but the outcome is not uncertain, it\u2019s going to happen. And I think it reflects what happened here in Las Vegas, which is people flock to these casinos, will make more money than pre-COVID and our business will boom again and I think, you are asking, clearly, asking about timing, but not of the outcome. And also we\u2019re not going to invest heavily in both those places, because that\u2019s our best path to $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion EBITDA. We have been very clear of these in both Texas, Florida, and perhaps, other larger jurisdictions in the U.S. We will be -- we have the balance sheet and the optionality to pursue those, and as Pat just outlined, we are very involved in the digital strategy. It\u2019s pretty slow to get there. But I think three years to five years from now you\u2019ll see a real positive outcome. And that\u2019s where we think we end up. We feel pretty confident. We\u2019ve been derailed the last 18 months by this horrific virus, this pandemic. But I think it\u2019s clear we\u2019re heading, to me it\u2019s very obvious that we\u2019re going to be patient and stay the course and I think we\u2019re doing that. We have ample liquidity to do anything we want to do anywhere in a large scale. So that would be my thought three years to five years from now. Patrick, just go ahead with this [ph]?\nPatrick Dumont: I couldn\u2019t agree with you more and I think that the great thing about it is we have a lot of opportunity in front of us, right? I can\u2019t tell you which one of these options hopefully all of them become available but probably. And the great thing is that we\u2019ve just invested $2.2 billion in Macao. We feel very strongly about the market and the potential to invest more post-concession renewal. We feel very strongly about the expansion in Singapore and our long-term commitment. Singapore is a very unique tourist destination and a high quality of earnings potential that we\u2019ll get from Singapore. And then looking to the U.S., these are just great locations. And looking at the digital opportunity, we feel really strongly about the returns and the potential growth that\u2019s in this area. So from a company standpoint, five years from now, we could be looking like a very different company in terms of our scale. And to Rob\u2019s point earlier, I think, our balance sheet and the capability that the liquidity from the sale of Las Vegas presents allows us to pursue all these opportunities. So we\u2019re very bullish about it.\nDavid Katz: And if I may just follow-up quickly and I appreciate all of that, with respect to the digital strategy, is -- the notion that it would be integrated with the company as it is today and branded as such or is it more of a sort of a separate enterprise or potentially either still at this point? Thank you.\nPatrick Dumont: Rob, if you\u2019re okay, I\u2019ll grab that one.\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. Please. Please do.\nPatrick Dumont: So I think the key thing to note is, we have a very skilled team and a great platform. We have a very strong corporate culture. We have just the ability to execute on a variety of different things and I think we have the capital to have patience and invest for the long-term. And so I think this is going to be a business that will require separate people, separate infrastructure and be distinct. That being said, it will benefit from being part of our larger organization. So much like Singapore and Macao are part of a global team, they have things that are specific to them that they have to deal with and so will this business. But it will benefit from being part of the larger organization.\nDavid Katz: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you, David, as always. Dan?\nOperator: This concludes\u2026\nRob Goldstein: That concludes -- go ahead.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you.",

            "name": "Dr. Wilfred Wong",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you. Yeah. I think the situation has not changed. The -- obviously, the extension, it's a very complicated issue. It's something that the Macao Government and the Chinese Government will have to look at very carefully. They also have their own preoccupation at this stage. For example, the Macao Government apart from still working very hard on making sure that Macao remains a safe city in all the precautionary measures against COVID. They are now preparing for the mixed legislative council election, which is due on the 12th of September. So the government is operating at a pace where they feel they want to launch the public consultation for the concession renewal towards the second half of this year, which we believe might mean that it will only happen after the legislative council election. Now I don't think the government is in a rush to renew the license, because they want to do things right. And as we all know, there are many legal issues they have to attend to such as the concession and sub-concession issue and this -- they can only go to the legislative council when the new council is in place. And then so, for -- at this stage, we are really focusing on doing our best, aligning our interest with the government, such as focusing on investment and reinvestment opportunities, building out our properties, improving our operational efficiencies, maintaining a stable workforce, which is very important during this pandemic. And I think that things will pan itself out eventually, because as we've moved closer to the expiry of the concession, naturally that the extension of the concession is an option, which the government will have to look at. But at this stage, there is nothing official and we have no privy information."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "Sure. Happy too. Thanks, Robin. So a few points. I think our brand is very strong. I think we have decades of established brand and high-quality operations and a great relationship with customers. We think that's very powerful to your point. One thing we're thinking about is we're really investing for the future. We take a very long-term approach. We're still evaluating a lot of different opportunities. I think B2B presents a very significant opportunity for us. Davis has a great history and we're really looking forward to him getting started and we're happy that he joined us. I think we'll provide updates as we make progress. It's still very early stages. But we're looking forward to be able to deploy capital over many years and really look at this from the long-term and create a lot of long-term shareholder value. And I think in the future, you'll see us looking at other things and other opportunities. As Rob said on other calls, we're going to be very patient. We're going to be prudent and we're going to look for opportunities where we see ways to create real value in the long-term. So I don't think this is the last thing you'll see from us. But I think it's really just the beginning and we're looking forward to seeing this thing evolve over time. So as we make progress, we'll definitely provide more updates. It's a very fair point. And I think, interestingly, our company has seen a lot of changes in the last 12 months. And I think one of the things that we thought about when we considered this is that we really are conflicting. The operation, which we -- the markets in which we operate going forward are going to be Singapore and Macao. And so from that standpoint, it's really a limited universe of people who are our true competitive set clearly in some of the larger geographies where a B2B services model could really be productive. So I think from our standpoint, we are a little bit neutral. Like we believe we are from the sense that in a lot of the markets that we might look to target, we don't have any land-based operations and don't have any B2C operations where we could find customers from a B2B business model standpoint. So we feel pretty good about it. Thanks, Rob. I think the key thing is what Rob just said, which is there's a certain amount of uncertainty around the timing and availability of when we can actually get things done. A lot of the early parts of this project required us to work with certain government agencies to seek their approval and to work with them collaboratively to ensure that we fulfill the obligations and their desires as well as part of this project. It's a very tight sight. It's eight acres. There's a lot of programming, a lot of density and a lot of things that have to be worked through, and a lot of things have to be integrated into the current environment to make it right. And so we're starting to work with some of those things. But as a practical matter, the nature of the construction project of this complexity and size would always be challenging in a normal environment. So I think we're just trying to be cautious and make sure that we understand all of the different parameters around labor and construction timelines before we say that this is a schedule that is not achievable or is achievable. I think a lot of it depends on the environment and how things go in terms of concession, excuse me, COVID recovery over the next couple of months. We'll have a much better view at that time. But right now, I think, we're just -- we're cautiously optimistic. We're going to continue to work with the government and hopefully have an opportunity to get going sooner rather than later. So it's a very interesting question. It's something that we've been looking at for a while and we continue to look at. It's an interesting comment about valuations. I think there's been a lot of optimism in the market, call it, the last six months to 12 months, and valuations have definitely moved around a lot in the last few weeks. I think the key thing for us is we're really building for the long-term and so when we look at things we're really going to take a long-term view of value and if we do acquire something, it's going to be for the reason that it fits into a much larger broader strategy and something where we see long-term value creation by owning it. I also think we're not necessarily looking to take big bites right away. I think this is something we're going to look to develop it over time in the prudent manner and sort of build more and then maybe buy where it makes sense. I don't think you'll see us go out and make a splash by using Las Vegas sale proceeds in any large transformational acquisition unless there's some really compelling reason why we have to do it. But that's not our focus. Our focus is to build the product, get the culture right, get the opportunity right and then make acquisitions as they fit in with the overall strategy. It's a pretty broad range. I'll tell you that, our goal is really, I don't know that we provide a lot of value at the angel stage. We might be able to help some people, but I am not really sure that that's where we provide sort of the most value. I think from our standpoint, if we can get kind of earlier-stage and mid-stage, but again fitting into a larger strategy, that's where we'll look to be really effective. I think things that are much larger that would be transformational in the $1 billion range. We would have to have a really good reason to do it and I think we would want to be operating for a while to understand why that would make sense for us. But I don't think we're going to buy our way into a business. I think we're going to develop our way into a business and look to see how acquisitions help enhance that approach. There's one other comment that might be helpful, which is the way we're sort of thinking about it, is that the investment in the product really matter.

Our results continue to reflect the pandemic's impact. We did generate positive EBITDA of $244 million a quarter, about the same as the first quarter. Our Macao performance reflected sequential improvement, but pandemic-related travel restrictions continued to impact our performance. We do remain confident in the eventual recovery in both Macao and Singapore, and we cannot define the timing of the full recovery, but it's underway and will continue in 2021. Singapore remains in the $500 million to $600 million range annually, although the second quarter was impacted by heightened pandemic-related restrictions for a portion of the quarter. We will also be subject to closures of both portions of MBS from today to August 5th as part of COVID-19-related protocols. This will obviously have a negative impact on Q3 results. In addition, there remains no visibility as to when air traffic will return in Singapore. Unlike Macao, it is difficult to project additional EBITDA from MBS until the resumption of air travel. Our considerable investment in Macao continues to take shape. As the market recovers Four Seasons and the Londoner will represent growth opportunities, and we continue to have the largest footprint in this incredible market. China continues to demonstrate economic resilience. The spending in Macao is very strong at the premium mass level for both in gaming and retail perspective you may want to reference Page 29 and 30 in your deck. We do have great optimism about our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns, and our company is dividing into three areas, the Asian portfolio in Macao and Singapore. While we believe Macao will accelerate in the second half of this year and lead the recovery, Singapore will follow upon the resumption of air travel. We are confident we'll return to a $5 billion-plus EBITDA from Asia in the future. The sale of the Las Vegas assets creates liquidity and vast optionality to explore large land-based destination resorts in the United States and Asia. And finally, we're in the early innings of building out our digital presence. We're exploring multiple opportunities at the present and we are eager to have this effort become material to our company in the years ahead and we'll update you at the appropriate time. Let's take some questions. Pat, do you want to take that? Thanks, Robin. Wilfred, are you there? And just to follow-up, Joe, on Wilfred's comments, we remain very comfortable with our position. We have to be patient, but there will be resolution. As you know, we've said numerous times, we've led the efforts in Macao for a diversified approach to development. We've gone above and beyond. Sheldon was the guy behind the Cotai development. We invested US$15-plus and we continue to follow the government's advice and direction. So we remain very confident and very patient waiting for the government's decision. But no real change, nothing new, but we've not altered our belief that we're in a very good position, very comfortable. Thank you. I am going to give it to Patrick, except for one. I'll say this before Patrick jumps in. We remain very committed to Singapore to withstand our presence and footprint. Obviously, COVID has thrown a monkey wrench, a big monkey wrench in this whole thing. But this is an extraordinary market. We are going to invest in Singapore. We've done very well there and the addition is going to happen. I think the timeframe really depends on the ability to go back to work in the construction area and getting things back in line. I think we've lost 2021, we're heading to 2022. So, again, we're committed and I'll ask Patrick to provide more color because he's dealt with the government directly. Not at this time, Carlo. We've had inquiries from a lot of parties there. We tried very hard. There's a lot of money and a lot of human capital worked there in the last 10 years, 15 years and we left with a feeling that there was just too much uncertainty for us. We can always revisit something based on a change in circumstance, but at this point, we remain on the sidelines. Thank you. Well, in the U.S., you know of our efforts in New York, which we shutdown because New York did not resolve that issue. So that's not available at this time. Texas, we remain very committed to pursuing. I think it's a couple years away. But I think there's a real chance down the road back in Texas doing something down there. There's some recent news there in Florida. We put a new order in Florida. If we can get some opportunity, we're going to look past there in 2022, because we're successfully gathering signatures to get a vote in the fall of 2022 for a land-based opportunity. In the U.S., that's all at this point we're looking at. Obviously, we've discussed Japan, although, previously. Our best opportunities are to reinvest in Macao and Singapore because those places have proven huge successes. And I think when you're as fortunate as we are to have made $5-plus billion when we build out there, who knows what, but there's a lot of running room in both Singapore and Macao. Frankly, they remain our biggest focus, because they're so extraordinary and hard to duplicate anywhere in the world. And I think that's our focus right now is getting MBS things to up, and hopefully, late in the fall, we can invest more in Macao. The Londoner will be completed later this year or 2022, Four Seasons. We would love to deploy more capital in Asia. I think the broad opportunity is interesting. We'll see when we have the ability to get there. But it's hard to find things as extraordinary as the two places we operate today. Sure. Thank you. Grant? Patrick? Well, I think, you're saying, you're looking at Singapore as opposed to Macao you said right, Thomas? I think... Well, VIP, as you know, right now it's a closed market, just locals only. So you do trading mostly exclusively on people who are living in Singapore and that maybe people residing during the pandemic. You might get an extra push from some of the folks who have moved to Singapore to wait out the pandemic as part of the reason. But I don't think you can look at our numbers at this point and really make a whole lot of inference as a future, because it's so -- without having -- look at the slot business there, it's so outsized and yet it's surprising us how well it's doing because that never was the case that kind of performance. You have people that can't leave, they are stuck in Singapore. The same way people can't leave, they are stuck in Singapore right now on the high end. So I think it's hard to make inferences looking into the future. It's probably a trend. It's just an anomaly. I think that's going to be the case until this thing resolves and there's air traffic in and out of Singapore. You'll see these trends both good and bad that are confusing. And I think in the case of it's very difficult to look at Singapore's numbers and come up with a clear direction where it goes and the slot performance confused all of us initially and now you realize a lot of people who travel outside Singapore are staying to gamble. The same probably holds true on the high end on the Chinese nationals to be residing in Singapore during the pandemic. So I am not sure you can make a whole lot of long-term trends based on what we're seeing today in Singapore. Well, thank you for the question. Actually, China is not lacking in vaccines. Actually, they export quite a lot of vaccines. But the truth, if you look at the statistics, China today has already administered 1.5 billion doses of vaccine. Now that really means that over 50%, 60% of the population has been vaccinated and if you assume everyone has two doses, then that represents 53%. And they are still vaccinating at over 10 million doses a day. So what it means is, every 25 days, they can increase that vaccination rate by 10%. Now, that is also to some extent true for Hong Kong and Macao. Hong Kong already administered 5 million doses and its vaccination rate is already over 40%. Macao administered 460,000 doses. That's also over 40% of the population. So we're quite confident that if China continues in that rate and with the increase of vaccination rate by about 10% per 25 days, when you come to winter, almost the whole population like 90%, 80%, would be vaccinated. Now, I think once we reach that level, that travel bubble within China, including Hong Kong and Macao is really possible. Now what you have seen in the news is that because China adopts a non-tolerance policy towards COVID, so whenever there's some outbreak in certain areas in the country, it's widely reported and they immediately go back to lockdown. And that's why I think the best scenario in the short-term is a travel bubble between China, Hong Kong and Macao, because they are so concerned about the importation of COVID cases, especially with the variant cases. Hi. Well, it's pretty simple from our perspective. I mean, first and foremost, we return to $5 billion or $6 billion EBITDA in our Macao and Singapore markets. We see a renewed investment in both Macao and Singapore to grow that from $5 billion to $6 billion and beyond. We still see a one or two land-based facility in the United States [Audio Gap] maybe Florida and Texas and last we have a strong regional presence. And reflecting our balance sheet, we have the ability to do all these things. I think we're convinced in Asia that the most important thing in this company is the timing is uncertain of a return to more normal environment in Asia, but the outcome is not uncertain, it's going to happen. And I think it reflects what happened here in Las Vegas, which is people flock to these casinos, will make more money than pre-COVID and our business will boom again and I think, you are asking, clearly, asking about timing, but not of the outcome. And also we're not going to invest heavily in both those places, because that's our best path to $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion EBITDA. We have been very clear of these in both Texas, Florida, and perhaps, other larger jurisdictions in the U.S. We will be -- we have the balance sheet and the optionality to pursue those, and as Pat just outlined, we are very involved in the digital strategy. It's pretty slow to get there. But I think three years to five years from now you'll see a real positive outcome. And that's where we think we end up. We feel pretty confident. We've been derailed the last 18 months by this horrific virus, this pandemic. But I think it's clear we're heading, to me it's very obvious that we're going to be patient and stay the course and I think we're doing that. We have ample liquidity to do anything we want to do anywhere in a large scale. So that would be my thought three years to five years from now. Patrick, just go ahead with this [ph]? Yeah. Please. Please do. Thank you, David, as always. Dan? That concludes -- go ahead. Thank you."

            "content": "Yeah. Hi, Shaun. Good morning. I think the trends have been pretty consistent in the last six months. You see, I think, very strong consumption propensity, great strength in spending power for those who have returned to Macao for leisure trips and I think that applies across the different segments. But, obviously, clearly, the premium mass, the segment has returned in greater volume, greater number of patrons. But when you go farther down to mid level and the base mass, the spending power is definitely prominent. However, we can see from the visitations, they are still around, let's say, low 20% of where we were before the pandemic. So the base mass is clearly impacted by just the drastic reduction in the number of people visiting. But the people who are coming are actually staying longer and in most cases, more. And I think what was encouraging sequentially, although, June was somewhat of a temporary hiccup, what was encouraging was we saw the greatest amount of sequential growth in the base mass in the FRT segments versus Q1. Although premium mass continued to cover. The bigger bounce back was actually in the base mass. So we hope to see some of those makes encouraging trends continue into the summer holidays and beyond."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Daniel Briggs.\nDaniel Briggs: Thank you, Katrina. Joining me on the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Also joining us on the call are Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chung, Chief Operating Officer of Sands China.  Before I turn the call over to Rob, please let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements.  In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. Please note that we have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website. We will refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, let me please turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Goldstein: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, and a very early good morning to our colleagues in Asia. Some brief comments then we'll [indiscernible] Q&A. Our results reflect the pandemic's impact. We did generate $244 million of EBITDA for the quarter. And we continue to have a strong belief in the Macao recovery because the March numbers were very different from those in January and February and the recent visitation numbers and [indiscernible] for April reflect continued acceleration. Obviously, we cannot define the timing of the full recovery, but it's underway and we will continue in 2021.  At this time, Singapore is in the $500 million to $600 million range annual EBITDA. There is no visibility as to when air traffic will return to Singapore. And unlike Macao, it's more difficult to project additional or incremental EBITDA from MBS until the resumption of [material] [ph] air travel. Our investments in Macao continue to take shape as the market recovers, Four Seasons and Londoner will present, I think large growth opportunities for us, and we continue to have -- we do have the largest structure in this incredible market of Macao. And China continues to demonstrate economic resilience. The spending in Macao is very strong [the premium mass] [ph] level for both a gaming and a retail perspective and referenced on Page 29 and 30 [investment] [ph] retail perspective, there's some pleasant surprises there. But again, we have no reservations on our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns.  Our company today is sort of divided in 3 different areas: The Asia portfolio, Macao and Singapore. And while we believe Macao will accelerate this year and lead the recovery, Singapore follow-up on resumption of air travel and participate in the recovery as well, and we anticipate a return to a $5 billion-plus EBITDA from Asia in the future.  [On the sale] [ph] of Las Vegas assets enable us to have huge optionality to explore large scale land-based destination works in both United States and Asia. And finally, we have -- we're eager to have a material digital presence in the future. We are exploring multiple opportunities at the present time. This is obviously a departure from our historical approach, and we'll update you at the appropriate time.  So let's go to Q&A and have first caller, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. First question, we have Robin Farley -- I'm sorry, we have Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: Rob, I appreciate there's probably some sensitivity around it. But in your prepared remarks, obviously, you talked about some of the Asia opportunities. And clearly, upon the completion of the Las Vegas sale, which obviously came at a very nice multiple for you guys, and I'm sure you're having very nice proceeds coming out of it. How do you think about the use of those proceeds in light of some of the opportunities? You're obviously kind of eyeing in Asia relative to, obviously, the return of a dividend, potential for buybacks longer term, potentially owning more [indiscernible] in China, all of the above? How do you kind of prioritize that pecking order and acknowledging you could do several of those things kind of what the balance sheet position that it's in?\nRobert Goldstein: Sure. We're looking at -- obviously a great opportunity for return. I think we continue to believe there'll be something happening in Macao at some point in the future, which will enable us to reinvest in Macao on a non-gaming basis. We're hopeful that'll happen sooner than later. You know that our project in Singapore, our phase 2 project is -- we're still continuing to work through those issues there. We continue to look at other Asian -- large-scale Asian opportunities. And then, of course, we think in the U.S., there may be some opportunities for us here. And lastly, digital. I think we look at everything individually and look at the returns and -- but our priority remains getting back on our feet in Asia be back to a $5-plus billion EBITDA and maintain -- that's the backbone of our company. That's what we'll start first. If something opportunistic opens up in U.S., Bob is with the bat and if something opens up digitally, we're deep into a digital and deep dive to figure out -- have deployed capital and intelligently to get a return. And I think there'll be some nice opportunities in the future there. As far as the dividend, I like Patrick to address that issue and return of the dividend. Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. Thanks, Rob. So I think, as Rob mentioned, we look very cautiously at the way we deploy capital, and we're very patient and we look for the way to maximize our returns for shareholders. And so when we look at the dividend, it really was and hopefully will be in the future, really the cornerstone, and you've heard me say that before, of a return of capital program. And I think where we are today is that we're going to look for operations to return to a baseline level and get a sense of where those operations are trending and then make an assessment with the Board and with management looking at our long-term potential to where the dividend should be given our ability to reinvest and allocate capital to other projects that are higher growth. And so I think it's pretty consistent with what you've heard us say before in calls, and nothing's changed from that perspective.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great, guys. And then if I could, whoever kind of wants to take this, it's more of an opinion question than anything else. But obviously, There is some consternation in the investment community around the status of VIP in Macao and the direction of the VIP going forward in Macao, whether or not if there's a perception that, that will have a positive or negative impact on the premium mass segment. One could obviously make the case that VIP customers who are having a harder time accessing capital, who do like to go -- could obviously move into the mass segment or premium mass segment, which wouldn't be the worst thing to happen or the fact that maybe some of that still overplay from VIP, if the VIP is softer doesn't show up in mass. Rob, maybe what's kind of your view and a view from your folks in Macao on how that -- how they would expect that to play out?\nRobert Goldstein: I have a very strong view, but since I woke up Grant at 04:30 morning, why don't Grant take that call. Grant? Are you there?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thanks, Rob. Yes. We're here yes. Sure. On the question of VIP and premium mass, I think you've clearly seen the segments have diverged in terms of the recovery. Clearly, premium mass is -- has made a very significant recovery and already approaching 50% of pre-pandemic levels. VIP on the other hand, is still struggling at around 20% or sub-20%. So the segments are actually following very different trajectories, and we would expect that to continue for the time being. And of course, your question about whether there's spillover, whether there's migration I don't think those dynamics have really changed since a few years ago that there is a structural change over time, where more of the customers and more of the new customers are dealing directly with the casino operators program. And of course, the great assets on the integrated resort that all of the operators, including us, we've built up, have attracted more and more of these consumers to the premium mass program, and we expect that to continue over time as these non-gaming lifestyle assets and products continue to attract people to play in our programs.\nOperator: Next question, we have Joe Greff from JPMorgan.\nJoseph Greff: When you look at your advanced bookings for the Golden Week holiday in Macao, do these bookings suggest or imply a further acceleration in the visitation or mix quality might be tough on sort of spend or GGR level relative to April and March? And anything underlying that suggests that maybe people are anticipating any -- or Macao patrons are anticipating any further incremental easing of travel restrictions?\nRobert Goldstein: [Indiscernible] to share with you our bookings for Gold Week. I just think we look at the -- I think the best reflection in the market right now is the acceleration in April. I think across the board, both visitation revenue is growing. And we remain convinced Macao is in a recovery mode already. I think the term came in March, very encouraging. I think it's foolish for us to try -- again, call the shots, so to speak, as when -- as this thing grows. I don\u2019t think it might be a [indiscernible] to define it. I think, instead it's a slow process of gradual growth. And I think the market will be disappointed [indiscernible] inflection point was just like Golden Week pops the numbers to a materially different level. I think we're seeing a gradual growth. The easing restrictions, obviously, the government decision. People are getting there as evidenced by the numbers coming out of April and the revenues. And I think we believe that this will just continue to accelerate with the only caveat being -- hopefully, obviously returned any cases of virus. [Can you offer,] [ph] Grant, any thoughts on that?\nGrant Chum: Yes. I think what Rob said is absolutely right. The term really started in March. In March, we started to experience a pretty meaningful rebound in visitations versus January and February. And as you've seen from the figures released by MGTO, that has continued on a similar momentum in April with visitations reaching post-pandemic highs in the mid of April. So the acceleration is seen across -- very encouragingly across all the different segments, whether you're talking about premium mass, mass. But the encouraging thing is that since March, we've really seen an acceleration in the base mass as well as the leisure FIT guests at the hotel, of course, retail, especially at the high-end consumption end of things. And we've even had an initial resumption of the MICE segment activity in March and bookings for Q2 look encouraging for the MICE as well, which is a surprise. But I think what you can see is a broad-based recovery in the different segments since early March.\nRobert Goldstein: I don't think we're going to get very emotional if there's not as big a number comes out of the May. We -- I think it's more -- it's a slow but very steady road upwards. Here in Las Vegas, it looks like the weekend is pre-pandemic levels, it's amazingly busy year and demand is back. I think Macao is going to follow suit. Of course, Vegas is still leading to the return of the group business, but that's inevitable. I think the U.S. is obviously in a different place than Asia. But I think China and Macao are just going to continue to move forward, accelerate. I think you'll see a slow gradual return in the second half of the year it could be very positive for everybody over there.\nJoseph Greff: Great. And then my follow-up question is maybe for all of you, those in Las Vegas and those in the ground early in the morning in Macao. And I just wanted to ask a question about a topic you guys love to answer is sort of your thoughts on the timing or process for the concession renewals. And I think I'm going to ask in a way that's answerable. If the government was thinking of renewing or extending 12 months in front of that expansion, right? And we're knocking on that and even if that was an extension for relatively short periods, would they have discussions for that with you by now? And maybe I'll have a -- I'll let you sort of open-endedly answer that question.\nRobert Goldstein: Yes. Joe, I don't think we want to speculate because we don't know -- we're not [indiscernible] the government. We don't know what they\u2019re thinking. But as we said, ad nauseam in the past, we remain strong believers is our position there. The story about the [ASEAN] [ph] and what we've done in Cotai and the $15 billion investment and the non-gaming assets we built back. We just aren't that concerned about - when the government tells us they tell us, but we don't have the insight and nor do we have any idea when they're going to do that. But we feel renewals will happen. We feel very confident of our position. And other than that, I don't have any other insight, unless Wilfred, anything you want to add to that? Is that fair to say?\nWilfred Wong: Yes. All the sixth concessioners are waiting eagerly for the government to make announcements as we draw closer to the expiration of the concession. But as ever, we stand ready to cooperate with the government once they announced the timeline and what they intend to do over the next 12, 18 months.\nOperator: Next question, we have Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: As a follow-up, I think, to Carlo's question on the proceeds from Las Vegas. I guess, where would raising your ownership of Sands China factor into that list? And can you just remind us what the process or limitations might be if you did want to go down that path?\nRobert Goldstein: Sure. Pat, do you want to grab that?\nPatrick Dumont: Yes, sure. So I think from our standpoint, we feel very strongly about the long-term future and success of Macao as the world's leading leisure and tours destination. And as Rob has said before and as you've heard on these calls, we're very interested in investing more there in non-gaming. We feel very strongly in the future of Macao. So it's definitely something that we think about and consider over time. I think where we are now -- we don't have the proceeds yet. We're looking at all the options, and we're going to consider everything. I think we're going to be very focused on returns. And so I think we're looking at new developments we're looking at how to increase and develop more in the markets that we're in. And I think that will be something that we think about. And I think really for us, there's a lot of opportunity in front of the company. And we're being patient. We're looking at it all. And we're going to look through the lens of maximizing return. So it's not something that I'm going to say we're going to do now, but it's something that is in the things that we consider as we look across the way we might allocate capital.\nStephen Grambling: And so just to clarify, is there a maximum ownership percentage that you can go up to for Sands China? \nPatrick Dumont: So I think technically they want to have 25% of the float outstanding for the exchange, but there are exceptions.\nStephen Grambling: Got it.\nPatrick Dumont: Grant, I want to make sure that, that makes sense. Grant I just want to ask Grant Chum, I want to make sure I didn't [indiscernible] thing there, but ...\nGrant Chum: Yes.\nRobert Goldstein: That's correct. You're right.\nStephen Grambling: That's helpful. And then as we think about the model going forward, I realize that you broke out the Las Vegas assets within the EBITDA count. But is there any impact that we should be thinking about and it's more of a modeling question, but as we think about corporate expenses, going forward, is it basically what you reported this quarter kind of the right run rate to think about? Or is there other things that might be in there?\nPatrick Dumont: No. I think what you should see over time is that corporate expenses should adjust post sale. But I think in the long run, we will continue to have a corporate office that manages the activities of the enterprise as a whole. So there's nothing in there that's noise right now, but you should expect to see some changes going forward after the completion of the sale.\nOperator: Next question, we have Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.\nThomas Allen: So just on Marina Bay Sands, the performance of the property improved quarter-over-quarter. Obviously, they're not getting any more Chinese visitors there. So can you just talk about some of the drivers of that?\nRobert Goldstein: Yes. Surprisingly, our slot business there are exceptional -- the biggest drivers are slot performance has been outsized. It's been -- I mean we actually are not up against pre-pandemic levels, the slot floor. I think that reflects the comfort level with the team and other for the ability the to buy slot capacity without having a feel uncomfortable. It's more difficult on the table side to do that there's more spacing on the table side, which makes it difficult. But as you referenced, not having that fond of station is very hurtful because -- Singapore traditionally, the residents there and the visitors and the current residents all. It was a slot -- strong slot market before we he got there, just has gotten better over the years with the -- our ability to provide a good quality product. But that's the driver, no question about it. But without that foreign visitation, it's hard to grow the premium mass in the high-end table business.  So we convince struggle and I think we'll stay in this range until things improve. And unlike Macao, I think we're going to see a move in this summer and fall. I don't think you can see that -- any reason to believe that happens in Singapore. The neighboring countries are still struggling with the vaccinations, be it Malaysia or Indonesia or Japan, there's no real evidence that this is going to change in the short term. But it's a slot business over there that's been really exceptionally strong.\nPatrick Dumont: The other thing to note, and this is Patrick, is just keep in mind that while the pandemic-related restrictions has eased, the actual activity levels of the people in Singapore has gotten more back-to-normal over time across the quarter, right? So as people get vaccinated, as public health initiatives bear fruits, people who are in Singapore are more out and about. And so we benefited from some of that as well. So it's not as if there's a change, to Rob's point before, it's not as if there's a change in visitation, but there has been a change in activity in Singapore as things return more to normal there.\nThomas Allen: Makes total sense. And then just as my follow-up, it seems like you're getting more and more serious about your digital strategy. Can you just elaborate a little bit more of that?\nRobert Goldstein: I don't see anything because we're not very yet, Thomas. We have -- we're like the new guys with locker, I think the game is just beginning. And we're looking at it from many, many aspects. We've been a lot of man hours, a lot of people looking at the opportunities. We have a big appetite, but as you know, that market is still developing be it -- I think we're looking not just in the sports or the game, but all aspects of digital. We find it fastening and very, very complementary to our land-based business. But we're just not ready yet to disclose what we're going to do because we haven't decided. So not much color there, but I think you'll be hearing from us this year and next year about the direction we're taking.\nOperator: Next question, we have Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: I just wanted to go back to the kind of question around some of the possible reinvestment back into Asia as you've got so much cash or liquidity available on the balance sheet and obviously heading into the concession process. So my specific question was that there was some press recently about possible investment in the broader Greater Bay area being a potential criteria or a potential result of the concession process? And I would just kind of peaked my thinking around, would that be something that LVS would consider potentially investing in non-gaming, let's call it, in the broader region, but outside of Macao directly? Is that something you -- how would you react to that?\nRobert Goldstein: Positively. And we are -- again, we're strong believers in the rebound of Macao. It's coming back and there are people who somehow don't believe it, that's -- we'll have to wait and see. But it's going to come back in a strong way. We'll be the leading site in that space, our Londoner and Four Seasons investments are going to be having very well received. If the government wants us to invest in the region, and it makes -- we'll do it. We have capital, we've appetite, and we remain committed to Macao in a big way. We believe it's going to grow and grow for us. And despite all the distractions and all the pandemic, all the issues, Macao still remains from a land-based perspective, the most opportunistic and advantageous market in the world. And we plan to be there for a long time and invest more capital. And again, the government's directions will be pound out to our thinking.\nShaun Kelley: Great. And just maybe as a quick follow-up. potential reopening of Hong Kong, just kind of curious on latest there. I think the case counts have been, I think, very low. And there's some positive news there, but I think the vaccination rate is also very low. So just curious on color from that part of the market and that as a possible avenue for reopening some of the travel in the region.\nRobert Goldstein: Sure. Wilfred or Grant can grab that since you guys are right there at the middle of it?\nWilfred Wong: Yes. I think it is gratifying to note that the cases every day has dropped to single digit. And I think yesterday, there was no home case in Hong Kong. The -- both governments of Hong Kong and Macao have announced that if there is a continuing period of 14 days of zero cases, they would open or consider opening the border between Hong Kong and Macao. And I think the Hong Kong government is working very hard to achieve that. And hopefully, that if that happens, that's going to help our business a lot.\nOperator: Next question, we have Chad Beynon from Macquarie.\nChad Beynon: I know it's early on the Londoner opening of phase 1 here, but just wanted to ask about the makeup of the customer or how you guys are running that right now between Londoner and Venetian? Is there a major difference in terms of the customers that are visiting 1 versus the other from a base or premium standpoint? And are you deciding to comp certain players into 1 versus the other? Just trying to get some additional color in terms of how that's running since it just reopened?\nRobert Goldstein: Mr. Chum?\nKwan Chum: Yes, yes. On the subject of Londoner, well, I think if you take a step back, we opened our first new product in the Four Seasons, the Grand Suites last year, and that has progressed exceptionally well in terms of customer feedback. And so clearly, that is more targeted at the premium mass and the long-stay leisure family guests. And then when we got to early part of 2021, as you referenced, we opened the first phase of Londoner. That's really the main Londoner hotel and the north side of the building with the Crystal Palace Atrium and some of the signature food and beverage outlets and some other tractions that we've opened up so far.  And I think it's important to remember that a large part of the building, namely on the south side, the Sheraton side, is still under heavy construction -- actually both on the interior as well as the exterior side because we have been bringing forward the construction works on that side of the building to take advantage of the low levels of traffic. So in terms of your question about segmentation, it really follows the trajectory of the initial recovery that we see in Macao right now. Therefore, not very much in terms of base mass traffic, and that's both because of the demand side but also the fact that the south side of the building is undergoing large-scale construction. And it's really focused more on the premium mass segment as well as the FIT leisure guest. We've enjoyed a resumption of the FIT segment in the various hotels that we have in the Londoner Macao. But clearly, there's a lot more to come in the remainder of the year into early part of next year in terms of the products that are coming online. We've got second all-suite hotel Londoner opening up later on the year. The Sheraton side, we're going to have the second wow space, atrium Shakespeare hall coming online imminently in the second quarter. Obviously, we still have the London arena. and another, call it, 6, 7, 8 food and beverage outlets, together with the theme attractions in the property as well as the retheming of the retail shops. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we are today.\nChad Beynon: Okay. Yes, that's great. And then separately, just regarding your retail mall business in Asia, which is on Slide 29, you've outlined that rental concessions have come down sequentially, which should be a positive just in terms of the health of your tenants. Is there anything that's going to change dramatically going forward just in terms of a turnover versus base component of the makeup of this business or when visitation kind of gets back to more normalized levels? Do you still expect for the profits of the retail mall portfolio to kind of mirror what you saw pre-pandemic?\nRobert Goldstein: Yes, we absolutely expect it to be very much like the pre-pandemic levels. I mean what you're seeing now is similar to the U.S. outside spending by affluent people driving these crazy good numbers out of luxury Four Seasons and others. But I think we expect a full recovery. We have no concerns in trepidation that as visitation in Macao returns and to Singapore, our malls are going back to pre-pandemic levels and perhaps even beyond that. So we -- I don't think there's any concerns that you've seen the correction on the rent concessions, you've seen it go the right direction. But we're very pleased with the caveat that we want to see a return to mass traffic as well as various people driving these large performances.  But yes, we expect it to look a lot like pre-pandemic levels, hopefully, as the year continues. And in Macao -- Singapore, the more difficult because, but again, until the resumption of air traffic and foreign travel. I think Singapore is going to lag their pre-pandemic levels. And again, we feel much more aggressive in the return of Macao than we do at Singapore at this time because we don't see the vaccination kicking as large in the region, nor do we see air traffic -- any visibility in the resumption of air traffic. So it's hard to see Singapore getting back to pre-pandemic levels this year.\nOperator: Next question, we have Robin Farley from UBS. .\nRobin Farley: A lot of my questions have been asked already. But I'm curious on the online strategy. It sounds like it's going to be a little while from your comment earlier before there would be some announcement about LVS involvement. Is it fair to say, given that there's so much activity around getting market share when new markets open, that if you're kind of maybe coming to the online markets a little bit later than others that maybe your strategy would be kind of M&A focused rather than kind of building from scratch your presence in those markets.\nRobert Goldstein: Well, the thought is we can go either direction, we can go to M&A or we could build organically. But at this point, again, I think we'll lay low. I think the challenging businesses -- despite the valuation, there's still challenging businesses. And it's early innings maybe -- in fact national anthem on time in terms of some of these businesses. I mean online in the U.S. is still a very -- not online gaming, which has been the profited -- most positive still in a few states. And I think the sports betting remains a conundrum to some extent to what's really happening there.  So -- and there's also a lot of movement outside the U.S., there's Europe and there's North America, there's all kinds of opportunities. So I don't think it'd be that long, we'll come back to you, but we're trying to again assess how to be smart and targeted, not just -- obviously with the kind of balance sheet we have, the optionality is endless. And we'll be careful and do it the right way. We really have the finest land-based business. So we want to get back and healthy. But we'll come back at the right time and the right strategy and right thought process. And then we'd want to obligate ourselves to say it's going to be organic or it's M&A, but we'll get there. I promise you that. We have a pretty voracious appetite to be in that world. And it may be different than you think it's going to be, but we'll let you know, and we're going to talk about it.\nOperator: Next question, we have Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.\nSteve Wieczynski: So the guys on the ground earlier in the call, touched on the favorable -- talked about the favorable case counts they're seeing in Hong Kong. But I guess the question is, can you guys provide any color around the actual vaccinations process -- or progress in your key feeder markets like Macao, Hong Kong, Guangdong? Obviously, it's very tough for us over here to get a good understanding where they are today versus maybe somebody like the U.S. is right now. So any color there would be pretty helpful.\nRobert Goldstein: Wilfred, Grant, can you help me on that one?\nWilfred Wong: Yes. I think the situation on the ground in China, they have started the vaccination program, but there's no -- really no hurry for people to get the vaccination because China has been very safe for the last months. And for Hong Kong and Macao, Macao has no incidents for over 380 days. So the feeling of comfort is causing a lot of people to adopt the wait and see attitude. But it's getting there, people are slowly ticking up the vaccination. Same with Hong Kong. I think Hong Kong is -- there's, unfortunately, a few cases of people suffering after the vaccination so again, there are people adopting the wait-and-see attitude. But slowly, slowly, people are beginning to realize the importance, especially if they are thinking of traveling overseas that the travel bubble may require vaccination certification. So I think people are beginning to take up vaccination.\nSteve Wieczynski: Got you. And Rob, there's been some talk or some rumors out there about Macao potentially moving to a digital currency down the road at some point, try to combat money laundering. Do you have any high-level thoughts around something like that being implemented? And then if something like that would get implemented, maybe the impact you potentially could see across certain business segments?\nRobert Goldstein: I think a couple of thoughts to that. One is, I don't -- some people are concerned, we're not -- we think it's an additional form of liquidity into the market. Two, it won't preempt other currencies, there are ways of having funds to gamble. But also, I think some of the problem we have in our industry we think that everything is done in Beijing, they're actually thinking about casinos in Macao. I'm not sure if the case is a different thought process there. Sometimes we very limit our thinking. I don't think Macao is a target or as you mentioned anti-money laundering, much as a digital currency strategy by Beijing. And I don't think it's hurting Macao whatsoever. I think it's just a traditional liquidity. And Grant, do you want to weigh on this at all?\nGrant Chum: No. I think you said it well, I think it's a big and complex topic. It's really more about the digital currency strategy of China more broadly. And also how Macao can fit into that. So probably most helpful is to refer to the comments by the Chief Executive recently in the question-and-answer session in the legislature, basically, this digital currency China has been looking at since 2014. And so Macao will also adjust and adapt in order to accommodate this broader strategy on digital currency. But a prerequisite of that is also getting prepared in terms of amending the existing relevant legislation. So this is still an early stage process from the perspective of Macao.\nRobert Goldstein: I think the assumption has been by a lot of people, this is a negative thing. We view it as a positive as again, we would love to have more cross currency and more cross-border currency. So to me, the long to protect the Hong Kong dollar and the renminbi, it's another form of currency. And I should only be concerned, our business is not built on money laundering or on necessary junket profile. We're looking to focus on the mass customer, premium mass -- that's our bread and butter, that's who we are, where we want to go in the future. And we can build a business that keeps growing on the back of that. More visitation more penetration in China, more ways we're getting people to gamble and visit Macao is we're looking for. [indiscernible] is another value add to it. I think it's positive. I know the common wisdom is always going to be turbulent. I don't want seeing people think that way. It's not an immediate concern nor I think it's a long-term concern. It may be a very positive thing for Macao market as it becomes more traditional, more integrated into China and more consumer-friendly, it will be very positive for us.\nOperator: Our last question is from David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: Rob, I just -- you used the term voracious appetite for digital before. And I wondered -- I appreciate it and wondered what intelligence you have or what survey work that gives you a sense that your people, your customers here in the U.S. or you have an audience in the U.S., particularly in the context of Las Vegas going away that, that audience is there for you?\nRobert Goldstein: Well, I think [indiscernible]. And Mike, I guess, more voracious is a description of how we feel about that digital market, and you look at it. You can't deny the cumulative power of all those different businesses. And I think we have to do know which 1 we want to enter, which few want to enter. I'm not that concerned about the fact where some people were late to the party or who don't have a sports betting presence because I don't think it's all that difficult to enter them. We want to buy something we could we want to build the platform could. But I think we're looking at -- right now, it's a good kind of to reflect on what's making money, what's going to grow. And I don't think it necessarily in our thought process -- just simply in the U.S., it may be outside in Europe, it would not be in Asia because we would not do something that upsets the governments we do business within Asia. But it could be in Europe, it could be in South America and North America, there're a lot of markets after -- beyond the U.S. And it could be in the U.S., it could be B2B, it could be B2C. I just think the market -- we are spending a lot of time leading and learning.  And with our balance sheet with the sale of Las Vegas, again, we have outsized capital to look at these things. When we build organically or buy something remains to be determined. We won't do something just to do something. It'll be something that's intelligent, well thought out and profitable. And I think we all see -- not just LVS, but we can see the opportunities there for digital market that goes to 20%, 30%, 40%, who knows the numbers. The numbers keep growing in people's minds. And I think there is a belief that the digital market will become probably the hugely opportunistic for people like us, but we plan be part of that. But again, it's growing in each for us. We're just learning the business. And I don't think it's a question of selling Las Vegas takes off the table in fact. I think the sale Las Vegas puts us again even further because it provides the capital and the incentive to grow.  At the same time, I think people have this speed and work concept or if you're a land-based, you can't be digital, you have to be -- we're not either we're going to be a land-based player for years to come, making probably $5-plus billion in Asia in the near future. We're going to be a digital player and we'll still look at -- there's some speculation we want to lead the U.S. market, which is absolutely untrue. We just felt it was a better place to earn more returns on our capital then in Las Vegas. And we think we can be in multiple businesses. We need digital, land-based, Asia, U.S., where the opportunities grow that's where we'll grow. And we're not tied to any one strategy and one thought process.\nOperator: Everyone. That's all the time that we have for today. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Robert Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, and a very early good morning to our colleagues in Asia. Some brief comments then we'll [indiscernible] Q&A. Our results reflect the pandemic's impact. We did generate $244 million of EBITDA for the quarter. And we continue to have a strong belief in the Macao recovery because the March numbers were very different from those in January and February and the recent visitation numbers and [indiscernible] for April reflect continued acceleration. Obviously, we cannot define the timing of the full recovery, but it's underway and we will continue in 2021.  At this time, Singapore is in the $500 million to $600 million range annual EBITDA. There is no visibility as to when air traffic will return to Singapore. And unlike Macao, it's more difficult to project additional or incremental EBITDA from MBS until the resumption of [material] [ph] air travel. Our investments in Macao continue to take shape as the market recovers, Four Seasons and Londoner will present, I think large growth opportunities for us, and we continue to have -- we do have the largest structure in this incredible market of Macao. And China continues to demonstrate economic resilience. The spending in Macao is very strong [the premium mass] [ph] level for both a gaming and a retail perspective and referenced on Page 29 and 30 [investment] [ph] retail perspective, there's some pleasant surprises there. But again, we have no reservations on our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels once visitation returns.  Our company today is sort of divided in 3 different areas: The Asia portfolio, Macao and Singapore. And while we believe Macao will accelerate this year and lead the recovery, Singapore follow-up on resumption of air travel and participate in the recovery as well, and we anticipate a return to a $5 billion-plus EBITDA from Asia in the future.  [On the sale] [ph] of Las Vegas assets enable us to have huge optionality to explore large scale land-based destination works in both United States and Asia. And finally, we have -- we're eager to have a material digital presence in the future. We are exploring multiple opportunities at the present time. This is obviously a departure from our historical approach, and we'll update you at the appropriate time.  So let's go to Q&A and have first caller, please. Sure. We're looking at -- obviously a great opportunity for return. I think we continue to believe there'll be something happening in Macao at some point in the future, which will enable us to reinvest in Macao on a non-gaming basis. We're hopeful that'll happen sooner than later. You know that our project in Singapore, our phase 2 project is -- we're still continuing to work through those issues there. We continue to look at other Asian -- large-scale Asian opportunities. And then, of course, we think in the U.S., there may be some opportunities for us here. And lastly, digital. I think we look at everything individually and look at the returns and -- but our priority remains getting back on our feet in Asia be back to a $5-plus billion EBITDA and maintain -- that's the backbone of our company. That's what we'll start first. If something opportunistic opens up in U.S., Bob is with the bat and if something opens up digitally, we're deep into a digital and deep dive to figure out -- have deployed capital and intelligently to get a return. And I think there'll be some nice opportunities in the future there. As far as the dividend, I like Patrick to address that issue and return of the dividend. Patrick? I have a very strong view, but since I woke up Grant at 04:30 morning, why don't Grant take that call. Grant? Are you there? [Indiscernible] to share with you our bookings for Gold Week. I just think we look at the -- I think the best reflection in the market right now is the acceleration in April. I think across the board, both visitation revenue is growing. And we remain convinced Macao is in a recovery mode already. I think the term came in March, very encouraging. I think it's foolish for us to try -- again, call the shots, so to speak, as when -- as this thing grows. I don't think it might be a [indiscernible] to define it. I think, instead it's a slow process of gradual growth. And I think the market will be disappointed [indiscernible] inflection point was just like Golden Week pops the numbers to a materially different level. I think we're seeing a gradual growth. The easing restrictions, obviously, the government decision. People are getting there as evidenced by the numbers coming out of April and the revenues. And I think we believe that this will just continue to accelerate with the only caveat being -- hopefully, obviously returned any cases of virus. [Can you offer,] [ph] Grant, any thoughts on that? I don't think we're going to get very emotional if there's not as big a number comes out of the May. We -- I think it's more -- it's a slow but very steady road upwards. Here in Las Vegas, it looks like the weekend is pre-pandemic levels, it's amazingly busy year and demand is back. I think Macao is going to follow suit. Of course, Vegas is still leading to the return of the group business, but that's inevitable. I think the U.S. is obviously in a different place than Asia. But I think China and Macao are just going to continue to move forward, accelerate. I think you'll see a slow gradual return in the second half of the year it could be very positive for everybody over there. Yes. Joe, I don't think we want to speculate because we don't know -- we're not [indiscernible] the government. We don't know what they're thinking. But as we said, ad nauseam in the past, we remain strong believers is our position there. The story about the [ASEAN] [ph] and what we've done in Cotai and the $15 billion investment and the non-gaming assets we built back. We just aren't that concerned about - when the government tells us they tell us, but we don't have the insight and nor do we have any idea when they're going to do that. But we feel renewals will happen. We feel very confident of our position. And other than that, I don't have any other insight, unless Wilfred, anything you want to add to that? Is that fair to say? Sure. Pat, do you want to grab that? That's correct. You're right. Yes. Surprisingly, our slot business there are exceptional -- the biggest drivers are slot performance has been outsized. It's been -- I mean we actually are not up against pre-pandemic levels, the slot floor. I think that reflects the comfort level with the team and other for the ability the to buy slot capacity without having a feel uncomfortable. It's more difficult on the table side to do that there's more spacing on the table side, which makes it difficult. But as you referenced, not having that fond of station is very hurtful because -- Singapore traditionally, the residents there and the visitors and the current residents all. It was a slot -- strong slot market before we he got there, just has gotten better over the years with the -- our ability to provide a good quality product. But that's the driver, no question about it. But without that foreign visitation, it's hard to grow the premium mass in the high-end table business.  So we convince struggle and I think we'll stay in this range until things improve. And unlike Macao, I think we're going to see a move in this summer and fall. I don't think you can see that -- any reason to believe that happens in Singapore. The neighboring countries are still struggling with the vaccinations, be it Malaysia or Indonesia or Japan, there's no real evidence that this is going to change in the short term. But it's a slot business over there that's been really exceptionally strong. I don't see anything because we're not very yet, Thomas. We have -- we're like the new guys with locker, I think the game is just beginning. And we're looking at it from many, many aspects. We've been a lot of man hours, a lot of people looking at the opportunities. We have a big appetite, but as you know, that market is still developing be it -- I think we're looking not just in the sports or the game, but all aspects of digital. We find it fastening and very, very complementary to our land-based business. But we're just not ready yet to disclose what we're going to do because we haven't decided. So not much color there, but I think you'll be hearing from us this year and next year about the direction we're taking. Positively. And we are -- again, we're strong believers in the rebound of Macao. It's coming back and there are people who somehow don't believe it, that's -- we'll have to wait and see. But it's going to come back in a strong way. We'll be the leading site in that space, our Londoner and Four Seasons investments are going to be having very well received. If the government wants us to invest in the region, and it makes -- we'll do it. We have capital, we've appetite, and we remain committed to Macao in a big way. We believe it's going to grow and grow for us. And despite all the distractions and all the pandemic, all the issues, Macao still remains from a land-based perspective, the most opportunistic and advantageous market in the world. And we plan to be there for a long time and invest more capital. And again, the government's directions will be pound out to our thinking. Sure. Wilfred or Grant can grab that since you guys are right there at the middle of it? Mr. Chum? Yes, we absolutely expect it to be very much like the pre-pandemic levels. I mean what you're seeing now is similar to the U.S. outside spending by affluent people driving these crazy good numbers out of luxury Four Seasons and others. But I think we expect a full recovery. We have no concerns in trepidation that as visitation in Macao returns and to Singapore, our malls are going back to pre-pandemic levels and perhaps even beyond that. So we -- I don't think there's any concerns that you've seen the correction on the rent concessions, you've seen it go the right direction. But we're very pleased with the caveat that we want to see a return to mass traffic as well as various people driving these large performances.  But yes, we expect it to look a lot like pre-pandemic levels, hopefully, as the year continues. And in Macao -- Singapore, the more difficult because, but again, until the resumption of air traffic and foreign travel. I think Singapore is going to lag their pre-pandemic levels. And again, we feel much more aggressive in the return of Macao than we do at Singapore at this time because we don't see the vaccination kicking as large in the region, nor do we see air traffic -- any visibility in the resumption of air traffic. So it's hard to see Singapore getting back to pre-pandemic levels this year. Well, the thought is we can go either direction, we can go to M&A or we could build organically. But at this point, again, I think we'll lay low. I think the challenging businesses -- despite the valuation, there's still challenging businesses. And it's early innings maybe -- in fact national anthem on time in terms of some of these businesses. I mean online in the U.S. is still a very -- not online gaming, which has been the profited -- most positive still in a few states. And I think the sports betting remains a conundrum to some extent to what's really happening there.  So -- and there's also a lot of movement outside the U.S., there's Europe and there's North America, there's all kinds of opportunities. So I don't think it'd be that long, we'll come back to you, but we're trying to again assess how to be smart and targeted, not just -- obviously with the kind of balance sheet we have, the optionality is endless. And we'll be careful and do it the right way. We really have the finest land-based business. So we want to get back and healthy. But we'll come back at the right time and the right strategy and right thought process. And then we'd want to obligate ourselves to say it's going to be organic or it's M&A, but we'll get there. I promise you that. We have a pretty voracious appetite to be in that world. And it may be different than you think it's going to be, but we'll let you know, and we're going to talk about it. Wilfred, Grant, can you help me on that one? I think a couple of thoughts to that.

And so when we look at the dividend, it really was and hopefully will be in the future, really the cornerstone, and you've heard me say that before, of a return of capital program. And I think where we are today is that we're going to look for operations to return to a baseline level and get a sense of where those operations are trending and then make an assessment with the Board and with management looking at our long-term potential to where the dividend should be given our ability to reinvest and allocate capital to other projects that are higher growth. And so I think it's pretty consistent with what you've heard us say before in calls, and nothing's changed from that perspective. Yes, sure. So I think from our standpoint, we feel very strongly about the long-term future and success of Macao as the world's leading leisure and tours destination. And as Rob has said before and as you've heard on these calls, we're very interested in investing more there in non-gaming. We feel very strongly in the future of Macao. So it's definitely something that we think about and consider over time. I think where we are now -- we don't have the proceeds yet. We're looking at all the options, and we're going to consider everything. I think we're going to be very focused on returns. And so I think we're looking at new developments we're looking at how to increase and develop more in the markets that we're in. And I think that will be something that we think about. And I think really for us, there's a lot of opportunity in front of the company. And we're being patient. We're looking at it all. And we're going to look through the lens of maximizing return. So it's not something that I'm going to say we're going to do now, but it's something that is in the things that we consider as we look across the way we might allocate capital. So I think technically they want to have 25% of the float outstanding for the exchange, but there are exceptions. Grant, I want to make sure that, that makes sense. Grant I just want to ask Grant Chum, I want to make sure I didn't [indiscernible] thing there, but ... No. I think what you should see over time is that corporate expenses should adjust post sale. But I think in the long run, we will continue to have a corporate office that manages the activities of the enterprise as a whole. So there's nothing in there that's noise right now, but you should expect to see some changes going forward after the completion of the sale. The other thing to note, and this is Patrick, is just keep in mind that while the pandemic-related restrictions has eased, the actual activity levels of the people in Singapore has gotten more back-to-normal over time across the quarter, right? So as people get vaccinated, as public health initiatives bear fruits, people who are in Singapore are more out and about. And so we benefited from some of that as well. So it's not as if there's a change, to Rob's point before, it's not as if there's a change in visitation, but there has been a change in activity in Singapore as things return more to normal there."

            "content": "Yes. All the sixth concessioners are waiting eagerly for the government to make announcements as we draw closer to the expiration of the concession. But as ever, we stand ready to cooperate with the government once they announced the timeline and what they intend to do over the next 12, 18 months. Yes. I think it is gratifying to note that the cases every day has dropped to single digit. And I think yesterday, there was no home case in Hong Kong. The -- both governments of Hong Kong and Macao have announced that if there is a continuing period of 14 days of zero cases, they would open or consider opening the border between Hong Kong and Macao. And I think the Hong Kong government is working very hard to achieve that. And hopefully, that if that happens, that's going to help our business a lot. Yes. I think the situation on the ground in China, they have started the vaccination program, but there's no -- really no hurry for people to get the vaccination because China has been very safe for the last months. And for Hong Kong and Macao, Macao has no incidents for over 380 days. So the feeling of comfort is causing a lot of people to adopt the wait and see attitude. But it's getting there, people are slowly ticking up the vaccination. Same with Hong Kong. I think Hong Kong is -- there's, unfortunately, a few cases of people suffering after the vaccination so again, there are people adopting the wait-and-see attitude. But slowly, slowly, people are beginning to realize the importance, especially if they are thinking of traveling overseas that the travel bubble may require vaccination certification. So I think people are beginning to take up vaccination."

            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Rob. Yes. We're here yes. Sure. On the question of VIP and premium mass, I think you've clearly seen the segments have diverged in terms of the recovery. Clearly, premium mass is -- has made a very significant recovery and already approaching 50% of pre-pandemic levels. VIP on the other hand, is still struggling at around 20% or sub-20%. So the segments are actually following very different trajectories, and we would expect that to continue for the time being. And of course, your question about whether there's spillover, whether there's migration I don't think those dynamics have really changed since a few years ago that there is a structural change over time, where more of the customers and more of the new customers are dealing directly with the casino operators program. And of course, the great assets on the integrated resort that all of the operators, including us, we've built up, have attracted more and more of these consumers to the premium mass program, and we expect that to continue over time as these non-gaming lifestyle assets and products continue to attract people to play in our programs. Yes. I think what Rob said is absolutely right. The term really started in March. In March, we started to experience a pretty meaningful rebound in visitations versus January and February. And as you've seen from the figures released by MGTO, that has continued on a similar momentum in April with visitations reaching post-pandemic highs in the mid of April. So the acceleration is seen across -- very encouragingly across all the different segments, whether you're talking about premium mass, mass. But the encouraging thing is that since March, we've really seen an acceleration in the base mass as well as the leisure FIT guests at the hotel, of course, retail, especially at the high-end consumption end of things. And we've even had an initial resumption of the MICE segment activity in March and bookings for Q2 look encouraging for the MICE as well, which is a surprise. But I think what you can see is a broad-based recovery in the different segments since early March. Yes. No. I think you said it well, I think it's a big and complex topic. It's really more about the digital currency strategy of China more broadly. And also how Macao can fit into that. So probably most helpful is to refer to the comments by the Chief Executive recently in the question-and-answer session in the legislature, basically, this digital currency China has been looking at since 2014. And so Macao will also adjust and adapt in order to accommodate this broader strategy on digital currency. But a prerequisite of that is also getting prepared in terms of amending the existing relevant legislation. So this is still an early stage process from the perspective of Macao."

At this time, all participants have been placed on listen-only mode, but we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation.  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours.\nDaniel Briggs : Thank you, operator. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and CEO; Patrick Dumont, our President and COO; Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, EVP of Asia Operations, Las Vegas Sands and COO of Sands China.  Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. We will be making those statements under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements.  In. addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are included in our press release. We have posted an earnings presentation on our website. We may refer to that presentation during the call. Finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those with interest to please pose one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. The presentation is being recorded.  I'll now turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Goldstein : Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining our call today. A few brief comments, then we move to Q&A. Macao's future is bright, remains the largest integrated resort market globally. Our commitment to investing in this incredible market is never wavered and with an unrivaled critical mass of world-class IRs as well as continued improvement in transportation infrastructure in the region. Macao will mature into a vibrant, diversified tourism market over the coming years. SCL's positioning and scale are perfect to capture the opportunity. Our diversified IR model with continuous investment in non-gaming segments, including MICE, hotel suites, live entertainment, retail, food and beverage, positions us well to capture the growth opportunity. Our diversity, scale and track record in non-gaming make us uniquely positioned to cater all segments of the market enable Macao to appeal to international tourists as well. The new concession is a win-win. We deeply appreciate the opportunity to operate one of those gaming concessions in the next 10 years. We are excited to deploy more capital to expand non-gaming offerings at SCL.  The $3.8 billion commitment is just a baseline. We hope to invest more as the market continues to grow. The commitment to develop non-gaming is the core of our investment and operating strategy for the past two decades, whether it be MICE, entertainment themed attractions or destination sales and marketing in overseas markets. We view the investment commitments by SCL and the rest of the industry is positive for Macao.  Over the past few weeks, travel restrictions have been lifted. It is too hard to tell the true measure of the underlying pace of recovery, but indications are extremely positive. We have seen significant improvement on property visitation, gaming volumes, retail sales and hotel occupancy.  We remain positive on investments in, The Londoner and Four Seasons. Our investments position us well as the market recovers. The quality of our new products will also help drive high-value tourism from the region, especially the overseas markets.  Turning to Singapore, our normalized EBITDA and gaming volumes are back now to the 2019 levels. Normalized EBITDA reached $386 million for the quarter. Rolling volumes are approaching 2019 level and mass win per day is now exceeding the level of 2019. We have also delivered strong performance in non-gaming across all segments, including retail, mall, hotel, F&B and MICE. Retail is especially noteworthy with a 26% increase in tenant sales per square foot versus 2019. Our [Indiscernible 0:03:45] casino renovation program is progressing. Renovated product will come online throughout the year. Looking ahead, Marina Bay Sands is poised for further growth as all of our markets recover and become free of travel restrictions and airline lift continues to recover.  Let's move to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe, your line is live.\nJoseph Greff : Hey, everybody, good afternoon. And good morning to those in Macao. My first question, obviously, is going to be on Macao, and Rob, Patrick, Dan, can you remind us what levels of mass GGR either on a dollar per day basis or as a percentage of 2019 levels, do you need to be at in order to be EBITDA breakeven? Obviously, the 4Q saw a narrowing relative to the 3Q. I'm presuming and would love for you to expand on it, I'm presuming what you're seeing thus far early in January is either at EBITDA breakeven or maybe more recently generating some level of positive EBITDA.\nRob Goldstein : So pessimistic, Joe. We're more than breakeven. A lot more than breakeven, doing just fine. I'll ask Patrick to give us some color on those issues, but I think we're past the breakeven. We're now in the positive territory moving towards very positive territory. Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont : Thanks, Rob. So a couple of things to note. Mix is important here. So as you know, we're a mass and premium mass and really a large-scale tourism investment company. And I think the key thing to note is the market is open. Liquidity is in the market. This is going to be a premium led recovery.  We invested significantly during the pandemic. And the benefit of that investment is on full display. We have new suite products. We probably have the -- what we think is the best new property we've had in a long time, opened up in Macao. That investment is really showing power in the market right now today. There's significant non-gaming scale and investment that we've made that is bearing fruit. And so it's great to see the recovery. It's great to see the volumes coming back.  It's interesting, I think, Rob has talked a lot about pent-up demand over the years. He's witnessed it in other places earlier in his career. We saw it here in Las Vegas, and we experienced it fully in Singapore and now we're at a run rate that is really, really strong. And I think we're seeing that in Macao. I think the key thing is this is going to be a premium led recovery.  In terms of breakeven, I don't think that's really a consideration anymore. I think we're way past it.\nRob Goldstein : Yeah. Joe, I think we can be confident, be very honest and direct. We are in very positive territory and keep moving upside. I think the one thing I would say to you is that no one ever questions the power the base mass market. I would remind you I was looking at our numbers, base mass in Macao in our building costs about 1,500 Hong Kong per hand as an opening bet. So it's a couple of hundred bucks a hand USD. That's the base mass business. The problem we have right now is you can't get a seat in the games in our buildings. We're running 95%, 100% occupancy in those games. And the same applies to slot ETGs.  The big question everyone's thinking about obviously is premium mass. And I think you'll be pleasantly surprised when you can see the numbers coming out of the premium mass. And you'll see the liquidity, you'll see resilience in that segment. And it's been a very pleasant surprise. Grant, can you add some color to that?\nGrant Chum : Yeah. Good morning and good afternoon. Yeah, I think the key thing we're seeing right now is that the quality of patronage is very high across all segments. So it's not just premium mass, it's also the base mass, it's in the retail segment. So we are seeing a very strong recovery in spend per customer. And again, that's not concentrated in any one segment. It's extremely broad based. And I think what you're seeing in the public numbers on presentation were recovered.  I think for CNY against 2019, we're about 40% of where we were in 2019, Chinese New Year for the first three days. And we're seeing revenues and volumes outperforming that visitation recovery, which is natural, which is what we've seen in other markets. So things are looking extremely positive right now.\nJoseph Greff : Great color, guys. Thank you. And then maybe switching over to Singapore for my follow-up question. Obviously, your comments on mass gaming, Rob, obviously, very strong. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your comments that you believe on like forcing late December and thus far in January, there's been an inflection at least from the Mainland Chinese segment? Can you give us some perspective on the relative -- I don't know if you want to look at it on a revenue or EBITDA contribution looking at 2019 levels. And then where that was sort of more recently as a percentage of the total mix?\nRob Goldstein : Yeah. I'll let Patrick -- you want address that?\nPatrick Dumont : Yeah, sure. I think the important thing to note is that there was this pent-up demand story in Singapore and now it's blossomed into full on bonanza. And so what we're really seeing is every segment is working. And so we had a lot of noise in this quarter because of the hold. We rolled north of $7 billion, which is pretty unbelievable considering where we came from. And the mass play was very, very strong. And so while we were doing this, we had almost 20% of our room inventory out. And so when you look at that 477 win number in mass and you look at the rolling volumes and realize we're out 20% of our rooms, there's a lot of leg room here. There's a lot of room for us to go. And so I want to be careful when we talk about margins and contribution because we're going to adjust that as we change mix, as we get rooms online as we go through the innovation, as we change our suite product, as we price up, as we yield up, and as we have access to higher value tourism. So this is really a forward-looking thing more than it is what happened in this quarter because we're going to continue to sort of adjust while we get our mix right.  So what I would look to in this business is margin expansion over time, more rooms coming online, better product, better service and, of course, being able to capture a very strong component of both VIP play and mass play.\nRob Goldstein : Joe, I think we're missing -- to Patrick's point, we're missing -- we're in a great place. We're back to 2000 -- we're back to 1.6 run rate if you take out the abnormal low hold on the rolling. But the two drivers that we just thought -- there's a lot of drivers, but the two jump off the page or renewed tours throughout Asia and China in particular. That's yet to come. We haven't -- we're doing all this -- we're in 2019 with no China participation and or limited China participation.  And as Patrick mentioned, a handicap physical plan, we are in a very, very fortunate position with MBS. I think it's going to become a property, a lot of growth. And I believe it's going to be a $2 billion business in the future. And I see nothing holding it back, except for our own renovations, which are extraordinary. I hope you get a chance to see it. And the reemergence of Asian tourism, including China back into the property.  The only regret we have is Singapore. We just like to have more capacity because -- you'll see -- I think you'll see in this year the power of -- the earning power of MBS. It's an extraordinary product, and we're lucky to have it.\nJoseph Greff : And Patrick, just back to your mix and yield comment. Do we interpret that, at least if we look back to 2019, that, that China MBS patron was a -- had a positive mix on spend per trip or spend per day or gaming revenue per day?\nRob Goldstein : I think it's a combination of factors, Joe. I think, obviously, the China market is always powerful. But I also think there's cost issues in all these markets. There's this inflationary factors, undeniable, be it energy, wages -- I mean, there's a different world out there, and you've got to cope with it. But the thing about MBS that fascinates us is we believe we can drive revenues across the board. We're going to rethink our retail, rethink our table mix, our floor, our room pricing. We think we have a product that the demand will be close to insatiable for it, from the gamer and non-gamer perspective. And we're going to overcome margin cost -- margin by overcoming costs with higher revenues, a lot higher revenues across the board in every segment. That's the approach. We see MBS as a very unique product that's unrivaled in that part of the world. And we can just push pricing across the board, gaming pricing, ADR pricing, retail pricing, F&B pricing, it's just that good and that desirable. And let's face it, the market right now is using our favor. Singapore is very desirable from a lot of perspectives.\nJoseph Greff : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live.\nCarlo Santarelli : Hey, everybody. Thanks, and good evening. Rob, or whoever wants to handle this, I was just wondering, in the brief time that China has more or less reopened, have you guys seen positive or negative, any change in behavior as it pertains to patronage at MBS?\nRob Goldstein : MBS, that's a good question. I think it's too early to say we're going to see that. I see us as getting plenty of trying of participation, both in Macao and Singapore. But it's really too early to say. It just happened so quickly and the turnabout was so rapid that I think it's too hard to predict. I think the way this is going to segment though is that we're going to get more than our fair share of the rolling business in MBS. That moves in that direction, and we'll get the premium mass customer to visit more into Macao.  I think our business really is going to split in that direction. I think it's very predictable what's going to happen here, and we're okay with that. So Singapore will get the top of the top. But each of those places will get tons of premium mass demand from China and throughout the region. I also think people underestimate how powerful Macao can become as a desirable visitation place throughout China. It's got everything. It's got the rooms, it's got the access, it's got the -- one thing, it has beyond Singapore, it's has lots of capacity and lots to offer. So I think Macao is going to be a very strong international destinations ahead. We plan to be very aggressive trying to push people into Macao to see the property, all of our products.\nCarlo Santarelli : That makes sense, Rob. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, and I understand kind of looking backwards at things that are Macao related is somewhat pointless in the environment that we're in right now. But it's just -- it does stand out a little bit when looking at your base and premium mass table revenues from the slide deck, your premium mass is representing, I think, 20% of 4Q '19 base mass kind of more like mid-teens, 16, something like that. However, the premium mass is down considerably year-over-year, whereas the base mass is reasonably steady year-over-year. Is that a whole dynamic on just lower than normal historical volumes? Or is there something else that's kind of made those 2 diverge more recently here, and then the fourth quarter specifically?\nRob Goldstein : No, I think it's just a visitation issue. It's not a whole issue. It's visitations sure. I think you're going to find that washes out. I wouldn't take those numbers too much to heart. I think when you look at Q1, I wish when you see January, when those numbers are out there for the market, I think it will all wash away quite nicely. It won't be -- it won't enter into your thinking, Carlo. It's a nonevent. I think you'll see a surprising strength in both those segments.  I would say in Macao, we're going to be very strong, very represented in the base mass because we have the capacity. We're a scale player. And so we have the capacity in the gaming, non-gaming, retail, restaurant space to do extraordinary things in the base mass. And again, as I'll reiterate, base mass in Macao is a different animal than the U.S. It's a $200 base bet, $175 base bet. So pretty special customer. We are going to represent because of our scale.  But on the other hand, with all of our suite product, et cetera, I think we'll also be the leaders in the premium mass business. So we have a very strong future ahead of us in Macao. I always chuckle, people, if you're looking for a negative commentary in the Macao market, you're in the rolling earnings call.\nCarlo Santarelli : Understood. And then, Rob, just quickly, if you could remind us, to the extent you guys are willing to share it, 2019, your direct VIP volume, your in-house VIP volume as a percentage of total, would you guys be able to share something like that?\nRob Goldstein : We would, but we won't.\nCarlo Santarelli : Understood. You could, but you won't.\nRob Goldstein : We could share it, we just won't. No, we're not going to do that. But Carlo, thank you. It's good to hear from you.\nCarlo Santarelli : Thanks, guys. You as well. Take care. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live. \nStephen Grambling : Hi, everyone. Thanks. Can you hear me okay?\nRob Goldstein : Pretty clear, Stephen. Go ahead.\nStephen Grambling : So the visitation data for Chinese near looks like Hong Kong has been the bigger driver in the recent uptick in visitation. Is there any way to parse out recovery between Hong Kong and Mainland China? And any reason why spending behavior and recovery may be different between these source markets?\nRob Goldstein : Yeah. And I've got a perfect answer to that. Mr. Chum?\nGrant Chum : Yes, you can see from the visitation numbers been published by the Tourism Bureau. The Mainland Chinese visitation is at about 30% recovery rate versus 2019 CNY. So obviously, with a 40% recovery for overall visitations, Hong Kong visitation recovery has been higher. Mainly, I think, as a result of just the ease with which they've been able to go. And obviously, Hong Kong has had a longer stabilized situation with, as it relates to the pandemic. So I think from a pure visitation point of view, it's just not unexpected. And bear in mind, the transportation support for the Hong Kong visitor only really opened up on the eighth of January. So this has been a very rapid increase in Hong Kong visitations. That said, I think we referenced back to the comments that Rob made earlier and I alluded to as well, I wouldn't get too stuck on the visitation recovery. I think in these types of reopening, we're going to see the premium customers come back first. The core customer coming back as a much bigger percentage than the overall visitation.  So I think what we're seeing is the quality of revenues and the patronage from all regions that visit in Chinese New Year has been very, very high. So we are way outperforming the visitation recovery in terms of volumes and revenue. And indeed, I think if you look at our property visitations our recovery rate in visitations to our own property, is far outperforming the recovery in the overall visitation numbers in the market versus 2019.\nRob Goldstein : Steve, to Grant's comment just, again, we don't want to confuse visitation with GGR. There's not necessarily an easy way to make them work. I was recently in Singapore, I walked in one of our retail stores with our retail person and she told me the sales in the store were like $70 million. And I said there's nobody here, no one in the store. And she said, Rob, we only need the right people, not a lot of people. I think that's what's happening in Macao, we gained the right people showing up in mass, and it's reflecting in the numbers. You'll see that when the market numbers come out.  I think the early adapters to the market are the right people for the market. And I think that's why there's a confusion in the visitation versus the actual revenues.\nStephen Grambling : Makes sense. And maybe as a related follow-up there, there's been a similar dynamic, stronger spend per visitor in the U.S. that ultimately drove much better margins. How are you thinking about the puts and takes to margins in Macao versus what we've seen in other markets?\nRob Goldstein : Grant, margins?\nGrant Chum : Yeah. I think first of all, our cost structure is in good shape. It's been -- unfortunately, we've had to spend extra effort in optimizing the cost structure over the past two or three years. So we've got a very lean cost base right now.  In terms of gross margins on the revenue, I think a couple of things. One is our mix, obviously, is more favorable going forward just from a gross margin mix perspective simply because a vast majority of our revenues will be coming from the non-rolling and slot segments. And then secondly, the non-gaming, we expect to be growing, and that's obviously a much higher margin. We expect to be growing retail, hotel, F&B, actually all the non-gaming segments. So that's the structural framework for the margin. But obviously, the actual flow-through in the percentage margin we ultimately deliver from this very positive structure is really dependent on the rate of volume recovery. So we still need the top line to recover to a certain level before you get the flow through. And then to go beyond that, obviously, we hope and we all are working towards that, is for this market to continue to grow and, hopefully, at least in the mass segments and non-gaming segments glad to go beyond where we were in 2019. So if that happens, obviously, our margin structure should be very positive. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we think about the structure of margins going forward.\nStephen Grambling : Absolutely. Thanks so much. \nRob Goldstein : Thanks, Stephen. \nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live.\nRobin Farley : Great, thanks. I wanted to ask, you've obviously always been very focused on the mass business there. But some of your competitors that have been more VIP focused, are you seeing them do things differently now that there's not the VIP market to go after in the same way there had been? Is that -- is it too soon to be seeing what changes that might mean?\nRob Goldstein : I would assume it is, but I'll defer to Grant since he's on the ground. I can't imagine we have any visibility into that at this point. But clearly, we have a new market here, which favors our asset base. And our approach for the last 20 years has been scale. As you well know, Robin, it's a mass story with premium mass and retail commencing, et cetera. So we don't have things like -- it's tailor made for what we do, this environment. Our competitors will adapt and have to change. But I don't know. Grant, any color on that?\nGrant Chum : Yeah. I think, Robin, the competition for premium mass has always been very intense. And I think we'll continue to be, given the dynamics you just referenced. At the same time, I think as Rob says, we've got a footprint and scale advantage on our [Indiscernible 0:24:40] non-gaming asset facilities, I think really position us very well for all segments of mass. And then as Patrick referenced at the outset, the product that we've been developing for the last three years, especially, The London and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons, are really prime position to help us be more competitive the premium lifestyle segments up in market as well as, I think, hopefully, to drive overall high-value tourism to Macao over the coming years. And I do as to point about international tourism as well. I think our footprint to combine with our new products and our traditional strength in MICE, in international marketing network really position us very well to bring those high-value guests to Macao as well.\nRob Goldstein : Great. Thank you for that color. And then just for my follow-up question on Macao. Can you give us sort of a rough sense of that dollar commitment that you've made to invest over the next 10 years in Macao? Kind of roughly what percent of that might be new projects and what percent might be -- might kind of fall into the OpEx line, kind of like overseas marketing and things? Just kind of CapEx versus OpEx split, just ballpark? Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont : Yeah. Sure. I think one thing that would be helpful. If you turn to Page 22 in the presentation, you'll see some details on that. So it might be best to refer to those pages because we do break it out, and there are several pages behind it that explain what our concession renewal commitments actually are. So it's there in the presentation.\nRobin Farley : It's always tough to get through all of your slides before the earnings call.\nPatrick Dumont : I apologize. I think the key thing here is that we're very committed to investing in the Macao market. We think this investment will drive additional long-term tourism value and diversification of Macao's economy. We're very excited to make these investments, and we think these are things that will really help achieve our goals in the goals of the government. So we're looking forward to it actually.\nRobin Farley : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live.\nShaun Kelley : Good afternoon. Good morning, Grant. So just high level, as you kind of look through kind of what you're seeing probably real time, could you give us just your latest thoughts on maybe the pace of recovery here? Do you expect things to be pretty linear or any chance of whether it's COVID or restriction-related setbacks or anything else that could change what you're seeing on the ground? And obviously, Chinese New Year is fantastic. But it would seem like the opening here is just going to continue.  Any reason that, that would be kind of different from the reality? Or how are you seeing your bookings shape up and the patterns you're expecting to see over the next couple of months?\nRob Goldstein : I'd begin by saying, first of all, we're just thrilled to be open and making money and seeing demand like we're seeing. I don't think any of us have the aptitude or the insight to tell you what's going to happen -- they have post-change news.  But I do think longer term, you have to have real strong confidence. And you see -- when you get to see these numbers that we are seeing that this is a market that's going to rebound. This market has a strong base mass, premium mass. And some of the fears be in the market about, it was liquidity like, what's resiliency, I think those fears will be pushed to the side.  What's the trajectory and how fast it happens? I don't think any of us have the gumption to make venture a guess. I think it would be silly. We just feel fortunate we're open. We're operating. We think it keeps getting better, not worse. I don't believe COVID is going to be -- obviously, China has gone through a different trajectory than we did here in the U.S.  But hopefully, that won't be a problem. Again, I don't want to speak anything that I can't speak for. But if things keep going like they're going, we'll all be in a very happy place in 2023, especially, I think, somewhere in the second half of the year. As normal travel patterns resume, Hong Kong gets back on speed, Mainland China. I think there's a lot of growth potential and a lot of good thoughts coming our way vis-a-vis the future. We are -- again, as I said earlier, we're not going to tell you that we don't believe in this -- we believe in this strongly very strongly. We believe in our assets very strongly. We believe in international tourism in Macao very strongly.  So we're not going to predict when it happens, how it happens, how fast it happens. But we feel very positive about what's going to happen in Macao in the long term, very positive. And we're looking to investing money in there and getting back to where we were in the past in Macao. We couldn't be more positive on the can long term.\nShaun Kelley : Great. Thanks for that, Rob. And then maybe a little bit more specific one for Grant, if I may. But just wanting to dig in a little bit more on the labor and staffing side of what you're seeing in Macao right now. You talked about the margin structure high level. But are you fully expecting to return to levels of staff that you had pre-COVID?  Are you already there? Will it be even above those levels? Kind of what's needed and what have you optimized? I know those people have -- many of them have found employment elsewhere, the market has grown since where we started. So kind of how do you think about maybe either FTEs or overall operating expense run rates relative to 2019?\nGrant Chum : I think, Shaun, we've also become more productive and efficient through the past couple of years. So I think we'll have to rethink -- it wouldn't necessarily be referencing exactly back to 2019. And also a mix of product has also changed quite a bit through the Londoner. We do have more high-quality non-gaming asset base to operate as well.  So to give you a bit more color, today, we are short of manpower relative to full operating capacity and relative to the demand that we're seeing. So we're not operating one of the Sheraton Towers as we speak. So we are minus 2,200 rooms from our operating capacity. And our newest hotel Londoner Court, which we soft opened in the past year, we're not at the full operating capacity for that high end all-suite hotel. We're still only about two thirds of the way through in terms of ability of manpower to operate the whole hotel. So both at the top end and at the mass end, we are still short of manpower to operate at full capacity. And we'll be progressively hiring to fill the gaps as we go through the recovery. And hopefully, within the next few months, we're going to be in a better place relative to our full operating potential because we clearly see the demand pattern, I think is going to urge the whole industry to staff up and to be able to operate, especially for these peak periods. And that's another part. We have no crystal ball as Rob says served on the post CNY. But clearly, the early indications of metrics like the demand for the hotels is telling you that, yes, the demand is staging a strong recovery.  And obviously, we're going to have to [Indiscernible 0:32:50]. Thanks.\nShaun Kelley : Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad, your line is live.\nChad Beynon : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In the slide deck, you highlighted principal areas of development being Macao, which we just talked about, Singapore, which we talked about, and New York, which I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on. But second part of that question is, I know in the past, you talked about other potential opportunities in Asia like a Korea or a Thailand, years ago we talked about Japan. Wondering if those are going quiet at this time. So I guess, firstly, on New York, and then secondly, potential Asian opportunities? Thanks. \nRob Goldstein : Chad, let's revert your mind, I'll reverse it just. I think we all know that Thailand has been discussions there, and we're certainly looking at Thailand. And that's no secret has been in the press that Thailand is a possibility. So we're certainly looking hard at Thailand. I would love to be -- have a presence there in the future. Japan, as you referenced, is not there. And Korea is nothing viable to speak of today. So we'll jump to New York, which is an extraordinary and unique opportunity. And I think for the winning bidder or bidders, it's going to be an amazing opportunity because of a very simple dynamic of a huge market with limited capacity. There's only a few casinos there. It's probably the only place in the U.S. where you can have millions and millions of people, and yet there'll be probably just a handful of casinos total. The win per units there will be exceptional.  The lucky winner is going to do very, very well. I think the evidence of the market is clear just by looking at the three operating properties under the table games. And we really don't have much of a -- it's not a great product right now in New York as far as room capacity. It's still doing approaching USD 2 billion with just slot machines.  So our approach is very much in LVS, it's anchored by an LDH historical approach, which is scale and quality. We're not looking to build a casino, looking to build not a regional casino but rather a truly large hotel with spa convention space, dozens of restaurants, a new theater, a huge entertainment feature, a transformational product, which will positively impact the community and grow tourism a powerful statement. We're not looking to be in this thing in a limited way. We'll be all the way in. And we think if we do it, it will be transformational for the county we're working in, very good for the people in the county and something they can be very proud of. And it will drive tourism -- outsized tourism into Nassau. Our bid is very much traditional on the thinking of LVS large-scale with numerous non-gaming assets, lots of meeting space, probably 400,000 square per foot new space.  So I view New York very much very unique to the rest of the United States. It's not -- it's a population in the many millions to just a couple of casinos, very different here in Las Vegas. We've got a huge local market but dozens and dozens and dozens of casinos. There you'll be basically alone. And so it's going to be very -- it's an exceptional opportunity. It won't come along again. I think this is one and done. So we're trying very hard. And we've been trying to do New York for a number of years, but it looks like this is finally someone's opportunity. Hopefully, it's ours.\nChad Beynon : Thank you very much, Rob. And then secondly, I just wanted to ask another one on Macao, now that you've had some more data in the market, Grant. It seems like there's an even bigger shift towards Peninsula -- or I'm sorry, versus to Cotai versus Peninsula than we've seen in the past. I was wondering if you could confirm that or if that's really just kind of a mix of a reflection of what we're seeing from the different modes of transportation. Wondering if that's a trend that could continue in '23.  And then related to that, how are you thinking about your asset and the Peninsula there's CapEx opportunities? I know that's not part of the big CapEx plan. Thank you. \nRob Goldstein : Grant?\nGrant Chum : Sure. Rob, should I take that? Yes.\nRob Goldstein : Yeah. \nGrant Chum : I think I haven't seen any data on the split between Cotai and Peninsula. However, it stands to reason, I think, structurally, we see -- and we have always said that Cotai will become the primary hub. And I think even pre-COVID, we were already more than half of the mass revenues from Cotai. And I think that trend will continue.  I think there's a lot of different reasons. But I think at its heart, the main reason is just the cluster of world class integrated resorts that you have on Cotai. And what this, I think, next generation of these lifestyle consumers are looking for from Macao as a destination, and all of the investments in non-gaming that are going into basically making these results even more desirable over the next 10 years, all of those structural factors are surely will continue to push the balance of revenues towards the Cotai side, and that's a structural issue that will continue to evolve over the long time. As regards to -- we obviously have one asset on the Peninsula, we do intend to reinvest in that asset. But it clearly the majority -- the vast majority of our capital will still be going towards our Cotai properties.\nChad Beynon : Thank you very much. Appreciated. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt, your line is live. \nBrandt Montour : Hey, everybody. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Starting on Singapore. I was curious if you could compare the spend per visitor that you're seeing there to what we saw in Las Vegas in 2020 and 2021. If that's sort of holding up in the same way, if it's -- if the curve looks different quarter-over-quarter. And then if you want to throw Macao early days into that comparison, that would also be helpful.\nPatrick Dumont : Yeah. I think it's really hard to compare between markets. The key thing to note is that it's really all about pent-up demand, consumer tourism experience and the products that we offer. And sort of the nature of those assets for high-quality tourism. So it's not really fair to compare between markets. The price points are different, the consumer behaviors are different. It really doesn't look the same. What is thematically similar is the pent-up demand story.  And Rob -- as I said before, Rob's seen it in his career in other locations. We experienced here in Las Vegas in a very strong way. We saw it in Singapore in a very strong way, and it's still in effect and we're starting to see them in Macao now and it's coming on strong. So I think it's really the nature of consumer behavior as opposed to the specific price points in each market.\nBrandt Montour : Okay, that's great. \nRob Goldstein : It's part of the -- to Patrick's point, think about what Singapore is market GGR versus Macao, Macao could be a $25 billion, $30 billion GGR market has been higher historically. And Singapore just doesn't have the capacity. And then Las Vegas is much more of a -- it's got a gaming component, it's got a very strong non-gaming. So it's almost impossible to apples-to-apples. The driving force is the scale of people in Macao in Singapore -- in Mainland China, the accessibility to adjustable market is so huge in Macao. And so the product offering. To Grant's point, the Peninsula, versus the Cotai, it's got such enormous capacity and great product. It's hard to -- that market is so outsized when it just back at full capacity, it's hard to compare than anything. It's so powerful.\nBrandt Montour : Okay. Okay. Thanks for that. And then on Slide 22, the long-term commitments in Macao slide, on the capital, the left side of the slide, I was curious, looking at your plans for the next 10 years if you think you're going to be able to achieve return levels commensurate to recent projects that you've done in that market and you've enjoyed in that market?\nRob Goldstein : Yeah, we sure do. We forget, we -- you're talking to a bunch of people have been doing business in the count for 20 years, and we've seen the returns. We've seen what non-gaming can do. Our theaters, our retail, our entertainment has driven billions and billions and billions of dollars of EBITDA, and they will in the future as well. We have no concerns whatsoever about investing and getting a solid return on non-gaming commitments. All they do is drive more visitation to the market. They are additives to the market, certainly going to drive more business right now.  We look at this as a 10-year starting commitment and going beyond that. Our commitment to Macao is as long as we can be there. And so we have no hesitation to invest or show the market a very, very considerable return. Just look we've done in the past. I mean, on our current assets, mostly non-gaming. The lion's share of our investment in Macao is non-gaming, the great majority. It's worked out pretty well for us. So we think next 10 years, we'll continue that trend, and we're very happy and very committed to Macao.\nBrandt Montour : Excellent. Thanks so much, everyone. \nRob Goldstein : Sure. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ben Chaiken from Credit Suisse. Ben, your line is live. \nBen Chaiken : Hey, everyone. Just a quick one for me. Historically, capital return has been really important to you guys. Obviously, Macao is just beginning to ramp, and there's a lot of areas to invest. But how are you thinking about the dividend these days? Is that still important? And if so, how should we think about timing of that?\nPatrick Dumont : Yeah. If Sheldon were here, he would say, yay [ph 0:42:49], dividends. I think someone put us on hold in Macao.\nDaniel Briggs : Sorry about that.\nRob Goldstein : Brief commercial from Macao.\nPatrick Dumont : So as I was saying, if Sheldon were here, and we miss him dearly, he would be saying, yay, dividends. I think Las Vegas Sands is a growth company. We're back to growth. We're a development company. We do large-scale developments in key markets. But most importantly, we're also a returning capital company.  And I think as our business returns and as we see normalization of cash flows, we're going to look to start the dividend again and be very shareholder friendly. But at the end of the day, we're very focused on the strength of our balance sheet of new development. And you heard Rob talk about New York, it's very exciting. There are other things that hopefully we'll get a chance to do in the near term. And opportunistically, I think we'll continue to deploy capital where the highest returns are. And as part of that, the dividend will be fundamental to our shareholder return strategy. But I think we're going to wait and see where operating cash flow ends up and we'll make some assessments at that point.\nBen Chaiken : Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve, your line is live. \nSteve Wieczynski : Yeah, guys. Good afternoon. So Rob or whoever wants to take this, I mean, if we look at visitation in Macao over the last, let's call it, week or so around the start of Chinese New Year, it does seem like it has been pretty strong. And I guess, is there any commentary or color you could give us about the spending patterns of these folks that are coming to the market? Meaning, are these folks gambling as much as they did before? Or is that some of that spending being pushed more into the non-gaming side of the floor? And maybe it's just too early to tell. But I think with how high Chinese savings levels are right now. I'm just wondering if you can provide any color around that.\nRob Goldstein : Yes. Yes. Yes. They're spending in retail, they're spending in gambling, they're spending, as we may have referenced so Steve, it's just the right customers showing up. And I think this is historically how it's worked out in the recoveries where those who are the most aggressive gamers and retail spenders show up first. And we're seeing that strongly in Macao. It's a very good audience, a very strong audience. You'll see the market numbers then come out.  It's really gratifying for those of us who wait along terrible three years to see these days return, and they returned. And I think the real question is these customers that are now the question is, how many more are coming behind them? Because to your point, visitation has been mediocre out of Mainland China, relative to what had been previously. We're not even there. We're getting some pretty big numbers coming out of Macao in the market.  So we're very enthused about it. I don't think -- it's not necessarily choosing gaming or retail, I think they're doing both, and then they're eating and shopping and funding everything. So -- it's very typical of these recovery situations where the people who wanted most to shop there and they're buying their spending enjoying life again. I think the Chinese are no different to the Americans who came to the U.S. markets and enjoy themselves. And hopefully, a party continues is just getting started, and we've got a very encouraging start to this reopening after the last three years.  Grant, do you want add some color to that, any issues you can raise that I haven't?\nGrant Chum : No, I think it's just as you said. The nature of these reopenings, it will attract the high-quality customers first, and that's what we're seeing. And I think we saw that in Singapore in April as well. We had much stronger recovery in the Southeast Asian overseas spend in Singapore versus the recovery in the tourist arrivals. And I think Macao has also following something similar, except for the fact Macao has a much bigger advantage in being able to support visitation, not just by international airlift, regional airlift, but also by land and sea as well and domestic airlift then connecting through the Southern China as well.  So I think it's -- let's see how -- what the pace of visitation recoveries like versus the revenue recovery. But so far, I think the pattern that we've seen in CNY does support that pattern. Yes, you're getting a much stronger revenue. I think you are in visitation.\nRob Goldstein : I think that last comment of Grant's, that's a great one, in that this is on the air dependent market like Singapore. You'll need the airlines. You can come other ways, access to Macao is mostly vehicular or both. So I think it's a huge advantage for Macao that as the population conquers, the virus situation gets more confident, there's nothing to -- no impediments to massive growth in visitation coming to Macao from China. That's a very positive point.  But Steve, look, we just -- we are pleased we're seeing and they're spending in every direction. So we very -- we feel very fortunate. Hopefully, it just continues to ramp up from here.\nSteve Wieczynski : That's great color. That's it for me, guys. Really appreciated. \nRob Goldstein : Thank you, as always. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. \nCassandra Lee : Hi. This is Cassandra on behalf of David. Happy Chinese New Year to everyone. Yeah, I think a lot of my questions have been answered already, so I hope it's not getting repetitive. You've mentioned cost issues in all markets, especially in energy wages. So could you discuss to what extent are those permanent? And where we might be run rating in terms of EBITDA versus 2019 level today?\nRob Goldstein : We're not going to discuss EBITDA at this point, except for what you've seen in Singapore. I do think energy is a vast thing. It does vastly. It doesn't go one way, as you well know, whereas wages, I think, worldwide are going to be an issue for everybody. And I think we'll deal with that. They're not -- I don't see them coming down a whole lot. Again, our resorts and our capacity constrained ability to price up -- the rating at our business is you can price up and retain your margins. That, I think, will be our strategy in Singapore and also in Macao. I don't think wages are going to decline greatly. I think Grant alluded to efficiencies, and then that's important. We have a large workforce, in the tens of thousands, in Macao. So more efficient and better doing what we do, that should be helpful. But I think we're all going to live with at this point in the U.S. and Asia, higher wages appear to be in the structure for now. Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont : I think the key thing is that by the nature of our business, we have resiliency in the face of inflation. As Rob mentioned, we have a lot of flexible pricing, hotel rooms, gaming pricing, the way we operate food and beverage, that we operate all of our non-gaming amenities. These are not long-term contracts. We have the ability to go with the market.  So while there are some structural increases around wages, around inputs that we use, at the same time, we have the ability to price because of the unique nature of our products the experiences we offer to be fair to the positioning of the products that we have. We've invested a lot over many years in both markets, the reason why they're so strong. So in our mind, inflation is a real thing. We have to take into account but we have the ability to work through it and actually grow the margins of our business over time.\nCassandra Lee : Great. Thank you. And shifting to New York, how do you share or disclose publicly what kind of investments you expect to make if you win the gaming license versus if you don't?\nRob Goldstein : Yeah, the current thought in our heads is about $4 billion to $5 billion. Again, this is not a regional casino. This is a full-blown resort. With MICE, entertainment, retail, restaurants, it's the real thing. It's not meant to be a small time investment. We're going all the way in and building something transformational that drives tourism. And we think will be the biggest, in terms of the casino business will be the biggest revenue generator.\nCassandra Lee : Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. \nRob Goldstein : Thank you, appreciated. \nOperator: Thank you. And the last question today will be coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live. \nDan Politzer : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for [Indiscernible 0:51:23] I guess, first on Macao. I know VIP was historically about a quarter of your total business. I mean, to what extent, if any, have you seen this customer return and in what form has it been more of a credit, a direct VIP type customer? Or is this customer showing up in premium mass?\nPatrick Dumont : So one thing to note is the VIP contribution was much lower than that. So let's call it, high single digits, low double digits historically. We've always been mass and premium mass driven. So it's -- on a contribution basis because the margins in premium and VIP and, to be fair, junket business, were always structurally much different than they were for our mass business. So we've always been led on a contribution basis by our mass play and our premium mass play. And you can tell that by our asset base and how we speak to our customers and the type of tourism we attract. That being said, I do want to turn it over to Grant for some additional comments.\nGrant Chum : Thanks, Patrick. Not a lot to add. I mean, all of our rolling business currently is in the premium direct program. And I think the second point is premium mass is doing recovering much, much faster than premium direct. I think that's what we're seeing right now.\nDan Politzer : Got it. And then just a follow-up on the New York investment, the $4 billion to $5 billion you mentioned, I mean, is there -- should we expect a commensurate return on that type of project that you've seen in your Asia-based investments or given the high density population, the spend curve per unit, is there reasonable to think that there could actually be upside to that kind of 20% historical return?\nPatrick Dumont : I think for us, we're very focused on return on invested capital. So Rob and the rest of the team really looks everywhere that we can to try to best deploy capital in the highest return outcomes. And so we would be interested in New York, if we didn't think the returns were there. We think it's a very strong potential opportunity. And for us, it's going to be about the jobs we create, about the tourism we drive about the investment in the local community, the relationships that we have. In every market that we're in, we're typically the largest trade partner with small and medium enterprise. We're looking to develop deep community routes, so we can support the community and really show this industry is something that can benefit everyone. So we're very excited about it. We think the returns are there. Otherwise, we wouldn't be interested.\nDan Politzer : Got it. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time. And have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. So a couple of things to note. Mix is important here. So as you know, we're a mass and premium mass and really a large-scale tourism investment company. And I think the key thing to note is the market is open. Liquidity is in the market. This is going to be a premium led recovery.  We invested significantly during the pandemic. And the benefit of that investment is on full display. We have new suite products. We probably have the -- what we think is the best new property we've had in a long time, opened up in Macao. That investment is really showing power in the market right now today. There's significant non-gaming scale and investment that we've made that is bearing fruit. And so it's great to see the recovery. It's great to see the volumes coming back.  It's interesting, I think, Rob has talked a lot about pent-up demand over the years. He's witnessed it in other places earlier in his career. We saw it here in Las Vegas, and we experienced it fully in Singapore and now we're at a run rate that is really, really strong. And I think we're seeing that in Macao. I think the key thing is this is going to be a premium led recovery.  In terms of breakeven, I don't think that's really a consideration anymore. I think we're way past it. Yeah, sure. I think the important thing to note is that there was this pent-up demand story in Singapore and now it's blossomed into full on bonanza. And so what we're really seeing is every segment is working. And so we had a lot of noise in this quarter because of the hold. We rolled north of $7 billion, which is pretty unbelievable considering where we came from. And the mass play was very, very strong. And so while we were doing this, we had almost 20% of our room inventory out. And so when you look at that 477 win number in mass and you look at the rolling volumes and realize we're out 20% of our rooms, there's a lot of leg room here. There's a lot of room for us to go. And so I want to be careful when we talk about margins and contribution because we're going to adjust that as we change mix, as we get rooms online as we go through the innovation, as we change our suite product, as we price up, as we yield up, and as we have access to higher value tourism. So this is really a forward-looking thing more than it is what happened in this quarter because we're going to continue to sort of adjust while we get our mix right.  So what I would look to in this business is margin expansion over time, more rooms coming online, better product, better service and, of course, being able to capture a very strong component of both VIP play and mass play. Yeah. Sure. I think one thing that would be helpful. If you turn to Page 22 in the presentation, you'll see some details on that. So it might be best to refer to those pages because we do break it out, and there are several pages behind it that explain what our concession renewal commitments actually are. So it's there in the presentation. I apologize. I think the key thing here is that we're very committed to investing in the Macao market. We think this investment will drive additional long-term tourism value and diversification of Macao's economy. We're very excited to make these investments, and we think these are things that will really help achieve our goals in the goals of the government. So we're looking forward to it actually. Yeah. I think it's really hard to compare between markets. The key thing to note is that it's really all about pent-up demand, consumer tourism experience and the products that we offer. And sort of the nature of those assets for high-quality tourism. So it's not really fair to compare between markets. The price points are different, the consumer behaviors are different. It really doesn't look the same. What is thematically similar is the pent-up demand story.  And Rob -- as I said before, Rob's seen it in his career in other locations. We experienced here in Las Vegas in a very strong way. We saw it in Singapore in a very strong way, and it's still in effect and we're starting to see them in Macao now and it's coming on strong. So I think it's really the nature of consumer behavior as opposed to the specific price points in each market. Yeah. If Sheldon were here, he would say, yay [ph 0:42:49], dividends. I think someone put us on hold in Macao. So as I was saying, if Sheldon were here, and we miss him dearly, he would be saying, yay, dividends. I think Las Vegas Sands is a growth company. We're back to growth. We're a development company. We do large-scale developments in key markets. But most importantly, we're also a returning capital company.  And I think as our business returns and as we see normalization of cash flows, we're going to look to start the dividend again and be very shareholder friendly. But at the end of the day, we're very focused on the strength of our balance sheet of new development. And you heard Rob talk about New York, it's very exciting.

So we've always been led on a contribution basis by our mass play and our premium mass play. And you can tell that by our asset base and how we speak to our customers and the type of tourism we attract. That being said, I do want to turn it over to Grant for some additional comments. I think for us, we're very focused on return on invested capital. So Rob and the rest of the team really looks everywhere that we can to try to best deploy capital in the highest return outcomes. And so we would be interested in New York, if we didn't think the returns were there. We think it's a very strong potential opportunity. And for us, it's going to be about the jobs we create, about the tourism we drive about the investment in the local community, the relationships that we have. In every market that we're in, we're typically the largest trade partner with small and medium enterprise. We're looking to develop deep community routes, so we can support the community and really show this industry is something that can benefit everyone. So we're very excited about it. We think the returns are there. Otherwise, we wouldn't be interested."

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining our call today. A few brief comments, then we move to Q&A. Macao's future is bright, remains the largest integrated resort market globally. Our commitment to investing in this incredible market is never wavered and with an unrivaled critical mass of world-class IRs as well as continued improvement in transportation infrastructure in the region. Macao will mature into a vibrant, diversified tourism market over the coming years. SCL's positioning and scale are perfect to capture the opportunity. Our diversified IR model with continuous investment in non-gaming segments, including MICE, hotel suites, live entertainment, retail, food and beverage, positions us well to capture the growth opportunity. Our diversity, scale and track record in non-gaming make us uniquely positioned to cater all segments of the market enable Macao to appeal to international tourists as well. The new concession is a win-win. We deeply appreciate the opportunity to operate one of those gaming concessions in the next 10 years. We are excited to deploy more capital to expand non-gaming offerings at SCL.  The $3.8 billion commitment is just a baseline. We hope to invest more as the market continues to grow. The commitment to develop non-gaming is the core of our investment and operating strategy for the past two decades, whether it be MICE, entertainment themed attractions or destination sales and marketing in overseas markets. We view the investment commitments by SCL and the rest of the industry is positive for Macao.  Over the past few weeks, travel restrictions have been lifted. It is too hard to tell the true measure of the underlying pace of recovery, but indications are extremely positive. We have seen significant improvement on property visitation, gaming volumes, retail sales and hotel occupancy.  We remain positive on investments in, The Londoner and Four Seasons. Our investments position us well as the market recovers. The quality of our new products will also help drive high-value tourism from the region, especially the overseas markets.  Turning to Singapore, our normalized EBITDA and gaming volumes are back now to the 2019 levels. Normalized EBITDA reached $386 million for the quarter. Rolling volumes are approaching 2019 level and mass win per day is now exceeding the level of 2019. We have also delivered strong performance in non-gaming across all segments, including retail, mall, hotel, F&B and MICE. Retail is especially noteworthy with a 26% increase in tenant sales per square foot versus 2019. Our [Indiscernible 0:03:45] casino renovation program is progressing. Renovated product will come online throughout the year. Looking ahead, Marina Bay Sands is poised for further growth as all of our markets recover and become free of travel restrictions and airline lift continues to recover.  Let's move to Q&A. So pessimistic, Joe. We're more than breakeven. A lot more than breakeven, doing just fine. I'll ask Patrick to give us some color on those issues, but I think we're past the breakeven. We're now in the positive territory moving towards very positive territory. Patrick? Yeah. Joe, I think we can be confident, be very honest and direct. We are in very positive territory and keep moving upside. I think the one thing I would say to you is that no one ever questions the power the base mass market. I would remind you I was looking at our numbers, base mass in Macao in our building costs about 1,500 Hong Kong per hand as an opening bet. So it's a couple of hundred bucks a hand USD. That's the base mass business. The problem we have right now is you can't get a seat in the games in our buildings. We're running 95%, 100% occupancy in those games. And the same applies to slot ETGs.  The big question everyone's thinking about obviously is premium mass. And I think you'll be pleasantly surprised when you can see the numbers coming out of the premium mass. And you'll see the liquidity, you'll see resilience in that segment. And it's been a very pleasant surprise. Grant, can you add some color to that? Yeah. I'll let Patrick -- you want address that? Joe, I think we're missing -- to Patrick's point, we're missing -- we're in a great place. We're back to 2000 -- we're back to 1.6 run rate if you take out the abnormal low hold on the rolling. But the two drivers that we just thought -- there's a lot of drivers, but the two jump off the page or renewed tours throughout Asia and China in particular. That's yet to come. We haven't -- we're doing all this -- we're in 2019 with no China participation and or limited China participation.  And as Patrick mentioned, a handicap physical plan, we are in a very, very fortunate position with MBS. I think it's going to become a property, a lot of growth. And I believe it's going to be a $2 billion business in the future. And I see nothing holding it back, except for our own renovations, which are extraordinary. I hope you get a chance to see it. And the reemergence of Asian tourism, including China back into the property.  The only regret we have is Singapore. We just like to have more capacity because -- you'll see -- I think you'll see in this year the power of -- the earning power of MBS. It's an extraordinary product, and we're lucky to have it. I think it's a combination of factors, Joe. I think, obviously, the China market is always powerful. But I also think there's cost issues in all these markets. There's this inflationary factors, undeniable, be it energy, wages -- I mean, there's a different world out there, and you've got to cope with it. But the thing about MBS that fascinates us is we believe we can drive revenues across the board. We're going to rethink our retail, rethink our table mix, our floor, our room pricing. We think we have a product that the demand will be close to insatiable for it, from the gamer and non-gamer perspective. And we're going to overcome margin cost -- margin by overcoming costs with higher revenues, a lot higher revenues across the board in every segment. That's the approach. We see MBS as a very unique product that's unrivaled in that part of the world. And we can just push pricing across the board, gaming pricing, ADR pricing, retail pricing, F&B pricing, it's just that good and that desirable. And let's face it, the market right now is using our favor. Singapore is very desirable from a lot of perspectives. MBS, that's a good question. I think it's too early to say we're going to see that. I see us as getting plenty of trying of participation, both in Macao and Singapore. But it's really too early to say. It just happened so quickly and the turnabout was so rapid that I think it's too hard to predict. I think the way this is going to segment though is that we're going to get more than our fair share of the rolling business in MBS. That moves in that direction, and we'll get the premium mass customer to visit more into Macao.  I think our business really is going to split in that direction. I think it's very predictable what's going to happen here, and we're okay with that. So Singapore will get the top of the top. But each of those places will get tons of premium mass demand from China and throughout the region. I also think people underestimate how powerful Macao can become as a desirable visitation place throughout China. It's got everything. It's got the rooms, it's got the access, it's got the -- one thing, it has beyond Singapore, it's has lots of capacity and lots to offer. So I think Macao is going to be a very strong international destinations ahead. We plan to be very aggressive trying to push people into Macao to see the property, all of our products. No, I think it's just a visitation issue. It's not a whole issue. It's visitations sure. I think you're going to find that washes out. I wouldn't take those numbers too much to heart. I think when you look at Q1, I wish when you see January, when those numbers are out there for the market, I think it will all wash away quite nicely. It won't be -- it won't enter into your thinking, Carlo. It's a nonevent. I think you'll see a surprising strength in both those segments.  I would say in Macao, we're going to be very strong, very represented in the base mass because we have the capacity. We're a scale player. And so we have the capacity in the gaming, non-gaming, retail, restaurant space to do extraordinary things in the base mass. And again, as I'll reiterate, base mass in Macao is a different animal than the U.S. It's a $200 base bet, $175 base bet. So pretty special customer. We are going to represent because of our scale.  But on the other hand, with all of our suite product, et cetera, I think we'll also be the leaders in the premium mass business. So we have a very strong future ahead of us in Macao. I always chuckle, people, if you're looking for a negative commentary in the Macao market, you're in the rolling earnings call. We would, but we won't. We could share it, we just won't. No, we're not going to do that. But Carlo, thank you. It's good to hear from you. Pretty clear, Stephen. Go ahead. Yeah. And I've got a perfect answer to that. Mr. Chum? Steve, to Grant's comment just, again, we don't want to confuse visitation with GGR. There's not necessarily an easy way to make them work. I was recently in Singapore, I walked in one of our retail stores with our retail person and she told me the sales in the store were like $70 million. And I said there's nobody here, no one in the store. And she said, Rob, we only need the right people, not a lot of people. I think that's what's happening in Macao, we gained the right people showing up in mass, and it's reflecting in the numbers. You'll see that when the market numbers come out.  I think the early adapters to the market are the right people for the market. And I think that's why there's a confusion in the visitation versus the actual revenues. Grant, margins? Thanks, Stephen. I would assume it is, but I'll defer to Grant since he's on the ground. I can't imagine we have any visibility into that at this point. But clearly, we have a new market here, which favors our asset base. And our approach for the last 20 years has been scale. As you well know, Robin, it's a mass story with premium mass and retail commencing, et cetera. So we don't have things like -- it's tailor made for what we do, this environment. Our competitors will adapt and have to change. But I don't know. Grant, any color on that? Great. Thank you for that color. And then just for my follow-up question on Macao. Can you give us sort of a rough sense of that dollar commitment that you've made to invest over the next 10 years in Macao? Kind of roughly what percent of that might be new projects and what percent might be -- might kind of fall into the OpEx line, kind of like overseas marketing and things? Just kind of CapEx versus OpEx split, just ballpark? Thanks. I'd begin by saying, first of all, we're just thrilled to be open and making money and seeing demand like we're seeing. I don't think any of us have the aptitude or the insight to tell you what's going to happen -- they have post-change news.  But I do think longer term, you have to have real strong confidence. And you see -- when you get to see these numbers that we are seeing that this is a market that's going to rebound. This market has a strong base mass, premium mass. And some of the fears be in the market about, it was liquidity like, what's resiliency, I think those fears will be pushed to the side.  What's the trajectory and how fast it happens? I don't think any of us have the gumption to make venture a guess. I think it would be silly. We just feel fortunate we're open. We're operating. We think it keeps getting better, not worse. I don't believe COVID is going to be -- obviously, China has gone through a different trajectory than we did here in the U.S.  But hopefully, that won't be a problem. Again, I don't want to speak anything that I can't speak for. But if things keep going like they're going, we'll all be in a very happy place in 2023, especially, I think, somewhere in the second half of the year. As normal travel patterns resume, Hong Kong gets back on speed, Mainland China. I think there's a lot of growth potential and a lot of good thoughts coming our way vis-a-vis the future. We are -- again, as I said earlier, we're not going to tell you that we don't believe in this -- we believe in this strongly very strongly. We believe in our assets very strongly. We believe in international tourism in Macao very strongly.  So we're not going to predict when it happens, how it happens, how fast it happens. But we feel very positive about what's going to happen in Macao in the long term, very positive. And we're looking to investing money in there and getting back to where we were in the past in Macao. We couldn't be more positive on the can long term. Chad, let's revert your mind, I'll reverse it just. I think we all know that Thailand has been discussions there, and we're certainly looking at Thailand. And that's no secret has been in the press that Thailand is a possibility. So we're certainly looking hard at Thailand. I would love to be -- have a presence there in the future. Japan, as you referenced, is not there. And Korea is nothing viable to speak of today. So we'll jump to New York, which is an extraordinary and unique opportunity. And I think for the winning bidder or bidders, it's going to be an amazing opportunity because of a very simple dynamic of a huge market with limited capacity. There's only a few casinos there. It's probably the only place in the U.S. where you can have millions and millions of people, and yet there'll be probably just a handful of casinos total. The win per units there will be exceptional.  The lucky winner is going to do very, very well. I think the evidence of the market is clear just by looking at the three operating properties under the table games. And we really don't have much of a -- it's not a great product right now in New York as far as room capacity. It's still doing approaching USD 2 billion with just slot machines.  So our approach is very much in LVS, it's anchored by an LDH historical approach, which is scale and quality. We're not looking to build a casino, looking to build not a regional casino but rather a truly large hotel with spa convention space, dozens of restaurants, a new theater, a huge entertainment feature, a transformational product, which will positively impact the community and grow tourism a powerful statement. We're not looking to be in this thing in a limited way. We'll be all the way in. And we think if we do it, it will be transformational for the county we're working in, very good for the people in the county and something they can be very proud of. And it will drive tourism -- outsized tourism into Nassau. Our bid is very much traditional on the thinking of LVS large-scale with numerous non-gaming assets, lots of meeting space, probably 400,000 square per foot new space.  So I view New York very much very unique to the rest of the United States. It's not -- it's a population in the many millions to just a couple of casinos, very different here in Las Vegas. We've got a huge local market but dozens and dozens and dozens of casinos. There you'll be basically alone. And so it's going to be very -- it's an exceptional opportunity. It won't come along again. I think this is one and done. So we're trying very hard. And we've been trying to do New York for a number of years, but it looks like this is finally someone's opportunity. Hopefully, it's ours. Grant? Yeah. It's part of the -- to Patrick's point, think about what Singapore is market GGR versus Macao, Macao could be a $25 billion, $30 billion GGR market has been higher historically. And Singapore just doesn't have the capacity. And then Las Vegas is much more of a -- it's got a gaming component, it's got a very strong non-gaming. So it's almost impossible to apples-to-apples. The driving force is the scale of people in Macao in Singapore -- in Mainland China, the accessibility to adjustable market is so huge in Macao. And so the product offering. To Grant's point, the Peninsula, versus the Cotai, it's got such enormous capacity and great product. It's hard to -- that market is so outsized when it just back at full capacity, it's hard to compare than anything. It's so powerful. Yeah, we sure do. We forget, we -- you're talking to a bunch of people have been doing business in the count for 20 years, and we've seen the returns. We've seen what non-gaming can do. Our theaters, our retail, our entertainment has driven billions and billions and billions of dollars of EBITDA, and they will in the future as well. We have no concerns whatsoever about investing and getting a solid return on non-gaming commitments. All they do is drive more visitation to the market. They are additives to the market, certainly going to drive more business right now.  We look at this as a 10-year starting commitment and going beyond that. Our commitment to Macao is as long as we can be there. And so we have no hesitation to invest or show the market a very, very considerable return. Just look we've done in the past. I mean, on our current assets, mostly non-gaming. The lion's share of our investment in Macao is non-gaming, the great majority. It's worked out pretty well for us. So we think next 10 years, we'll continue that trend, and we're very happy and very committed to Macao. Sure. Thank you. Brief commercial from Macao. Yes. Yes. Yes. They're spending in retail, they're spending in gambling, they're spending, as we may have referenced so Steve, it's just the right customers showing up. And I think this is historically how it's worked out in the recoveries where those who are the most aggressive gamers and retail spenders show up first. And we're seeing that strongly in Macao. It's a very good audience, a very strong audience. You'll see the market numbers then come out.  It's really gratifying for those of us who wait along terrible three years to see these days return, and they returned. And I think the real question is these customers that are now the question is, how many more are coming behind them? Because to your point, visitation has been mediocre out of Mainland China, relative to what had been previously. We're not even there. We're getting some pretty big numbers coming out of Macao in the market.  So we're very enthused about it. I don't think -- it's not necessarily choosing gaming or retail, I think they're doing both, and then they're eating and shopping and funding everything. So -- it's very typical of these recovery situations where the people who wanted most to shop there and they're buying their spending enjoying life again. I think the Chinese are no different to the Americans who came to the U.S. markets and enjoy themselves. And hopefully, a party continues is just getting started, and we've got a very encouraging start to this reopening after the last three years.  Grant, do you want add some color to that, any issues you can raise that I haven't? I think that last comment of Grant's, that's a great one, in that this is on the air dependent market like Singapore. You'll need the airlines. You can come other ways, access to Macao is mostly vehicular or both. So I think it's a huge advantage for Macao that as the population conquers, the virus situation gets more confident, there's nothing to -- no impediments to massive growth in visitation coming to Macao from China. That's a very positive point.  But Steve, look, we just -- we are pleased we're seeing and they're spending in every direction. So we very -- we feel very fortunate. Hopefully, it just continues to ramp up from here. Thank you, as always. We're not going to discuss EBITDA at this point, except for what you've seen in Singapore. I do think energy is a vast thing. It does vastly. It doesn't go one way, as you well know, whereas wages, I think, worldwide are going to be an issue for everybody. And I think we'll deal with that. They're not -- I don't see them coming down a whole lot. Again, our resorts and our capacity constrained ability to price up -- the rating at our business is you can price up and retain your margins. That, I think, will be our strategy in Singapore and also in Macao. I don't think wages are going to decline greatly. I think Grant alluded to efficiencies, and then that's important. We have a large workforce, in the tens of thousands, in Macao. So more efficient and better doing what we do, that should be helpful. But I think we're all going to live with at this point in the U.S. and Asia, higher wages appear to be in the structure for now. Patrick? Yeah, the current thought in our heads is about $4 billion to $5 billion. Again, this is not a regional casino. This is a full-blown resort. With MICE, entertainment, retail, restaurants, it's the real thing. It's not meant to be a small time investment. We're going all the way in and building something transformational that drives tourism. And we think will be the biggest, in terms of the casino business will be the biggest revenue generator. Thank you, appreciated."

            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yeah. Good morning and good afternoon. Yeah, I think the key thing we're seeing right now is that the quality of patronage is very high across all segments. So it's not just premium mass, it's also the base mass, it's in the retail segment. So we are seeing a very strong recovery in spend per customer. And again, that's not concentrated in any one segment. It's extremely broad based. And I think what you're seeing in the public numbers on presentation were recovered.  I think for CNY against 2019, we're about 40% of where we were in 2019, Chinese New Year for the first three days. And we're seeing revenues and volumes outperforming that visitation recovery, which is natural, which is what we've seen in other markets. So things are looking extremely positive right now. Yes, you can see from the visitation numbers been published by the Tourism Bureau. The Mainland Chinese visitation is at about 30% recovery rate versus 2019 CNY. So obviously, with a 40% recovery for overall visitations, Hong Kong visitation recovery has been higher. Mainly, I think, as a result of just the ease with which they've been able to go. And obviously, Hong Kong has had a longer stabilized situation with, as it relates to the pandemic. So I think from a pure visitation point of view, it's just not unexpected. And bear in mind, the transportation support for the Hong Kong visitor only really opened up on the eighth of January. So this has been a very rapid increase in Hong Kong visitations. That said, I think we referenced back to the comments that Rob made earlier and I alluded to as well, I wouldn't get too stuck on the visitation recovery. I think in these types of reopening, we're going to see the premium customers come back first. The core customer coming back as a much bigger percentage than the overall visitation.  So I think what we're seeing is the quality of revenues and the patronage from all regions that visit in Chinese New Year has been very, very high. So we are way outperforming the visitation recovery in terms of volumes and revenue. And indeed, I think if you look at our property visitations our recovery rate in visitations to our own property, is far outperforming the recovery in the overall visitation numbers in the market versus 2019. Yeah. I think first of all, our cost structure is in good shape. It's been -- unfortunately, we've had to spend extra effort in optimizing the cost structure over the past two or three years. So we've got a very lean cost base right now.  In terms of gross margins on the revenue, I think a couple of things. One is our mix, obviously, is more favorable going forward just from a gross margin mix perspective simply because a vast majority of our revenues will be coming from the non-rolling and slot segments. And then secondly, the non-gaming, we expect to be growing, and that's obviously a much higher margin. We expect to be growing retail, hotel, F&B, actually all the non-gaming segments. So that's the structural framework for the margin. But obviously, the actual flow-through in the percentage margin we ultimately deliver from this very positive structure is really dependent on the rate of volume recovery. So we still need the top line to recover to a certain level before you get the flow through. And then to go beyond that, obviously, we hope and we all are working towards that, is for this market to continue to grow and, hopefully, at least in the mass segments and non-gaming segments glad to go beyond where we were in 2019. So if that happens, obviously, our margin structure should be very positive. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we think about the structure of margins going forward. Yeah. I think, Robin, the competition for premium mass has always been very intense. And I think we'll continue to be, given the dynamics you just referenced. At the same time, I think as Rob says, we've got a footprint and scale advantage on our [Indiscernible 0:24:40] non-gaming asset facilities, I think really position us very well for all segments of mass. And then as Patrick referenced at the outset, the product that we've been developing for the last three years, especially, The London and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons, are really prime position to help us be more competitive the premium lifestyle segments up in market as well as, I think, hopefully, to drive overall high-value tourism to Macao over the coming years. And I do as to point about international tourism as well. I think our footprint to combine with our new products and our traditional strength in MICE, in international marketing network really position us very well to bring those high-value guests to Macao as well. I think, Shaun, we've also become more productive and efficient through the past couple of years. So I think we'll have to rethink -- it wouldn't necessarily be referencing exactly back to 2019. And also a mix of product has also changed quite a bit through the Londoner. We do have more high-quality non-gaming asset base to operate as well.  So to give you a bit more color, today, we are short of manpower relative to full operating capacity and relative to the demand that we're seeing. So we're not operating one of the Sheraton Towers as we speak. So we are minus 2,200 rooms from our operating capacity. And our newest hotel Londoner Court, which we soft opened in the past year, we're not at the full operating capacity for that high end all-suite hotel. We're still only about two thirds of the way through in terms of ability of manpower to operate the whole hotel. So both at the top end and at the mass end, we are still short of manpower to operate at full capacity. And we'll be progressively hiring to fill the gaps as we go through the recovery. And hopefully, within the next few months, we're going to be in a better place relative to our full operating potential because we clearly see the demand pattern, I think is going to urge the whole industry to staff up and to be able to operate, especially for these peak periods. And that's another part. We have no crystal ball as Rob says served on the post CNY. But clearly, the early indications of metrics like the demand for the hotels is telling you that, yes, the demand is staging a strong recovery.  And obviously, we're going to have to [Indiscernible 0:32:50]. Thanks. Sure. Rob, should I take that? Yes. I think I haven't seen any data on the split between Cotai and Peninsula. However, it stands to reason, I think, structurally, we see -- and we have always said that Cotai will become the primary hub. And I think even pre-COVID, we were already more than half of the mass revenues from Cotai. And I think that trend will continue.  I think there's a lot of different reasons. But I think at its heart, the main reason is just the cluster of world class integrated resorts that you have on Cotai. And what this, I think, next generation of these lifestyle consumers are looking for from Macao as a destination, and all of the investments in non-gaming that are going into basically making these results even more desirable over the next 10 years, all of those structural factors are surely will continue to push the balance of revenues towards the Cotai side, and that's a structural issue that will continue to evolve over the long time. As regards to -- we obviously have one asset on the Peninsula, we do intend to reinvest in that asset. But it clearly the majority -- the vast majority of our capital will still be going towards our Cotai properties. No, I think it's just as you said. The nature of these reopenings, it will attract the high-quality customers first, and that's what we're seeing. And I think we saw that in Singapore in April as well. We had much stronger recovery in the Southeast Asian overseas spend in Singapore versus the recovery in the tourist arrivals. And I think Macao has also following something similar, except for the fact Macao has a much bigger advantage in being able to support visitation, not just by international airlift, regional airlift, but also by land and sea as well and domestic airlift then connecting through the Southern China as well.  So I think it's -- let's see how -- what the pace of visitation recoveries like versus the revenue recovery. But so far, I think the pattern that we've seen in CNY does support that pattern. Yes, you're getting a much stronger revenue. I think you are in visitation. Thanks, Patrick. Not a lot to add. I mean, all of our rolling business currently is in the premium direct program. And I think the second point is premium mass is doing recovering much, much faster than premium direct. I think that's what we're seeing right now."

A few brief comments and we'll move to Q&A. The recovery of Marina Bay Sands continued during the quarter with property EBITDA reaching US$343 million. Relaxation of virus-related restrictions in Singapore and many of the source markets, coupled with the improvements in airlift, have enabled this performance and financial -- this improvement in financial performance. We expect a robust recovery over time as further relaxation measures in the region are implemented and additional airlift in Singapore comes online. Our $1 billion capital investment program currently underway at Marina Bay Sands has introduced exceptional new suite product in premium segment-focused amenities of the resort. The response to these initial offerings has been strong. Additional offerings, including spacious new suite products, will be introduced throughout the remainder of this year and 2023. We look forward to substantially increasing our investment in the Singapore market as we execute our expansion plans at MBS in the years ahead. Turning to Macao, the operating environment remains difficult. Importantly though, tourism with restrictions have been relaxed to customer demand and spending in Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both gaming and retail perspective. We appreciate the opportunity to submit our tender proposal for one of the six gaming concessions in Macao in September. We are now in the consultation phase of the tender program. And as such, we won't be able to comment much further on the process at this time. We are big believers in Macao as a world center of tourism and leisure. We have been the biggest investor and operated non-gaming businesses over the past two decades in Macao. We absolutely welcome the opportunity to invest even more in the non-gaming products and offerings in Macao. We have great confidence in Macao's tourism recovery and its long-term growth prospects as we do most of our -- we'll do our utmost to support Macao's economic diversification and its evolution as Asia's leading destination for MICE and leisure visitors. We consider our existing portfolio of resorts in Asia to be an ideal platform for growth in the years ahead. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities to develop new large-scale land-based destination resorts in both the U.S. and Asia.  We thank you for listening today, and I'll turn to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.\nJoseph Greff : Yes, Rob, Marina Bay Sands, you're run rating close to $1.4 billion in annualized EBITDA. And as you referenced in the investor slide presentation, without any contribution from a geography, namely China, given what you're seeing with improved easing regional visitation volume in, say, other non-China geographies, do you think you can get to 2019 EBITDA levels at some point in the next year or so without direct contribution from China?\nRob Goldstein: Joe, we think Singapore is in a very unique place. I think we easily achieved 2019 levels. And as you referenced, we have three great impediments right now. We have -- obviously, tourism to China is very limited. We also are running about 55% visitation into Singapore from the rest of Asia, which means -- and that may seem odd to reference that because you think, well, we're running at the high levels of occupancy. But keep in mind that, that residual tourist that comes in does not sleep at the MBS property, gambles there, shops there, eats there. So we're getting hurt, I think, on the table business by not having all the hotels in Singapore operating at full level. It's a big business for us because MBS is the first protocol from those visitors, whether they're sleeping there or not, they go there. That hurts our business. And despite that, we're achieving $700 win per units on the slots and huge retail numbers, but the upside is material. Third impediment is our sleeping rooms. We had about 400 or 500 units down right now. I think Singapore, it's just beginning. I always joke with the guys here, the party is just starting in Singapore. The truth is that Singapore is going to grow and for a couple of reasons. One is the destination is getting more powerful than ever. Our building is getting better than ever. And I think when you see a rebound from China and the rest of Asia, one, six looks very small in terms of our ability to grow with much larger than that. I think we can keep going to $2 billion the next couple of years if we get it right in the market for recovers. So as much as we like the numbers currently, we think there's much better days ahead for Singapore. That market and that destination has grown quite a bit in terms of the Asian tourism world. And I think our numbers will reflect that years ahead.\nJoseph Greff : Great. And then switching over to Macao, I'm not going to sort of waste, I guess, my bullet of the question on concessionaire terms and other things I'd love to ask about. But maybe can you just remind us what your expectation or what your conversations during the consultation process, what the timetable is for the license renewals to be finalized? When would you expect to hear from the government and then the government's end result to be publicly communicated? And that's all for me.\nRob Goldstein : We woke our colleagues up in Asia in a deep sleep to participate. I'll let them answer that question. Gentleman, Grant and Wilfred, both online correct?\nDaniel Briggs: Correct.\nRob Goldstein : Are you awake, guys?\nWilfred Wong : Yes, we're up.\nGrant Chum : Yes.\nRob Goldstein : Answer away. Do you need the question?\nWilfred Wong : Well, we've been working with the government closely. And a couple of rounds of discussion has been held. We are waiting for the government notification, whether there will be another next round of discussion. And the timetable remains the same. Everything is in good progress, and we expect some notification towards the end of the month for us to know what's the next step.\nRob Goldstein : Grant, do you have anything to add, any additional commentary, Grant?\nGrant Chum: No, I think that's right. And we obviously welcome the smooth progress in the process. And we still do expect the entire process to complete by the end of the year, as previously stated by the government.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. .\nCarlo Santarelli : Obviously, Rob or whoever wants to take this, you guys had a significant boost in kind of hotel revenue out of Singapore and namely in ADR. Any color you guys could provide? I mean, I know strategically, you're looking to put the best customers in that building right now from a gaming perspective. And obviously, that's showing up in the numbers, both on the VIP segment roll and mass segment roll. Anything you could provide as to kind of how the mix has changed at that property? I assume some of that ADR is just kind of casino comp room and that's kind of what's making that sound so significant?\nRob Goldstein : I think, Carlo, one of the most significant things is what's not there. We're running like 96%. You see on Page 14, the reference page, ADR $515. I think, again, we're just beginning. We only have half the recovery in terms of -- China is not there, most of Asia is not there. Our point is, the mix gets better and better because demand gets higher and higher. Our problem there's going to be enough rooms to service all the demand FIT casino.  And I think we pointed two great variables: one being retail, which is that mall just keeps getting better and will keep getting better. And then our win per unit on the slot side looks strong. But I think the refocus on Singapore as a destination market, as a market in great ascent illustrates what the upside could be in the -- on the tables, the non-rolling tables. Rolling tables will probably get the whole new level, but demand for the non-rolling tables is what I'm waiting for recovery. And that's where you see China and the rest of Asia full lift comes back. So right now, we're just faced with -- the sad reality is we like to have a lot more rooms in Singapore because that $515 is a real number, it could be a lot higher as demand keeps lifting. We can sell hotel resolve there longer at top dollar rates from the FIT side. We have great demand, much better than pre-pandemic demand from the rolling side. So again, the 343 is a very nice number, a good print in lieu of what's happening in that market.  But I think the best phase of Singapore next couple of years as we keep growing -- and you're going to see our refocus on our mix in the retail segment. Our room mix, we're going to continue to focus. I mean the right room mix, top-tier rooms, the right food and beverage product, we've got to work harder because Singapore as a destination is growing measurably. We want to be a part of that. So we're just in a very good place in Singapore. I think looking back, we always thought one, six was a very nice number. Hopefully, obviously a small number in the future.\nCarlo Santarelli : Great. That's helpful. And then if I could, as you guys have talked about in the past and the thoughts on development, clearly, the New York process is kind of underway. Could you perhaps maybe share a little bit of your thinking around your approach and perhaps how you're thinking about the broader process timeline in general for New York?\nRob Goldstein : Waiting for a Governor Hochul\u2019s advice to how that's going to process will begin. As you know, we've always been focused on the market for many years. We have a bid we're putting it right now. We have property we're put together right now. Very bullish on New York as a market. Tough because one really, I think, one available license at the end of the day, I think it's been a very -- a dog fight. And hopefully, we have a bid that gets attention. But other than that, time table looks like January for the RFP. I think sometime in '23, maybe you see a decision. And we'll put our best foot forward, that's for sure. It would be a perfect market to be in with the density of population and ethnicity.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS.\nRobin Farley : Can you give us a sense of when -- what your expectation is for a more open border and whether there's still an expectation that November would see the package tour visas and electronic visas, is that something that you feel like is still moving forward and will still allow for increased visitation to start?\nRob Goldstein : I'm going to ask your former colleague, Mr. Chum, to answer that question, Robin.\nGrant Chum : Sorry, Robin, I couldn't quite hear the question. Can you repeat that?\nRobin Farley : It was just about your expectations around timing for the border to be a little more open in Macao and specifically anything on the changes that were planned by early November for visa applications to be electronic and packaged tour visa to restart?\nGrant Chum: Yes, sure. I mean I think, Robin, there has been a positive announcement on the relaxation with regards to two groups as well as the electronic Visa application in four provinces and also in Shanghai expected to commence end of the month or early November. And so that's obviously going to be a very positive signal for a gradual recovery in the visitation especially from these key provinces and municipality. And obviously, we welcome the development. Clearly, in the past few weeks and also months, it\u2019s still being relatively impacted by the COVID cases in different provinces as far as the non-Guangdong visitation is concerned. So what we're seeing right now in Macao is predominantly coming from the Guangdong province. But hopefully, as we get out further into the fourth quarter with these recent measures, we're going to start to see a more well-rounded mix of visitation building up towards the end of the year.\nRobin Farley : Okay. And then also for my other question on Singapore. I know you\u2019ve said that the deadline to start construction was extended to April 2023, and that's -- you had said that before this quarter. Just wondering if you have anything more definitive about when that would happen?\nPatrick Dumont: I think -- it's Patrick. I think the great news is, as Rob said in his opening remarks and the questions, our performance in Singapore is very strong. It's a privilege market and now tourism there is really remarkable given some of the constraints. The spending power of the consumer there is tremendous. We're really focused on high-value tourism and you're seeing the results of that in our results. And I think the Tower 2 in our [IR 2], in our mind, has just tremendous potential. We're very excited about it. But unfortunately, we don't have any update right now about the timing. So we're working on it. We're in process. And as we make a little bit more progress on our work there, we'll be able to disclose further about where we're headed. But as of right now, we're very optimistic about it. We're excited about the project. We think it really will speak to a very powerful part of the market. Now we don't have an update on timing.\nRobin Farley : Can I just ask one clarifying question on that? It had sounded previously like the timing of the budget and all of that was because of the pandemic and the disruption from that. If your business level has sort of fairly recovered, is that still the kind of uncertainty in the commencing construction? Or are there other factors that are more of a gating issue at this point?\nPatrick Dumont : It's really just process. I think there's a certain number of steps that we have to go through to be able to build. And so those processes were delayed because of the pandemic and because of some of the government agencies that we have to deal with being focused on very pressing matters. So now that they're able to reengage, we'll start that process again and begin on the path. And as we follow sort of the steps necessary, we'll be able to provide an update. But it's really just timing related to things necessary to begin. There's a lot of things that have to happen to make a building of this scale and complexity in the location that it's in, get all the approvals, go with the steps necessary to begin.\nRob Goldstein : And Robin, I would say, the process for us is a learning -- is an evolutionary process. We keep thinking how about this market differently as we learn more and see more. And so our thinking has changed, there's the size of on gaming capacity, who the customer is. Singapore is morphed from what it was five years ago to hold it in place now. And I think it's affected our thoughts on what we build and so forth and how good should it be and how powerful it should be. And I think it's slower we want to be, but it's been the end of a very, very important product.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo.\nDaniel Politzer : So just -- you guys are seeing a lot of strength in terms of the room product right now. You're doing the $1 billion project renovation on your room product and MBS. I mean how do we think about the return of that given this should be fully online next year? And do you think you can get to that typical kind of 20% return historically or maybe higher even in the absence of the Chinese consumer coming back?\nRob Goldstein : I think we need the Chinese consumer. We -- a couple of these to happen, let's be clear, we need to see China return at some point to achieve our goals. We also need to see the balance of Asia open up and come back at. Again, as I referenced earlier, the 55-or-so percent number, which is compared to 2019 isn't good, we need Singapore full on because our building, if you walk through there, when there's tens of thousands, hundreds of thousand people there, they're all staying there. There's the other hotels from the business. So these other hotels are very important to us.  So we need two things happen. Our innovation will complete in late '23. The balance of Singapore -- of Asian tourism into Singapore should be hopefully by Q2 complete. And that leaves the one barrier we can't answer as to China return. But when all that happens, do we think we can get you a very fat return? Oh, yes. I'd like to believe we can -- our goal is to get to $2 billion in Singapore. And we believe that's not difficult if the market returns in full.  So keep in mind that we went into Singapore with a very different mentality a decade plus ago. The evolution of Macao into a really the premier FIT gaming market probably right now in that region is MBS. And I think we're experiencing the beginning to return, but it's not nearly where it needs to get to for us to get to $500 million a quarter. But I think that -- we'll hopefully see that in the years ahead. So we feel very bullish.  And I can't think of a better place to invest our capital than Singapore and Macao, and Singapore has proven to be terrific opportunity. We put a lot of money in Macao. That will open up the fence and be a good opportunity. But right now, Singapore is very, very exciting for us. And yes, we're very confident the returns will be there.\nDaniel Politzer : Got it. And then just pivoting to Macao. Another one on the group tours and the e-visas being resumed. I mean can you maybe frame how big these components work for your business in 2019? And then secondarily, if we think about these parts of the business returning and coming back online, is there a path to Macao getting to positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter, assuming no major outbreaks? \nRob Goldstein : I'll ask Grant to reference that. But I think we should be careful. We don't -- it's very hard, as you know, right now, predictions of Macao had been erroneous the last couple of years because we don't know who's going to come and we don't know when they'll close the market. It's been stopping the start for so long. It's kind of silly for us to pontificate on exact gains in EBITDA. Could be EBITDA positive? Sure, these positive tomorrow if things open up and visitation returns. And that's going to happen at some point. But I think it's not -- it's difficult for us to tell you fourth quarter could be EBITDA positive without knowing what effect the visitors team will have in November and then also not knowing how zero COVID in force will happen. So there's certainly unknowns in Macao is very difficult to guess. Grant, Wilfred, any commentary?\nGrant Chum: Yes, Rob, I think Rob is right. I mean, the prediction of the future is tough. I think what we can say about the past is the group package tours represented roughly 1/4 of the visitation before the pandemic. With respect to electronic visas, we don't have those numbers. Obviously, it varies significantly from province-to-province. But clearly, the provision or availability of that node of application absolutely is helpful to facilitate the visa application for those relevant provinces.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley : Maybe just to stay on Singapore, my first question is just to ask a little bit about trying to triangulate a little bit more on sort of what you're seeing behaviorally. When we look at RevPAR, for instance, I think it's about 6% versus 2019. Is that a decent gauge of, let's call it, the consumer and the, let's call it, the spend per person or per head. Is it better than that? I'm just trying to kind of think about pent-up demand or what you're seeing on kind of a core visit-to-visit basis versus what we've seen in some of the Western markets because we don't have a great proxy in Asia yet about sort of how pent-up demand is going to play out and just trying to kind of see what you're seeing a little bit more.\nRob Goldstein : I'm going to ask Patrick to take that, but I want to say one thing, it's critical to understanding is that Singapore is much different. I think this is the obvious response to that. Singapore is much different than Las Vegas or U.S. regional because of the obvious that you got to fly to get there, so you had to take other countries opening up and it's like buying wine in Burgundy, a lot of different regions in Burgundy. Well, there's a lot of different regions in Asia that don't open, haven't opened, airlift is a problem. So we're really hampered. As nice as what 340 is for the quarter, I think you're not getting the full power. It's hard to differentiate versus other places. The truth is that Singapore remains really held back by no China or little China and the regional market there, depending on airlift. The difference, Macao will be -- when Macao opens up, it's like Las Vegas or regionals. You can come right in without airlift. You're not airlift-dependent. So I do think Singapore right now is in kind of unclear, uncertain environment. It's nicely making 1.4 billion, whatever the number annualizes. But we won't know the full power of this market. We see it in retail. We see it in local slot play is still strong. We see it in rolling volumes are strong because everyone is coming to Singapore, especially the F1. But I think what you're not seeing yet is unleash the full power of this destination and what's happening. Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont : It's a very interesting question. I think the key thing to note is that it's a data point for the quality of tourism coming into Singapore. And the high amount of consumption that's there when tourists visit, there are constraints and there were constraints from during the quarter. So as Rob mentioned at the beginning, you see from the deck, we had approximately 500 rooms out of inventory during the renovation, the rooms that are coming online are probably the best products we've ever had. We're very proud about that. We think we'll be able to trade up in terms of the quality of the tourism that we get out of those rooms once the completion is there. One thing to note is that we'll be done at the end of '23. So we're going to have a few more quarters of disruption as we take rooms out of inventory to complete the renovation process and rebate Sands. The other thing to note is that the airlift is not there. And some of the other hotels around the Singapore market do not have the full capacity because of labor constraints. So once these things are removed from the market that act as limiters, then you can get an idea of what the true potential would be in a run rate environment. But I would still call this a little bit of a recovery quarter. So we think there's more potential to run as we fix some of these things that are sort of limiting the way that we can earn. And to be fair, the market can earn.\nRob Goldstein : If you look at our sales in the retail mall on Page 31, it gives you some indication that we're running at $2,300, $2,400 a foot at Marina Bay Sands from the third quarter. I also think if you look at the rolling volumes as they start to kick in, I think those are great data points as you get quality coming. But again, it's early days. I think the recovery quarter is the right way of approaching it.\nShaun Kelley : Super helpful. And sort of want to go down the same path, transitioning over to Macao. And I'm not sure it's the exact right way to look at it. But here, you do this slide on Slide 12 where you kind of break down the mass win per visit, which I find to be very, very valuable. Just as we think about that level, and we saw the sort of pullback from what was probably a very premium mass driven business back over the -- like last eight quarters or so, the last two quarters? Have looked a lot like where you were back in kind of 2018, 2019. Is this the right -- which one of those two, either the sort of pent-up demand we saw over the last eight quarters or kind of these more recent numbers is a better guide for what we think normal activity might look like in Macao?\nRobert Goldstein : Grant, do you want to take that?\nGrant Chum: Yes, I'll take that, Rob. Yes, thanks for the question. I think it's interesting looking at that trend as you highlight for the past several quarters. I would say the difference that you highlighted with the previous two quarters versus the prior eight, it's really just a function of the regional mix. So into 2022, we've had a much more Guangdong bias mix, if you look at the visitation data, and that's mainly a result of the various COVID outbreak impact on the non-Guangdong source of visitation. So if you're looking at the period post-pandemic, that's clearly the differentiator. And then if you compare with pre-pandemic, then it's, of course, still very much premium mass coming back faster. And I think that broadly stands notwithstanding or up Asia adjusted for the regional provincial mix. I think that's still a valid point, and it's borne out by the data series. So obviously, premium mass comes back first and then the mass comes back later. But this year, definitely, there's an impact from the regional mix as well.\nShaun Kelley : Very helpful. Thank you.\nRob Goldstein : I think we all agree to underlying demand in Macao's going to be there once COVID resolved. And no difference happened probably in the U.S. and again, with our footprint there, our size, our scale, we know the base mass, premium mass is going to drive this thing. The only variable we don't know is the missing junket segment, how impactful will be. But we believe -- again, when that door does open, I think the pent-up demand is going to be extraordinary.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays.\nBrandt Montour : On Singapore, can you guys give us the room rate differential between the finished room product and the legacy room product at run rate?\nPatrick Dumont : I think the problem is the -- it's Patrick. I think the problem is there's so much noise in the comparison because what we would be giving you is 2019, and this is not a fully open market yet. What we'd like to believe is after the quality of the renovation to be fair, we were taking keys out of inventory to create larger suite product. The level of design, we have a new service model. We've changed out a lot of the team there in order to improve our service delivery. There's a lot of things that are going to be different. So I don't want to quote you a number until we get to the run rate. But the key takeaway is that we're very focused on high-value tourism. We're investing in room product, we're investing in personnel and training and in service delivery and in food and beverage and other amenities in the property to ensure that we can sort of capture that high-value tourist. And that's really what you'll see over time.\nRob Goldstein : I think one thing you just have to do, you want to understand this thing is you will have pictures listen to us, but jump on a plane some day and go see it. The product we're building there is unlike any haven't been done in Singapore, it is our spirit to what we've done the best in our competitors. And so I think when people -- our response has been across the board perfect in terms of be able to view this product. I think the impact is going to be much higher than we understand because you build something that good, people respond to it. I would encourage anybody who's in that part of the world to spend a day at Marina Bay Sands and we'll show you what we're doing is pretty impressive.\nBrandt Montour : Great. That's helpful. And then as you -- again, on Singapore, one of the narratives on the early days of the reopening in that market was that Singapore was gaining share of groups and convention business from Hong Kong. As you talk to your meeting planners and bookers and they're looking out six, 12 months, 18 months. Is there a sense that with Hong Kong starting to reopen that, that market is sort of trying to regain some of that share? Or is that market too uncertain? And the momentum is being maintained for Singapore in that business?\nPatrick Dumont : So Singapore is open for business. And so that means a return of leisure tourism, which we're benefiting from directly and the return of business tourism, which we're seeing in a strong way. I don't think we can draw a comparison with Hong Kong because access is different. So I think the way to look at it now is Singapore has always been a very strong MICE market. And I think it will continue to be so because of the investment, the high-quality tourism assets it's important as a financial center. We intend to invest behind this thesis. And so we think it's generally a very strong place to do business tourism. In terms of Hong Kong, I don't think we're at run rate yet to really understand sort of what that means. There's still COVID restrictions. There's still other restrictions in operation. So until those return to a more normal time, I think it's going to be hard to have any view at all.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley.\nStephen Grambling : You mentioned the trade-up and quality of the new rooms in Singapore. Can you just remind us of the cadence of rooms coming out and coming in over the next couple of quarters? And also talk to the net impact from these actions split across any uplift from renovated rooms versus the older rooms and maybe even tying in headwinds from those closed?\nPatrick Dumont : So we're going to have, let's call it, anywhere from 300 to 500 keys out of circulation across the next five quarters. And then the room renovation will wrap up and the tower will be fully -- the 2 towers will be fully ready by Chinese New Year '24. And actually by the end of '23. So that's sort of the cycle. So we're going to have we're going to have not our full potential of room delivery during the next five quarters.\nStephen Grambling : Are you currently delineating between the new rooms in terms of pricing in the old rooms?\nPatrick Dumont : There is some variability there, yes, but it also depends on which room within the segment so that we have certain suites that are out, certain rooms that are in, depends on the time. Yes, there is some differentiation. So there is a blend there.\nStephen Grambling : Got it. And then maybe turning to Macao. The market share there in mass has been quite volatile. How would you frame how your market share may evolve in a market recovery as different segments return, as you've described in a bit of a cadence premium mass and then mass?\nRob Goldstein : Grant, do you want to have that?\nGrant Chum: Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, I think it is volatile right now because the volumes are so thin. So I'm not sure looking at this quarter or even the prior quarters is particularly meaningful at this point. But I think going forward, I think as Rob referenced, we expect a strong comeback of both premium mass and mass. And I think in those segments, we're going to perform very well. Obviously, there's a past history there. But also, I think looking forward, we are coming off these fantastic product investments that we've made during the pandemic with the $2.2 billion investment program that we've implemented and now coming out on the other side pretty much completing with the London arena being the last component. So with the Londoner and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons, we feel very strongly that we're going to perform very well in the market share front. Across all of these segments, not just because of the suites, speaking to the premium mass segment, but also for the mass segment, I think we'll end up with these three wonderful iconic destinations to follow on from The Venetian and The Parisian and now with the Londoner Macao, which is already starting to gain so much traction with the people who have been able to visit and also locally as well.\nOperator: And the last question is coming in from David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz : If you could just talk a little bit about what you may have learned past quarter or so about the mix of revenue in recovery in Macao, what should we expect? And what role does sort of VIP play in all of this? And I know obviously, premium mass is the focus. But help us break down the different streams, if you can.\nRob Goldstein : Mr. Chum, are you still awake?\nGrant Chum : Yes, still going. Yes. I think as I referenced earlier, I think there is a mix between the business segment -- the matrix between the business segment as well as the regional breakdown. So I think if you're just looking at the business segment, then clearly, VIP right now is -- has very low levels of volume, especially versus premium mass and even mass. But part of this impact in 2022 is also the regional composition of the business where we're obviously very Guangdong-dependent right now and have been for most part of this year. But I think going forward, it should be like how we've been seeing, which is the premium as we'll come back first and more strongly and then followed by the mass. And this is also true if you look at the retail numbers, what we've seen is 2021 very, very significant performance in the luxury retail segment. And of course, 2022, less so. But again, it's really impacted by that regional difference. And then going forward, yes, similar trends, we expect the luxury retail to come back first and the fastest and then you follow through with the mass retail.\nOperator: Looks like we lost David. We did have another question come in, from Ben Chaiken from Credit Suisse.\nBenjamin Chaiken : Just kind of want to level set as we close the year. I think we mentioned tour groups and e-visas for a few provinces in Shanghai, either at the end of this month or early November. Is it possible that Macao could have breakeven or positive EBITDA as we go into the end of fourth quarter? Or do you think that's out of the realm of expectations?\nPatrick Dumont : Yes. I think the difficulty is, we don't know. We've been in these conditions for 2.5 years. We're very hopeful. We're going to continue to invest in Macao. We feel very strongly about Macao's future and the opportunities that exist there for leisure and business tourism but we just don't know. So as of right now, we're just waiting patiently, and we're going through the process, and we're looking forward to the opportunity for the upcoming concession.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "I think -- it's Patrick. I think the great news is, as Rob said in his opening remarks and the questions, our performance in Singapore is very strong. It's a privilege market and now tourism there is really remarkable given some of the constraints. The spending power of the consumer there is tremendous. We're really focused on high-value tourism and you're seeing the results of that in our results. And I think the Tower 2 in our [IR 2], in our mind, has just tremendous potential. We're very excited about it. But unfortunately, we don't have any update right now about the timing. So we're working on it. We're in process. And as we make a little bit more progress on our work there, we'll be able to disclose further about where we're headed. But as of right now, we're very optimistic about it. We're excited about the project. We think it really will speak to a very powerful part of the market. Now we don't have an update on timing. It's really just process. I think there's a certain number of steps that we have to go through to be able to build. And so those processes were delayed because of the pandemic and because of some of the government agencies that we have to deal with being focused on very pressing matters. So now that they're able to reengage, we'll start that process again and begin on the path. And as we follow sort of the steps necessary, we'll be able to provide an update. But it's really just timing related to things necessary to begin. There's a lot of things that have to happen to make a building of this scale and complexity in the location that it's in, get all the approvals, go with the steps necessary to begin. It's a very interesting question. I think the key thing to note is that it's a data point for the quality of tourism coming into Singapore. And the high amount of consumption that's there when tourists visit, there are constraints and there were constraints from during the quarter. So as Rob mentioned at the beginning, you see from the deck, we had approximately 500 rooms out of inventory during the renovation, the rooms that are coming online are probably the best products we've ever had. We're very proud about that. We think we'll be able to trade up in terms of the quality of the tourism that we get out of those rooms once the completion is there. One thing to note is that we'll be done at the end of '23. So we're going to have a few more quarters of disruption as we take rooms out of inventory to complete the renovation process and rebate Sands. The other thing to note is that the airlift is not there. And some of the other hotels around the Singapore market do not have the full capacity because of labor constraints. So once these things are removed from the market that act as limiters, then you can get an idea of what the true potential would be in a run rate environment. But I would still call this a little bit of a recovery quarter. So we think there's more potential to run as we fix some of these things that are sort of limiting the way that we can earn. And to be fair, the market can earn. I think the problem is the -- it's Patrick. I think the problem is there's so much noise in the comparison because what we would be giving you is 2019, and this is not a fully open market yet. What we'd like to believe is after the quality of the renovation to be fair, we were taking keys out of inventory to create larger suite product. The level of design, we have a new service model. We've changed out a lot of the team there in order to improve our service delivery. There's a lot of things that are going to be different. So I don't want to quote you a number until we get to the run rate. But the key takeaway is that we're very focused on high-value tourism. We're investing in room product, we're investing in personnel and training and in service delivery and in food and beverage and other amenities in the property to ensure that we can sort of capture that high-value tourist. And that's really what you'll see over time. So Singapore is open for business. And so that means a return of leisure tourism, which we're benefiting from directly and the return of business tourism, which we're seeing in a strong way. I don't think we can draw a comparison with Hong Kong because access is different. So I think the way to look at it now is Singapore has always been a very strong MICE market. And I think it will continue to be so because of the investment, the high-quality tourism assets it's important as a financial center. We intend to invest behind this thesis. And so we think it's generally a very strong place to do business tourism. In terms of Hong Kong, I don't think we're at run rate yet to really understand sort of what that means. There's still COVID restrictions. There's still other restrictions in operation. So until those return to a more normal time, I think it's going to be hard to have any view at all. So we're going to have, let's call it, anywhere from 300 to 500 keys out of circulation across the next five quarters. And then the room renovation will wrap up and the tower will be fully -- the 2 towers will be fully ready by Chinese New Year '24. And actually by the end of '23. So that's sort of the cycle. So we're going to have we're going to have not our full potential of room delivery during the next five quarters. There is some variability there, yes, but it also depends on which room within the segment so that we have certain suites that are out, certain rooms that are in, depends on the time. Yes, there is some differentiation. So there is a blend there. Yes. I think the difficulty is, we don't know. We've been in these conditions for 2.5 years. We're very hopeful. We're going to continue to invest in Macao. We feel very strongly about Macao's future and the opportunities that exist there for leisure and business tourism but we just don't know. So as of right now, we're just waiting patiently, and we're going through the process, and we're looking forward to the opportunity for the upcoming concession."

            "name": "Rob Goldstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining our call today. A few brief comments and we'll move to Q&A. The recovery of Marina Bay Sands continued during the quarter with property EBITDA reaching US$343 million. Relaxation of virus-related restrictions in Singapore and many of the source markets, coupled with the improvements in airlift, have enabled this performance and financial -- this improvement in financial performance. We expect a robust recovery over time as further relaxation measures in the region are implemented and additional airlift in Singapore comes online. Our $1 billion capital investment program currently underway at Marina Bay Sands has introduced exceptional new suite product in premium segment-focused amenities of the resort. The response to these initial offerings has been strong. Additional offerings, including spacious new suite products, will be introduced throughout the remainder of this year and 2023. We look forward to substantially increasing our investment in the Singapore market as we execute our expansion plans at MBS in the years ahead. Turning to Macao, the operating environment remains difficult. Importantly though, tourism with restrictions have been relaxed to customer demand and spending in Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both gaming and retail perspective. We appreciate the opportunity to submit our tender proposal for one of the six gaming concessions in Macao in September. We are now in the consultation phase of the tender program. And as such, we won't be able to comment much further on the process at this time. We are big believers in Macao as a world center of tourism and leisure. We have been the biggest investor and operated non-gaming businesses over the past two decades in Macao. We absolutely welcome the opportunity to invest even more in the non-gaming products and offerings in Macao. We have great confidence in Macao's tourism recovery and its long-term growth prospects as we do most of our -- we'll do our utmost to support Macao's economic diversification and its evolution as Asia's leading destination for MICE and leisure visitors. We consider our existing portfolio of resorts in Asia to be an ideal platform for growth in the years ahead. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities to develop new large-scale land-based destination resorts in both the U.S. and Asia.  We thank you for listening today, and I'll turn to your questions. Joe, we think Singapore is in a very unique place. I think we easily achieved 2019 levels. And as you referenced, we have three great impediments right now. We have -- obviously, tourism to China is very limited. We also are running about 55% visitation into Singapore from the rest of Asia, which means -- and that may seem odd to reference that because you think, well, we're running at the high levels of occupancy. But keep in mind that, that residual tourist that comes in does not sleep at the MBS property, gambles there, shops there, eats there. So we're getting hurt, I think, on the table business by not having all the hotels in Singapore operating at full level. It's a big business for us because MBS is the first protocol from those visitors, whether they're sleeping there or not, they go there. That hurts our business. And despite that, we're achieving $700 win per units on the slots and huge retail numbers, but the upside is material. Third impediment is our sleeping rooms. We had about 400 or 500 units down right now. I think Singapore, it's just beginning. I always joke with the guys here, the party is just starting in Singapore. The truth is that Singapore is going to grow and for a couple of reasons. One is the destination is getting more powerful than ever. Our building is getting better than ever. And I think when you see a rebound from China and the rest of Asia, one, six looks very small in terms of our ability to grow with much larger than that. I think we can keep going to $2 billion the next couple of years if we get it right in the market for recovers. So as much as we like the numbers currently, we think there's much better days ahead for Singapore. That market and that destination has grown quite a bit in terms of the Asian tourism world. And I think our numbers will reflect that years ahead. We woke our colleagues up in Asia in a deep sleep to participate. I'll let them answer that question. Gentleman, Grant and Wilfred, both online correct? Are you awake, guys? Answer away. Do you need the question? Grant, do you have anything to add, any additional commentary, Grant? I think, Carlo, one of the most significant things is what's not there. We're running like 96%. You see on Page 14, the reference page, ADR $515. I think, again, we're just beginning. We only have half the recovery in terms of -- China is not there, most of Asia is not there. Our point is, the mix gets better and better because demand gets higher and higher. Our problem there's going to be enough rooms to service all the demand FIT casino.  And I think we pointed two great variables: one being retail, which is that mall just keeps getting better and will keep getting better. And then our win per unit on the slot side looks strong. But I think the refocus on Singapore as a destination market, as a market in great ascent illustrates what the upside could be in the -- on the tables, the non-rolling tables. Rolling tables will probably get the whole new level, but demand for the non-rolling tables is what I'm waiting for recovery. And that's where you see China and the rest of Asia full lift comes back. So right now, we're just faced with -- the sad reality is we like to have a lot more rooms in Singapore because that $515 is a real number, it could be a lot higher as demand keeps lifting. We can sell hotel resolve there longer at top dollar rates from the FIT side. We have great demand, much better than pre-pandemic demand from the rolling side. So again, the 343 is a very nice number, a good print in lieu of what's happening in that market.  But I think the best phase of Singapore next couple of years as we keep growing -- and you're going to see our refocus on our mix in the retail segment. Our room mix, we're going to continue to focus. I mean the right room mix, top-tier rooms, the right food and beverage product, we've got to work harder because Singapore as a destination is growing measurably. We want to be a part of that. So we're just in a very good place in Singapore. I think looking back, we always thought one, six was a very nice number. Hopefully, obviously a small number in the future. Waiting for a Governor Hochul's advice to how that's going to process will begin. As you know, we've always been focused on the market for many years. We have a bid we're putting it right now. We have property we're put together right now. Very bullish on New York as a market. Tough because one really, I think, one available license at the end of the day, I think it's been a very -- a dog fight. And hopefully, we have a bid that gets attention. But other than that, time table looks like January for the RFP. I think sometime in '23, maybe you see a decision. And we'll put our best foot forward, that's for sure. It would be a perfect market to be in with the density of population and ethnicity. I'm going to ask your former colleague, Mr. Chum, to answer that question, Robin. And Robin, I would say, the process for us is a learning -- is an evolutionary process. We keep thinking how about this market differently as we learn more and see more. And so our thinking has changed, there's the size of on gaming capacity, who the customer is. Singapore is morphed from what it was five years ago to hold it in place now. And I think it's affected our thoughts on what we build and so forth and how good should it be and how powerful it should be. And I think it's slower we want to be, but it's been the end of a very, very important product. I think we need the Chinese consumer. We -- a couple of these to happen, let's be clear, we need to see China return at some point to achieve our goals. We also need to see the balance of Asia open up and come back at. Again, as I referenced earlier, the 55-or-so percent number, which is compared to 2019 isn't good, we need Singapore full on because our building, if you walk through there, when there's tens of thousands, hundreds of thousand people there, they're all staying there. There's the other hotels from the business. So these other hotels are very important to us.  So we need two things happen. Our innovation will complete in late '23. The balance of Singapore -- of Asian tourism into Singapore should be hopefully by Q2 complete. And that leaves the one barrier we can't answer as to China return. But when all that happens, do we think we can get you a very fat return? Oh, yes. I'd like to believe we can -- our goal is to get to $2 billion in Singapore. And we believe that's not difficult if the market returns in full.  So keep in mind that we went into Singapore with a very different mentality a decade plus ago. The evolution of Macao into a really the premier FIT gaming market probably right now in that region is MBS. And I think we're experiencing the beginning to return, but it's not nearly where it needs to get to for us to get to $500 million a quarter. But I think that -- we'll hopefully see that in the years ahead. So we feel very bullish.  And I can't think of a better place to invest our capital than Singapore and Macao, and Singapore has proven to be terrific opportunity. We put a lot of money in Macao. That will open up the fence and be a good opportunity. But right now, Singapore is very, very exciting for us. And yes, we're very confident the returns will be there. I'll ask Grant to reference that. But I think we should be careful. We don't -- it's very hard, as you know, right now, predictions of Macao had been erroneous the last couple of years because we don't know who's going to come and we don't know when they'll close the market. It's been stopping the start for so long. It's kind of silly for us to pontificate on exact gains in EBITDA. Could be EBITDA positive? Sure, these positive tomorrow if things open up and visitation returns. And that's going to happen at some point. But I think it's not -- it's difficult for us to tell you fourth quarter could be EBITDA positive without knowing what effect the visitors team will have in November and then also not knowing how zero COVID in force will happen. So there's certainly unknowns in Macao is very difficult to guess. Grant, Wilfred, any commentary? I'm going to ask Patrick to take that, but I want to say one thing, it's critical to understanding is that Singapore is much different. I think this is the obvious response to that. Singapore is much different than Las Vegas or U.S. regional because of the obvious that you got to fly to get there, so you had to take other countries opening up and it's like buying wine in Burgundy, a lot of different regions in Burgundy. Well, there's a lot of different regions in Asia that don't open, haven't opened, airlift is a problem. So we're really hampered. As nice as what 340 is for the quarter, I think you're not getting the full power. It's hard to differentiate versus other places. The truth is that Singapore remains really held back by no China or little China and the regional market there, depending on airlift. The difference, Macao will be -- when Macao opens up, it's like Las Vegas or regionals. You can come right in without airlift. You're not airlift-dependent. So I do think Singapore right now is in kind of unclear, uncertain environment. It's nicely making 1.4 billion, whatever the number annualizes. But we won't know the full power of this market. We see it in retail. We see it in local slot play is still strong. We see it in rolling volumes are strong because everyone is coming to Singapore, especially the F1. But I think what you're not seeing yet is unleash the full power of this destination and what's happening. Patrick? If you look at our sales in the retail mall on Page 31, it gives you some indication that we're running at $2,300, $2,400 a foot at Marina Bay Sands from the third quarter. I also think if you look at the rolling volumes as they start to kick in, I think those are great data points as you get quality coming. But again, it's early days. I think the recovery quarter is the right way of approaching it. I think we all agree to underlying demand in Macao's going to be there once COVID resolved. And no difference happened probably in the U.S. and again, with our footprint there, our size, our scale, we know the base mass, premium mass is going to drive this thing. The only variable we don't know is the missing junket segment, how impactful will be. But we believe -- again, when that door does open, I think the pent-up demand is going to be extraordinary. I think one thing you just have to do, you want to understand this thing is you will have pictures listen to us, but jump on a plane some day and go see it. The product we're building there is unlike any haven't been done in Singapore, it is our spirit to what we've done the best in our competitors. And so I think when people -- our response has been across the board perfect in terms of be able to view this product. I think the impact is going to be much higher than we understand because you build something that good, people respond to it. I would encourage anybody who's in that part of the world to spend a day at Marina Bay Sands and we'll show you what we're doing is pretty impressive. Grant, do you want to have that? Mr. Chum, are you still awake?"

            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yes. No, I think that's right. And we obviously welcome the smooth progress in the process. And we still do expect the entire process to complete by the end of the year, as previously stated by the government. Sorry, Robin, I couldn't quite hear the question. Can you repeat that? Yes, sure. I mean I think, Robin, there has been a positive announcement on the relaxation with regards to two groups as well as the electronic Visa application in four provinces and also in Shanghai expected to commence end of the month or early November. And so that's obviously going to be a very positive signal for a gradual recovery in the visitation especially from these key provinces and municipality. And obviously, we welcome the development. Clearly, in the past few weeks and also months, it's still being relatively impacted by the COVID cases in different provinces as far as the non-Guangdong visitation is concerned. So what we're seeing right now in Macao is predominantly coming from the Guangdong province. But hopefully, as we get out further into the fourth quarter with these recent measures, we're going to start to see a more well-rounded mix of visitation building up towards the end of the year. Yes, Rob, I think Rob is right. I mean, the prediction of the future is tough. I think what we can say about the past is the group package tours represented roughly 1/4 of the visitation before the pandemic. With respect to electronic visas, we don't have those numbers. Obviously, it varies significantly from province-to-province. But clearly, the provision or availability of that node of application absolutely is helpful to facilitate the visa application for those relevant provinces. Yes, I'll take that, Rob. Yes, thanks for the question. I think it's interesting looking at that trend as you highlight for the past several quarters. I would say the difference that you highlighted with the previous two quarters versus the prior eight, it's really just a function of the regional mix. So into 2022, we've had a much more Guangdong bias mix, if you look at the visitation data, and that's mainly a result of the various COVID outbreak impact on the non-Guangdong source of visitation. So if you're looking at the period post-pandemic, that's clearly the differentiator. And then if you compare with pre-pandemic, then it's, of course, still very much premium mass coming back faster. And I think that broadly stands notwithstanding or up Asia adjusted for the regional provincial mix. I think that's still a valid point, and it's borne out by the data series. So obviously, premium mass comes back first and then the mass comes back later. But this year, definitely, there's an impact from the regional mix as well. Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, I think it is volatile right now because the volumes are so thin. So I'm not sure looking at this quarter or even the prior quarters is particularly meaningful at this point. But I think going forward, I think as Rob referenced, we expect a strong comeback of both premium mass and mass. And I think in those segments, we're going to perform very well. Obviously, there's a past history there. But also, I think looking forward, we are coming off these fantastic product investments that we've made during the pandemic with the $2.2 billion investment program that we've implemented and now coming out on the other side pretty much completing with the London arena being the last component. So with the Londoner and the Grand Suites at Four Seasons, we feel very strongly that we're going to perform very well in the market share front. Across all of these segments, not just because of the suites, speaking to the premium mass segment, but also for the mass segment, I think we'll end up with these three wonderful iconic destinations to follow on from The Venetian and The Parisian and now with the Londoner Macao, which is already starting to gain so much traction with the people who have been able to visit and also locally as well. Yes, still going. Yes. I think as I referenced earlier, I think there is a mix between the business segment -- the matrix between the business segment as well as the regional breakdown. So I think if you're just looking at the business segment, then clearly, VIP right now is -- has very low levels of volume, especially versus premium mass and even mass. But part of this impact in 2022 is also the regional composition of the business where we're obviously very Guangdong-dependent right now and have been for most part of this year. But I think going forward, it should be like how we've been seeing, which is the premium as we'll come back first and more strongly and then followed by the mass. And this is also true if you look at the retail numbers, what we've seen is 2021 very, very significant performance in the luxury retail segment. And of course, 2022, less so. But again, it's really impacted by that regional difference. And then going forward, yes, similar trends, we expect the luxury retail to come back first and the fastest and then you follow through with the mass retail."

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. So we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours.\nDaniel Briggs: Thank you. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, Chief Operating Officer of Sands China. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we may discuss non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures that's included in the press release. We have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. Finally, for those who would like to participate in the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. Please note that this presentation is being recorded. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining our call today. A few brief comments than we move to Q&A. The recovery in Singapore at MBS accelerate during the quarter with property EBITDA reaching $390 million. The relaxation of pandemic related restrictions in Singapore and many of its source markets has enabled this encouraging improvement in the financial performance at MBS. We expect the more robust recovery over time as additional airlift in the Singapore comes online and further relaxation measures in the region are implemented. Our conviction the long-term opportunity at Singapore might remain steadfast. Our $1 billion capital investment is underway at Marina Bay Sands as introduced exceptional new suite product and premium segment focused amenities the resort, more offerings will be added throughout the remainder of 2022 and '23. And this one has the properties appeal to premium customers seeking the highest level travel experiences. In addition, we look forward to substantially increasing our investment in the Singapore market as we execute our expansion plans, and Marina Bay Sands in the years ahead. Singapore remains in an outstanding market for additional investment. Let's turn to Macao. The operating environment there remains very difficult in periods when the restrictions have been lifted. The customer demand and spend in Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and a retail perspective. As the market eventually recovers our $2.2 billion investment program at Four Seasons in London, we'll provide outstanding growth opportunities in both the premium and mass customer segments. We appreciate the clarity of the revised gaming law in June. We look forward to participating in the concession re-tendering process as it proceeds. We continue to have the largest footprint in this incredible market. We retain great optimism and our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels and beyond the Macao, once visitation returns. We would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of additional dollars in Macao. We continue to believe Macao is now outstanding market for additional investment. We can see our portfolio of resorts in Asia to be an ideal platform for growth in the years ahead and additionally continue to pursue additional other opportunities in large land base destination resorts in the U.S. and Asia. Let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe, your line is live.\nJoe Greff: Hello, everybody.\nRobert Goldstein: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Greff: Love to start with Singapore here. When you look back at trends within the 2Q, which were obviously encouraging. And you look at the premium mass in the VIP segments, was there anything notable in one segment versus the other throughout the quarter? How even with the recovery month-to-month in the segments throughout the quarter other than seasonality. You talked about source markets driving improvement? What geographies are driving that improvement? And then lastly, with my multi-part, question number one here can you talk about what you've seen so far in July in the first 20 days here? thank you.\nRobert Goldstein: A lot of questions there, Joe. We're not going to break out the quarter. I think we'll be -- it\u2019s suffice to say we're pleased that we back in the strong position in Singapore. And the fundamental growth there comes from obviously both base and premium mass, I don't think either one outshine the other is consistent movement in the right direction. I think the biggest thing we're seeing is the airlift is opening up. And that also remains to be the -- remains to be the most challenging part of the Singapore recovery. Airlift is still a challenge. You were getting a lot of good business out of the region, especially of Indonesia, Malaysia, but I think there's a lot more opportunity as the airlift returns. And I think you'll see that in our deck, the Changi monthly visitation numbers are still relatively less than 50% of what they were at pre-pandemic. So although we're delighted with Singapore, and the numbers reflect that. We think it's really optimistic in the months ahead.\nJoe Greff: And great to make follow-up\u2026\nRobert Goldstein: [Indiscernible] question, Joe. If you want to just keep that's where I think I heard you say, is there more to it?\nJoe Greff: No, I mean, I, can you just talk about what you've seen so far in July? Has that trend continued?\nRobert Goldstein: I think, we're not going to do that. We're not going to talk about July, I think, but I think the numbers or deck gives you a real good sense of what happened in Q2. And I, again, I think the story in Marina Bay Sands is a regional story and Singapore Story as that, as that place gets more visitation. I think if you look on Page 16 of your slide presentation deck there, you'll see that we've not even reached 50% capacity, and in Changi it's like 46%, but it was May of '19. So we're doing these numbers with a still very, very distressed airlift. And I think, unlike the U.S. where there's unfettered ability to get to regional markets, airlift is back transportation, this is still a place you need to fly to. And so the airlift story can use to hamper the recovery. So I think the $300 million plus quarter is a pleasant upside to what we've thought we do. But there's I think a lot more room to run, as this market opens up in -- into places like Japan, Korea, and more travel. We're really more dependent right now on the closer in foreign markets.\nJoe Greff: Got it.\nPatrick Dumont: And Joe, one other thing it's Patrick, I think one thing to know when you look at Marina Bay Sands, is that we're not at capacity. And what I mean by that is, to Rob's point, if you look at the amount of airlift coming in to Singapore, it's not where it can be. But we're at levels that are very strong relative to 2019. If you look at, our not only volumes, which are really speaking to the premium mass segment from the catchment area, this is only going to grow. And the good news is we have our team together. One of the things that's been slowing some of the growth coming out of the pandemic, and really capturing some of the pent-up demand and return to normalcy is the fact that many operators on luxury segment didn't necessarily keep their team together throughout the pendency of the pandemic. We were fortunate enough to do that. And so now our team is ready to respond. So we have plenty of capacity to absorb the growth as it comes in. So our view is that this is a good start, but we have more room to run.\nRobert Goldstein: To Patrick's point, Joe, one more things to make you aware. We were there, I guess a month or so ago. One thing is disturbing is the hotel business. They even the luxury brands haven't been able to get open 100%. So I'm running at 40%, 50% capacity, because they don't have adequate personnel. And that obviously feeds into Marina Bay Sands. So as they get open fully this year, as that market returns, as employment grows, I think we'll grow with that. There's a lot of room to run here if we get that place fully open, and airlift returns to pre pandemic numbers.\nJoe Greff: Great, thank you for your thoughts there. Switching over to Macao. Can you just talk about what your average daily operating expense? Average cash burn rate has been during this most recent casino closure there.\nRobert Goldstein: Grant, are you awake? Grant?\nGrant Chum: Yes, we're here.\nRobert Goldstein: Got it?\nGrant Chum: Good morning. Sorry. Just momentarily lost you. Yes, Joe, I think obviously, second quarter, we were running at this $110 million EBITDA loss. So we'll basically just over a million a day. Now as we went into the second half of June, we have a local outbreak of COVID in Macao, and therefore, into the third quarter. Clearly the revenue environment is slower than it has been in the second quarter, especially with the last weeks [indiscernible] casinos as well. So I think you can look back to where we were in 2020. In a very, very low tourism environment in the middle of that year. And take it from that in terms of the actual daily cash burn rate, although I think our operating expenses have moderated a little bit since then. But that's the ballpark region.\nJoe Greff: Thanks, guys.\nRobert Goldstein: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, good afternoon, everybody. Rob, just sort of going back to Singapore for a moment. The Changi numbers are really interesting. Is that a pretty good guide for, I guess visitation levels of the property and sort of where I'm going is, thinking about spend per visitor, right. We've obviously seen the pent-up demand, and that those numbers rise across U.S. regional gaming Las Vegas strip. And I think we're all struggling a little bit to know exactly what Asia is going to do, but we can all I think do the math, if visitations down 50 and obviously, you're 75% or 80% of your productivity levels already that's just very good spend per visit levels, but obviously, don't want to extrapolate just from the airport, if you could give us a little bit more guidance.\nRobert Goldstein: Well, I think it'd be careful here in terms of extrapolating, without recognize we are running high occupancies already at Marina Bay Sands, where I think you struggle a bit is to factor in when the rest of the market recovers. That's why I referenced the other high end luxury hotels are lots of sleeping rooms, who we benefit from, they come to shop, eat with us, gamble with us, we're not getting that lift, I think that's the -- could be a very impactful down the road, we're very happy to spend levels we're seeing, and we're happy with the occupancy we're getting, but we're not getting that extra people don't sleep in our hotel unnecessarily coming over to gamble, shop, et cetera. So I think that's where we're trying to point out the visitation levels. I also think there'll be helpful in driving better levels of play and spend as these other markets. So you can't lose three million people in a month, like May and not have some impact in numbers. The question you raise is how high is up? And I don't want -- I'm not prepared to answer that, I don't know. But you can't ignore the fact that you're losing 10s of millions of people versus pre-pandemic. The point here is just to make it clear how different is over there versus in the U.S. where visitation levels are back and access these properties is back here in Las Vegas and regionals. It's not the case yet in Asia, and I think will benefit as that rise in spend will get better. There are retail numbers that you might look here on Page 31, as some indication is how powerful the recovery is happening even without full visitation, you can see the sales per square foot MBS and the power what's happening over there. So the good news is we're getting we're profitable, we're seeing growth, the better news is there might be a lot more ahead of us if we can access more people into Changi. So have more hotels around our hotel and see a full visitation inventory. It's not there yet.\nShaun Kelley: Great and maybe just my follow-up thinking about margins in Singapore, right without the revenues being back online, it's been hard to analyze, but can you just talk a little bit about puts and takes there now as we get back to very recovered levels on the revenue side, about some of the, kind of on a stabilized basis as different segments come along? Because I think, there was a tax change there that impacted the market and some other things. So, could you just help us think about pros and cons or segments of business that could impact margins on a stabilized basis?\nRobert Goldstein: Pat, you want to take that?\nPatrick Dumont: Yes, sure. So a couple of things to think about. First off, just as you mentioned, after March 1, our gaming tax increased both by 3% in the Premium and the non-Premium side. So that 3% does impact margin. Now I think there are some other things going on in Singapore, there's some higher expenses that is used, there's utility costs that have gone up. There's other costs to operate in the market that have gone up inflation that you've seen in other markets are impacting some of the things that we buy. There's also some wage inflation because there's scarcity of labor in the marketplace in Singapore, so a high quality environment to work in. It's just a high demand as our economy continues to grow for high quality labor, so we've seen some labor increase. So there's some things that from a cost basis side are impacting our margins. But the flip side of this is we're not at full revenue yet. So as we grow revenue and as we make investments in these higher value suite products and as we grow some of the services that we offer to our patrons in the long run, we'd like to believe our margins return back towards where they were before, we just need to be operating under normal environment. So we still have some start-up, what's called fits and starts related to some expenses. And I think our goal is to get our margins back to where they were, but it's going to take some revenue growth for us to get there.\nShaun Kelley: Great, thanks. That's very clear. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thank you. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Well, Rob maybe you could help here. Just in terms of the -- at Marina Bay Sands, obviously, I think VIP recovered to close to 75% of Q2 '19 levels, as you think about that kind of moving forward are clearly some channels, as you mentioned, Korea, Japan, and I would assume to some extent Mainland in China is curtailed to say the least. But when you think about like the stability of that, in the current environment, does it feel as though that's a number that that's kind of a new baseline, thereabouts, at least as we move forward?\nRobert Goldstein: You mean, this current quarter's results being a baseline?\nCarlo Santarelli: I'm referring more to VIP ownership volume and kind of the stability of that segment of the market?\nRobert Goldstein: I think there's room to run, I think there's room in there. I mean, look at what's happened in Singapore, let's begin with we glossed -- I glossed over the beginning, but we're putting $1 billion in that product. It'll be very blunt about it. It's always been a very appealing building, but it's never had the FF&E component in the suite and room product, I think it deserved, it now has that and over the next 18 months, it'll finish. We were there and the product we're putting together is as good as any place we've ever operated. And I think that's going to be very helpful. To us be clear that Singapore is more desirable than ever as a destination is growing in appeal to a lot of people for a lot of reasons. We referenced the airlift, you referenced China, you're absolutely right, China's obviously not there. But I think you add these things together, the desirability of Singapore as a destination, the rethinking of the FF&E in that building, the return of a lot more airlift than there was hopefully in 2019. Yes, I think that segment can run, yes, I do. I think we can, we also have less competition in the region. Obviously, Macao is not operating at this point. But I think this Singapore business is going to continue to grow because the region, the City state of Singapore is very desirable, and more and more people come to us. So you add our better building with a more desirable Singapore with the airlift, with the opening of China, with the opening of Japan, Korea at all, I think the cumulative impact here is every segment can grow. I have a lot of belief that we can drive -- we have to drive it because there's cost size as it was referenced by Sean and Patrick in the previous call. So we will drive revenue in all segments and we'll be very attuned to it. But I think we were in a very, very privileged position in Singapore right now. And what's happened there, both our building and with the destination itself.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great, that's helpful and then just as it pertains to the expansion that the 1000 new rooms, I believe you guys had the construction start, kind of, I guess it was an extension on what you had to begin construction into Q2 of next year, if I'm not mistaken. Is there anything firmer that you guys have around cost and our plans there that you'd be able to share?\nRobert Goldstein: Yes, Patrick, do you want to?\nPatrick Dumont: Sure, absolutely. So, Rob referenced our visit to Singapore, it was a great visit on a lot of fronts, I think we spent time in the building. And we had the opportunity to continue our dialog around the IR2 expansion. We're very excited to begin, I think one of the things that the pandemic did unfortunately was slow down that process. There's just a lot of things that have to be considered to fit it in to this very complex and very busy environment to make it sort of fit all the requirements that are necessary to get the approvals to begin. And so I think we're working on that now. And it's something that we hope in the coming months that we'll be able to get more firm about a start date, but we're excited about it and working with the Government currently and hopefully we'll get a chance to begin soon.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great, thank you Patrick. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad, your line is live.\nChad Beynon: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask about M&A in this environment. And I know that's not a normal question for you guys. But given your strong cash flow, position, your balance sheet and just compressed multiples kind of across the gaming lodging leisure space. How are you thinking about maybe considering some opportunistic looks across the world? Thanks.\nRobert Goldstein: Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: So, I think one of the things as a company that alternative pandemic, and part of the pandemic we've always focused on is how we allocate capital, and how we drive the highest returns for shareholders. And you may have heard in the past say that our highest and best use of capital do new development from the ground up. And that's really what we're focused on. If you look at the history of the company, and success in the way it's delivered outside shareholder returns is exploiting a strategy of building large scale integrated resorts in new jurisdictions. And that's what we're focused on. And so for us, I think we have opportunities unique to who we are, we have a long track record with Rob and his decades of experience, the rest of the team has decades of experience in developing these resorts. And so we're going to look to do that, before we look to buy anything, I don't think the idea is that we would never look at something, I think we're always interested, I think we're interested in seeing if there's a way to create greater returns for our shareholders. But as a practical matter, we're not an M&A driven business. And I think for us, our priorities are going to be look for new markets, develop, build and scale, and invest over the long-term to create sustainable and durable returns. And that's really what we're going to look to do. So I understand that there's variability, particularly in the digital side, there's a lot of things that have valuations now that may people see them as compelling for the long-term, there's perhaps some land based opportunities that may come up over time. But as a practical matter, like everyone else will look at it, see if it makes any sense for us. But we're really going to be focused on ground up development. That's who we are.\nChad Beynon: Thank you. And then on MBS again, just on margins, you kind of touched about some of the different pieces of that, because the promotional environment between you and your competitor in the market changed versus pre-pandemic, or does it feel as rational as it was at that time? And do you expect anything to change from a promotional environment once Macao opens back up? Thanks.\nRobert Goldstein: We've always been lucky that environment is not driven. I don't think it will be in the future either. And I have to wait and see what happens in Macao. But my sense is Macao when opens will not be a challenge either. There'll be plenty of demand and usually promotional activities, got to controlling his lack of revenue, I don't think we lack revenue in Macao or Singapore. So I feel pretty good about it.\nChad Beynon: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Chad.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt your line is live.\nBrandt Montour: Hey, everyone, thanks for taking my questions. First one was on Singapore I'll follow-up on that the last question. But more just for the Singapore market, specifically. And we've heard a bunch of chatter out there in terms of potential interest in your main competitor in that -- in the Singapore market? Is there any scenario in which, a different operator would come in and take that over? And that would change the way you look at that competitive landscape?\nPatrick Dumont: We'd already have been without it, that's up to the government make that decision. But it's a duopoly market. And I don't see it having impact either way.\nGrant Chum: Yes, I think one thing that's important to note is that we view Marina Bay Sands as the best building in the world. And in our mind, it's just an unbelievable opportunity to continue invest and operate the building and grow it over time. So I don't think we view it any differently. We think the market opportunity in Singapore is absolutely unique. And, we're very committed to long-term investment there. So for us, I'm not sure it matters, who operates it, that's up to the Singapore government and to the owners of that business. But for us, we're just focused on, continuing to develop our property and grow the market as best we can.\nRobert Goldstein: What I would say about Singapore, we said before, we'll just reiterate is that that place has evolved even better than was we started years ago. And it keeps getting better. And if you look at Changi running it such a still 40%, 50% capacity. Look at the desirability at market, the things we're doing, I'm sure again, thing is as well to improve the product, it just feels like that mark has a lot of room to run, and to grow from us and for our competitor. The offerings get better, our Phase 2 will be even stronger. So to me, that's the market just beginning to feel it's muscle.\nBrandt Montour: Okay, great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up on that, as we sort of think about how to think about the constraints, for how fast that that MBS property can recover. The Singapore Tourism Board recently put out a number for 2022 international visitation that are some something along the lines of $4 million to $6 million for '22. That it doesn't seem like that would incorporate a ton of ramp from here, and I know that's not necessarily exactly what you guys would see. But does that is that make it seem like the Changi airlift is for the rest of yours baked into the cake now or is there can that be flexed up do you think?\nRobert Goldstein: I'm not going to speak for the government or what their numbers say. I think the capacity opportunity speaks for itself, I think it's more depended not on Singapore but on the airline themselves and the other countries wanting to reengage and to open them. I think the airport can obviously have the capacity. I'd be surprise if Singapore wouldn't welcome more, more access more flights. It's question of getting the requisite employees in these airlines to get the lift going and open up these countries in a major way. I think it's hard to forecast we're in a world of change every day is different. And I'd like to think there's a lot more opportunity than that, but remains to be seen. If the government's want to engage and if the airlines can get the employees make it happen. I think demand -- underlying demand is absolutely there just gained the ability to get there.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Thanks so much, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live.\nRobin Farley: Great, thanks. Hi, just a quick one on I don't know if I'm missing your introductory comments, any comments on what you've talked about in the past related to online gaming and sports betting and kind of more looking at B2B investments. I didn't catch if you had an update there? Thanks.\nRobert Goldstein: We didn't have enough there. We didn't mention, we're focused right now on what's happened. We remain committed to our digital investments and looking at that market. But right now, the story for us is this land based recovery, which we're dealing in Singapore and we made some major strides in this company in terms of liquidity. The reopening of Singapore, and we think the upside potential of Singapore. The licensing process and Macao are focused on that. And of course, most importantly, the return to a normalized operating environment in Macao is paramount. We just been so busy without your focus wasn't on digital. Right now, we continue to look at that opportunity. We continue to invest, we made a few investments, as you know, in the past, so just simply a focus right now on land based.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. And then also, has there been a change in what you expect for timing and spending a potential New York project, since last quarter?\nRobert Goldstein: I'm sorry, I missed you -- about New York.\nPatrick Dumont: Timing of spend.\nRobert Goldstein: Oh, timing of spend? No, I think we remain a believer in that market. And the process is taking longer than I thought it would. But hopefully it'll come to -- hopefully this year or early next, we'll know what's happening there. Now it's still the density of population and the ethnicity. And the access in New York makes it very appealing and lack of capacity still remains a premier market in my mind, if we can get there is a lot of competition. We're one of many in the hunt there. So nothing new report, we have a plan in place we're executing to it want to wait for the RFP to unfold. So we're nothing new in New York.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Robin.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve, your line of live.\nSteve Wieczynski: Yes, hey guys, good afternoon. So this will probably be for Grant, and it's probably going to be a difficult question to even answer. But, Grant, I guess for us, non-Chinese citizens, it's extremely tough for us to understand, where China is with respect to the reopening process. But I don't know if you can help us understand, maybe what you're hearing around the zero case policy, which I mean, I think the rest of the world probably fully knows at this point is never really going to work. And if some of these harsher stances toward the virus could start to get relaxed before. Maybe is there a timeframe you guys are watching? Or is there anything you've heard? Maybe it's at the October election? I guess, anything around that would be very, very helpful? Thanks.\nGrant Chum: Yes, thanks for the question. I think as you alluded to, there's not much that we can help with in terms of any speculation on timelines or changes. I think what we're focused on is, what was happening in Macao. So I think, the things that we can effect is to make sure that we do help the prevailing government policy so that we can actually get Macao reopen back with Zhuhai that's a neighboring city in Mainland as quickly as possible. And that means, I think aligning ourselves fully and safely with the overall COVID policy. And that's what's happening right now. And so hopefully, in over the coming weeks, we will be progressively reopening all of the facilities that we've had to close in the past week. That's what we're really focused on. And it's really not a place to speculate on future changes on the overall health policy. I don't know if Wilfred has more to add on that.\nWilfred Wong Ying-Wai: No, I think Grant, you're right. At this stage, I think the whole country is also employed in this COVID situation. And obviously, policies will evolve. And we in Macao is trying our best to support that local government in order that Macao can return to normalcy.\nSteve Wieczynski: Okay, great. Thanks for that guys. And then Rob, obviously, there's been some it's been some movement with regards to the new Macao gaming laws, regulations, whatever way you want to think about it, which actually seem pretty favorable. But wondering how you guys are viewing those regulation changes, and maybe any of the pros or cons that you see emerging from those?\nRobert Goldstein: Well, we're grateful for the clarity from the government. I think the process is moving very well. And I think a lot of concerns, some people haven't been eliminated. So we're just going to go into process and hoping to complete this thing in due course, but obviously, we're all pleased. I think all the operators are pleased how this is playing out. And we're hoping for a positive conclusion. I think a lot of the fears have been erased. Grant or Wilfred is going to comment, that's as far as I can take it.\nGrant Chum: I think that's right, Rob.\nWilfred Wong Ying-Wai: Yes, absolutely. Grant, go ahead.\nGrant Chum: Yes, I'll just going to add that, obviously, we're very appreciative during this difficult time on the COVID front, that the government and the legislature were able to move forward to complete the passing of the revised gaming law in towards the end of June, and that we were able to also execute the six month extension that takes us to the end of this year. So I think the whole process is moving forward expeditiously. And as Rob said, we look forward to participating in the tendering process.\nPatrick Dumont: Steve, one thing I would say our company, as you know, has been through it's been an awfully difficult couple of years more than most because we're Asia focused. But we've now completed the sale in Las Vegas gives us more than ample liquidity. Now what happens? Singapore is up and making money and there's more to come. It's a very, we're very grateful for what's happening in Singapore. We see a lot better days ahead. The Macao licensing process is the same way it feels like we've survived it was a lot of people are concerned.  But in the end, it's worked out for everybody in a positive manner thus far. Hope that continues. And we're just waiting for the thing you referenced initially, which is when does Macao, when does the government rethink the zero COVID or how that play out? We don't know. Don't pretend to know. But that's the last thing waiting for it to get our company back to a much better place, but three of the four have been achieved. So we'll continue to press on with a license and wait patiently for the government to advise us on the reopening of Macao.\nSteve Wieczynski: Okay, great. Thanks, Robert. Appreciate it.\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live.\nDavid Katz: Hi, afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Number one, I wanted to ask about just the physical plant in Macao. And recalling that, those are have a significant number of private rooms that were historically used for VIP. How do we think about kind of that spatial layout and planning going forward and then I have a follow-up in another direction?\nRobert Goldstein: Grant, do you want to take that because I have my own views, but I think you should.\nGrant Chum: Yes, sure. I think we've been watching as the market has been evolving and also planning for the future. I think a lot of the salons and suddenly that applies to the new salons that we've developed as part of The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, and the London and Macao projects. I think they're really premium salons, premium gaming salons that could be applicable and used by the different segments whether that's the VIP rolling or the premium mass. So, clearly I think Macao overall, may be relooking at how each operator redeploys their assets. But as far as we're concerned especially the new products that we've developed over the past two years, we feel pretty positive about redeploying a lot of those gaming spaces for the premium mass segment. But also over time, as we look towards the future also the premium direct segment and attracting the overseas markets in the Rest of Asia, into those products. So we've been currently going through a planning exercise on the future deployment of those areas. But as the market evolves and as things normalize, we'll be able to get more definition around that. But even as of the past 12 months, we've been redeploying some of those rooms that were assigned to the Rolling segment, to the non-Rolling segments.\nRobert Goldstein: Hey David, no ever thought the additional gaming space in Macao is a bad thing as we focus more on base mass and premium mass, I think actually expands our ability to make more money, the junket business, we always know is a margin challenge business. I feel grateful, we have all this new space coming back to us that we can redeploy. And we're still going to the world's biggest gaming market, real land based and one of the biggest footprint. So as this as we as Grant and Wilfred and the team, rethink that space, I think it adds all kinds of premium opportunities for base mass, premium mass and direct premium as well. So to me, it's a very valuable transition to a higher focus margin business, that enables us to again, Singapore, I mean, Macao, the penetration is Chinese still, I think sub 3% for the China population, there's going to be a growth market, capacity will be an issue down the road, because there are new casinos opening. So I think that space may prove be very valuable as we get back to work in Macao, hopefully this year, or next. But I think we're lucky to have all that extra space, we can redeploy in a more profitable way down the road. So happy to have it back.\nDavid Katz: Understood. And as my follow-up, you've done obviously, the Singapore MBS did a lot better than what we had. But just looking at the ADR of, I think 330 and I'm not sure that you cover this directly so far when we look back to 2019, it was there's still some headroom there. It was about $90 ADR higher. How do you sort of see that evolving as we roll forward?\nRobert Goldstein: Pat, you want to take that?\nPatrick Dumont: Yes, sure. Happy to, I think some of it has to do with sort of startup across the quarter, I think one of the other things to note is that it's not fully recovered in with all the different segments, because there is sort of not as much FIT and MICE demand as we had across 2019. So you're going to see some ADR spread from that. But I think the most important thing to note is we're making as Rob referenced a $1 billion investment in our product there, over time, our ADR will be higher. So across the next six quarters, and let's sort of focus on at the end of '23 in time for Chinese New Year of '24, we are going to have 400 new suites that we've never had before. And they're the highest quality suites we've ever done as a company. And we're going to drive different ADR. So while we're out a couple of 100 suites now we've got rooms out of inventory, we've had a lot of things going on through the building, it started period, I wouldn't look at this ADR is representative. And so over the next couple of quarters, as we have rooms out of inventory, it's going to -- there's going to be some choppiness, but by the time we're done getting into '23 and getting across '23, when the project is completed, then you'll have a good look what ADR can really be under the value of the full investment, which is substantial. It's basically a complete redo of Towers 1 and Towers 2 and some of the common spaces and amenity spaces that we have. It's going to be a fundamentally different experience for our guests. And we hope and believe very strongly, they'll pay a lot more for it, because it will attract a higher value tourist and that's really our goal.\nRobert Goldstein: Our biggest problem in the days ahead in MBS is as that Changi recovery continues, and passengers come back as our game, our biggest problem won't be ADRs can be putting have enough rooms to accommodate all the demand, ADR will climb either to casino direct or through cash customers or to convention. There'll be no problem getting back. That's not the issue. The issue as always been it'd be where capacity constrained in MBS, we need more sleeping rooms. And we'll get the ADR that markets, the recovery you're seeing here is in its infancy it's just beginning. And be assured that we can get the ADR back to pre-COVID levels and above in fact, I hope we can do much better with casino demand and driving casino ADR as well.\nDavid Katz: Perfect, thank you so much.\nRobert Goldstein: Sure, thank you.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. And last question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live.\nDaniel Politzer: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, given the momentum you're seeing in Singapore and the recovery is still in its infancy, how do you think about the long-term path to getting back to pre-COVID, the $1.7 billion of EBITDA in the event China doesn't open, do you need China to reopen to kind of get back or get close to that level or given what you're seeing now, do you have a line of sight to getting near there in the absence of China reopening?\nRobert Goldstein: It's good question. And we're watching like you are, I think, let's not ever dismiss the importance of China in any of our businesses, China's still a powerhouse as a consumer market. And we should never dismiss it as powerful till we get to $400 million a quarter without China, I mostly would think not. But then again, I would have thought we wouldn't have done this well, with Changi still having underperforming in terms of visitation. So, depends on like the U.S., I think you have to question what were the over indexing come from will Indonesia, Malaysia and other source markets over indexed and that's the question, we don't know the answer that, will there be pent-up demand coming out of Thailand and Vietnam and Indonesia. And could they -- could Korea outperform, I just don't know what the wait and see if those markets open up again, we're in uncharted waters here. It's new. But I would never dismiss the importance of China as a market for anybody in our retail business, or hotel business, or casino business. China is very, very critical to everybody in Asia. And you can see that in any market, we participate in. But how high is up without China returning, I do want to wait and see together. There's a lot of good drivers here that make us feel good, the visitation makes us feel there is opportunity there. Our renovation, it feels like it's been very impactful as comes online. The over indexing of non-China markets feels like it's coming on strong. But I think we'll revisit that and we'll have a better answer for you next quarter, we print our numbers.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it. And then just a follow-up. I know COVID cases in Singapore actually have been rising lately. Given your experience working with the government and your perception, and I guess other than their standard of living with COVID and the stage of reopening, do you see any risk with additional restrictions coming back or being put in place?\nRobert Goldstein: Patrick, do you want to grab that?\nPatrick Dumont: Yes, sure. Happy to, I think at this point, all we can do is be optimistic about the public health posture that Singapore shown, they have shown a lot of leadership, they have a significant history of investment in their hospital system and their public health infrastructure. And I think they're proceeding as they've said, I think they broadcast it all along, and they followed what they've laid out. So as we sit here right now, I think they're moving in the way they said they're going to do, which is continue to have visitation, continue to be involved in the growth of their economy and move forward with this is an endemic situation. But we don't know. And I think this is something where we've obviously shown flexibility to respond as needed to support the government their initiatives, but at this time, it seems like we're heading in the right direction. But could that change in the future? We don't know.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining our call today. A few brief comments than we move to Q&A. The recovery in Singapore at MBS accelerate during the quarter with property EBITDA reaching $390 million. The relaxation of pandemic related restrictions in Singapore and many of its source markets has enabled this encouraging improvement in the financial performance at MBS. We expect the more robust recovery over time as additional airlift in the Singapore comes online and further relaxation measures in the region are implemented. Our conviction the long-term opportunity at Singapore might remain steadfast. Our $1 billion capital investment is underway at Marina Bay Sands as introduced exceptional new suite product and premium segment focused amenities the resort, more offerings will be added throughout the remainder of 2022 and '23. And this one has the properties appeal to premium customers seeking the highest level travel experiences. In addition, we look forward to substantially increasing our investment in the Singapore market as we execute our expansion plans, and Marina Bay Sands in the years ahead. Singapore remains in an outstanding market for additional investment. Let's turn to Macao. The operating environment there remains very difficult in periods when the restrictions have been lifted. The customer demand and spend in Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and a retail perspective. As the market eventually recovers our $2.2 billion investment program at Four Seasons in London, we'll provide outstanding growth opportunities in both the premium and mass customer segments. We appreciate the clarity of the revised gaming law in June. We look forward to participating in the concession re-tendering process as it proceeds. We continue to have the largest footprint in this incredible market. We retain great optimism and our ability to perform to pre-pandemic levels and beyond the Macao, once visitation returns. We would welcome the opportunity to invest billions of additional dollars in Macao. We continue to believe Macao is now outstanding market for additional investment. We can see our portfolio of resorts in Asia to be an ideal platform for growth in the years ahead and additionally continue to pursue additional other opportunities in large land base destination resorts in the U.S. and Asia. Let's go to Q&A. Hi, Joe. A lot of questions there, Joe. We're not going to break out the quarter. I think we'll be -- it's suffice to say we're pleased that we back in the strong position in Singapore. And the fundamental growth there comes from obviously both base and premium mass, I don't think either one outshine the other is consistent movement in the right direction. I think the biggest thing we're seeing is the airlift is opening up. And that also remains to be the -- remains to be the most challenging part of the Singapore recovery. Airlift is still a challenge. You were getting a lot of good business out of the region, especially of Indonesia, Malaysia, but I think there's a lot more opportunity as the airlift returns. And I think you'll see that in our deck, the Changi monthly visitation numbers are still relatively less than 50% of what they were at pre-pandemic. So although we're delighted with Singapore, and the numbers reflect that. We think it's really optimistic in the months ahead. [Indiscernible] question, Joe. If you want to just keep that's where I think I heard you say, is there more to it? I think, we're not going to do that. We're not going to talk about July, I think, but I think the numbers or deck gives you a real good sense of what happened in Q2. And I, again, I think the story in Marina Bay Sands is a regional story and Singapore Story as that, as that place gets more visitation. I think if you look on Page 16 of your slide presentation deck there, you'll see that we've not even reached 50% capacity, and in Changi it's like 46%, but it was May of '19. So we're doing these numbers with a still very, very distressed airlift. And I think, unlike the U.S. where there's unfettered ability to get to regional markets, airlift is back transportation, this is still a place you need to fly to. And so the airlift story can use to hamper the recovery. So I think the $300 million plus quarter is a pleasant upside to what we've thought we do. But there's I think a lot more room to run, as this market opens up in -- into places like Japan, Korea, and more travel. We're really more dependent right now on the closer in foreign markets. To Patrick's point, Joe, one more things to make you aware. We were there, I guess a month or so ago. One thing is disturbing is the hotel business. They even the luxury brands haven't been able to get open 100%. So I'm running at 40%, 50% capacity, because they don't have adequate personnel. And that obviously feeds into Marina Bay Sands. So as they get open fully this year, as that market returns, as employment grows, I think we'll grow with that. There's a lot of room to run here if we get that place fully open, and airlift returns to pre pandemic numbers. Grant, are you awake? Grant? Got it? Thanks, Joe. Well, I think it'd be careful here in terms of extrapolating, without recognize we are running high occupancies already at Marina Bay Sands, where I think you struggle a bit is to factor in when the rest of the market recovers. That's why I referenced the other high end luxury hotels are lots of sleeping rooms, who we benefit from, they come to shop, eat with us, gamble with us, we're not getting that lift, I think that's the -- could be a very impactful down the road, we're very happy to spend levels we're seeing, and we're happy with the occupancy we're getting, but we're not getting that extra people don't sleep in our hotel unnecessarily coming over to gamble, shop, et cetera. So I think that's where we're trying to point out the visitation levels. I also think there'll be helpful in driving better levels of play and spend as these other markets. So you can't lose three million people in a month, like May and not have some impact in numbers. The question you raise is how high is up? And I don't want -- I'm not prepared to answer that, I don't know. But you can't ignore the fact that you're losing 10s of millions of people versus pre-pandemic. The point here is just to make it clear how different is over there versus in the U.S. where visitation levels are back and access these properties is back here in Las Vegas and regionals. It's not the case yet in Asia, and I think will benefit as that rise in spend will get better. There are retail numbers that you might look here on Page 31, as some indication is how powerful the recovery is happening even without full visitation, you can see the sales per square foot MBS and the power what's happening over there. So the good news is we're getting we're profitable, we're seeing growth, the better news is there might be a lot more ahead of us if we can access more people into Changi. So have more hotels around our hotel and see a full visitation inventory. It's not there yet. Pat, you want to take that? You mean, this current quarter's results being a baseline? I think there's room to run, I think there's room in there. I mean, look at what's happened in Singapore, let's begin with we glossed -- I glossed over the beginning, but we're putting $1 billion in that product. It'll be very blunt about it. It's always been a very appealing building, but it's never had the FF&E component in the suite and room product, I think it deserved, it now has that and over the next 18 months, it'll finish. We were there and the product we're putting together is as good as any place we've ever operated. And I think that's going to be very helpful. To us be clear that Singapore is more desirable than ever as a destination is growing in appeal to a lot of people for a lot of reasons. We referenced the airlift, you referenced China, you're absolutely right, China's obviously not there. But I think you add these things together, the desirability of Singapore as a destination, the rethinking of the FF&E in that building, the return of a lot more airlift than there was hopefully in 2019. Yes, I think that segment can run, yes, I do. I think we can, we also have less competition in the region. Obviously, Macao is not operating at this point. But I think this Singapore business is going to continue to grow because the region, the City state of Singapore is very desirable, and more and more people come to us. So you add our better building with a more desirable Singapore with the airlift, with the opening of China, with the opening of Japan, Korea at all, I think the cumulative impact here is every segment can grow. I have a lot of belief that we can drive -- we have to drive it because there's cost size as it was referenced by Sean and Patrick in the previous call. So we will drive revenue in all segments and we'll be very attuned to it. But I think we were in a very, very privileged position in Singapore right now. And what's happened there, both our building and with the destination itself. Yes, Patrick, do you want to? Patrick? We've always been lucky that environment is not driven. I don't think it will be in the future either. And I have to wait and see what happens in Macao. But my sense is Macao when opens will not be a challenge either. There'll be plenty of demand and usually promotional activities, got to controlling his lack of revenue, I don't think we lack revenue in Macao or Singapore. So I feel pretty good about it. What I would say about Singapore, we said before, we'll just reiterate is that that place has evolved even better than was we started years ago. And it keeps getting better. And if you look at Changi running it such a still 40%, 50% capacity. Look at the desirability at market, the things we're doing, I'm sure again, thing is as well to improve the product, it just feels like that mark has a lot of room to run, and to grow from us and for our competitor. The offerings get better, our Phase 2 will be even stronger. So to me, that's the market just beginning to feel it's muscle. I'm not going to speak for the government or what their numbers say. I think the capacity opportunity speaks for itself, I think it's more depended not on Singapore but on the airline themselves and the other countries wanting to reengage and to open them. I think the airport can obviously have the capacity. I'd be surprise if Singapore wouldn't welcome more, more access more flights. It's question of getting the requisite employees in these airlines to get the lift going and open up these countries in a major way. I think it's hard to forecast we're in a world of change every day is different. And I'd like to think there's a lot more opportunity than that, but remains to be seen. If the government's want to engage and if the airlines can get the employees make it happen. I think demand -- underlying demand is absolutely there just gained the ability to get there. We didn't have enough there. We didn't mention, we're focused right now on what's happened. We remain committed to our digital investments and looking at that market. But right now, the story for us is this land based recovery, which we're dealing in Singapore and we made some major strides in this company in terms of liquidity. The reopening of Singapore, and we think the upside potential of Singapore. The licensing process and Macao are focused on that. And of course, most importantly, the return to a normalized operating environment in Macao is paramount. We just been so busy without your focus wasn't on digital. Right now, we continue to look at that opportunity. We continue to invest, we made a few investments, as you know, in the past, so just simply a focus right now on land based. I'm sorry, I missed you -- about New York. Oh, timing of spend? No, I think we remain a believer in that market. And the process is taking longer than I thought it would. But hopefully it'll come to -- hopefully this year or early next, we'll know what's happening there. Now it's still the density of population and the ethnicity. And the access in New York makes it very appealing and lack of capacity still remains a premier market in my mind, if we can get there is a lot of competition. We're one of many in the hunt there. So nothing new report, we have a plan in place we're executing to it want to wait for the RFP to unfold. So we're nothing new in New York. Well, we're grateful for the clarity from the government. I think the process is moving very well. And I think a lot of concerns, some people haven't been eliminated. So we're just going to go into process and hoping to complete this thing in due course, but obviously, we're all pleased. I think all the operators are pleased how this is playing out. And we're hoping for a positive conclusion. I think a lot of the fears have been erased. Grant or Wilfred is going to comment, that's as far as I can take it. Thank you. Grant, do you want to take that because I have my own views, but I think you should. Hey David, no ever thought the additional gaming space in Macao is a bad thing as we focus more on base mass and premium mass, I think actually expands our ability to make more money, the junket business, we always know is a margin challenge business. I feel grateful, we have all this new space coming back to us that we can redeploy. And we're still going to the world's biggest gaming market, real land based and one of the biggest footprint. So as this as we as Grant and Wilfred and the team, rethink that space, I think it adds all kinds of premium opportunities for base mass, premium mass and direct premium as well. So to me, it's a very valuable transition to a higher focus margin business, that enables us to again, Singapore, I mean, Macao, the penetration is Chinese still, I think sub 3% for the China population, there's going to be a growth market, capacity will be an issue down the road, because there are new casinos opening. So I think that space may prove be very valuable as we get back to work in Macao, hopefully this year, or next. But I think we're lucky to have all that extra space, we can redeploy in a more profitable way down the road. So happy to have it back. Pat, you want to take that? Our biggest problem in the days ahead in MBS is as that Changi recovery continues, and passengers come back as our game, our biggest problem won't be ADRs can be putting have enough rooms to accommodate all the demand, ADR will climb either to casino direct or through cash customers or to convention. There'll be no problem getting back. That's not the issue. The issue as always been it'd be where capacity constrained in MBS, we need more sleeping rooms. And we'll get the ADR that markets, the recovery you're seeing here is in its infancy it's just beginning. And be assured that we can get the ADR back to pre-COVID levels and above in fact, I hope we can do much better with casino demand and driving casino ADR as well. Sure, thank you. It's good question. And we're watching like you are, I think, let's not ever dismiss the importance of China in any of our businesses, China's still a powerhouse as a consumer market. And we should never dismiss it as powerful till we get to $400 million a quarter without China, I mostly would think not. But then again, I would have thought we wouldn't have done this well, with Changi still having underperforming in terms of visitation. So, depends on like the U.S., I think you have to question what were the over indexing come from will Indonesia, Malaysia and other source markets over indexed and that's the question, we don't know the answer that, will there be pent-up demand coming out of Thailand and Vietnam and Indonesia. And could they -- could Korea outperform, I just don't know what the wait and see if those markets open up again, we're in uncharted waters here. It's new. But I would never dismiss the importance of China as a market for anybody in our retail business, or hotel business, or casino business. China is very, very critical to everybody in Asia. And you can see that in any market, we participate in. But how high is up without China returning, I do want to wait and see together. There's a lot of good drivers here that make us feel good, the visitation makes us feel there is opportunity there. Our renovation, it feels like it's been very impactful as comes online. The over indexing of non-China markets feels like it's coming on strong. But I think we'll revisit that and we'll have a better answer for you next quarter, we print our numbers. Patrick, do you want to grab that?"

            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "And Joe, one other thing it's Patrick, I think one thing to know when you look at Marina Bay Sands, is that we're not at capacity. And what I mean by that is, to Rob's point, if you look at the amount of airlift coming in to Singapore, it's not where it can be. But we're at levels that are very strong relative to 2019. If you look at, our not only volumes, which are really speaking to the premium mass segment from the catchment area, this is only going to grow. And the good news is we have our team together. One of the things that's been slowing some of the growth coming out of the pandemic, and really capturing some of the pent-up demand and return to normalcy is the fact that many operators on luxury segment didn't necessarily keep their team together throughout the pendency of the pandemic. We were fortunate enough to do that. And so now our team is ready to respond. So we have plenty of capacity to absorb the growth as it comes in. So our view is that this is a good start, but we have more room to run. Yes, sure. So a couple of things to think about. First off, just as you mentioned, after March 1, our gaming tax increased both by 3% in the Premium and the non-Premium side. So that 3% does impact margin. Now I think there are some other things going on in Singapore, there's some higher expenses that is used, there's utility costs that have gone up. There's other costs to operate in the market that have gone up inflation that you've seen in other markets are impacting some of the things that we buy. There's also some wage inflation because there's scarcity of labor in the marketplace in Singapore, so a high quality environment to work in. It's just a high demand as our economy continues to grow for high quality labor, so we've seen some labor increase. So there's some things that from a cost basis side are impacting our margins. But the flip side of this is we're not at full revenue yet. So as we grow revenue and as we make investments in these higher value suite products and as we grow some of the services that we offer to our patrons in the long run, we'd like to believe our margins return back towards where they were before, we just need to be operating under normal environment. So we still have some start-up, what's called fits and starts related to some expenses. And I think our goal is to get our margins back to where they were, but it's going to take some revenue growth for us to get there. Sure, absolutely. So, Rob referenced our visit to Singapore, it was a great visit on a lot of fronts, I think we spent time in the building. And we had the opportunity to continue our dialog around the IR2 expansion. We're very excited to begin, I think one of the things that the pandemic did unfortunately was slow down that process. There's just a lot of things that have to be considered to fit it in to this very complex and very busy environment to make it sort of fit all the requirements that are necessary to get the approvals to begin. And so I think we're working on that now. And it's something that we hope in the coming months that we'll be able to get more firm about a start date, but we're excited about it and working with the Government currently and hopefully we'll get a chance to begin soon. So, I think one of the things as a company that alternative pandemic, and part of the pandemic we've always focused on is how we allocate capital, and how we drive the highest returns for shareholders. And you may have heard in the past say that our highest and best use of capital do new development from the ground up. And that's really what we're focused on. If you look at the history of the company, and success in the way it's delivered outside shareholder returns is exploiting a strategy of building large scale integrated resorts in new jurisdictions. And that's what we're focused on. And so for us, I think we have opportunities unique to who we are, we have a long track record with Rob and his decades of experience, the rest of the team has decades of experience in developing these resorts. And so we're going to look to do that, before we look to buy anything, I don't think the idea is that we would never look at something, I think we're always interested, I think we're interested in seeing if there's a way to create greater returns for our shareholders. But as a practical matter, we're not an M&A driven business. And I think for us, our priorities are going to be look for new markets, develop, build and scale, and invest over the long-term to create sustainable and durable returns. And that's really what we're going to look to do. So I understand that there's variability, particularly in the digital side, there's a lot of things that have valuations now that may people see them as compelling for the long-term, there's perhaps some land based opportunities that may come up over time. But as a practical matter, like everyone else will look at it, see if it makes any sense for us. But we're really going to be focused on ground up development. That's who we are. Thanks, Chad. We'd already have been without it, that's up to the government make that decision. But it's a duopoly market. And I don't see it having impact either way. Timing of spend. Thanks, Robin. Steve, one thing I would say our company, as you know, has been through it's been an awfully difficult couple of years more than most because we're Asia focused. But we've now completed the sale in Las Vegas gives us more than ample liquidity. Now what happens? Singapore is up and making money and there's more to come. It's a very, we're very grateful for what's happening in Singapore. We see a lot better days ahead. The Macao licensing process is the same way it feels like we've survived it was a lot of people are concerned.  But in the end, it's worked out for everybody in a positive manner thus far. Hope that continues. And we're just waiting for the thing you referenced initially, which is when does Macao, when does the government rethink the zero COVID or how that play out? We don't know. Don't pretend to know. But that's the last thing waiting for it to get our company back to a much better place, but three of the four have been achieved. So we'll continue to press on with a license and wait patiently for the government to advise us on the reopening of Macao. Yes, sure. Happy to, I think some of it has to do with sort of startup across the quarter, I think one of the other things to note is that it's not fully recovered in with all the different segments, because there is sort of not as much FIT and MICE demand as we had across 2019. So you're going to see some ADR spread from that. But I think the most important thing to note is we're making as Rob referenced a $1 billion investment in our product there, over time, our ADR will be higher. So across the next six quarters, and let's sort of focus on at the end of '23 in time for Chinese New Year of '24, we are going to have 400 new suites that we've never had before. And they're the highest quality suites we've ever done as a company. And we're going to drive different ADR. So while we're out a couple of 100 suites now we've got rooms out of inventory, we've had a lot of things going on through the building, it started period, I wouldn't look at this ADR is representative. And so over the next couple of quarters, as we have rooms out of inventory, it's going to -- there's going to be some choppiness, but by the time we're done getting into '23 and getting across '23, when the project is completed, then you'll have a good look what ADR can really be under the value of the full investment, which is substantial. It's basically a complete redo of Towers 1 and Towers 2 and some of the common spaces and amenity spaces that we have. It's going to be a fundamentally different experience for our guests. And we hope and believe very strongly, they'll pay a lot more for it, because it will attract a higher value tourist and that's really our goal. Thanks, David. Yes, sure. Happy to, I think at this point, all we can do is be optimistic about the public health posture that Singapore shown, they have shown a lot of leadership, they have a significant history of investment in their hospital system and their public health infrastructure. And I think they're proceeding as they've said, I think they broadcast it all along, and they followed what they've laid out. So as we sit here right now, I think they're moving in the way they said they're going to do, which is continue to have visitation, continue to be involved in the growth of their economy and move forward with this is an endemic situation. But we don't know. And I think this is something where we've obviously shown flexibility to respond as needed to support the government their initiatives, but at this time, it seems like we're heading in the right direction. But could that change in the future? We don't know."

            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yes, we're here. Good morning. Sorry. Just momentarily lost you. Yes, Joe, I think obviously, second quarter, we were running at this $110 million EBITDA loss. So we'll basically just over a million a day. Now as we went into the second half of June, we have a local outbreak of COVID in Macao, and therefore, into the third quarter. Clearly the revenue environment is slower than it has been in the second quarter, especially with the last weeks [indiscernible] casinos as well. So I think you can look back to where we were in 2020. In a very, very low tourism environment in the middle of that year. And take it from that in terms of the actual daily cash burn rate, although I think our operating expenses have moderated a little bit since then. But that's the ballpark region. Yes, I think one thing that's important to note is that we view Marina Bay Sands as the best building in the world. And in our mind, it's just an unbelievable opportunity to continue invest and operate the building and grow it over time. So I don't think we view it any differently. We think the market opportunity in Singapore is absolutely unique. And, we're very committed to long-term investment there. So for us, I'm not sure it matters, who operates it, that's up to the Singapore government and to the owners of that business. But for us, we're just focused on, continuing to develop our property and grow the market as best we can. Yes, thanks for the question. I think as you alluded to, there's not much that we can help with in terms of any speculation on timelines or changes. I think what we're focused on is, what was happening in Macao. So I think, the things that we can effect is to make sure that we do help the prevailing government policy so that we can actually get Macao reopen back with Zhuhai that's a neighboring city in Mainland as quickly as possible. And that means, I think aligning ourselves fully and safely with the overall COVID policy. And that's what's happening right now. And so hopefully, in over the coming weeks, we will be progressively reopening all of the facilities that we've had to close in the past week. That's what we're really focused on. And it's really not a place to speculate on future changes on the overall health policy. I don't know if Wilfred has more to add on that. I think that's right, Rob. Yes, I'll just going to add that, obviously, we're very appreciative during this difficult time on the COVID front, that the government and the legislature were able to move forward to complete the passing of the revised gaming law in towards the end of June, and that we were able to also execute the six month extension that takes us to the end of this year. So I think the whole process is moving forward expeditiously. And as Rob said, we look forward to participating in the tendering process. Yes, sure. I think we've been watching as the market has been evolving and also planning for the future. I think a lot of the salons and suddenly that applies to the new salons that we've developed as part of The Grand Suites at Four Seasons, and the London and Macao projects. I think they're really premium salons, premium gaming salons that could be applicable and used by the different segments whether that's the VIP rolling or the premium mass. So, clearly I think Macao overall, may be relooking at how each operator redeploys their assets. But as far as we're concerned especially the new products that we've developed over the past two years, we feel pretty positive about redeploying a lot of those gaming spaces for the premium mass segment. But also over time, as we look towards the future also the premium direct segment and attracting the overseas markets in the Rest of Asia, into those products. So we've been currently going through a planning exercise on the future deployment of those areas. But as the market evolves and as things normalize, we'll be able to get more definition around that. But even as of the past 12 months, we've been redeploying some of those rooms that were assigned to the Rolling segment, to the non-Rolling segments."

A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release. We have posted supplementary earnings slides on our Investor Relations website. We may refer to those slides during the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this presentation is being recorded.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Goldstein : Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, and good morning to our colleagues in Asia. Some brief comments, and we'll go to Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemics impact, the travel restrictions to press visitation, our financial results in both Macao and Singapore this quarter. We did generate positive EBITDA for the quarter in Singapore and for the company in total. The [business] in Singapore as the travel corridors established last quarter have been replaced with an introduction of the backdated traveler framework, which allows backdate travelers to enter Singapore in much the same way as prior to the pandemic. In short term, as we are open for business in Singapore.  Our conviction and long-term opportunity in the Singapore market remains steadfast. The $1 billion capital investment currently underway at MBS introduced luxurious new suite product and amenities that disorder. In Macao, our considerable investment Londoner are nearing completion. As the market recovers 4 Seasons, Londoner will provide growth opportunities in both premium and mass customer segments. We continue to have the largest footprint in the Macao marketplace, and we appreciate the opportunity to provide input in the public consultation process, and we look forward to participating in the retendering process as well. While the current quarter results in Macao were impacted severely by the enhanced travel restrictions in China, customer demand and spending Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective in periods when the restrictions have been relaxed. We remain confident that we return to positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover. We consider our portfolio of resorts in Asia to be outstanding the platform for growth for the years ahead.  In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities to develop large-scale resorts in both the United States and Asia. The sale of Las Vegas was completed this quarter, which creates additional liquidity and optionality. Lastly, we can build out our digital presence and to explore multiple opportunities. We will provide additional color at the appropriate time. Let's go to your questions.\nDaniel Briggs: Paul, we're ready to go to questions. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Joe Greff from JP Morgan.\nJoe Greff: Rob, I love to get a little bit more detail on the recent experience in Singapore with the VTL framework? And can you tell us or share with us business volumes, visitation improvements in March and April to date? And when we kind of look at the first quarter and looking at the $121 million of hold normalized EBITDA. How much of that was sort of the last month of the quarter, given the benefits from more international inbound tourism?\nRobGoldstein: Yes. Joe, it\u2019s a fair question. The core to MBS was clearly driven, it moved upward as you went along. I started $17 million in January, went to $46 million in the hours of February. We had $58 million of EBITDA in March. And that trajectory is continuing the momentum is going upward in April. I think \u2013 look, Singapore is back, and it will experience the same post-COVID numbers as you see in the U.S., in my opinion. The question is how fast does it get there? The demand is there. It will continue. Assuming there\u2019s no more surprises from the COVID situation. We like to think that Singapore returned to $1 billion run rate in this year. So $58 million in March feels pretty good, and that momentum is continuing.\nJoe Greff: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And hopefully, I\u2019m not going to follow up Macao-related question but is much to ask. Can you talk about Thailand and sort of that as an integrated resort opportunity and what the latest is there? I know there have been press reports with your efforts and that as an opportunity.\nRobGoldstein: Yes, I think it\u2019s premature, Joe, and we\u2019re looking at a lot of different things in Asia, and that\u2019s certainly a list of things, but I think it\u2019s premature to get ahead of ourselves there. I\u2019ll pass on that.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.\nStephen Grambling: Maybe sticking with new development opportunities. There's obviously been a lot of back and forth in New York, specifically New York City, different boroughs, you've been seeing some headlines around Times Square. Just curious what you're seeing there, how we should think about that as an opportunity?\nRobGoldstein: Well, New York has been on our radar for a long time. We continue to be in the hunt there. I don't want to get into static borrowers locations. I think that's proprietary. But we remain interested. I think it's a huge market for us. We've been very clear about that in the past. The process is quite a long way to go. And we'll just keep you posted as we hear and learn things, but we're in the hunt and we'll see how it works out for us.\nStephen Grambling: And then you did mention you'll discuss digital when the time is right and they obviously say patience is a virtue, which is clearly paid off looking at some of these stocks. So as you think about the opportunity set in front of you, has anything changed in terms of your thinking of what areas of the industry might be more or less interesting to dig into even before considering where the investment might end up?\nPatrick Dumont: So it's Patrick. So I think nothing has really changed in our view. We take a very long-term perspective on digital. I think our comments have been pretty consistent across the quarters. We're really in a growth and investment stage. So it's very early on, and we have something to talk about, we'll definitely start discussing it. But at this point, it's a very early stage. We're building a team and looking forward to the future.\nStephen Grambling: Awesome. Maybe one last one if I can sneak it in then. So since the development opportunities feel like they're still pushed out and you've gotten some proceeds in from Vegas. I think you maybe have mentioned this in the remarks, but just remind us in terms of thinking about capital allocation priorities. I mean is buyback something that's on the table that you'd be thinking about with some of those proceeds? Or do you feel like there's enough other things to spend the money on the near term?\nPatrick Dumont: No problem. This is a question that I think we get pretty often. I'll refer to the answers that we gave in our last quarterly call. But I think the key thing to take away is we're very focused on new development. The sale of Las Vegas was really to reinvest capital in high growth opportunities that we think are unique to our company. We feel very strongly about our development capabilities and our ability to execute large-scale developments in new markets. And we think there's a lot of them out there, a lot of potential. And so we're waiting to see this 1 come forward. And as Rob said, where we can invest to get the highest returns. In terms of return of capital, I think we've always said that the dividend is really the cornerstone of our turn capital program. It's something that we want to look at in terms of really long-term operational cash flow growth, and then we'll size it accordingly and look to that to recur before we actually start the dividend again.  In terms of share repurchases, we've always said we've been opportunistic to return capital that way as well. If you look at our past, we've actually returned a fair amount of capital through share versus when we felt that we had the excess liquidity. So I think at this point, our priority is to make sure we get out of the pandemic, make sure we have ample liquidity and a protected balance sheet to ensure that we recover from our pandemic operations. We can support a local host market, support our team members as we go through that process. Then we're going to focus on new development and growth and investment in our existing markets, which we've been doing throughout the pandemic and then we'll look to restart the dividend as operating cash flows recover. And then lastly, I think we'll look at share repurchases where the opportunities arise.\nRobGoldstein: Let's not forget that we are investing $1 billion currently in Singapore. We're trying to invest more in Singapore. And we think Macao when things reopen might be opportunistic as well. People forget how much capital we could put to work in our existing marketplaces.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: Just maybe to actually touch on Macao for a minute. Rob, there have been some different starts as it relates to the reopening in Hong Kong, and I think some positive progress there as case counts have come down. Any signposts maybe out of that market and maybe reconnecting that with Macao that the local team could give us some color on?\nRobGoldstein: Sure. Grant, do you on the call?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes. I mean at this stage, there is no new information or news in terms of quarantine-free travel from Hong Kong to Macao. I think Hong Kong cases have been improved. But we're not at the point where there's any change in the quarantine policy.\nShaun Kelley: Grant, maybe just to clarify, is that specifically as it relates to its interaction with Macao? Or what about for visitors coming from overseas possibly opening up a corridor to Singapore? So maybe help us think a little bit more broadly, if you could?\nGrant Chum: I'm sorry, are you referring to overseas visitors from [indiscernible]\nShaun Kelley: Yes. Either, I think arriving in Hong Kong and then, I guess, coming in from inbound places or leaving Hong Kong going to places like Singapore.\nGrant Chum: Sorry, you're asking a question about people going to Singapore or to Macao?\nShaun Kelley: Well, specifically talking about -- just is there any sign that Hong Kong is loosening of its overall visitation policy because it's been pretty closed from the external perspective. I guess that's where I'm trying to go.\nGrant Chum: Sorry, I'd be asking about Hong Kong. Yes, they have relaxed. So non-residents can now travel to Hong Kong from the 1st of May and that was -- that hasn't been possible for some time. So you can go to Hong Kong from next month overseas into Hong Kong, but you would still have to be subject to the quarantine policy once you enter Hong Kong.\nRobGoldstein: Something more to say, Glen, I'm going to cut you off, more to say?\nGrant Chum: No, that's it. That Okay.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS.\nRobin Farley: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Singapore and any change in the composition of business there in terms of what's coming back? Is it more mass? Is it more VIP? Is it higher win per visitor than what you saw before or just more absolute number of visitors. Just kind of what are you seeing sort of come back first?\nRobGoldstein: The answer is yes. It's all coming back. I mean it's demand over there for -- in the month of March, we saw outsized demand from free independent travelers on the pure leisure side, we saw premium mass. We saw high-end plate coming out of over the relm. I just think Singapore is a unique position. It's -- obviously, in Macao is in a difficult place right now, so people are going to gravitate to other opportunities. They want to travel. They're no different than what we've seen here in the U.S. I think our MBS products as a very, very unique opportunistic window here. We're hoping Macao's up obviously sooner. But until it does, I think you'll see a lot more demand than typical. I think it's from all segments, the team there is being very good about what happened in the month of March. And again, it's leisure travel, it's casino, it's is VIP casino, it's premium mass as casino. It's universal. And it feels like renewal very positive beginning. And hopefully, without a COVID interruption or a change in policy, I believe MBS is going to be very productive '22.\nRobin Farley: Great. And then my follow-up question is about you had an announcement a week or 2 ago about it's probably a small investment, and I think it was sort of an integrity-related business for online sports betting. And I wonder if you could just talk about that because it seems like there are some B2B online sports companies that already sort of provide that kind of for free as part of their services between the leagues and the sports books. And so I just -- I wonder if you could talk about what interested you in that angle or what's different about that? And kind of what's offered almost for free really by the other OSB B2B providers?\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. It's Patrick. And I think what you'll see over time is us make investments in small companies where we think they have a competitive advantage in the B2B space that has a lot of growth potential and also where we think over time we may form it to a larger platform. So from our standpoint, we're looking at a variety different businesses that are in start off or early stage in order to make sure that we stay in front of technological innovation in our industry. And so this is part of a broader strategy. It is a relatively small investment relative to Las Vegas and -- we think over time, this investment in others will help contribute to our overall digital efforts. So I'm not going to get into the exact thesis behind every investment that we do. There's a long-term plan for what we're approaching. And I think over time, you'll start to see how that evolves.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: I just have 2 kind of time line-related questions. And I don't know, Rob, maybe answer the first and then perhaps something on color on Macao and the time line there. But just in terms of MBS, obviously, construction and things along those lines in this type of environment is very hard to predict. And I have not gotten a chance to get through the slides yet to see if there any changes to kind of your expectations for the time line there. But what are some of the goalposts in terms of construction on that? And then secondarily, as it pertains to the tender process and whatnot in Macao. How do you guys see the time line for that shaping up as we move through the rest of 2022?\nRobGoldstein: Carl, in Singapore, as you know, we're underway in a rather extensive renovation, $1 billion-plus renovation in Singapore that's underway as we speak. And it's going to take a while. It won't complete until the '23 but it's going to be a very encompassing. We've had -- as everyone in the world has been impacted by COVID, both getting supplies and labor has been issued, but it's happy it's underway. We're still working through our issues with IR too. We were not ready to talk about that today because we're still working through issues there. Same issues supplies, labor costs, et cetera. We intend to complete IR 1, again, '23 IR2 is token for interpretation. As for Macao time lines and the retendering, I'm going to turn it over to Wilfred or Grant to take that question. Maybe Wilfred, the best suited.\nWilfred Wong: Thank you. The time line for retendering of the concession is progressing according to the time line announced by the Macao SAR government. Now currently, a few things are at play, 2 bills relating to the gaming law is -- has been approved by the legislative assembly and will be approved in full after the panel discussion before the end of this legislative session in August. And we are hearing all kinds of suggestion that it will be earlier than August. At this stage, we are going to be granted an extension of the current concession until the end of 2022. And that is the time that we expect the retendering exercise will be completed. And so after the amendment of the law, then the retendering procedure will start a lot of information about the retender will come out. We are in the process of preparing for that retendering exercise and hopefully, everything will be done before the end of 2022.\nCarlo Santarelli: That's helpful. So just so I'm clear, in August, you'll more or less have everything you need from the gaming law perspective? And then that period from, say, August, if not maybe earlier through December will be the formal tendering process when everything is more or less buttoned up. Is that the right interpretation?\nWilfred Wong: That's right.\nOperator: The next question is coming from George Choi from Citigroup. George?\nGeorge Choi: A couple of questions from me. Firstly, Macao. The Macao Corp has recently ruled that a couple of your competitors are joining and separately liable for some illegal deposits for I guess, how do you see the likelihood that you guys will also be found liable for this potential liability after the recent close down of the major changes there?\nRobGoldstein: Grant, do you want to handle that?\nGrant Chum: Sure. Thanks, Josh, for the question. I think, as you know, the cessation of operations of all of these fixed-room junket promoters, obviously happened fairly recently in December of last year. And as a result of that, obviously, there are some new court cases being raised by various stakeholders and participants in that system. Currently, there is nothing material to report from Sands China perspective. There are a few cases ongoing, but none of them are material, and we will continue to monitor the situation and obviously report back if there any changes.\nGeorge Choi: And my second question is on your balance sheet. Now clearly, the first quarter was quite difficult for your Macao operations is putting a lot of stress on your balance Sands China. When it gets to a point where Sands China needs to raise funds, could you guys consider equity as option or is because of that still cheap enough that you would continue to look to response from the decapital market?\nRobGoldstein: Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: It's Patrick. So a couple of thoughts here. I think we're very optimistic about the long-term future of Macao. We understand there's articles out about concerns around liquidity. I think we have a very strong balance sheet. Yes, we've received some stress over the last few years under the pandemics tough operating conditions, I think we all have. But the good news is that our company as a group has a lot of liquidity a lot of different options. I think the good news is also that we were an investment-grade company during the pandemic, which does a lot about the market's view about our ability to raise additional capital. So from our standpoint, I think we have a lot of flexibility.  Our balance sheet was designed to withstand shocks and a lot of variability in our respective operating markets. I think we've proven that. And I think where we are today is we'll look to see how the operations continue coming out of the pandemic, which hopefully soon, look at our liquidity to review. I think we have cash of the parent, we have cash around the system. We have an investment-grade credit rating. We have access to credit markets. And I think the good news is we position ourselves well to benefit from the recovery on the other side. So I think we have a lot of flexibility, and we'll use it as net\nOperator: Next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie.\nChad Beynon: I wanted to ask about inflation. I know it's obviously something that people are a little bit more focused on here in North America and it's different in different regions of the world. But wondering if you could kind of talk about the labor inflationary environment or employment situation in your key markets, Singapore and Macao? And how that could potentially impact margins when the business is fully recovered on the revenue side?\nRobGoldstein: I don't want to say one thing about our business. Obviously, margin is inflation. It's a question we're anticipating. But I would say that I believe the revenue side of the equation is going to more than take care of itself as far as margins. We're going to be really -- I'd be shocked if will see a big return in Singapore this year and then hopefully a big return in Macao in '23, hopefully, maybe '22, I don't know. We don't have any visibility more than you do about what's going to happen in China, to be clear. But I do think, just like here in the U.S., margins have gone very powerfully positive because the demand is there. I only think Asians are different. The equation is going to be driven by excessive revenue, I think, in Singapore, we'll see it this year, I believe, and hopefully see in Macao this year or next. As for the operating entities, Grant discussed as you see as far as Macao, for example, in wage inflation, I don't know how to address that question.\nGrant Chum: Sure, Rob. I think right now, Macao is a slightly different situation. If you look at the wage trend, it's very moderate, if not flattish in terms of wage inflation. But obviously, that's for reasons that are not hard to discern because there is pressure on unemployment since it's such a tourism-dependent economy. And then interestingly, in terms of construction works costs are, again, either in line with prior years or if not going down somewhat, again, because of the demand supply situation that's specific to Macao as a lot of large scale works have moderated, they being completed. So at this stage, we're not seeing any significant signs on the inflation front.  Of course, there are some supplies such as food and so on, where we do experience inflation, but obviously, thoughtful for the totality of our business, this is not going to be material. But I think the important point is what Rob said, I think you also have to consider for our type of business, the revenue side of the equation, which I think is going to be the more dominant driver. -- is obviously prices tick off\nPatrick Dumont: And just to sort of 1 other thought. I think -- the important thing to note is where you'll see the impact of inflation is really in construction costs and in materials that go into construction inputs for large-scale projects. You see that in the U.S., you'll see it in Singapore and you'll start to see in other markets in Asia. As people come out of the pandemic and really there's a pent-up demand pipeline of things that needed to get done as well as a shortage of labor and a shortage of labor movement related to pandemic restrictions. So that is something that is a likely thing to be seen, you're already experiencing a little bit of it in certain markets. I think the other thing is, the good news is that inflation also comes pricing. And so our business is not tied into any long-term contracts. We have the ability to operate within the market. Singapore has always been a very high quality place for labor. It's been an expensive labor market. It's always been very tight, and we've always managed it. So I have faith in the team take on our execution capability to maintain margins through the cycle. And I think that's really the nature of our business that we have pricing power. We have the ability to change rates as a hotel as a consumer products company and really work through the changing inflation and in effect, make that part of the business margin.\nChad Beynon: And then separately, just on -- kind of back on the digital portfolio opportunities that you talked about just given the current valuation change that we've seen in a lot of the public companies, has anything changed just in terms of the total amount of money that you want to invest in this space given that there might be some really good opportunities in the near term just because of a valuation disconnect? Or are you still kind of disciplined in terms of the total amount that you would put forward towards this effort?\nRobGoldstein: I believe we have to be disciplined. And the reason I say that is our core business, and let's be honest, our balance sheet is what it is. It's in a pretty good place. If our business returns in Singapore, like we anticipate, -- and then behind that comes to Macao, we get back to $4 billion or $5 billion, $6 billion EBITDA. Our investment portfolio approach may change as it relates to digital. But at this time, we're going to stay doing what we're doing now, which is being very disciplined waiting for our core business return because there's no 1 like us. If the Macao comes back and I think it will be back hopefully sooner than later, Singapore is coming back, we'll be in a very different place in 6 months or a year and that may change our thinking. I think it's pretty simple. We want to get back to our core strength and then we visit other things at that time.\nPatrick Dumont: And I think 1 other thing that's important to note is we're very much focused on building rather than buying. We want to make sure that we create a lot of long-term value. Our company has a history of being a platform of development in entrepreneurship, and we are taking that approach through our digital efforts in several different areas. And we think over time, that will provide the most reward for shareholders. So we're very patient. We're thinking long term. And yes, there are cycles in valuations across the digital space. In our mind, we'll execute against our long-term strategy and take advantage where we can.\nOperator: The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: With respect to the U.S. land-based opportunities that's out there. If you sort of have your druthers or how your wishes come to pass, what does the LVS U.S. land-based presence look like over time?\nRobGoldstein: Any place there's very large-scale buildings that can create large EBITDA. We're not looking to be a small regional player obviously. So that limits the opportunities doesn't to Texas, New York. We failed in Florida recently, but we're not done with Florida. We're still looking at that. And there thereaf places we can go and invest the kind of money on investment, the kind of returns we want, we're not going to be buying small businesses. So I think at this point, as you talk to you today, it would have to be Texas, New York and perhaps Florida.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.\nSteve Wieczynski: Just 1 question for me. Rob, you talked about getting to that $1 billion EBITDA run rate in Singapore by potentially by the end of the year. And I'm not sure you're going to answer this. But is it fair to say that March and maybe more so April on a monthly run rate basis is enough to get you to that $1 billion run rate level? And I'm just really trying to understand a little more how strong recent trends have been?\nRobGoldstein: Yes. Well, I guess, looking at March, you're at about $700 million run rate if you take you annualize March, and April looks better at this point. So I don't think it takes a lot to get there. I mean, to be honest, I don't know why we wouldn't get there. We won't get into specific numbers in April, but the trending Singapore, as I referenced earlier, Robin, someone asked the question about what's happening it's outsized demand in all segments. So why wouldn't it happen? I mean I think it's going to blow past the $1 billion, frankly, I think it should. It just depends on if we see any pushback COVID restrictions. I mean we have an outsized opportunity.  Singapore is the best product at all in the market today. Macao essentially is not available. I think we compete very well anyway in Singapore, but it's unique now. And I think it's -- it should at $1 billion and better. The only negative there, as you well know, is China is still relatively close to us. So that's the market we'll miss but we feel very confident about our prospects. In the last month, things have gone from hesitancy to full-bore excitement about what's happening in Singapore. And I think the government -- I think I hope they show our enthusiasm.\nOperator: And the final question is coming from Ben Chaiken from Credit Suisse.\nBen Chaiken: I guess just 2 or 3 follow-ups on Singapore. You mentioned $58 million in March. Can you remind me, is that -- I believe there was some tax changes coming into play, I guess, simplistically, VIP and mass each go up roughly 300 basis points. Is that -- was that in March already in the numbers you mentioned?\nRobGoldstein: Yes, it was as of March 1, that was - were impacted as of March 1 by the changes you referenced, yes.\nDavid Katz: Cool. And then two, I think in the last few days, there's been some changes in Singapore regarding travel restrictions -- can you remind us maybe -- can you just refresh us where we are today versus where we were in March?\nRobGoldstein: Where we are today is if you're a vaccine, you can get into Singapore pretty easily. There are still restrictions and you've got to be -- if you're in the casino, you've got to be smoking or drinking water or something to I think your mask off. But pretty much, it's -- if you're a vaccinate, you have full access to Singapore. It's a very different place than it was a month ago. So that's why we're still bullish in Singapore. It basically is quarantine free entry for all vaccinated traveler. And no quote on number of daily arrivals is no more strict. So we're back in the business in Singapore in a very positive way.\nBen Chaiken: Got it. And then just last quick one, not to get ahead of ourselves, but -- you mentioned $1 billion a few times. But why not, I mean you're doing $1.7 billion, right, pre-COVID and the new hotel coming, like what's -- is the billing just a round number to --\nRobGoldstein: There's no new hotel coming. We're not building any hotel yet. So there's no new hotel. There's a renovation of a current hotel. Look, we just see $1 billion of benchmark. We think that's attainable. We're not trying to oversell it or over -- get too excited ahead of ourselves. Let's see where it goes. We're looking at the results in the U.S. We're very excited what's happened in the U.S. The demand is there. We've seen a reason why Asia shouldn't just keep ramping more positively. And again, as we referenced, that's a very unique asset. $1.7 billion at the peak was the performance of MBS. We get back to some time Yes, I think we will and then beyond that, but it won't be this year.\nOperator: There were no other questions in queue. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "So it's Patrick. So I think nothing has really changed in our view. We take a very long-term perspective on digital.

So I'm not going to get into the exact thesis behind every investment that we do. There's a long-term plan for what we're approaching. And I think over time, you'll start to see how that evolves. It's Patrick. So a couple of thoughts here. I think we're very optimistic about the long-term future of Macao. We understand there's articles out about concerns around liquidity. I think we have a very strong balance sheet. Yes, we've received some stress over the last few years under the pandemics tough operating conditions, I think we all have. But the good news is that our company as a group has a lot of liquidity a lot of different options. I think the good news is also that we were an investment-grade company during the pandemic, which does a lot about the market's view about our ability to raise additional capital. So from our standpoint, I think we have a lot of flexibility.  Our balance sheet was designed to withstand shocks and a lot of variability in our respective operating markets. I think we've proven that. And I think where we are today is we'll look to see how the operations continue coming out of the pandemic, which hopefully soon, look at our liquidity to review. I think we have cash of the parent, we have cash around the system. We have an investment-grade credit rating. We have access to credit markets. And I think the good news is we position ourselves well to benefit from the recovery on the other side. So I think we have a lot of flexibility, and we'll use it as net And just to sort of 1 other thought. I think -- the important thing to note is where you'll see the impact of inflation is really in construction costs and in materials that go into construction inputs for large-scale projects. You see that in the U.S., you'll see it in Singapore and you'll start to see in other markets in Asia. As people come out of the pandemic and really there's a pent-up demand pipeline of things that needed to get done as well as a shortage of labor and a shortage of labor movement related to pandemic restrictions. So that is something that is a likely thing to be seen, you're already experiencing a little bit of it in certain markets. I think the other thing is, the good news is that inflation also comes pricing. And so our business is not tied into any long-term contracts. We have the ability to operate within the market. Singapore has always been a very high quality place for labor. It's been an expensive labor market. It's always been very tight, and we've always managed it. So I have faith in the team take on our execution capability to maintain margins through the cycle. And I think that's really the nature of our business that we have pricing power. We have the ability to change rates as a hotel as a consumer products company and really work through the changing inflation and in effect, make that part of the business margin. And I think 1 other thing that's important to note is we're very much focused on building rather than buying. We want to make sure that we create a lot of long-term value. Our company has a history of being a platform of development in entrepreneurship, and we are taking that approach through our digital efforts in several different areas. And we think over time, that will provide the most reward for shareholders. So we're very patient. We're thinking long term. And yes, there are cycles in valuations across the digital space. In our mind, we'll execute against our long-term strategy and take advantage where we can."

            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon, and good morning to our colleagues in Asia. Some brief comments, and we'll go to Q&A. Our results continue to reflect the pandemics impact, the travel restrictions to press visitation, our financial results in both Macao and Singapore this quarter. We did generate positive EBITDA for the quarter in Singapore and for the company in total. The [business] in Singapore as the travel corridors established last quarter have been replaced with an introduction of the backdated traveler framework, which allows backdate travelers to enter Singapore in much the same way as prior to the pandemic. In short term, as we are open for business in Singapore.  Our conviction and long-term opportunity in the Singapore market remains steadfast. The $1 billion capital investment currently underway at MBS introduced luxurious new suite product and amenities that disorder. In Macao, our considerable investment Londoner are nearing completion. As the market recovers 4 Seasons, Londoner will provide growth opportunities in both premium and mass customer segments. We continue to have the largest footprint in the Macao marketplace, and we appreciate the opportunity to provide input in the public consultation process, and we look forward to participating in the retendering process as well. While the current quarter results in Macao were impacted severely by the enhanced travel restrictions in China, customer demand and spending Macao have proven resilient at the premium mass level from both a gaming and retail perspective in periods when the restrictions have been relaxed. We remain confident that we return to positive cash flow in both Macao and Singapore in the future as restrictions are eased and travel and tourism recover. We consider our portfolio of resorts in Asia to be outstanding the platform for growth for the years ahead.  In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities to develop large-scale resorts in both the United States and Asia. The sale of Las Vegas was completed this quarter, which creates additional liquidity and optionality. Lastly, we can build out our digital presence and to explore multiple opportunities. We will provide additional color at the appropriate time. Let's go to your questions. Yes. Joe, it's a fair question. The core to MBS was clearly driven, it moved upward as you went along. I started $17 million in January, went to $46 million in the hours of February. We had $58 million of EBITDA in March. And that trajectory is continuing the momentum is going upward in April. I think \u2013 look, Singapore is back, and it will experience the same post-COVID numbers as you see in the U.S., in my opinion. The question is how fast does it get there? The demand is there. It will continue. Assuming there's no more surprises from the COVID situation. We like to think that Singapore returned to $1 billion run rate in this year. So $58 million in March feels pretty good, and that momentum is continuing. Yes, I think it's premature, Joe, and we're looking at a lot of different things in Asia, and that's certainly a list of things, but I think it's premature to get ahead of ourselves there. I'll pass on that. Well, New York has been on our radar for a long time. We continue to be in the hunt there. I don't want to get into static borrowers locations. I think that's proprietary. But we remain interested. I think it's a huge market for us. We've been very clear about that in the past. The process is quite a long way to go. And we'll just keep you posted as we hear and learn things, but we're in the hunt and we'll see how it works out for us. Let's not forget that we are investing $1 billion currently in Singapore. We're trying to invest more in Singapore. And we think Macao when things reopen might be opportunistic as well. People forget how much capital we could put to work in our existing marketplaces. Sure. Grant, do you on the call? Something more to say, Glen, I'm going to cut you off, more to say? The answer is yes. It's all coming back. I mean it's demand over there for -- in the month of March, we saw outsized demand from free independent travelers on the pure leisure side, we saw premium mass. We saw high-end plate coming out of over the relm. I just think Singapore is a unique position. It's -- obviously, in Macao is in a difficult place right now, so people are going to gravitate to other opportunities. They want to travel. They're no different than what we've seen here in the U.S. I think our MBS products as a very, very unique opportunistic window here. We're hoping Macao's up obviously sooner. But until it does, I think you'll see a lot more demand than typical. I think it's from all segments, the team there is being very good about what happened in the month of March. And again, it's leisure travel, it's casino, it's is VIP casino, it's premium mass as casino. It's universal. And it feels like renewal very positive beginning. And hopefully, without a COVID interruption or a change in policy, I believe MBS is going to be very productive '22. Carl, in Singapore, as you know, we're underway in a rather extensive renovation, $1 billion-plus renovation in Singapore that's underway as we speak. And it's going to take a while. It won't complete until the '23 but it's going to be a very encompassing. We've had -- as everyone in the world has been impacted by COVID, both getting supplies and labor has been issued, but it's happy it's underway. We're still working through our issues with IR too. We were not ready to talk about that today because we're still working through issues there. Same issues supplies, labor costs, et cetera. We intend to complete IR 1, again, '23 IR2 is token for interpretation. As for Macao time lines and the retendering, I'm going to turn it over to Wilfred or Grant to take that question. Maybe Wilfred, the best suited. Grant, do you want to handle that? Patrick? I don't want to say one thing about our business. Obviously, margin is inflation. It's a question we're anticipating. But I would say that I believe the revenue side of the equation is going to more than take care of itself as far as margins. We're going to be really -- I'd be shocked if will see a big return in Singapore this year and then hopefully a big return in Macao in '23, hopefully, maybe '22, I don't know. We don't have any visibility more than you do about what's going to happen in China, to be clear. But I do think, just like here in the U.S., margins have gone very powerfully positive because the demand is there. I only think Asians are different. The equation is going to be driven by excessive revenue, I think, in Singapore, we'll see it this year, I believe, and hopefully see in Macao this year or next. As for the operating entities, Grant discussed as you see as far as Macao, for example, in wage inflation, I don't know how to address that question. I believe we have to be disciplined. And the reason I say that is our core business, and let's be honest, our balance sheet is what it is. It's in a pretty good place. If our business returns in Singapore, like we anticipate, -- and then behind that comes to Macao, we get back to $4 billion or $5 billion, $6 billion EBITDA. Our investment portfolio approach may change as it relates to digital. But at this time, we're going to stay doing what we're doing now, which is being very disciplined waiting for our core business return because there's no 1 like us. If the Macao comes back and I think it will be back hopefully sooner than later, Singapore is coming back, we'll be in a very different place in 6 months or a year and that may change our thinking. I think it's pretty simple. We want to get back to our core strength and then we visit other things at that time. Any place there's very large-scale buildings that can create large EBITDA. We're not looking to be a small regional player obviously. So that limits the opportunities doesn't to Texas, New York. We failed in Florida recently, but we're not done with Florida. We're still looking at that. And there thereaf places we can go and invest the kind of money on investment, the kind of returns we want, we're not going to be buying small businesses. So I think at this point, as you talk to you today, it would have to be Texas, New York and perhaps Florida. Yes. Well, I guess, looking at March, you're at about $700 million run rate if you take you annualize March, and April looks better at this point. So I don't think it takes a lot to get there. I mean, to be honest, I don't know why we wouldn't get there. We won't get into specific numbers in April, but the trending Singapore, as I referenced earlier, Robin, someone asked the question about what's happening it's outsized demand in all segments. So why wouldn't it happen? I mean I think it's going to blow past the $1 billion, frankly, I think it should. It just depends on if we see any pushback COVID restrictions. I mean we have an outsized opportunity.  Singapore is the best product at all in the market today. Macao essentially is not available. I think we compete very well anyway in Singapore, but it's unique now. And I think it's -- it should at $1 billion and better. The only negative there, as you well know, is China is still relatively close to us. So that's the market we'll miss but we feel very confident about our prospects. In the last month, things have gone from hesitancy to full-bore excitement about what's happening in Singapore. And I think the government -- I think I hope they show our enthusiasm. Yes, it was as of March 1, that was - were impacted as of March 1 by the changes you referenced, yes. Where we are today is if you're a vaccine, you can get into Singapore pretty easily. There are still restrictions and you've got to be -- if you're in the casino, you've got to be smoking or drinking water or something to I think your mask off. But pretty much, it's -- if you're a vaccinate, you have full access to Singapore. It's a very different place than it was a month ago. So that's why we're still bullish in Singapore. It basically is quarantine free entry for all vaccinated traveler. And no quote on number of daily arrivals is no more strict. So we're back in the business in Singapore in a very positive way. There's no new hotel coming. We're not building any hotel yet. So there's no new hotel. There's a renovation of a current hotel. Look, we just see $1 billion of benchmark. We think that's attainable. We're not trying to oversell it or over -- get too excited ahead of ourselves. Let's see where it goes. We're looking at the results in the U.S. We're very excited what's happened in the U.S. The demand is there. We've seen a reason why Asia shouldn't just keep ramping more positively. And again, as we referenced, that's a very unique asset. $1.7 billion at the peak was the performance of MBS. We get back to some time Yes, I think we will and then beyond that, but it won't be this year."

Now currently, a few things are at play, 2 bills relating to the gaming law is -- has been approved by the legislative assembly and will be approved in full after the panel discussion before the end of this legislative session in August. And we are hearing all kinds of suggestion that it will be earlier than August. At this stage, we are going to be granted an extension of the current concession until the end of 2022. And that is the time that we expect the retendering exercise will be completed. And so after the amendment of the law, then the retendering procedure will start a lot of information about the retender will come out. We are in the process of preparing for that retendering exercise and hopefully, everything will be done before the end of 2022. That's right."

I think Hong Kong cases have been improved. But we're not at the point where there's any change in the quarantine policy. I'm sorry, are you referring to overseas visitors from [indiscernible] Sorry, you're asking a question about people going to Singapore or to Macao? Sorry, I'd be asking about Hong Kong. Yes, they have relaxed. So non-residents can now travel to Hong Kong from the 1st of May and that was -- that hasn't been possible for some time. So you can go to Hong Kong from next month overseas into Hong Kong, but you would still have to be subject to the quarantine policy once you enter Hong Kong. No, that's it. That Okay. Sure. Thanks, Josh, for the question. I think, as you know, the cessation of operations of all of these fixed-room junket promoters, obviously happened fairly recently in December of last year. And as a result of that, obviously, there are some new court cases being raised by various stakeholders and participants in that system. Currently, there is nothing material to report from Sands China perspective. There are a few cases ongoing, but none of them are material, and we will continue to monitor the situation and obviously report back if there any changes. Sure, Rob. I think right now, Macao is a slightly different situation. If you look at the wage trend, it's very moderate, if not flattish in terms of wage inflation. But obviously, that's for reasons that are not hard to discern because there is pressure on unemployment since it's such a tourism-dependent economy. And then interestingly, in terms of construction works costs are, again, either in line with prior years or if not going down somewhat, again, because of the demand supply situation that's specific to Macao as a lot of large scale works have moderated, they being completed. So at this stage, we're not seeing any significant signs on the inflation front.  Of course, there are some supplies such as food and so on, where we do experience inflation, but obviously, thoughtful for the totality of our business, this is not going to be material. But I think the important point is what Rob said, I think you also have to consider for our type of business, the revenue side of the equation, which I think is going to be the more dominant driver. -- is obviously prices tick off"

The number would have been $40 million higher if we had held as expected in the rolling segment. It's only been one year since the end of COVID in Macao. We began in Q1 with $400 million of EBITDA. In Q2, we did $540 million. Q3, we did $630 million. The growth just keeps coming. We look forward to continued growth in both gaming and non-gaming revenue, which will lift in our market. SCL continues to own the largest share of non-rolling table win, rolling table win and slot ETG win. Most importantly, we have the largest share of EBITDA in Macao market by a wide margin. We believe the completed London will need and perhaps even exceed the earning power of the nation. Our future growth in Macao is tethered to these powerful assets, which will drive growth in the years ahead, whether it's rooms, gaming capacity, retail, entertainment, food and beverage, we have stellar assets. Those assets will even get better as we complete the ongoing $1.2 billion Londoner reinvestment program. There is an ongoing speculation of the future growth of Macao. Can Macao market grow to $30 billion, $35 billion, even $40 billion and beyond? We believe that it will. This underscores our confidence in the returns that we generated by capital investment programs in our portfolio. We are staunch believers in the growth of the Macao market in near and long-term. LBS has invested $15 billion in Macao to date. Macao is the most important land-based market in the world. A few reference points to consider, fourth quarter EBITDA, assuming expected hold on rolling play represents considerable growth when compared to the previous quarters. Our retail business in Macao has already far exceeded pre-COVID numbers. I continue to expect the gaming force on our business to follow the same path as Singapore and accelerate in 2024. Let's pivot to the MBS and Singapore. Seven quarters into our reopening, MBS delivered a $544 million a quarter. This is the largest EBITDA for one quarter in the history of the building. The power of this building is evident based on the results despite the disruptive impact of our ongoing $1.75 billion renovation. Disruption notwithstanding MBS is hitting on all cylinders with gaming, lodging and retail perspective. Slots in ETG's MBS are approaching a $1 billion annual run rate. Non-rolling tables are exceeding $20 million of the drop per day. ADRs are escalating and the retail component is delivering far beyond pre-COVID numbers. MBS validates the quality assets prevail and reinvesting in our assets will generate sustained returns. MBS has it all, our iconic building with superb decor and service levels, which attract the most desirable customers in every segment. At the completion of both phases of the renovation program, MBS will feature 770 suites, we previously had less than 200 suites. There is no denying its future. How far can MBS go. Our future expectations starts at $2 billion and beyond in EBITDA per year. As you know, we're bidding for a license in New York. We're receiving strong local support. The cost of the building will be in the $6 billion range, which enables us to develop a true five-star resort with [indiscernible]. This is a massive opportunity. We are very enthused about the prospect. Our bid is compelling. If we receive the license, we'd be in the ground as quickly as possible. Thank you for joining us today. I'll turn the call over to Patrick before we move on to Q&A.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Rob. We wanted to highlight some changes in the materials that we typically provide for the quarter. After discussions and review with the SEC, we will no longer be presenting hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA in our press releases, SEC filings and supplemental earnings materials. These changes are being made to our materials for this quarter and for our reporting going forward. We believe that the analysis of our financial and operating results in any quarter will continue to benefit from an understanding of the impact of expected hold in our rolling volume segments for our reported results. We will continue to provide the impact of expected hold in our rolling volume segments for our earnings materials. Please see Pages 6 and 7 in our earnings presentation for an overview of the new presentation format. For this quarter, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we generated $654 million of adjusted property EBITDA in Macao, a very strong operating result. It is important to note that we held 2.16% in our rolling segment in Macao. EBITDA would have been higher by $40 million in Macao had we held as expected in our rolling segment. At Marina Bay Sands for the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated $544 million in adjusted property EBITDA, another strong result. We held 4.57% in our rolling segment in Singapore. EBITDA would have been lower by $71 million in MBS had we held as expected in our Rolling segment. It is also important to address our margin structure as we held as expected in our rolling line segments in Macao and Singapore. In Macao, our margins for the fourth quarter of 2023 would have been 35.9%, an improvement of 100 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2023, if our hold was as expected in our rolling volume segment. At MBS, had we held as expected in our rolling volume segment, o ur fourth quarter 2023 margin would have been 48.8%, an increase of 170 basis points sequentially. It's important to note that both in Macao and in Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, we are generating revenue growth, EBITDA growth and when considering expected hold for rolling volume segments, margin expansion. We are very focused on the quality of our offerings on further investment to drive high-value visitation to our properties on the resulting revenue growth and our margin expansion over time. Looking ahead, we are excited about our progress in our markets, and we are focused on growth for the long term. Let's move to the Q&A portion of our call. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question today is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nJoe Greff: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nRob Goldstein: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Greff: Obviously, the premium mass had significant sequential growth and exceeded the base mass. I was just hoping -- can you talk about the progression of base mass recovery throughout the fourth quarter? And then clearly, what we're seeing out of information for the Macao market as a whole, in January month-to-date is nice overall mass growth pickup. And as you said before, Rob, the growth keeps coming. I was hoping if you can talk about sort of the relative performance of base mass in January and if we're seeing this hopefully anticipated pickup in that mass segment?\nRob Goldstein: Thanks, Joe. As you know, we don't comment on the current quarter. The numbers speak for themselves so the market appreciation in Macao in January thus far has been published, a very encouraging doesn\u2019t it, a continuation of December. As for our performance in Q4, I'll turn to Grant to talk about the acceleration of base and premium mass. Grant?\nGrant Chum: Yes, Rob. Thank you. Yes, Joe, the segment differential growth in the fourth quarter, we had 13% growth in premium mass and 8% growth sequentially on base mass. So I think base mass was progressing nicely through the quarter. It's just that premium mass had a great performance that exceeded that. If you look at the visitation trends during the fourth quarter, Macao actually recovered to almost 90% of 2019 levels on visitations. So I think the base mass is continuously progressing and building up. Transportation infrastructure has been improving. I think the demand to come, I think the desire to take advantage of the non-gaming events that have been coming on stream across our properties, but across the whole industry, have been very effective. So I think you should expect that growth pattern to continue.\nRob Goldstein: Grant can say also \u2013 Grant, why I ask is it fair to say transportation and Visa, the whole lubricant that supplies the market into Macao is getting better year after COVID. It seems to me as if the ability to get the desire is there, but also the ability that this improving daily. Is that fair to say?\nGrant Chum: Yes. The ability to get there has been improving, but the desirability of the destination is even clearer. You can see that the domestic flight to mainland key Greater Bay Area airports has all but fully recovered. And if you look at our ferry statistics, passengers that we carried in the fourth quarter recovered to 93% of pre-COVID, but only 52% of our sailing capacity. So clearly, people are enthusiastic about coming even though the transportation capacity is still recovering. And that's also clear, very gratifyingly the overseas, the foreign visitation recovered dramatically in fourth quarter, especially from Southeast Asia, and that's great to see from Macao. And that's despite the direct flights from foreign countries into Macao, haven't recovered even by, I think, 60% in the fourth quarter versus pre-COVID. But the visitation now is getting back up to 80%, 90% of what it was before despite the flight connectivity still catching up.\nJoe Greff: Great. And then my follow-up\u2026\nPatrick Dumont: Hey, Joe, it\u2019s a -- Joe, before the follow-up, one thing important to note also, it's been a while since we talked about this. But we actually have capacity to absorb base mass business as it continues to come into the market. So when you think about the property portfolio that we have, the investment that we've made in terms of amenities, the tourism attraction for the base mass customer, the ability to service that customer in terms of food and beverage, shopping, entertainment, but also the fact that we have the capacity as that market continues to grow, we'll be the beneficiary of that. And it's important to note, because the market is not at capacity yet. So as more visitors come in this base mass segment, we'll have the ability to absorb it. Sorry, what's your next question?\nJoe Greff: My next question is for you, Patrick. Obviously, it's nice to see $1 billion of buyback activity this past quarter. Do you view that as a sustainable level unless there's some huge volatility in the share price level?\nPatrick Dumont: I think there was -- I think there was some activity during the quarter, and to be fair, I think we looked at the share price levels as an opportunity. When we think about our future capital return, as we said before, we kind of expect our share repurchase will be more heavily weighted into that. And so I think we fundamentally believe in the long-term value of share repurchases, the benefit of the compounding, the benefit of the share shrink, trigging that denominator. In terms of amount, I think we'll be measured across time. If you sort of look at our balance sheet, you look at the free cash flow we generate, we're going to look to be aggressive when we can. And I think we're going to run a program where we look to acquire shares consistently over time. But I think -- I don't know that we'll necessarily buy the same amount that we bought in this quarter going forward every quarter.\nJoe Greff: Okay. And then one final thing, congratulations, Grant, on your promotion. That's all for me. Thanks. \nRob Goldstein: Thank you, Joe. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live. Please go ahead. Stephen, your line is live. Please you may go ahead with your question now. \nStephen Grambling: Hey, there. Sorry, can you hear me?\nRob Goldstein: Yes.\nPatrick Dumont: Yes.\nStephen Grambling: Sorry about that. So you may have touched on this a little bit, but as we think about the renovations coming up for the remainder of Sands Cotai Central/Londoner. Can you just maybe help contextualize how that will compare to the first renovation, both in terms of disruption and then contribution? \nRob Goldstein: Yes. I think we'll turn over to Grant for that comment. Grant, Londoner?\nGrant Chum: Sure. Thanks, Rob. Thanks for the question, Steve. I mean, I think we can say in terms of the time line, we have already commenced the renovation of the Sheraton Hotel, and that will continue through the whole of 2024, and we'll hopefully complete sometime in the first quarter of 2025. And yes, there could be some impact from construction disruption, especially as we go into the second half of the year. And that a little bit depends on when the works are approved to commence on the Sheraton side of the casino floor, and also as well as the number of keys that will be our at any given time at the Sheraton. That said, I think we'll be managing this whole process just as we did in the first phase when we converted the holiday in into the London starting in 2019. So, we'll be well used to yielding the rest of the portfolio. As you know, the yields we're getting at the Sheraton side of the building is lower than the rest of the portfolio. So, we will be trying to not miss any opportunity to yield the rest of the portfolio whilst the works are going on. And this is something that we've been doing throughout these existing building renovations. Right now, the schedule is still a little bit fluid, just pending some statutory approvals. But at this point, our expectation is the first half will be relative normal and then expect to see some disruption into the second half. But then by 2025, we're going to be in a dramatically elevated and different position in terms of the entire Londoner. You asked about the Phase I and Phase II contribution. Well, we have done the bulk of the work in the public areas and external facade in the Phase I and the retail mall and one the two casino floors, but we only touched 1,000 keys out of the 6,000 that we have. So, the main difference is that Phase II is going to address the majority of the hotel inventory in terms of renovation and of course, the other main gaming floor that we have on the Sheraton side.\nRob Goldstein: Stephen, just to follow on Grant's comments. I understand the market is concerned about London disruption. It's a valid point. However, two thoughts for you. One is that I think if the market continues to accelerate like we're seeing January market numbers, perhaps we can overcome that by using other assets in the portfolio. But secondly, to Grant's comment, I think when you see the eventual transformation of Londoner, it will be a juggernaut on par with the -- or beyond. So it gives us two assets we think can probably make $3 billion by themselves. And while there's disruption 2024, 2025 in Beyond gives us something that's unique in that market. The number one and two assets are number one in on assets in that market for years to come. So, there may be some disruption but maybe market force can overcome that, but I think the end result is well worth the pain.\nStephen Grambling: That's all super helpful. Maybe an unrelated follow-up on Singapore. Looking at least at the visitation data, it seems like it was mixed at best, but yet you're still seeing that market grow sequentially from an EBITDA standpoint, revenue I guess, what are you seeing from China customers coming back to the market? Any initial reason how we should be thinking about that building into next year?\nPatrick Dumont: I think I'm happy to give -- go ahead, Rob. Go ahead.\nRob Goldstein: Go ahead, Patrick. I'll follow yours. Go ahead.\nPatrick Dumont: Yes. So, I think the key thing about Singapore is it's really about quality of tourism. So, we've been very focused on investment. If you heard us over the last couple of calls and what our investment thesis is, that the higher-quality assets we have, the higher-quality tourism will attract, and that's really on full display here. So, it's not about quantity. It's not about the full recovery. It's the fact that we're getting very high-value tourists if you look at Singapore as a market, it's incredibly attractive, right? It has a growing high net worth population. There's a lot of family offices moving there. There's a lot of business activity there. There's political stability, there's strong tourism infrastructure, it's got a strategic location, all of those things are benefiting the Singapore market overall and helping drive the business that we're in. And so for us, there's been a ramp from China. That's true. But there's still a lot more to go. It's still, let's call it, 50% on visitor arrivals. You may have heard that at some point, they're going to go visa-free this year. We're hopeful that, that actually occurs, which there's no way to know exactly how that official that it will be, but it can't hurt. But I think the key thing is just a very attractive market, but it really -- the results you see in this quarter in a building that was really under construction, didn't have its full suite complement and didn't really have a lot of the amenities that we'll have in halfway through 2024 and 2025. I think really speaks to the capability of the market and where this building can go. You heard Rob in his remarks about our view of the trajectory of this business, we're very bullish on it. But I think it's really just about high-value tourism. I wouldn't look at the absolute number of visitor arrivals and use it as a determining factor for where the business can go.\nRob Goldstein: I think Patrick's comments are spot on, Steve. We have limited -- we have capacity constrained building in MBS. Unfortunately, we only have so many rooms suites, which we got 10 times as much, but we don't. So the mass market tourism is as important to us as the right tourists in the market. We look at this asset as a $2 billion asset today annualized EBITDA, but we believe it can grow 10% to 20% over the next three to four years. And then hopefully, we can finalize our plans with the government once the government blesses another building, we believe that, that could open later this year and make us a $3 billion projected EBITDA by end of decade in Singapore. So we see ourselves now at $2 billion, going to $2.2, billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and eventually stepping up to $3 billion. We see huge growth in this asset. It's just beginning. We got obviously hampered by COVID, but to watch it growing is growing. Our only disappointment in Singapore is we just don't have more space, because it's a very desirable market and that building probably the most valuable in hotel building ever built in the world and will just accelerate in the next three, to four, five years until hopefully, we can tell you a finality, we have a deal in Phase II.\nStephen Grambling: Makes sense. It\u2019s all helpful. Thanks so much. Best of luck.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Stephen.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thank you. Hey, guys. Rob, you touched on it a little bit just there, but I was wondering, obviously, there's a ton of moving parts with COVID and everything else, but $1 billion in Phase I at Marina Bay Sands. Returns on that product look to be very favorable, $750 million over 2024 and into 2025. I was wondering how you think about returns there? And then to your point there at the end of your last comments, when do you expect to have an update around the timing and perhaps the spend on the larger scale projects there?\nRob Goldstein: I'll just reiterate how much we believe in Singapore as a market. My comment is about $3 billion. We actually believe retainable when we opened this new building late in the decade. As for the update, Patrick's been right in the middle of that. So Patrick please take it away in terms of Phase II Singapore.\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. I think it's an interesting comment. I think the key thing for us is that we are an investment-driven story, right? So the more we invest in high-quality assets, the better service levels we have, the more we're going to have pricing, the more we're going to differentiate our product, the more we're going to have high-value tourists and the more our EBITDA and margins will grow. And so you're seeing that happen real time in Singapore. And so for us, I think we'll finish the third tower by Chinese New Year next year, that $750 million will go in. We'll saw some amenities that have to be done across parts of 2025 -- but by the mid part of 2025, we're basically going to have what is, in effect, a brand-new building. It's going to be fully renovated, and you'll get to see the full power of the suite product on the rolling side. You get to see the power of the premium mass and all the amenities that we have, the shopping, the entertainment, all the things that we're adding in terms of our premium mass lifestyle program that you can't get any place else. These are all very positive things and the quality of these amenities base customers want to be repeat visitors. And so for us, these investments will drive very high returns. That's the reason why we were willing to do and that reason why the board was supportive. You can see the trajectory of EBITDA now, we're not even done. So we think Tower 3 will be very accretive in terms of investment. You heard the numbers Rob just mentioned. We're very confident in those numbers. We feel very strongly, but that's where we should be going. And then in terms of the next building, IR 2, we've been in very close discussions with the government over many months. There's a lot of moving parts here, a lot of things we have to satisfy. This is a project of national significance. We want to make sure that everyone is comfortable with it and that we get all the proper approvals, and we're hoping in the next quarter or two that we'll get everything done. We've been making good progress. We've been visiting Singapore, and we feel very confident where we are. And hopefully, we'll be able to get all the green lights we need and we'll be able to et going soon.\nCarlo Santarelli: That's all I need. Thank you guys. Helpful. \nRob Goldstein: Thank you, Carlo. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to offer my congrats to Grant on the promotion as well. And maybe speaking of promotions, Grant or whoever, if you could comment a little bit just on the promotional environment. I mean, I think this is a big question or theme that came out of the quarter last quarter and just sort of what you're seeing, particularly at the upper end of the premium mass segment right now? And in general, our premium mass market margins consistent with your pre-COVID expected ranges, or are they still a little bit below that? And what would it take for them to recover? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: Grant? Shaun, that was good by the way. Thank you.\nGrant Chum: Thank you, Shaun for the question. I think if you look at the competitive landscape, of course, it is very intense at the premium mass segment. But if you look at also at our margin structure, I think the way we've driven our business is no different from before, which is to really drive and elevate the product and to drive the content and the events that we put on across a whole range of sectors to attract visitors and patrons. And I do think that back to Patrick's opening comment, if you look at that margin progression, underlying margin grew another 100 basis points. We actually saw a good improvement in our mass margin sequentially. So we are dealing with the competitive market as any competitor does. It is intense, but we believe strongly that in the end, product wins and Londoner and Grand Suisse at Four Seasons are true living evolving testaments of that argument, that good product wins. And there are going to be fluctuations in the competitive intensity in particular segments at different points in time. But to have a sustainable competitive advantage and sustainable profitable growth, product and service and the content we put into the resort calendar are still going to trump everything else. And you can see that through what we've done at Londoner is already at a run rate of close to $800 million as it was exiting the year. And you can see that the way this is going, we will end up with a margin structure as we already are in Q4 back to the same level as we were in 2019. And then as the revenues continue to grow, you should logically expect that margin to continue to improve and therefore, exceed where we were in 2019.\nRob Goldstein: Shaun, can I just follow up on Grant's comments. My experience has always been the same. Regardless of the market, great buildings and great experiences always prevail. We have those in Macao. If you look at our EBITDA in Q3, I believe our EBITDA exceeded our next two contenders combined, which is quite a statement to the power of our buildings. There will be promotional issues occasionally here and there, so in the end, we have a structural advantage, which can't be undermined. We have more capacity for lodging, food and beverage, retail entertainment and gaming capacity [indiscernible] by a bunch, and that will enable us to avail both a margin and EBITDA basis. And so yes, there will be occasionally a promotional issue here and there, but it really shouldn't concern as far as our business. Our margins remain intact, and our dominance remain intact in all segments in Macao.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you, Rob for that. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, last quarter, it was mentioned, Grant, I think in one of your comments or one of your responses, a little bit about a bit of an uneven recovery we were seeing coming out of some of the source markets from broader Mainland China, as some of the air travel reopening. Wondering if we're continuing to see that uneven recovery or just any other broader signs of the kind of where the macro situation sits in China? Because so far, and again, seems to be continuing through January. Seems like Macao is relatively unaffected there, but I wanted sort of an update on that trajectory, if you could give one.\nGrant Chum: Sure, Shaun. I think if you look at fourth quarter, it did even have quite a bit. I think if you look at bans visitation from non-Guangdong versus Guangdong slides\u2026\nDaniel J. Briggs: Page 20.\nGrant Chum: Are catching. Yes. Thanks, Dan. We're catching up significantly on the recovery rate in non-Guangdong. That said, it is still uneven in the sense that if you look at the breakdown by province, some of the wealthier provinces, have recovered way beyond pre-COVID levels of visitations, particularly in the Yangtze River Delta versus even Guangdong, the recovery rate is actually much higher. But overall, I think you can see an evening out in terms of the recovery rate in Guangdong versus non-Guangdong. And then also, I think the fourth quarter, the overseas, the foreign country visitation also started to accelerate and even out as well against the nearby region source markets. So I think you are seeing I think, a progressive improvement across all the source markets. I don't know, maybe Wilford, I don't know if you have anything to add on the China side in terms of the \u2013 the economy.\nWilford Wong: Yes, Shaun, China is still recovering from the tough COVID period. And \u2013but what is evident is the company's quarterly performance has actually been trending well. We have seen as Grant alluded to, healthy growth in the number of visitors, especially from the non-confidential region. Now one observation is that when long-haul travels of Chinese travelers has not fully recovered, Macao is emerging as a top tourist destination for short-haul drivers from the Chinese mainland.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you everyone.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie Chad, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nChad Beynon: Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask one, just about the retail portfolio. We've been hearing and seeing a little bit of pressure just kind of in the luxury retail space, particularly in Asia based on the numbers that you put out and I guess, the turnover rent that you collected, you're not seeing that. But how are you thinking about the recovery in retail? Are you getting the right customers in there now? And do you think this could continue to improve as visitation and overall spend improves in 2025 or 2024? Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: If you look at your deck on, I think it's Page 28 and 29, it gives you a pretty good look at our retail portfolio in Asia and be blunt about it, how it could be in half of these numbers, almost $3,000 a foot and a 600,000-foot more at MBS. Finished $2,000 a foot with 800,000 feet, of course, $9,200 a foot at the Four Seasons luxury and a mere $4,200 a foot on the non-luxury, so the answer is we are seeing our retail portfolio that's approaching $700 million of contribution and growing. Of course, there's discussions out, they'll be mentioned a slowdown globally. But it looks to me that I spoke to David, because they are retail experts. It feels like we continue to see opportunity to remerchandize and get better and better at the retail segment. We still believe that retail is a long way to go. Our buildings are a little different than other retail and that we attract a higher value customer both in Macao and Singapore, as you reference the lack of supply in Singapore. So I think that mall just keeps appreciating and we keep re-merchandizing it to be more effective every day, more luxurious, more upscale. In Macao, we've got work cut out for us in some of our buildings, not there yet in the Parisian. There's some work to be done, but I don\u2019t know how you could argue with these kind of results, $677 million of contribution, and it just keeps accelerating. It compares very favorably with 2019. So we feel very bullish about our retail prospects. And again, it takes work. David Sylvester constantly remerchandize read things and reassesses the portfolio. He's got a lot of work to do. But the numbers, I think, are stellar and I think we'll continue to be stellar for years to come.\nChad Beynon: Thanks. Rob. Makes sense. And then just in terms of the hold, understanding that it's kind of random here in terms of luck or unlucky. Has there been any difference in terms of game play or you talk about kind of the recovery from the Chinese consumer. And I'm speaking of Singapore, but hold has been high now for three quarters. So is there anything that could kind of lead to maybe an elevated hold in that market in the near term, or should we expect kind of the reversion to the mean that we've seen in prior quarters and years? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: I think it's safe to say this business always runs on mathematics. The mathematics prevail, and I wouldn't take three quarters as an ongoing trend forever. There'll be a dark day in Singapore will miss by $70 million, because we take the highest volume players in the world, people who bet lots of money. And some days, it goes with you and someday it doesn't. This quarter, obviously, in Singapore went with us. But I would caution you, I don't think that the betters are changing. In fact, if any of the there's more of them, more affluence coming out of Asia, and we're fortunate enough to have the capacity to handle all of it. But I don't think you can point to a change in betting patterns in either jurisdiction that would elevate or hurt the whole percentage. It will be revert the mean always. And Macao will come back next quarter probably and do $70 million higher and Singapore may have a bad quarter. Grant, do you have any comment on that? That's how I see it.\nGrant Chum: That's exactly right, Rob. And people have relatively short memories. But in the fourth quarter of 2022, there is like $100 million plus adjustment on the downward impact from low hold at Marina Bay Sands. So I think one or two, three, four even five quarters is actually a relatively short period of time and sample size for you not to get potentially very random results that deviate from the expected normal hold. But I think it's fair to say, yeah, the mathematics always prevail. And given the scale of our business, over time over one year, two years, we should stay very much in the expected range. As you saw in Macao as well, we had the first three quarters holding significantly above the expected mean hold and then fourth quarter reversed. And for the whole year, we end up at about 3.3%, which is exactly where we expect it to be.\nRob Goldstein: And Chad, going back yeah, just to find going back, I don't know, maybe eight, 10 years ago, we had a horrific number of quarters in a row due to a few players, I think, was Indonesia or Malaysia and we lost obscene amounts of money quarter after quarter to them. And some people on our Board were concerned as they want to be sure. And we talk -- we looked at everything, and we're very comfortable. And there is a belief therefore a while that these people were magical and could be beaten and they lost back their entire winnings and then some. It always goes that way. I don't think you can ever get too emotional about this quarter, it's very interesting to see the Macao miss and the Singapore overachieving. But in the end, the games stay consistent, pairs and ties versus straight bets do matter. But the Asian gambler is special. And he or she shows up consistently and they're great customers. I wouldn't let the success of a few quarters change your views on the mathematics of backlog. We don't. So thank you.\nChad Beynon: Great. Thank you.\nGrant Chum: Thanks, Chad.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you. Two questions, if I could crease it in. One is just any comments on Chinese New Year upcoming anything with trends approaching that? And then Cole-related just your latest expectations for timing of a decision in New York? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: I'll take New York first, Robin. The governor, Governor Hochul, I think it was this week commented on seeing something happen this year. I hope that's true. We're -- as you know, are -- we've been working in New York for quite a long time. And we think we have a very compelling bid. But we don't have any great insight if that will happen. We sure hope the Governor is correct. And either way, win or lose we\u2019ll get decision in calendar year 2024. That's our hope. But I think it'd be [indiscernible] any insight beyond the governor's comments. I think we just -- we worked very hard on this project. We believe we have a really good chance of getting one, but I don't give you -- I couldn't give you any guidance beyond that. Grant, Chinese New Year. Do you think he'll be any there for that? Will the year of the dragon bring anybody to the building?\nGrant Chum: Well, Robin, I mean, we can't really comment on the current quarter and obviously, booking windows are short here. But I think you can see from the December holidays in these peak holiday periods, even though the end of December is not a big China holiday. It is in Hong Kong and some other parts of the region. But the ramp-up in demand during those peak periods was tremendous. So hopefully, that will be replicated through into this Chinese New Year as well. So there is a lot of optimism and expectations that this will be a strong one, yes.\nRob Goldstein: Robin, I do think, Robin, I think December was really great tell what might happen in Chinese -- December numbers that closed were just terrific. And again, you see the market numbers for January. So we're very hopeful that the year of Dragon is a huge year for us into the market.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you. And Grant, congratulations on the new role. Thanks.\nGrant Chum: Thank you, Robin.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays.\nBrandt Montour: Good evening everybody. Thanks for taking my question. So in Singapore on the Phase II, I was wondering if you could maybe remind us the total room count exiting the year and then specifically with regards to disruption cadence what is the quarter-to-quarter and overall year look like in terms of how that will flow through the P&L?\nRob Goldstein: Patrick, do you want to grab that?\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. So, yes, sure. So I think when we finished the year, we were around 2,200 keys available next year because of the construction in T3, Tower 3, we're going to get down to the mid 1,600 in Q3, it's probably going to be our peak of disruption. But those rooms are smallest right now and really have our lowest yield. So hopefully, the impact will be minimal, and we'll be able to yield because of the compression to higher-value customers. The performance today on Sands has been quite good, and you think we'll be able to yield up in the renovated portion of the building. Sorry, what was the rest of your question?\nBrandt Montour: And sorry, so then the ending key count when all is said and done with suites and normal rooms?\nPatrick Dumont: It's mid-1800s.\nBrandt Montour: Mid 1800, perfect. Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, just a broader question. We haven't really talked about non-gaming spending. I was just curious if you could give us update on your efforts on that front and maybe how your outlook has evolved for the return profile as we sort of go into 2024 on non-gaming spend?\nRob Goldstein: When you say non-gaming, can you be more specifically talking about retail, food and beverage, hotels?\nBrandt Montour:  Of course, sorry about that. Yeah, with regards to the concession agreements.\nRob Goldstein: Oh, I see. Okay. I'm going to let Grant handle that, but I would say we are a little bit different than the rest of our competitors in terms of we've been spending money aggressing Macao forever for 20 years on entertainment and other things. We believe it's a huge value add. I'll let Grant take the question specifically. But I think, again, it's important to note, we are a different animal than other people in terms of this concession. We welcome it. We've been doing it before the concession mandate. I think it's been very beneficial to our company. Grant?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think in 2023, we went very intensely on investing across all of the non-gaming categories that we committed to in the concession. As Rob said, many of these categories are categories that we have been investing in involved in for a very long time. So I think whether you look across entertainment, we had almost 80 shows that we put on during 2023 with some amazing record runs attendance. Obviously, firstly, with the Jacky Cheung concert in Cotai Arena, and then towards the end of the year, [indiscernible] a singer in Hong Kong and had a great 14 show run at the Londoner. So it's probably set a new standard and precedent for many residencies in Macao. And then across other categories in MICE, in art and culture, in themed attractions and gastronomy. Across the board, we've been investing heavily. I should also give a chance to Wilford to speak to some of those events and projects that we've been heavily investing in as well. But suffice to say versus our original forecast for what we would invest in the first year of the 10 years, we greatly exceeded that during 2023. And we're looking to do so again in 2024. Wilford, I don't know if -- so you want to add to the non-gaming concession and investments we're making.\nWilford Wong: Yes. We have, in the past years, been investing heavily in the areas that Grant just described. And by a long way off, we are the leader in the MICE market. So we are still seeing a very strong presence of MICE activities in our properties. For non-gaming, apart from the shows, we've been helping to promote Macao as a destination, not just for gaming. Therefore, we have a lot of art exhibitions, cultural shows that really put us apart from the other competitors.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Very helpful. Thanks, all.\nGrant Chum: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll ask to the both on one shot. If I could follow up on the share repurchases, Patrick, not asking about how much or when -- but just thinking about how the family stake takes a long-term view on where you'd like to be or how we might think about that evolving over time? And then second, since we last spoke on an earnings call, there's been an awful lot of activity and focus in Texas. And if you could share some of your views and thesis around what -- what the family's activities and how they might relate to the company and shareholders, that would be helpful as well. Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. So I think first off, I think we see value in both equities. So we're very long-term bullish. From a company standpoint, we're going to continue to be aggressive, as you said before, focusing on investment for growth. Do you see the success of our capital allocation programs, both in Macao as Grant just described in Singapore in driving growth in high-value tourism in diversifying our amenities and by creating margin and revenue expansion. So we're very focused on investment for growth. That being said, we generate a lot of free cash flow, and we anticipate to generate free cash flow in the future that we'll be able to use to return capital to shareholders. So I think the company will look to be aggressive and measured over time as we return capital share through share repurchases to shareholders. I think we've always had a dividend is not from the pandemic. I think we like having a dividend. We think it's helpful for shareholder returns. We think it's an important component of our overall shareholder value strategy. But that being said, we're going to be overweight to share repurchases. In terms of Texas, I think the most important thing is that Las Vegas Sands is actively trying to facilitate the development of integrated resorts in the State of Texas and through the liberalization of gaming. And so we're very excited about it. We think it's an unbelievable market. Over time, we hope that it happens. I can't tell you when it's going to be, but we're very focused on it as a company, and we like the opportunity to develop some very unique tourism assets, specifically in Dallas. We think that's a great market. We've been very focused on it. And we think the opportunity there would be a great one. In terms of the family's activities in Texas, I think we like the state. We're very obviously happy with our investment there. We're very excited about it. And we'll look to be part of the business community there. But in terms of LVS, we're very focused on bringing integrated resource to decimate resource, the State of Texas and the development opportunity that would exist there.\nDavid Katz: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live. Please go ahead.\nDan Politzer: Hey, good afternoon, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on Sands China and as it relates to capital allocation. Your net leverage there, I think, is around three times at this point. It should be much lower than that as you kind of make your way through 2024. How do you think about the subsidiary there resuming dividend payments up to the parent? And then obviously, your stake went up a little bit through the quarter through those debt repurchase. So maybe does that incentivize some of those dividends coming up sooner than later? Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: If it's okay. I'll take that one. I think the key thing here, as I just mentioned in the prior question, and as Grant mentioned, as Wilford mentioned, we're very committed to investing in the long term in Macao. And so our primary focus is going to be deploying capital there for growth. That being said, we are generating meaningful free cash flow there as we did in this last quarter. I think what you'll look to see over time is that some of the leverage that we put on the balance sheet during the pandemic will decease. So we have a maturity coming up in 2025. We'll look to decease some of that in front of the refinancing. And our goal is really to bring leverage down in terms of quantum, but then also our leverage is going to come in naturally as our EBITDA stands over time, which is our expectation. So I think once that occurs, we're going to start looking to begin the dividend again at the Sands China level. That's something that's going to be determined by the Board there. But I think overall, it's something that we'd like to see. And I think the goal is to begin that dividend in the years ahead. It was a very strong dividend payer in prior years pre-pandemic. And we'd like to become an investment-grade name there, keep that investment-grade rating, invest in the future in terms of scale and scope to grow our business there and then return excess capital through dividends to shareholders there. So that's the plan.\nDan Politzer: Got it. And then just for my follow-up, as you think about Macao, we've talked a bit about the margins and the improvement, more or less, it's been about 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter. As you think about kind of the trajectory from here, and I know you're on pace to get back to those 2019 levels how should we think about maybe the pacing of improvement? And do you think that operating expense structure is really in place at this point, you should benefit from scale here on out?\nPatrick Dumont: I have one quick comment and I'd like to turn it to Grant. We've mentioned this a few times in the past couple of quarters. I think the story of our margin expansion in Macao is going to be based on revenue growth. As the market continues to recover, as tourism continues to recover as more high-value tourists come online, they see the types of high-quality offerings lab, they experience the amenities and the entertainment that Grant referenced earlier, we're going to continue to grow and expand our customer base. And that will lead to pricing, that will be to expansion, that will lead to revenue growth. So, from that standpoint, I think our long-term margin view is expansion because of the investment and because of what we just described. But I'll turn it over to Grant to see if he has some additional comments.\nGrant Chum: Yes, Patrick, I think you covered it well. I think it's dependent on revenue growth as the market continues to grow, and we will be more than a full participant in that market growth. The margins will have a positive trajectory. I think we obviously have a more efficient and more productive cost structure today than we did in 2018 and 2019. So, we will -- we are benefiting from that as revenues grow and you get the operating leverage on the fixed costs. We will continue to do so. And I think it is very much about how revenues grow from here. And as revenues grow, our margins will have further upside.\nDan Politzer: Got it. And congratulations on the promotion Grant.\nGrant Chum: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from George Choi from Citi. George, your line is live, please go ahead.\nGeorge Choi: Thanks for taking my questions. My questions were answered earlier, but do have a housekeeping question. Would you please remind us how the overran mechanism works at the Macao properties? Should we expect a normal uptick in the quarter? That is when you guys received for rent? Thank you very much, I will come back to the queue.\nRob Goldstein: I'm sorry, George, I think we missed that. Could you repeat yourself? It was unclear there was some difficult -- static, yes. Can you try again, George, about Macao?\nGeorge Choi: Apologies. So, I just wonder how the turnover rent mechanism works in the Macao properties. Is it a fourth quarter event? Is that when you receive your term rate?\nRob Goldstein: Grant, do you want to handle the fourth quarter turnover to retail.\nGrant Chum: George, there are leases that are on monthly turnover rents and there are leases that are on annual turnover rents. So, historically, what happens is for those annual turnover rent leases as we get into the third quarter, the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will obviously be recognizing more of those turnover rents, as we hit the annual sales targets. So, historically, you should expect seasonally the second half of the retail rental revenues will be higher than the first half.\nGeorge Choi: Okay. Understood. That's all I have. Thank you very much.\nRob Goldstein: Before we finalize the call, I want to reach out and recognize the great contributions of Wilfred Wong, who is now Executive Vice Chair. Wilfred has been with us about eight years and made a great contribution. And Wilfred, congratulations on the elevation of Executive Vice Chair. Grant Chum, well deserved. We hired Grant many years ago, the big concern was, was he old enough to win the casino at that time? And over the years, he's aged insufficiently, so he did not win the casino. Congratulations to you Grant. Both of you guys have built a terrific team over there. We're very proud and grateful for your efforts and look forward to many more years working together. Thank you for your time today and interest in our company. We bid you adieu.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rob. We wanted to highlight some changes in the materials that we typically provide for the quarter. After discussions and review with the SEC, we will no longer be presenting hold-normalized adjusted property EBITDA in our press releases, SEC filings and supplemental earnings materials. These changes are being made to our materials for this quarter and for our reporting going forward. We believe that the analysis of our financial and operating results in any quarter will continue to benefit from an understanding of the impact of expected hold in our rolling volume segments for our reported results. We will continue to provide the impact of expected hold in our rolling volume segments for our earnings materials. Please see Pages 6 and 7 in our earnings presentation for an overview of the new presentation format. For this quarter, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we generated $654 million of adjusted property EBITDA in Macao, a very strong operating result. It is important to note that we held 2.16% in our rolling segment in Macao. EBITDA would have been higher by $40 million in Macao had we held as expected in our rolling segment. At Marina Bay Sands for the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated $544 million in adjusted property EBITDA, another strong result. We held 4.57% in our rolling segment in Singapore. EBITDA would have been lower by $71 million in MBS had we held as expected in our Rolling segment. It is also important to address our margin structure as we held as expected in our rolling line segments in Macao and Singapore. In Macao, our margins for the fourth quarter of 2023 would have been 35.9%, an improvement of 100 basis points as compared to the third quarter of 2023, if our hold was as expected in our rolling volume segment. At MBS, had we held as expected in our rolling volume segment, o ur fourth quarter 2023 margin would have been 48.8%, an increase of 170 basis points sequentially. It's important to note that both in Macao and in Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, we are generating revenue growth, EBITDA growth and when considering expected hold for rolling volume segments, margin expansion. We are very focused on the quality of our offerings on further investment to drive high-value visitation to our properties on the resulting revenue growth and our margin expansion over time. Looking ahead, we are excited about our progress in our markets, and we are focused on growth for the long term. Let's move to the Q&A portion of our call. Thanks. Hey, Joe, it's a -- Joe, before the follow-up, one thing important to note also, it's been a while since we talked about this. But we actually have capacity to absorb base mass business as it continues to come into the market. So when you think about the property portfolio that we have, the investment that we've made in terms of amenities, the tourism attraction for the base mass customer, the ability to service that customer in terms of food and beverage, shopping, entertainment, but also the fact that we have the capacity as that market continues to grow, we'll be the beneficiary of that. And it's important to note, because the market is not at capacity yet. So as more visitors come in this base mass segment, we'll have the ability to absorb it. Sorry, what's your next question? I think there was -- I think there was some activity during the quarter, and to be fair, I think we looked at the share price levels as an opportunity. When we think about our future capital return, as we said before, we kind of expect our share repurchase will be more heavily weighted into that. And so I think we fundamentally believe in the long-term value of share repurchases, the benefit of the compounding, the benefit of the share shrink, trigging that denominator. In terms of amount, I think we'll be measured across time. If you sort of look at our balance sheet, you look at the free cash flow we generate, we're going to look to be aggressive when we can. And I think we're going to run a program where we look to acquire shares consistently over time. But I think -- I don't know that we'll necessarily buy the same amount that we bought in this quarter going forward every quarter. Yes. I think I'm happy to give -- go ahead, Rob. Go ahead. Yes. So, I think the key thing about Singapore is it's really about quality of tourism. So, we've been very focused on investment. If you heard us over the last couple of calls and what our investment thesis is, that the higher-quality assets we have, the higher-quality tourism will attract, and that's really on full display here. So, it's not about quantity. It's not about the full recovery. It's the fact that we're getting very high-value tourists if you look at Singapore as a market, it's incredibly attractive, right? It has a growing high net worth population. There's a lot of family offices moving there. There's a lot of business activity there. There's political stability, there's strong tourism infrastructure, it's got a strategic location, all of those things are benefiting the Singapore market overall and helping drive the business that we're in. And so for us, there's been a ramp from China. That's true. But there's still a lot more to go. It's still, let's call it, 50% on visitor arrivals. You may have heard that at some point, they're going to go visa-free this year. We're hopeful that, that actually occurs, which there's no way to know exactly how that official that it will be, but it can't hurt. But I think the key thing is just a very attractive market, but it really -- the results you see in this quarter in a building that was really under construction, didn't have its full suite complement and didn't really have a lot of the amenities that we'll have in halfway through 2024 and 2025. I think really speaks to the capability of the market and where this building can go. You heard Rob in his remarks about our view of the trajectory of this business, we're very bullish on it. But I think it's really just about high-value tourism. I wouldn't look at the absolute number of visitor arrivals and use it as a determining factor for where the business can go. Thanks, Stephen. Yeah. I think it's an interesting comment. I think the key thing for us is that we are an investment-driven story, right? So the more we invest in high-quality assets, the better service levels we have, the more we're going to have pricing, the more we're going to differentiate our product, the more we're going to have high-value tourists and the more our EBITDA and margins will grow. And so you're seeing that happen real time in Singapore. And so for us, I think we'll finish the third tower by Chinese New Year next year, that $750 million will go in. We'll saw some amenities that have to be done across parts of 2025 -- but by the mid part of 2025, we're basically going to have what is, in effect, a brand-new building. It's going to be fully renovated, and you'll get to see the full power of the suite product on the rolling side. You get to see the power of the premium mass and all the amenities that we have, the shopping, the entertainment, all the things that we're adding in terms of our premium mass lifestyle program that you can't get any place else. These are all very positive things and the quality of these amenities base customers want to be repeat visitors. And so for us, these investments will drive very high returns. That's the reason why we were willing to do and that reason why the board was supportive. You can see the trajectory of EBITDA now, we're not even done. So we think Tower 3 will be very accretive in terms of investment. You heard the numbers Rob just mentioned. We're very confident in those numbers. We feel very strongly, but that's where we should be going. And then in terms of the next building, IR 2, we've been in very close discussions with the government over many months. There's a lot of moving parts here, a lot of things we have to satisfy. This is a project of national significance. We want to make sure that everyone is comfortable with it and that we get all the proper approvals, and we're hoping in the next quarter or two that we'll get everything done. We've been making good progress. We've been visiting Singapore, and we feel very confident where we are. And hopefully, we'll be able to get all the green lights we need and we'll be able to et going soon. Yeah. So, yes, sure. So I think when we finished the year, we were around 2,200 keys available next year because of the construction in T3, Tower 3, we're going to get down to the mid 1,600 in Q3, it's probably going to be our peak of disruption. But those rooms are smallest right now and really have our lowest yield. So hopefully, the impact will be minimal, and we'll be able to yield because of the compression to higher-value customers. The performance today on Sands has been quite good, and you think we'll be able to yield up in the renovated portion of the building. Sorry, what was the rest of your question? It's mid-1800s. Sure. So I think first off, I think we see value in both equities. So we're very long-term bullish. From a company standpoint, we're going to continue to be aggressive, as you said before, focusing on investment for growth. Do you see the success of our capital allocation programs, both in Macao as Grant just described in Singapore in driving growth in high-value tourism in diversifying our amenities and by creating margin and revenue expansion. So we're very focused on investment for growth. That being said, we generate a lot of free cash flow, and we anticipate to generate free cash flow in the future that we'll be able to use to return capital to shareholders. So I think the company will look to be aggressive and measured over time as we return capital share through share repurchases to shareholders. I think we've always had a dividend is not from the pandemic. I think we like having a dividend. We think it's helpful for shareholder returns. We think it's an important component of our overall shareholder value strategy. But that being said, we're going to be overweight to share repurchases. In terms of Texas, I think the most important thing is that Las Vegas Sands is actively trying to facilitate the development of integrated resorts in the State of Texas and through the liberalization of gaming. And so we're very excited about it. We think it's an unbelievable market. Over time, we hope that it happens. I can't tell you when it's going to be, but we're very focused on it as a company, and we like the opportunity to develop some very unique tourism assets, specifically in Dallas. We think that's a great market. We've been very focused on it. And we think the opportunity there would be a great one. In terms of the family's activities in Texas, I think we like the state. We're very obviously happy with our investment there. We're very excited about it. And we'll look to be part of the business community there. But in terms of LVS, we're very focused on bringing integrated resource to decimate resource, the State of Texas and the development opportunity that would exist there. If it's okay. I'll take that one. I think the key thing here, as I just mentioned in the prior question, and as Grant mentioned, as Wilford mentioned, we're very committed to investing in the long term in Macao. And so our primary focus is going to be deploying capital there for growth. That being said, we are generating meaningful free cash flow there as we did in this last quarter. I think what you'll look to see over time is that some of the leverage that we put on the balance sheet during the pandemic will decease. So we have a maturity coming up in 2025. We'll look to decease some of that in front of the refinancing. And our goal is really to bring leverage down in terms of quantum, but then also our leverage is going to come in naturally as our EBITDA stands over time, which is our expectation. So I think once that occurs, we're going to start looking to begin the dividend again at the Sands China level. That's something that's going to be determined by the Board there. But I think overall, it's something that we'd like to see. And I think the goal is to begin that dividend in the years ahead. It was a very strong dividend payer in prior years pre-pandemic. And we'd like to become an investment-grade name there, keep that investment-grade rating, invest in the future in terms of scale and scope to grow our business there and then return excess capital through dividends to shareholders there. So that's the plan. I have one quick comment and I'd like to turn it to Grant. We've mentioned this a few times in the past couple of quarters. I think the story of our margin expansion in Macao is going to be based on revenue growth. As the market continues to recover, as tourism continues to recover as more high-value tourists come online, they see the types of high-quality offerings lab, they experience the amenities and the entertainment that Grant referenced earlier, we're going to continue to grow and expand our customer base. And that will lead to pricing, that will be to expansion, that will lead to revenue growth. So, from that standpoint, I think our long-term margin view is expansion because of the investment and because of what we just described. But I'll turn it over to Grant to see if he has some additional comments."

            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and thanks for joining us today. Macao delivered $654 million of EBITDA for the quarter. The number would have been $40 million higher if we had held as expected in the rolling segment. It's only been one year since the end of COVID in Macao. We began in Q1 with $400 million of EBITDA. In Q2, we did $540 million. Q3, we did $630 million. The growth just keeps coming. We look forward to continued growth in both gaming and non-gaming revenue, which will lift in our market. SCL continues to own the largest share of non-rolling table win, rolling table win and slot ETG win. Most importantly, we have the largest share of EBITDA in Macao market by a wide margin. We believe the completed London will need and perhaps even exceed the earning power of the nation. Our future growth in Macao is tethered to these powerful assets, which will drive growth in the years ahead, whether it's rooms, gaming capacity, retail, entertainment, food and beverage, we have stellar assets. Those assets will even get better as we complete the ongoing $1.2 billion Londoner reinvestment program. There is an ongoing speculation of the future growth of Macao. Can Macao market grow to $30 billion, $35 billion, even $40 billion and beyond? We believe that it will. This underscores our confidence in the returns that we generated by capital investment programs in our portfolio. We are staunch believers in the growth of the Macao market in near and long-term. LBS has invested $15 billion in Macao to date. Macao is the most important land-based market in the world. A few reference points to consider, fourth quarter EBITDA, assuming expected hold on rolling play represents considerable growth when compared to the previous quarters. Our retail business in Macao has already far exceeded pre-COVID numbers. I continue to expect the gaming force on our business to follow the same path as Singapore and accelerate in 2024. Let's pivot to the MBS and Singapore. Seven quarters into our reopening, MBS delivered a $544 million a quarter. This is the largest EBITDA for one quarter in the history of the building. The power of this building is evident based on the results despite the disruptive impact of our ongoing $1.75 billion renovation. Disruption notwithstanding MBS is hitting on all cylinders with gaming, lodging and retail perspective. Slots in ETG's MBS are approaching a $1 billion annual run rate. Non-rolling tables are exceeding $20 million of the drop per day. ADRs are escalating and the retail component is delivering far beyond pre-COVID numbers. MBS validates the quality assets prevail and reinvesting in our assets will generate sustained returns. MBS has it all, our iconic building with superb decor and service levels, which attract the most desirable customers in every segment. At the completion of both phases of the renovation program, MBS will feature 770 suites, we previously had less than 200 suites. There is no denying its future. How far can MBS go. Our future expectations starts at $2 billion and beyond in EBITDA per year. As you know, we're bidding for a license in New York. We're receiving strong local support. The cost of the building will be in the $6 billion range, which enables us to develop a true five-star resort with [indiscernible]. This is a massive opportunity. We are very enthused about the prospect. Our bid is compelling. If we receive the license, we'd be in the ground as quickly as possible. Thank you for joining us today. I'll turn the call over to Patrick before we move on to Q&A. Hi, Joe. Thanks, Joe. As you know, we don't comment on the current quarter. The numbers speak for themselves so the market appreciation in Macao in January thus far has been published, a very encouraging doesn't it, a continuation of December. As for our performance in Q4, I'll turn to Grant to talk about the acceleration of base and premium mass. Grant? Grant can say also \u2013 Grant, why I ask is it fair to say transportation and Visa, the whole lubricant that supplies the market into Macao is getting better year after COVID. It seems to me as if the ability to get the desire is there, but also the ability that this improving daily. Is that fair to say? Thank you, Joe. Thank you very much. Yes. Yes. I think we'll turn over to Grant for that comment. Grant, Londoner? Stephen, just to follow on Grant's comments. I understand the market is concerned about London disruption. It's a valid point. However, two thoughts for you. One is that I think if the market continues to accelerate like we're seeing January market numbers, perhaps we can overcome that by using other assets in the portfolio. But secondly, to Grant's comment, I think when you see the eventual transformation of Londoner, it will be a juggernaut on par with the -- or beyond. So it gives us two assets we think can probably make $3 billion by themselves. And while there's disruption 2024, 2025 in Beyond gives us something that's unique in that market. The number one and two assets are number one in on assets in that market for years to come. So, there may be some disruption but maybe market force can overcome that, but I think the end result is well worth the pain. Go ahead, Patrick. I'll follow yours. Go ahead. I think Patrick's comments are spot on, Steve. We have limited -- we have capacity constrained building in MBS. Unfortunately, we only have so many rooms suites, which we got 10 times as much, but we don't. So the mass market tourism is as important to us as the right tourists in the market. We look at this asset as a $2 billion asset today annualized EBITDA, but we believe it can grow 10% to 20% over the next three to four years. And then hopefully, we can finalize our plans with the government once the government blesses another building, we believe that, that could open later this year and make us a $3 billion projected EBITDA by end of decade in Singapore. So we see ourselves now at $2 billion, going to $2.2, billion, $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and eventually stepping up to $3 billion. We see huge growth in this asset. It's just beginning. We got obviously hampered by COVID, but to watch it growing is growing. Our only disappointment in Singapore is we just don't have more space, because it's a very desirable market and that building probably the most valuable in hotel building ever built in the world and will just accelerate in the next three, to four, five years until hopefully, we can tell you a finality, we have a deal in Phase II. Thank you. I'll just reiterate how much we believe in Singapore as a market. My comment is about $3 billion. We actually believe retainable when we opened this new building late in the decade. As for the update, Patrick's been right in the middle of that. So Patrick please take it away in terms of Phase II Singapore. Thank you, Carlo. Appreciate it. Grant? Shaun, that was good by the way. Thank you. Shaun, can I just follow up on Grant's comments. My experience has always been the same. Regardless of the market, great buildings and great experiences always prevail. We have those in Macao. If you look at our EBITDA in Q3, I believe our EBITDA exceeded our next two contenders combined, which is quite a statement to the power of our buildings. There will be promotional issues occasionally here and there, so in the end, we have a structural advantage, which can't be undermined. We have more capacity for lodging, food and beverage, retail entertainment and gaming capacity [indiscernible] by a bunch, and that will enable us to avail both a margin and EBITDA basis. And so yes, there will be occasionally a promotional issue here and there, but it really shouldn't concern as far as our business. Our margins remain intact, and our dominance remain intact in all segments in Macao. Thank you. Appreciate it. If you look at your deck on, I think it's Page 28 and 29, it gives you a pretty good look at our retail portfolio in Asia and be blunt about it, how it could be in half of these numbers, almost $3,000 a foot and a 600,000-foot more at MBS. Finished $2,000 a foot with 800,000 feet, of course, $9,200 a foot at the Four Seasons luxury and a mere $4,200 a foot on the non-luxury, so the answer is we are seeing our retail portfolio that's approaching $700 million of contribution and growing. Of course, there's discussions out, they'll be mentioned a slowdown globally. But it looks to me that I spoke to David, because they are retail experts. It feels like we continue to see opportunity to remerchandize and get better and better at the retail segment. We still believe that retail is a long way to go. Our buildings are a little different than other retail and that we attract a higher value customer both in Macao and Singapore, as you reference the lack of supply in Singapore. So I think that mall just keeps appreciating and we keep re-merchandizing it to be more effective every day, more luxurious, more upscale. In Macao, we've got work cut out for us in some of our buildings, not there yet in the Parisian. There's some work to be done, but I don't know how you could argue with these kind of results, $677 million of contribution, and it just keeps accelerating. It compares very favorably with 2019. So we feel very bullish about our retail prospects. And again, it takes work. David Sylvester constantly remerchandize read things and reassesses the portfolio. He's got a lot of work to do. But the numbers, I think, are stellar and I think we'll continue to be stellar for years to come. I think it's safe to say this business always runs on mathematics. The mathematics prevail, and I wouldn't take three quarters as an ongoing trend forever. There'll be a dark day in Singapore will miss by $70 million, because we take the highest volume players in the world, people who bet lots of money. And some days, it goes with you and someday it doesn't. This quarter, obviously, in Singapore went with us. But I would caution you, I don't think that the betters are changing. In fact, if any of the there's more of them, more affluence coming out of Asia, and we're fortunate enough to have the capacity to handle all of it. But I don't think you can point to a change in betting patterns in either jurisdiction that would elevate or hurt the whole percentage. It will be revert the mean always. And Macao will come back next quarter probably and do $70 million higher and Singapore may have a bad quarter. Grant, do you have any comment on that? That's how I see it. And Chad, going back yeah, just to find going back, I don't know, maybe eight, 10 years ago, we had a horrific number of quarters in a row due to a few players, I think, was Indonesia or Malaysia and we lost obscene amounts of money quarter after quarter to them. And some people on our Board were concerned as they want to be sure. And we talk -- we looked at everything, and we're very comfortable. And there is a belief therefore a while that these people were magical and could be beaten and they lost back their entire winnings and then some. It always goes that way. I don't think you can ever get too emotional about this quarter, it's very interesting to see the Macao miss and the Singapore overachieving. But in the end, the games stay consistent, pairs and ties versus straight bets do matter. But the Asian gambler is special. And he or she shows up consistently and they're great customers. I wouldn't let the success of a few quarters change your views on the mathematics of backlog. We don't. So thank you. I'll take New York first, Robin. The governor, Governor Hochul, I think it was this week commented on seeing something happen this year. I hope that's true. We're -- as you know, are -- we've been working in New York for quite a long time. And we think we have a very compelling bid. But we don't have any great insight if that will happen. We sure hope the Governor is correct. And either way, win or lose we'll get decision in calendar year 2024. That's our hope. But I think it'd be [indiscernible] any insight beyond the governor's comments. I think we just -- we worked very hard on this project. We believe we have a really good chance of getting one, but I don't give you -- I couldn't give you any guidance beyond that. Grant, Chinese New Year. Do you think he'll be any there for that? Will the year of the dragon bring anybody to the building? Robin, I do think, Robin, I think December was really great tell what might happen in Chinese -- December numbers that closed were just terrific. And again, you see the market numbers for January. So we're very hopeful that the year of Dragon is a huge year for us into the market. Patrick, do you want to grab that? When you say non-gaming, can you be more specifically talking about retail, food and beverage, hotels? Oh, I see. Okay. I'm going to let Grant handle that, but I would say we are a little bit different than the rest of our competitors in terms of we've been spending money aggressing Macao forever for 20 years on entertainment and other things. We believe it's a huge value add. I'll let Grant take the question specifically. But I think, again, it's important to note, we are a different animal than other people in terms of this concession. We welcome it. We've been doing it before the concession mandate. I think it's been very beneficial to our company. Grant? I'm sorry, George, I think we missed that. Could you repeat yourself? It was unclear there was some difficult -- static, yes. Can you try again, George, about Macao? Grant, do you want to handle the fourth quarter turnover to retail. Before we finalize the call, I want to reach out and recognize the great contributions of Wilfred Wong, who is now Executive Vice Chair. Wilfred has been with us about eight years and made a great contribution. And Wilfred, congratulations on the elevation of Executive Vice Chair. Grant Chum, well deserved. We hired Grant many years ago, the big concern was, was he old enough to win the casino at that time? And over the years, he's aged insufficiently, so he did not win the casino. Congratulations to you Grant. Both of you guys have built a terrific team over there. We're very proud and grateful for your efforts and look forward to many more years working together. Thank you for your time today and interest in our company. We bid you adieu."

            "content": "Yes, Shaun, China is still recovering from the tough COVID period. And \u2013but what is evident is the company's quarterly performance has actually been trending well. We have seen as Grant alluded to, healthy growth in the number of visitors, especially from the non-confidential region. Now one observation is that when long-haul travels of Chinese travelers has not fully recovered, Macao is emerging as a top tourist destination for short-haul drivers from the Chinese mainland. Yes. We have, in the past years, been investing heavily in the areas that Grant just described. And by a long way off, we are the leader in the MICE market. So we are still seeing a very strong presence of MICE activities in our properties. For non-gaming, apart from the shows, we've been helping to promote Macao as a destination, not just for gaming. Therefore, we have a lot of art exhibitions, cultural shows that really put us apart from the other competitors."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yes, Rob. Thank you. Yes, Joe, the segment differential growth in the fourth quarter, we had 13% growth in premium mass and 8% growth sequentially on base mass. So I think base mass was progressing nicely through the quarter. It's just that premium mass had a great performance that exceeded that. If you look at the visitation trends during the fourth quarter, Macao actually recovered to almost 90% of 2019 levels on visitations. So I think the base mass is continuously progressing and building up. Transportation infrastructure has been improving. I think the demand to come, I think the desire to take advantage of the non-gaming events that have been coming on stream across our properties, but across the whole industry, have been very effective. So I think you should expect that growth pattern to continue. Yes. The ability to get there has been improving, but the desirability of the destination is even clearer. You can see that the domestic flight to mainland key Greater Bay Area airports has all but fully recovered. And if you look at our ferry statistics, passengers that we carried in the fourth quarter recovered to 93% of pre-COVID, but only 52% of our sailing capacity. So clearly, people are enthusiastic about coming even though the transportation capacity is still recovering. And that's also clear, very gratifyingly the overseas, the foreign visitation recovered dramatically in fourth quarter, especially from Southeast Asia, and that's great to see from Macao. And that's despite the direct flights from foreign countries into Macao, haven't recovered even by, I think, 60% in the fourth quarter versus pre-COVID. But the visitation now is getting back up to 80%, 90% of what it was before despite the flight connectivity still catching up. Sure. Thanks, Rob. Thanks for the question, Steve. I mean, I think we can say in terms of the time line, we have already commenced the renovation of the Sheraton Hotel, and that will continue through the whole of 2024, and we'll hopefully complete sometime in the first quarter of 2025. And yes, there could be some impact from construction disruption, especially as we go into the second half of the year. And that a little bit depends on when the works are approved to commence on the Sheraton side of the casino floor, and also as well as the number of keys that will be our at any given time at the Sheraton. That said, I think we'll be managing this whole process just as we did in the first phase when we converted the holiday in into the London starting in 2019. So, we'll be well used to yielding the rest of the portfolio. As you know, the yields we're getting at the Sheraton side of the building is lower than the rest of the portfolio. So, we will be trying to not miss any opportunity to yield the rest of the portfolio whilst the works are going on. And this is something that we've been doing throughout these existing building renovations. Right now, the schedule is still a little bit fluid, just pending some statutory approvals. But at this point, our expectation is the first half will be relative normal and then expect to see some disruption into the second half. But then by 2025, we're going to be in a dramatically elevated and different position in terms of the entire Londoner. You asked about the Phase I and Phase II contribution. Well, we have done the bulk of the work in the public areas and external facade in the Phase I and the retail mall and one the two casino floors, but we only touched 1,000 keys out of the 6,000 that we have. So, the main difference is that Phase II is going to address the majority of the hotel inventory in terms of renovation and of course, the other main gaming floor that we have on the Sheraton side. Thank you, Shaun for the question. I think if you look at the competitive landscape, of course, it is very intense at the premium mass segment. But if you look at also at our margin structure, I think the way we've driven our business is no different from before, which is to really drive and elevate the product and to drive the content and the events that we put on across a whole range of sectors to attract visitors and patrons. And I do think that back to Patrick's opening comment, if you look at that margin progression, underlying margin grew another 100 basis points. We actually saw a good improvement in our mass margin sequentially. So we are dealing with the competitive market as any competitor does. It is intense, but we believe strongly that in the end, product wins and Londoner and Grand Suisse at Four Seasons are true living evolving testaments of that argument, that good product wins. And there are going to be fluctuations in the competitive intensity in particular segments at different points in time. But to have a sustainable competitive advantage and sustainable profitable growth, product and service and the content we put into the resort calendar are still going to trump everything else. And you can see that through what we've done at Londoner is already at a run rate of close to $800 million as it was exiting the year. And you can see that the way this is going, we will end up with a margin structure as we already are in Q4 back to the same level as we were in 2019. And then as the revenues continue to grow, you should logically expect that margin to continue to improve and therefore, exceed where we were in 2019. Sure, Shaun. I think if you look at fourth quarter, it did even have quite a bit. I think if you look at bans visitation from non-Guangdong versus Guangdong slides... Are catching. Yes. Thanks, Dan. We're catching up significantly on the recovery rate in non-Guangdong. That said, it is still uneven in the sense that if you look at the breakdown by province, some of the wealthier provinces, have recovered way beyond pre-COVID levels of visitations, particularly in the Yangtze River Delta versus even Guangdong, the recovery rate is actually much higher. But overall, I think you can see an evening out in terms of the recovery rate in Guangdong versus non-Guangdong. And then also, I think the fourth quarter, the overseas, the foreign country visitation also started to accelerate and even out as well against the nearby region source markets. So I think you are seeing I think, a progressive improvement across all the source markets. I don't know, maybe Wilford, I don't know if you have anything to add on the China side in terms of the \u2013 the economy. That's exactly right, Rob. And people have relatively short memories. But in the fourth quarter of 2022, there is like $100 million plus adjustment on the downward impact from low hold at Marina Bay Sands. So I think one or two, three, four even five quarters is actually a relatively short period of time and sample size for you not to get potentially very random results that deviate from the expected normal hold. But I think it's fair to say, yeah, the mathematics always prevail. And given the scale of our business, over time over one year, two years, we should stay very much in the expected range. As you saw in Macao as well, we had the first three quarters holding significantly above the expected mean hold and then fourth quarter reversed. And for the whole year, we end up at about 3.3%, which is exactly where we expect it to be. Thanks, Chad. Well, Robin, I mean, we can't really comment on the current quarter and obviously, booking windows are short here. But I think you can see from the December holidays in these peak holiday periods, even though the end of December is not a big China holiday. It is in Hong Kong and some other parts of the region. But the ramp-up in demand during those peak periods was tremendous. So hopefully, that will be replicated through into this Chinese New Year as well. So there is a lot of optimism and expectations that this will be a strong one, yes. Thank you, Robin. Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think in 2023, we went very intensely on investing across all of the non-gaming categories that we committed to in the concession. As Rob said, many of these categories are categories that we have been investing in involved in for a very long time. So I think whether you look across entertainment, we had almost 80 shows that we put on during 2023 with some amazing record runs attendance. Obviously, firstly, with the Jacky Cheung concert in Cotai Arena, and then towards the end of the year, [indiscernible] a singer in Hong Kong and had a great 14 show run at the Londoner. So it's probably set a new standard and precedent for many residencies in Macao. And then across other categories in MICE, in art and culture, in themed attractions and gastronomy. Across the board, we've been investing heavily. I should also give a chance to Wilford to speak to some of those events and projects that we've been heavily investing in as well. But suffice to say versus our original forecast for what we would invest in the first year of the 10 years, we greatly exceeded that during 2023. And we're looking to do so again in 2024. Wilford, I don't know if -- so you want to add to the non-gaming concession and investments we're making. Thank you. Yes, Patrick, I think you covered it well. I think it's dependent on revenue growth as the market continues to grow, and we will be more than a full participant in that market growth. The margins will have a positive trajectory. I think we obviously have a more efficient and more productive cost structure today than we did in 2018 and 2019. So, we will -- we are benefiting from that as revenues grow and you get the operating leverage on the fixed costs. We will continue to do so. And I think it is very much about how revenues grow from here. And as revenues grow, our margins will have further upside. Thank you very much. George, there are leases that are on monthly turnover rents and there are leases that are on annual turnover rents. So, historically, what happens is for those annual turnover rent leases as we get into the third quarter, the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will obviously be recognizing more of those turnover rents, as we hit the annual sales targets. So, historically, you should expect seasonally the second half of the retail rental revenues will be higher than the first half."

Macao diluted $630 million of EBITDA for the quarter and we are only eight months into our post-COVID reopen. These are early days. We began in Q1 with $400 million of EBITDA; Q2, we did $540 million of EBITDA; and Q3 is now at $630 million of EBITDA. Look forward to growth in both the gaming and non-gaming revenue to lift the entire market. SCL (ph) the largest share of non-rolling table win, rolling table win and slot ETG win. We've always believed that completed Londoner will meet perhaps exceed the earning power of the nation. Our future growth in Macao is tethered these powerful assets which have all the variables necessary to drive growth in years ahead. Whether it's rooms, gaming capacity, retail, entertainment, food and beverage, we have stellar assets. There is speculation about future growth of Macao. A relevant question is, can the market grow to $30 billion, $35 billion, $40 billion of GGR and beyond? We are firm believers that it will and may occur much -- a much shorter timetable that anyone realizes. This underscores our confidence and the returns will be generated by our capital investment programs in our portfolio. We are staunch believers in the growth of Macao market near and long-term. LVS has invested $15 billion in Macao, which is the most important land-based market in the world. A few reference points to consider, third quarter EBITDA represents strong growth compared to previous quarters, as I mentioned. Our retail business in Macao has far exceeded pre-COVID numbers. I expect the gain portion of our business to follow the same trajectory as Singapore and accelerated 2024. [Technical Difficulty] MBS and Singapore. Six quarters into a reopening, MBS delivered a $490 million quarter. The power of this building is evident based on the results despite the disruptive impact of our ongoing $1.75 billion renovation program. Disruption notwithstanding MBS is hitting on all cylinders from a gaming, lodging and retail perspective. Slots and ATG (ph) MBS are approaching $1 billion annually, non-rolling tables are exceeding $20 million of drop per day. The ADRs are escalating and our retail component is going far beyond pre-COVID numbers. MBS is a testament that quality assets prevail and validates the thesis that reinvesting in our assets will generate sustained returns. MBS has it all (ph), an iconic building with superb decor and service levels, which attract the most desirable customers in every segment. At the completion of both phases of our refurbishment program, MBS will feature 770 suites. We used to have 200 suites before the refurbishment. There is no denies future. How far can MBS go? Our expectations starts with $2 billion or more in the future of annualized EBITDA. Finally, we're bidding for a license in New York. We have secured the Nassau Coliseum (ph) and the process of gaining necessary selling requirements to move forward. We're also receiving strong local support from the local community. The resort will cost in excess of $5 billion, but enables us to develop a five-star resort with unlimited appeal. This is simply an extraordinary opportunity. We are very excited about the prospect. Our bid is compelling, that we award the license who will be in the ground as quickly as possible. Thanks for joining us again. I'm going to turn the call over to Patrick before we move on to some Q&A. Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Rob. I would like to cover two important topics before we get on to your questions. The first is the long-term margin structure we expect in our Macao business. As the Macao market revenues continue to recover, our margins will naturally benefit from an improved business mix. This quarter, our Macao EBITDA reached $631 million at a 35.3% margin, which is an increase of 210 basis points compared to the second quarter of '23. As revenues continue to grow, we expect our margin to exceed the 36% of Macao business in 2019. This quarter, the Malaysian Macao grew EBITDA to $290 million, with margins reaching 40.1%. This is an example of a property achieving strong revenue recovery with financial performance and margin that reflect the improved business mix. The Londoner Macao grew EBITDA to $167 million during the quarter, with EBITDA margin expanding 660 basis points sequentially to reach 32.2%. The strong flow-through of revenue to EBITDA reflects the operating leverage of our business, once the fixed costs have been covered. The transformation to Londoner has created a world-class product that is a must see for visitors for Macao. We will naturally have some construction disruption in 2024, but we expect future EBITDA growth and margin expansion over time, so that's Macao. The second item I wanted to cover is an update on our plans for the return of capital to shareholders. Our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion share repurchase through 2025, and we're looking forward to restarting our share repurchase program. In the nine-year period from 2012 to 2020, we returned over $22 billion of capital to [Technical Difficulty] shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases, which was split roughly 80% dividends and 20% to share repurchases. As we consider our future capital return, we expect share repurchase will be more heavily weighted than dividends. We believe repurchases will be more accretive in dividends over time as they reduce the denominator. We fundamentally believe in the compounding long-term benefit of share repurchases. So that's the capital return update. [Technical Difficulty] again today, and let's move to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Patrick, thank you for the additional color. Rob or anyone over in Macao maybe this one\u2019s best for. But as you guys think about the base and the premium mass. It looks like in the quarter, you guys kind of converted some premium mass tables to base mass tables. And obviously, with the increases in visitation that makes sense. Is that something you expect to do going forward? Do you have what you need basically in terms of the premium mass footprint in terms of table count at this point?\nRobert Goldstein: Yeah. The beauty of our business model is we've got plenty of capacity to do everyone. We will move to the market. As you saw in the quarter, we moved tables around to accommodate where we saw demand. But again, with the number of rooms and our table capacity, we can grow into any market in any segment that shows strength and that's what happened here. The truth is, I expect that to both move forward in the future and show growth both in base and premium. But our assets are built to be just this, which is versatile, able to accommodate the market. Grant may have some color on that's true of any market. The only difference in this market for me is, we did such a huge amount of table supply that we're very nimble. Grant?\nGrant Chum: Yeah. Thank you, Rob. Yeah. I think the repositioning this quarter for more towards base mass tables, that's just a natural part of our optimization between the segments and of course, as you rightly referenced, the summer saw a big increase in visitation and the base mass business. So that was just a natural repositioning to optimize the table count. As you can see, sequentially, a win per unit increased substantially in premium mass up 19% and base mass, even though we reorientated the table count towards base mass, we also increased the win per unit by 7% sequentially. So I think that you can see very clearly that we actually did optimize pretty well for the quarter between the two segments in terms of table capacity and these numbers will change again as the market evolves depending on which segment is growing faster.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. And then -- thank you for that. Patrick, if I could just kind of follow up on the Venetian and acknowledging that there was some high hold in the period on the VIP side. But it's a relatively small number in terms of revenue. As you think about kind of the margin profile, the 40.1% margins in the period at the property kind of rivaled '19 despite annualized third quarter net revenue being down, I think, close to 18% versus what you did in 2019. If we think about that gap, that odd $600 million flow-through, getting back to kind of '19 net revenue levels at that property or any other property. How would you think about kind of the incremental flow-through on that incremental net revenue and perhaps we could obviously take it from there to get a sense for where margins could kind of prove out over time?\nPatrick Dumont: So it's a great question. I think for us, the first thing is, this is what happens if you cover your fixed cost base. So when we were 70% recovered, we had to cover our fixed cost base in Macao. And as the market recovered and as tourism and visitation continue to grow, we will reach our run rate margin levels, which we always felt was in this context. So what do you see the Venetian is a result of a great product that has, is really an example of a property reaching a more run rate level of operation post-pandemic and the performance in margins that result. And we feel very strongly that the Venetian Macao is going to run as mass visitation continues to return to the market. Remember, Macao visitation is still about 20% less than it was pre-pandemic, we're down about 1 million visitors in the same period. So we feel very strongly about the margin potential. We're very proud about what's going on to The Londoner. We think the market is starting to understand that product operate it is, and we\u2019re starting to see the results in terms of productivity in terms of margin. But again, in that product as well, we think there\u2019s more room to run. So I think it\u2019s a great testament to the team there, the work they\u2019ve done to grow these businesses. But to be fair, we think there\u2019s strength in margins to continue as revenue continues to come into the market through visitation.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe, your line is live.\nJoe Greff: Good afternoon, guys. Before COVID, you guys used to disclose department margin ranges for base mass table games and premium mass table game ranges. I think base was 35% to 45% and premium mass is 25%, 40%. Are those margin ranges or the midpoint and higher still viable or does The Londoner and that ramp and clearly is in ramp mode right now, does that cause those ranges to be more middle or the lower end of that range is in the aggregate in Macao?\nPatrick Dumont: So I think for us, because of the mix of business and where we're investing, we sort of run the business in aggregate. So what we're looking at is the 40% margin that Venetian just put up in the quarter and the 660 basis point expansion in margin that The Londoner saw as the market discovered how great it was, and we started getting more visitation and more growth. So I think for us, that's really how we're looking at it. Departmentally, I think we manage the business overall. And as Rob said earlier, we're going to shift assets to the segment that is most productive and provides the best returns. So I think for us, we're not really looking at that as a guide. We're really looking at overall productivity of our asset base in total. I think one thing that's interesting to consider is, so in Macao, room occupancy was 96% versus 95% in the same period in '19. But the thing that's interesting is we're actually driving more daily casino nights at higher yields per room. And so in the premium mass segment, we're seeing a recovery, but our base mass segment is starting to recover strongly. And this is really what you see is, the businesses that used to support Macao mass tourism continue to come back online after what was basically a three-year hiatus. So this increased visitation will drive base mass revenue growth, and we'll start to see margin return to a more normal mix. So I wouldn't look at the departmental. I would look at the recovery in the aggregate margin of the operating asset. That's kind of how we're managing the business, and we're trying to manage segments throughout.\nRobert Goldstein: And then we look at EBITDA.\nPatrick Dumont: And then we look at EBITDA, which is the most important effect. Thank you, Rob.\nJoe Greff: Thanks. And then with respect to the buyback, that was great to see, Patrick. Do you look at that as more episodic or opportunistic? Or do you look at it as there's a minimum consistent minimum level or a consistent level per quarter per year that you would look at?\nPatrick Dumont: I think we're going to be measured across time. I think we want to return capital through share repurchases in a meaningful way. We think there is a real benefit to reducing the denominator. We think it's accretive. We think there's a compounding effect in share repurchases. And so we're looking forward to do it on a regular basis. The amounts to be determined. But for us, you see the size of the authorization, you see our balance sheet strength. You see the amount of cash flow we're generating down in the business. And we're going to go out and be aggressive. I think for us, we fundamentally believe in the dividend. But if you look at that split that we had, let's call it, pre-pandemic of a return of capital story (ph), I think we're looking to be majority share repurchases and get that benefit. And so if you look at how we've returned capital historically in a regular and repeatable way, I think we're going to look to do that again.\nRobert Goldstein: And Joe, it can't help, but be somewhat opportunistic as we look at the market. Our stock is trading roughly COVID levels, and we think our buildings are going to make $5 billion (ph) and more $40 billion, $50 billion in the next decade. It's hard not to look at the stock in [indiscernible], that's opportunistic. On the other hand, we also like to be long term and be consistent. So it's kind of a mixture of both. But it's hard for us to sit here today and look at pricing as if we\u2019re close to Macao or half open to Macao and Singapore, not think there\u2019s opportunity, but we also have a long-term perspective.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thanks a lot. Thanks, Patrick. Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on kind of what is holding back that lower spending customer. It sounds like transportation bottlenecks are no longer really the issue in Macao, if it's the RMB depreciation? Is that something we have to kind of wait for that to anniversary next year or I guess what do you think will change that the kind of visitor levels for that lower spending segment? Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. I think it's interesting. If you go to Page 16 in our deck and by the way, we debate this all the time. I think the team on the ground there is very focused on it. I think what you'll see is that visitation is from China, excluding Guangdong is 72%. [Technical Difficulty] Guangdong is back to 92%, but if you look at the air lift, Macao Airport was only at 64% of 2019 capacity in the quarter, and Hong Kong was only at 63%. So it's a pretty meaningful difference and so frictional transportation difficulties are still real, and they're getting better. Customers can get to Macao more easily in this border than they could before. But we're still not back to normal. And so what we're starting to see is, I mentioned earlier, some of the infrastructure for mass store groups are returning, which is very positive, starting to see some of the increased volumes due to their visitation. Some of the higher-value customers, premium mass customers and the IP customers, airlift isn't great. And some of this airlift coming into Macao was domestic and some of it's -- some of it's international. So I think for us, as we see this airlift capacity recover, we're going to start to see more entertainment (ph), of course, benefit not only us, but also the entire market is where people are able to get here more easily. But I think the recovery story is not fully there in terms of air travel and in terms of accessibility. I think it's on the way, but it's not fully back.\nRobin Farley: I guess I'm thinking that the air travel wouldn't necessarily be -- where the lower spending customer will be coming from there, and high-speed rail, I think is back to pre-COVID levels. So I just -- is there anything else that you think is impacting if that needs to change, whether it's policy in Mainland China or it\u2019s kind of anything else outside of that transportation issue. Thanks.\nRobert Goldstein: Grant, do you want to jump in here?\nGrant Chum: Sure. Yeah. I think, Robin, the -- Patrick referenced 72% out of non-Guangdong, Actually, if you look at the regional differences between provinces, I mean there are some of the higher spending provinces are actually way above 2019 in terms of visitation and some are lower than 2019. So I think there are just some regional differences depending on the whole host of factors ranging from the transportation to the availability of hotel rooms and so on and so forth, and their propensity to go cross border in their trips. I mean this is the first set of summer holidays since COVID. And then, I think what you see is actually a very strong acceleration in that non- Guangdong visitation this quarter. So we're really up 22% over visitations, but within that Mainland China is up a lot more sequentially. And that is also reflected in the property visitations that we saw this quarter, the 17% increase in the base mass revenue that we saw. So it is picking up, but it just accelerated at a different pace from the premium mass, which as you know, came back right from the start in a stronger fashion than the base mass. So I think as more to inventory is actually opening up and the propensity improves. People know the Macao market is back with all the non-gaming investments and events that are driving the interest in the destination I think that base mass segment will naturally improve over time as it did already significantly this quarter.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you, all. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live.\nStephen Grambling: Hi. Thanks. This may be a bit myopic, but I would love to hear a little bit more color on how Golden Week maybe trending and how the pace of recovery has continued across different customer categories more recently, especially around these big events that seem to have driven kind of a step function move in the recovery historically.\nRobert Goldstein: Steve, we traditionally don't talk about the current quarter. We'll keep that intact here as well. I think if you look at the numbers in the market as the print to see the strength of Golden Week\u2019s [indiscernible] the numbers driven by the government and other sources. But we never comment inside the quarter.\nStephen Grambling: Fair enough. And maybe changing to something more specific [Technical Difficulty] would love to just hear anything around potential near-term disruption. I think that that's going to be starting in November and then when that might be felt most and when we can anticipate the re-ramp?\nRobert Goldstein: Yeah. I'll turn to Grant, there will be some disruption, but we still feel as though the initial results, under are -- obviously, we're looking at it as a future hope that one of these prospects. Grant take it through '24, both [indiscernible] and Casino seeing that better and how we see it.\nGrant Chum: Yeah. Sure, Rob. I think clearly, we will work to minimize the impact on the guest experience and the business operations, but this is something that we have managed many, many times over the years. And indeed, we did that during 2019 when we started the holiday in conversion into The Londoner hotel. I think you'll see some disruption on the gaming side in the middle of next year. And I think we'll be managing the Sheraton Tower renovation methodically and judiciously over the entire period over the next 15, 18 months. So as to really continue to enhance the yielding on the customer front, but at the same time, try to get these works done as quickly as possible. I think the intent here is to move forward and complete the renovation and the repositioning of the entire south side of the resort, the Sheraton Towers and Pacifica Gaming as quickly as possible. The sooner we make the entire resort Londoner, the better it will be for everyone, our guests, our staff, our business and the brand positioning. So the only other point I would make is, we should take note that this part of the property portfolio is the lowest yielding part of the entire Cotai portfolio that we have both on the hotel and the gaming side. So we do hope to be able to successfully manage to minimize the disruption to the business. But when we get to completion on the other side, in the first half of '25. I think the earnings power through the holistic and expanded experience of the Londoner and Macao will be significantly enhanced. That's the goal.\nPatrick Dumont: Just sort of one thing to think about -- yeah, one thing to think about, so we're very focused on return on invested capital and growth in Macao. And so our anticipation is that the returns on these investments will be commensurate with those that we have previously and will drive meaningful growth. And by the way, the initial market reaction to this product really to what's been brought online so far really helps us with his view. Given the customer response and the performance of the asset in the long run, we believe that the completed Londoner, when it's done will be on par with the Venetian. That's what our target is.\nRobert Goldstein: I'd also add the Grant's comments, Stephen. Just again, the size, the scale of our portfolio gives us flexibility. We have 10,000 other rooms, money gets seems to new customers, too. So I think we minimize the disruption and maximize the opportunity to deploy the rest of our assets to keep our business strong despite that. And to Patrick's comment, one of those things can be juggernaut, they'll be neck and neck maybe exceed those two assets that are going to be hugely important in the future. But getting to \u201824, while not easy, I think it\u2019s very manageable to see deploy other assets in the portfolio intelligently.\nStephen Grambling: Thanks. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.\nRobert Goldstein: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad, your line is live.\nRobert Goldstein: Chad?\nOperator: Chad, please check your mute button. Your line is live, if you wish to ask a question. Okay. We can come back to Chad later. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. I just wanted to go back to the margins in Macao, and maybe that flowed through discussion a little bit more. If we look at it, it does look like flow-through just sequentially was a bit better in the third quarter here than in the second. I was just wondering, if we could get a little color on sort of maybe some of the mix impacts that drove that. Was that normalized staffing? Was it some of the non-gaming amenities, which are now kind of fully back on, which flow through at really good rates, like retail and hotel, was it sort of the base mass mix coming back? Just kind of how do you see it in terms of what maybe some of the factors were that drove that because it does look quite impressive.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks for that, and appreciate the question. I will tell you that there's a little bit of magic to it. It's called revenue increase 28.9%. So for us, it really is just more people showing up, spending money at the product, recognizing how great it is and increased demand. I mean it's a phenomenal product there last week. It really looks for the team, it\u2019s really providing unbelievable customer service and it's a highlight for Macao. It's a great asset and will continue to grow. And for us, it was just covering the fixed cost base. We just had to get -- and it was not a known product in the market. People are starting to figure it out, and it's going to keep growing. And so for us, this was really just growth in revenue across all segments, that was really the secret to it.\nShaun Kelley: Great. Thanks, Patrick. And then, as my follow-up, I just want to dig a little deeper into the buyback authorization, obviously, a big kind of strategic change. Could you give us a couple of parameters. I mean pre-COVID, the company was actually pretty high on its sort of overall payout ratio. You obviously have a pretty ambitious capital program across potentially New York, certainly, what you want to do on this -- on the big project in Singapore, some renovation activity and some of the CapEx in Macao. So should we think and parameters of a payout ratio and maybe how could we put some numbers around that, if possible? And then also just help us think about medium-term leverage, just given you're probably the most under levered gaming company I've ever covered. So a big complement to where you sit at the moment, but obviously, it presents a lot of potential firepower there.\nPatrick Dumont: So really appreciate the commentary of the question. I will tell you, so right now, we're sitting at about $5.6 billion worth of cash system-wide. Macao is starting to become very cash generative. Singapore is very cash generative. So the way we think about this is due to the timing of our development obligations and those cash flows, we will be able to do all. We'll be able to invest in our core markets and growth through organic growth and through redevelopment of key assets. We'll be able to do IR [Technical Difficulty] core. We'll be able to do our concession commitment to Macao and then we'll have excess capital and we'll pursue New York, and we're going to pursue other growth opportunities in new jurisdictions, and we'll be able to do it all because of the timing of the cash flow, the cash we have on hand and the cash tentative nature of our assets. So in terms of the payout ratio, as we addressed earlier in the call, we're not going to be as heavily weighted towards dividends as we were before. So if you look on Page 30, we sort of included a look on what were our prior return of capital programs looking like for both share repurchase and dividends. And on Page 30, what you'll see is historically, we were very dividend weighted. And to your point about payout ratio, we don't typically guide to payout ratio, but the point is well taken, we're looking really to flip it. So for us, the majority is actually going to end up being share repurchases, because we're very focused on growth. So we can grow the company's EPS through share shrink, we're going to do it. We can grow through capital allocations or high growth projects, we're going to do it. It's really an ROIC, and we're going to pursue it aggressively. And the good thing is we've got cash on the balance sheet. We've got cash center of assets and we have a historical program to provide you a good guide that we can launch off of and really hopefully drive real shareholder return in the future. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nPatrick Dumont: Sorry, one thing. Thank you, Dan. You mentioned leverage, and this is a very important thing. So prior to the pandemic, we spent about five years transforming the company to be an investment grade name. We thought this was really important. It gives us access to the largest, most liquid debt market in the world. It gives us a very efficient cost of capital, which in the long run provides flexibility but also drives returns on our new projects. And so having this investment-grade balance sheet also helps us in new jurisdictions because we have the financial capability to execute on projects we propose. So for us, we like being leveraged 2 times to 3 times on a gross basis. We've said it before. You've heard it from us on prior calls, nothing's changed. We still believe that. We think we\u2019ll delever over time through EBITDA expansion. But more importantly, I think for us, that\u2019s a key metric so that we maintain our investment grade rating for all the benefits we just described. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it.\nShaun Kelley: Thanks for that.\nDaniel Briggs: Thanks, Shaun.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt, your line is live.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Good evening, everybody. Thanks. So for Marina Bay Sands first, in your slide, you show flight capacity hovering around 80% recovered. Based on the momentum that you guys are seeing in that asset, do you still feel like you need that last 20% of China inbound to fully recover to hit that $2 billion run rate target. And can that happen actually while Tower 3 is under Reno?\nRobert Goldstein: What's happening, isn't it? I mean, this quarter, we just did 490. I hate to say, if that's happening. Good question. We always need China, let's be clear about that. We always want more business in all countries. But I think what you're seeing in Singapore is a very diverse bunch of assets are coming together. I think the biggest story is the suite product, which we haven't -- you haven't seen it's pretty extraordinary. When it goes from 200 to 700 -- 770, it's just a very potent combination of great food and beverage grade service. It enables us to get a place we've never thought of before. The real question is, I think $2 billion is our goal in the future and beyond. The real question is, when you get more China, when do you get more flights where you open up totally -- the thing that we talk about [Technical Difficulty] it's been open about six quarters of now. If you follow the trajectory of Singapore, we're hoping to see anything after Macao. We're very early stages in Macao. Singapore opened up, it wasn't that powerful in the first couple of quarters. And it been along, all of a sudden, it caught fire and now it's certainly performed, we're surprised how strong it is and because the place is kind of turn up. If you've been there, it's got some real challenges from a physical perspective. So to answer your question, we think we can get to without more a lot more. We'll take all the customers we can get. We think this is user for an asset. It's one of the places you just want to go to. You'll pay up for whether a room product or the gaming opportunity in retail it just is going to keep getting stronger. Do we think it's achievable? Yes, but we prefer to have all airlift coming in and all the potential customers in trying to have business [indiscernible]. We just have a huge faith in this product. We don't think two at the end, at the beginning, we're in to. So I do think it's important that we look at it the cabin benefit of understanding. We've gone from a dead stop in January back to the very difficult times of no one coming to mere in nine months later about 80% of Q3 '19. But how much for they're going to go? I think a lot more. If you look at Singapore, this trajectory, I think it's very telling what's going to happen in Macao. So I think, again, another illustration of what's happening in was on Page 25. I think the retail side is just you have to look at it. I mean all you guys have spent time in about $3,000 a foot is a pretty good local mall. The four season Macao is 8,400 foot in the luxury segment and 3,700 of the non-luxury in Venetian (ph) Macau, which is not a necessary luxury malls to $70 a foot. So the power of the spending right now in the retail opportunity always seem to happen first. The gaming seems to follow us happen in Singapore to happen in Macao. But to your question, we have huge confidence in the future of MBS. And I think our investments will prove in the end we make works in many places is supremely strong buildings with great service and great architecture, and that's what you have Rosadi (ph) and MBS.\nBrandt Montour: Great. That's super helpful. And then over on Macao, on Slide 14, it shows the win per visitor coming down quarter-over-quarter, it's the second quarter that's declined. Is that sort of wholly explainable by the reallocation of tables to base mass, which we talked about earlier in the call or is there any other constraints that you'd want to highlight why that sort of win per visitor is hovering around some of the quarters that we saw in 2019.\nPatrick Dumont: Just a quick thought on Page 14. This is really driven by visitation by the number of visitors that we're showing up to the market as it averages down. But I would like Grant to comment if he had any thoughts, just for some additional color.\nGrant Chum: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. No, I think what you're seeing is the evolution of premium mass coming back first. So for the first couple of quarters after the Board has reopened, you saw the revenue per Macao visit arrival, which is what this page shows, upon skyrocketed versus the historical levels. And you're now obviously getting more of the base mass, especially during the summer, so you are normalizing. But it's important to note that you are still getting a much higher quality mix of customers even with that when you compare to the same quarter in 2019. So I think from this slide, you can see is 610 per visits arrival in this quarter versus 557 in the same quarter in 2019. So the narrative continues that you are getting that higher quality across every segment, a higher spend per capita. But between the premium and base mass, you're now seeing the base mass starting to accelerate, especially during those July and August summer months.\nBrandt Montour: Got it. So just sorry to clarify, so it's mix to the base mass, but also more well-heeled customers that might be gambling slightly less, like families and such? Is that kind of a way to look at it?\nGrant Chum: No, this is actually showing you that the mass revenue per visit arrival is actually higher than the same quarter in 2019. So actually, you suggest that the higher spend per capita is actually prevalent in all segments of the market right now. And that also shows through in the gaming. I'm sorry, in the retail mall that Rob referenced as well.\nBrandt Montour: Perfect. Thanks for all the color.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Brandt.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from George Choi from Citi. George, your line is live.\nGeorge Choi: Thank you very much. While we do believe concerts can help to get incremental revenues in Macao. How should we think about the associated incremental expenses? And I guess more specifically, do you expect the [indiscernible] concerts at the Venetian this month to be both EBITDA accretive and margin enhancing at the same time?\nPatrick Dumont: So one thing just to begin, and thank you for the question. Entertainment is a very important part of our business. We're very focused on using entertainment to drive premium as visitation and create the programs that our customers feel like they'll get experiences with us, they can't get in other places. It's a very successful thing in Asia. And in fact, we just recently opened a brand-new venue in The Londoner that allows us to do that in more scale. But so I think for us, these programs are very accretive. Directionally, we think more entertainment as high quality is good, not only for the market, but also for diversification in Macao and in Singapore. I think it brings a prominence and an entertainment glow to the regions. But I would like to turn it over to Grant to see if you guys any additional comments about an entertainment and cost associated with it.\nGrant Chum: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Yeah. I think we've always been pursuing the entertainment strategy to create a better, more attractive destination and that hasn't stopped since the Board has reopened. In fact, we have been redoubling our efforts, as Patrick said, with the opening of The Londoner arena in May and June. So if you look at the third quarter, we actually did around 15 different show events with about 19 performances across the two arenas and obviously, in some only 13 weekends in the quarter, so there were some weekends where we are doing both a show at The Londoner and also in the Venetian. And we believe this is critical to driving not just the diversification in Macao and the non-gaming, but also to enhance the attractiveness and the propensity to come to the destination, especially our properties, and we can see the impact on our business. The economics of this hasn't changed and we've done this for 15 years. So we know how to calibrate the investment in entertainment versus the return we get on the overall resource spending. And also, there are different types of partnerships that we do in entertainment events, and that can range from just pure any rental to us being the actual promoter. So it varies and it's a calibration. It's analysis between the revenue benefit that we get and the visitation benefit that we get versus the cost and also depends also potentially on the entertainment partner as well, whether they invest or they want us to co-invest or us to invest. So that really hasn't changed, and we've been doing it for more than a decade. But what has changed is that we are actually significantly increasing the content because we now have a new spectacular venue in The Londoner for live music, which is already getting great feedback in terms of quality as any both for the audience but also for the office.\nRobert Goldstein: George, I\u2019d say, in my experience, entertainment is an essential component of any top-tier resort. You can never underestimate how powerful it is as a statement of the customer, longevity, commitment and honestly, for us, it's been stable. I wish regard how we can't do more because it's so powerful, just like retail, just like it's part of the package that makes people to come and visit. The reason why we have been so successful at the Venetian and it was true in Las Vegas. It was true in Lilac City (ph). It was true that anybody has ever worked. It's always been an essential component to be very tolerable in Singapore as well. So to me, it's not even a question, of course, how we do more of this stuff because it pays and pays and pays, very powerful.\nGeorge Choi: That\u2019s very good color. Thank you very much.\nRobert Goldstein: Thanks, George.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live.\nDaniel Politzer: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. First, on Singapore, the CapEx, the $750 million for Phase 2. How do you think about this maybe relative to your longer-term expansion plans at the property? I know that's been pushed out and the budget is probably higher than it initially was. But I mean, is this more kind of a bridge to that or how should we think about that long term and maybe when we get an update there?\nRobert Goldstein: Its commitment to Phase 1 because the product as good as it was externally architecturally, it lacked. Frankly, it was necessary that what happens in Phase 2. It's the best money we could spend to make that product successful and stronger. It's going to have enormous dividends in the future, the room product was lacking both from a size perspective, but also a finish perspective. Some of the casino space were just not very good. I always felt that MBS as good as was architecturally is lack of [indiscernible] inside the building. And in our business, great buildings, always prevail, and prevail for a decade and just grow and grow. So that money is money very well spent. It's not connected at all. It's meant to make MBS 1 a very powerful 2-plus billion product. We built in Singapore years ago, the speculation was that you'd never be more than $500 million, $600 million EBITDA. We're going to push through $2 billion and beyond. And I think it's a testament to reinvestment and spend money wisely. It doesn't have any association with Phase 2. Patrick, Phase 2.\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. Just to follow on with what Rob said, so fundamentally, we believe it's a product-driven business, right? And so that investment in quality, investment in innovation with great service and guest experience are going to drive the outside returns over time, right? So I think you're seeing that with The Londoner. And in Marina Bay Sands, the rules we just completed Tower 1 and Tower 2. The design is luxurious. It's residential, it is unmatched levels of service. These are the best things we've ever done, and they're basically saying a new standard for hospitality and customer experience at our properties. And to Rob's point, when Tower 3 is done, A Marina Bay Sands is going to be a hotel property in the world. We're really focused on it. From a food and beverage standpoint and from a retail standpoint, as Rob said before, from a guest experience standpoint, that's what we're focused on. IR 2 is going to be something different. It's going to be a new stand-alone development. It's going to have unique spaces, unique design, unique service, but it's something that's probably six months to a year away depending on how things go with approvals in order to get started. It will be additive to Marina Bay Sands. It will grow the market for us, be a different product and allow us to also have a live entertainment venue in Singapore, which is something that we really haven't had in scale before. And so if you look at the power of the Venetian and what we're doing in The Londoner with the venue that Grant mentioned, we will now have that capability in Singapore to drive high-value tourism to drive further growth and to really work that tourism that's related to live entertainment that we never really could do before. So for us, the expansion of Marina Bay Sands is a step function of growth potential. We're looking forward to doing it. We think it will be an unbelievable product. We've been spending a lot of time on it. And hopefully, we'll get a chance to start soon, but a completely different thing.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it. Thanks. And then just moving to Macao. I think for the last two to three quarters, your non-rolling ship win has been kind of in that 22% to 23% range. Is this a function of just really premium mass being a bigger piece of the mix or -- and so we should think about this kind of edging up over time back to that 23% to 24% plus range or is there something different in this market? And I'm sorry to harp on 1%, but when we're talking $24 billion.\nRobert Goldstein: You're right to harp on in, something we think about quite a bit. No, that your question is an excellent one, and we look at all the time, I was on the phone last night with our team Macao discussing its fast things we don't have an honest sans to tell you exactly why the entire industry seems to be down [indiscernible]. It's very impactful money we're talking about would be worth probably a couple of hundred million dollars used to us and go back 2% right, because it\u2019s EBITDA. So it's going back. We just don\u2019t have an answer. Is it mix? Maybe is it the removal of junket and that type of thing, maybe. But until we have a really coherent and certain answer, we don't want to give you a response. I'd like to believe that the oil industry trades up a point or 2. I'd vote for that. I'm sure our competitors would. But we didn't make it happen. We need perhaps -- it's very simple. The math on the baccarat games don't change. The customer best can change, ties and payers can change flatback change. So the point is, we don't know the answer ourselves. A lot of people scratched our heads until we have a certain answer we consider confidence. I want to hope along with you that we turn up to 24 again because it'd be a wonderful thing for us with our volumes, it will be incredibly impactful. We'd be at $700 million probably this quarter of EBITDA. So an excellent question. I don't have an excellent answer. We're working to prove it. Grant, any idea you add to that \u2013 that answer.\nGrant Chum: No, you're exactly right. We don't have a clear answer on that. There's -- in theory, actually, but just a point to make is, in theory, the premium mass being higher, higher mix in the drop actually should be positive for the whole facility. And it could also obviously add more volatility to the metric. But I think Rob is absolutely right that we don't have a clear answer and in truth, I mean this is only like eight, nine months into a recovery where the segments and the customers, I mean, all that is still evolving. So I think it's also premature to make specific pronouncements on what should be the non-rolling total percentage range. So right now, the numbers are what they are. But as you rightly referenced, as Rob also said 0.5 point of different, not even just 1 point, makes a tremendous difference to the numbers, the EBITDA, the margin, et cetera. So we're closely watching this, but there's no clear answer we can give on that in terms of why the whole percentage is where it is versus before.\nRobert Goldstein: Really in the new world in Macao, and I think people really don't understand. I think it's fast people understand how quickly this thing is reopened. I mean I know you know it, but the problem is Vegas open, regionals open, simple and quite a while ago, Macao was near the game. It's going to open for eight months, 8.5 months. So things are evolving and turning, it's happening quickly. Again, I think it's an instructive look at the trajectory of what happened in Singapore go back to eight months after it open, and you watch us happen double that time it's incredibly, I think, interesting to see the comparisons. I think this whole percentage thing is evolving. And we don't know we'll be wonderful to find out, we're back in '24 in Q2 would be wonderful. But without certainty, we will only give you an answer which we don't have clarity on ourselves, and we do we\u2019re happy to share with the market.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it. I appreciate all the detail and the perspective. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the last question today is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good day, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back on one detail. I'm not sure if you discussed this, but I'm just looking at the historical margin levels in Singapore, which were north of 50. Could you just talk about the puts and takes of getting back to that level again or if there's some specific headwinds? And then I have one quick follow-up.\nPatrick Dumont: No problem. I think one thing to highlight is that there was an increase in our tax rate by 3 percentage points and then there was a 1% GST. So what you see there is the impact of that along with inflation of the market. We've been able to manage expenses, manage business mix, manage pricing and push the business to be better. But our long term there is going to be with strong margins, with revenue growth just based on our investment and what we're seeing in the market. So we sort of manage the productivity yield and return on invested capital. Obviously, we look at margins and do our best. But we like where this business is going, and we think the future is very strong.\nDavid Katz: Understood. And as my follow-up, with the very, very good quarter that you had, and it's not just for your stuff, but many in our coverage, the market seems to expect some macro pressure in the future. And it's almost an obligatory question for all of our management teams. Are you seeing anything or providing anything that would validate any macro pressure at this point.\nPatrick Dumont: So I'll tell you what's interesting. You heard up Rob earlier reference our retail productivity. We are in very fortunate markets. So Singapore is an unbelievable place to do business. It's just a great place to visit as a tourist. There's a lot of exciting things to do there. It's a great business environment to trade and I think Singapore has benefited from its years of investment in the structure and people are going there and people are going there and consuming. And so we don't have a huge physical plant there. We've got 2,500 hotel rooms are going down as we add more suites. And I think in, Macao, we're less than 1% penetration in the market. And so when you look at business and leisure tourism opportunities, I don't know that we're impacted like a broad-based consumer staple. I think we're for a narrower segment, we don't appeal to everyone, but I think we're a great tourism assets in both of our markets. And we've continued to see growth through different cycles, because of who we appeal to and the volumes that we need to be successful.\nDavid Katz: Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and thanks for joining us today. Macao diluted $630 million of EBITDA for the quarter and we are only eight months into our post-COVID reopen. These are early days. We began in Q1 with $400 million of EBITDA; Q2, we did $540 million of EBITDA; and Q3 is now at $630 million of EBITDA. Look forward to growth in both the gaming and non-gaming revenue to lift the entire market. SCL (ph) the largest share of non-rolling table win, rolling table win and slot ETG win. We've always believed that completed Londoner will meet perhaps exceed the earning power of the nation. Our future growth in Macao is tethered these powerful assets which have all the variables necessary to drive growth in years ahead. Whether it's rooms, gaming capacity, retail, entertainment, food and beverage, we have stellar assets. There is speculation about future growth of Macao. A relevant question is, can the market grow to $30 billion, $35 billion, $40 billion of GGR and beyond? We are firm believers that it will and may occur much -- a much shorter timetable that anyone realizes. This underscores our confidence and the returns will be generated by our capital investment programs in our portfolio. We are staunch believers in the growth of Macao market near and long-term. LVS has invested $15 billion in Macao, which is the most important land-based market in the world. A few reference points to consider, third quarter EBITDA represents strong growth compared to previous quarters, as I mentioned. Our retail business in Macao has far exceeded pre-COVID numbers. I expect the gain portion of our business to follow the same trajectory as Singapore and accelerated 2024. [Technical Difficulty] MBS and Singapore. Six quarters into a reopening, MBS delivered a $490 million quarter. The power of this building is evident based on the results despite the disruptive impact of our ongoing $1.75 billion renovation program. Disruption notwithstanding MBS is hitting on all cylinders from a gaming, lodging and retail perspective. Slots and ATG (ph) MBS are approaching $1 billion annually, non-rolling tables are exceeding $20 million of drop per day. The ADRs are escalating and our retail component is going far beyond pre-COVID numbers. MBS is a testament that quality assets prevail and validates the thesis that reinvesting in our assets will generate sustained returns. MBS has it all (ph), an iconic building with superb decor and service levels, which attract the most desirable customers in every segment. At the completion of both phases of our refurbishment program, MBS will feature 770 suites. We used to have 200 suites before the refurbishment. There is no denies future. How far can MBS go? Our expectations starts with $2 billion or more in the future of annualized EBITDA. Finally, we're bidding for a license in New York. We have secured the Nassau Coliseum (ph) and the process of gaining necessary selling requirements to move forward. We're also receiving strong local support from the local community. The resort will cost in excess of $5 billion, but enables us to develop a five-star resort with unlimited appeal. This is simply an extraordinary opportunity. We are very excited about the prospect. Our bid is compelling, that we award the license who will be in the ground as quickly as possible. Thanks for joining us again. I'm going to turn the call over to Patrick before we move on to some Q&A. Patrick? Yeah. The beauty of our business model is we've got plenty of capacity to do everyone. We will move to the market. As you saw in the quarter, we moved tables around to accommodate where we saw demand. But again, with the number of rooms and our table capacity, we can grow into any market in any segment that shows strength and that's what happened here. The truth is, I expect that to both move forward in the future and show growth both in base and premium. But our assets are built to be just this, which is versatile, able to accommodate the market. Grant may have some color on that's true of any market. The only difference in this market for me is, we did such a huge amount of table supply that we're very nimble. Grant? And then we look at EBITDA. And Joe, it can't help, but be somewhat opportunistic as we look at the market. Our stock is trading roughly COVID levels, and we think our buildings are going to make $5 billion (ph) and more $40 billion, $50 billion in the next decade. It's hard not to look at the stock in [indiscernible], that's opportunistic. On the other hand, we also like to be long term and be consistent. So it's kind of a mixture of both. But it's hard for us to sit here today and look at pricing as if we're close to Macao or half open to Macao and Singapore, not think there's opportunity, but we also have a long-term perspective. Grant, do you want to jump in here? Steve, we traditionally don't talk about the current quarter. We'll keep that intact here as well. I think if you look at the numbers in the market as the print to see the strength of Golden Week's [indiscernible] the numbers driven by the government and other sources. But we never comment inside the quarter. Yeah. I'll turn to Grant, there will be some disruption, but we still feel as though the initial results, under are -- obviously, we're looking at it as a future hope that one of these prospects. Grant take it through '24, both [indiscernible] and Casino seeing that better and how we see it. I'd also add the Grant's comments, Stephen. Just again, the size, the scale of our portfolio gives us flexibility. We have 10,000 other rooms, money gets seems to new customers, too. So I think we minimize the disruption and maximize the opportunity to deploy the rest of our assets to keep our business strong despite that. And to Patrick's comment, one of those things can be juggernaut, they'll be neck and neck maybe exceed those two assets that are going to be hugely important in the future. But getting to \u201824, while not easy, I think it's very manageable to see deploy other assets in the portfolio intelligently. Okay. Thank you. Chad? What's happening, isn't it? I mean, this quarter, we just did 490. I hate to say, if that's happening. Good question. We always need China, let's be clear about that. We always want more business in all countries. But I think what you're seeing in Singapore is a very diverse bunch of assets are coming together. I think the biggest story is the suite product, which we haven't -- you haven't seen it's pretty extraordinary. When it goes from 200 to 700 -- 770, it's just a very potent combination of great food and beverage grade service. It enables us to get a place we've never thought of before. The real question is, I think $2 billion is our goal in the future and beyond. The real question is, when you get more China, when do you get more flights where you open up totally -- the thing that we talk about [Technical Difficulty] it's been open about six quarters of now. If you follow the trajectory of Singapore, we're hoping to see anything after Macao. We're very early stages in Macao. Singapore opened up, it wasn't that powerful in the first couple of quarters. And it been along, all of a sudden, it caught fire and now it's certainly performed, we're surprised how strong it is and because the place is kind of turn up. If you've been there, it's got some real challenges from a physical perspective. So to answer your question, we think we can get to without more a lot more. We'll take all the customers we can get. We think this is user for an asset. It's one of the places you just want to go to. You'll pay up for whether a room product or the gaming opportunity in retail it just is going to keep getting stronger. Do we think it's achievable? Yes, but we prefer to have all airlift coming in and all the potential customers in trying to have business [indiscernible]. We just have a huge faith in this product. We don't think two at the end, at the beginning, we're in to. So I do think it's important that we look at it the cabin benefit of understanding. We've gone from a dead stop in January back to the very difficult times of no one coming to mere in nine months later about 80% of Q3 '19. But how much for they're going to go? I think a lot more. If you look at Singapore, this trajectory, I think it's very telling what's going to happen in Macao. So I think, again, another illustration of what's happening in was on Page 25. I think the retail side is just you have to look at it. I mean all you guys have spent time in about $3,000 a foot is a pretty good local mall. The four season Macao is 8,400 foot in the luxury segment and 3,700 of the non-luxury in Venetian (ph) Macau, which is not a necessary luxury malls to $70 a foot. So the power of the spending right now in the retail opportunity always seem to happen first. The gaming seems to follow us happen in Singapore to happen in Macao. But to your question, we have huge confidence in the future of MBS. And I think our investments will prove in the end we make works in many places is supremely strong buildings with great service and great architecture, and that's what you have Rosadi (ph) and MBS. George, I'd say, in my experience, entertainment is an essential component of any top-tier resort. You can never underestimate how powerful it is as a statement of the customer, longevity, commitment and honestly, for us, it's been stable. I wish regard how we can't do more because it's so powerful, just like retail, just like it's part of the package that makes people to come and visit. The reason why we have been so successful at the Venetian and it was true in Las Vegas. It was true in Lilac City (ph). It was true that anybody has ever worked. It's always been an essential component to be very tolerable in Singapore as well. So to me, it's not even a question, of course, how we do more of this stuff because it pays and pays and pays, very powerful. Thanks, George. Its commitment to Phase 1 because the product as good as it was externally architecturally, it lacked. Frankly, it was necessary that what happens in Phase 2. It's the best money we could spend to make that product successful and stronger. It's going to have enormous dividends in the future, the room product was lacking both from a size perspective, but also a finish perspective. Some of the casino space were just not very good. I always felt that MBS as good as was architecturally is lack of [indiscernible] inside the building. And in our business, great buildings, always prevail, and prevail for a decade and just grow and grow. So that money is money very well spent. It's not connected at all. It's meant to make MBS 1 a very powerful 2-plus billion product. We built in Singapore years ago, the speculation was that you'd never be more than $500 million, $600 million EBITDA. We're going to push through $2 billion and beyond. And I think it's a testament to reinvestment and spend money wisely. It doesn't have any association with Phase 2. Patrick, Phase 2. You're right to harp on in, something we think about quite a bit. No, that your question is an excellent one, and we look at all the time, I was on the phone last night with our team Macao discussing its fast things we don't have an honest sans to tell you exactly why the entire industry seems to be down [indiscernible]. It's very impactful money we're talking about would be worth probably a couple of hundred million dollars used to us and go back 2% right, because it's EBITDA. So it's going back. We just don't have an answer. Is it mix? Maybe is it the removal of junket and that type of thing, maybe. But until we have a really coherent and certain answer, we don't want to give you a response. I'd like to believe that the oil industry trades up a point or 2. I'd vote for that. I'm sure our competitors would. But we didn't make it happen. We need perhaps -- it's very simple. The math on the baccarat games don't change. The customer best can change, ties and payers can change flatback change. So the point is, we don't know the answer ourselves. A lot of people scratched our heads until we have a certain answer we consider confidence. I want to hope along with you that we turn up to 24 again because it'd be a wonderful thing for us with our volumes, it will be incredibly impactful. We'd be at $700 million probably this quarter of EBITDA. So an excellent question. I don't have an excellent answer. We're working to prove it. Grant, any idea you add to that \u2013 that answer. Really in the new world in Macao, and I think people really don't understand. I think it's fast people understand how quickly this thing is reopened. I mean I know you know it, but the problem is Vegas open, regionals open, simple and quite a while ago, Macao was near the game. It's going to open for eight months, 8.5 months. So things are evolving and turning, it's happening quickly. Again, I think it's an instructive look at the trajectory of what happened in Singapore go back to eight months after it open, and you watch us happen double that time it's incredibly, I think, interesting to see the comparisons. I think this whole percentage thing is evolving. And we don't know we'll be wonderful to find out, we're back in '24 in Q2 would be wonderful. But without certainty, we will only give you an answer which we don't have clarity on ourselves, and we do we're happy to share with the market."

            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I would like to cover two important topics before we get on to your questions. The first is the long-term margin structure we expect in our Macao business. As the Macao market revenues continue to recover, our margins will naturally benefit from an improved business mix. This quarter, our Macao EBITDA reached $631 million at a 35.3% margin, which is an increase of 210 basis points compared to the second quarter of '23. As revenues continue to grow, we expect our margin to exceed the 36% of Macao business in 2019. This quarter, the Malaysian Macao grew EBITDA to $290 million, with margins reaching 40.1%. This is an example of a property achieving strong revenue recovery with financial performance and margin that reflect the improved business mix. The Londoner Macao grew EBITDA to $167 million during the quarter, with EBITDA margin expanding 660 basis points sequentially to reach 32.2%. The strong flow-through of revenue to EBITDA reflects the operating leverage of our business, once the fixed costs have been covered. The transformation to Londoner has created a world-class product that is a must see for visitors for Macao. We will naturally have some construction disruption in 2024, but we expect future EBITDA growth and margin expansion over time, so that's Macao. The second item I wanted to cover is an update on our plans for the return of capital to shareholders. Our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion share repurchase through 2025, and we're looking forward to restarting our share repurchase program. In the nine-year period from 2012 to 2020, we returned over $22 billion of capital to [Technical Difficulty] shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases, which was split roughly 80% dividends and 20% to share repurchases. As we consider our future capital return, we expect share repurchase will be more heavily weighted than dividends. We believe repurchases will be more accretive in dividends over time as they reduce the denominator. We fundamentally believe in the compounding long-term benefit of share repurchases. So that's the capital return update. [Technical Difficulty] again today, and let's move to Q&A. So it's a great question. I think for us, the first thing is, this is what happens if you cover your fixed cost base. So when we were 70% recovered, we had to cover our fixed cost base in Macao. And as the market recovered and as tourism and visitation continue to grow, we will reach our run rate margin levels, which we always felt was in this context. So what do you see the Venetian is a result of a great product that has, is really an example of a property reaching a more run rate level of operation post-pandemic and the performance in margins that result. And we feel very strongly that the Venetian Macao is going to run as mass visitation continues to return to the market. Remember, Macao visitation is still about 20% less than it was pre-pandemic, we're down about 1 million visitors in the same period. So we feel very strongly about the margin potential. We're very proud about what's going on to The Londoner. We think the market is starting to understand that product operate it is, and we're starting to see the results in terms of productivity in terms of margin. But again, in that product as well, we think there's more room to run. So I think it's a great testament to the team there, the work they've done to grow these businesses. But to be fair, we think there's strength in margins to continue as revenue continues to come into the market through visitation. So I think for us, because of the mix of business and where we're investing, we sort of run the business in aggregate. So what we're looking at is the 40% margin that Venetian just put up in the quarter and the 660 basis point expansion in margin that The Londoner saw as the market discovered how great it was, and we started getting more visitation and more growth. So I think for us, that's really how we're looking at it. Departmentally, I think we manage the business overall. And as Rob said earlier, we're going to shift assets to the segment that is most productive and provides the best returns. So I think for us, we're not really looking at that as a guide. We're really looking at overall productivity of our asset base in total. I think one thing that's interesting to consider is, so in Macao, room occupancy was 96% versus 95% in the same period in '19. But the thing that's interesting is we're actually driving more daily casino nights at higher yields per room. And so in the premium mass segment, we're seeing a recovery, but our base mass segment is starting to recover strongly. And this is really what you see is, the businesses that used to support Macao mass tourism continue to come back online after what was basically a three-year hiatus. So this increased visitation will drive base mass revenue growth, and we'll start to see margin return to a more normal mix. So I wouldn't look at the departmental. I would look at the recovery in the aggregate margin of the operating asset. That's kind of how we're managing the business, and we're trying to manage segments throughout. And then we look at EBITDA, which is the most important effect. Thank you, Rob. I think we're going to be measured across time. I think we want to return capital through share repurchases in a meaningful way. We think there is a real benefit to reducing the denominator. We think it's accretive. We think there's a compounding effect in share repurchases. And so we're looking forward to do it on a regular basis. The amounts to be determined. But for us, you see the size of the authorization, you see our balance sheet strength. You see the amount of cash flow we're generating down in the business. And we're going to go out and be aggressive. I think for us, we fundamentally believe in the dividend. But if you look at that split that we had, let's call it, pre-pandemic of a return of capital story (ph), I think we're looking to be majority share repurchases and get that benefit. And so if you look at how we've returned capital historically in a regular and repeatable way, I think we're going to look to do that again. Yeah. I think it's interesting. If you go to Page 16 in our deck and by the way, we debate this all the time. I think the team on the ground there is very focused on it. I think what you'll see is that visitation is from China, excluding Guangdong is 72%. [Technical Difficulty] Guangdong is back to 92%, but if you look at the air lift, Macao Airport was only at 64% of 2019 capacity in the quarter, and Hong Kong was only at 63%. So it's a pretty meaningful difference and so frictional transportation difficulties are still real, and they're getting better. Customers can get to Macao more easily in this border than they could before. But we're still not back to normal. And so what we're starting to see is, I mentioned earlier, some of the infrastructure for mass store groups are returning, which is very positive, starting to see some of the increased volumes due to their visitation. Some of the higher-value customers, premium mass customers and the IP customers, airlift isn't great. And some of this airlift coming into Macao was domestic and some of it's -- some of it's international. So I think for us, as we see this airlift capacity recover, we're going to start to see more entertainment (ph), of course, benefit not only us, but also the entire market is where people are able to get here more easily. But I think the recovery story is not fully there in terms of air travel and in terms of accessibility. I think it's on the way, but it's not fully back. Just sort of one thing to think about -- yeah, one thing to think about, so we're very focused on return on invested capital and growth in Macao. And so our anticipation is that the returns on these investments will be commensurate with those that we have previously and will drive meaningful growth. And by the way, the initial market reaction to this product really to what's been brought online so far really helps us with his view. Given the customer response and the performance of the asset in the long run, we believe that the completed Londoner, when it's done will be on par with the Venetian. That's what our target is. Thanks for that, and appreciate the question. I will tell you that there's a little bit of magic to it. It's called revenue increase 28.9%. So for us, it really is just more people showing up, spending money at the product, recognizing how great it is and increased demand. I mean it's a phenomenal product there last week. It really looks for the team, it's really providing unbelievable customer service and it's a highlight for Macao. It's a great asset and will continue to grow. And for us, it was just covering the fixed cost base. We just had to get -- and it was not a known product in the market. People are starting to figure it out, and it's going to keep growing. And so for us, this was really just growth in revenue across all segments, that was really the secret to it. So really appreciate the commentary of the question. I will tell you, so right now, we're sitting at about $5.6 billion worth of cash system-wide. Macao is starting to become very cash generative. Singapore is very cash generative. So the way we think about this is due to the timing of our development obligations and those cash flows, we will be able to do all. We'll be able to invest in our core markets and growth through organic growth and through redevelopment of key assets. We'll be able to do IR [Technical Difficulty] core. We'll be able to do our concession commitment to Macao and then we'll have excess capital and we'll pursue New York, and we're going to pursue other growth opportunities in new jurisdictions, and we'll be able to do it all because of the timing of the cash flow, the cash we have on hand and the cash tentative nature of our assets. So in terms of the payout ratio, as we addressed earlier in the call, we're not going to be as heavily weighted towards dividends as we were before. So if you look on Page 30, we sort of included a look on what were our prior return of capital programs looking like for both share repurchase and dividends. And on Page 30, what you'll see is historically, we were very dividend weighted. And to your point about payout ratio, we don't typically guide to payout ratio, but the point is well taken, we're looking really to flip it. So for us, the majority is actually going to end up being share repurchases, because we're very focused on growth. So we can grow the company's EPS through share shrink, we're going to do it. We can grow through capital allocations or high growth projects, we're going to do it. It's really an ROIC, and we're going to pursue it aggressively. And the good thing is we've got cash on the balance sheet. We've got cash center of assets and we have a historical program to provide you a good guide that we can launch off of and really hopefully drive real shareholder return in the future. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Sorry, one thing. Thank you, Dan. You mentioned leverage, and this is a very important thing. So prior to the pandemic, we spent about five years transforming the company to be an investment grade name. We thought this was really important. It gives us access to the largest, most liquid debt market in the world. It gives us a very efficient cost of capital, which in the long run provides flexibility but also drives returns on our new projects. And so having this investment-grade balance sheet also helps us in new jurisdictions because we have the financial capability to execute on projects we propose. So for us, we like being leveraged 2 times to 3 times on a gross basis. We've said it before. You've heard it from us on prior calls, nothing's changed. We still believe that. We think we'll delever over time through EBITDA expansion. But more importantly, I think for us, that's a key metric so that we maintain our investment grade rating for all the benefits we just described. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Just a quick thought on Page 14. This is really driven by visitation by the number of visitors that we're showing up to the market as it averages down. But I would like Grant to comment if he had any thoughts, just for some additional color. Thanks, Brandt. So one thing just to begin, and thank you for the question. Entertainment is a very important part of our business. We're very focused on using entertainment to drive premium as visitation and create the programs that our customers feel like they'll get experiences with us, they can't get in other places. It's a very successful thing in Asia. And in fact, we just recently opened a brand-new venue in The Londoner that allows us to do that in more scale. But so I think for us, these programs are very accretive. Directionally, we think more entertainment as high quality is good, not only for the market, but also for diversification in Macao and in Singapore. I think it brings a prominence and an entertainment glow to the regions. But I would like to turn it over to Grant to see if you guys any additional comments about an entertainment and cost associated with it. Yeah. Just to follow on with what Rob said, so fundamentally, we believe it's a product-driven business, right? And so that investment in quality, investment in innovation with great service and guest experience are going to drive the outside returns over time, right? So I think you're seeing that with The Londoner. And in Marina Bay Sands, the rules we just completed Tower 1 and Tower 2. The design is luxurious. It's residential, it is unmatched levels of service. These are the best things we've ever done, and they're basically saying a new standard for hospitality and customer experience at our properties. And to Rob's point, when Tower 3 is done, A Marina Bay Sands is going to be a hotel property in the world. We're really focused on it. From a food and beverage standpoint and from a retail standpoint, as Rob said before, from a guest experience standpoint, that's what we're focused on. IR 2 is going to be something different. It's going to be a new stand-alone development. It's going to have unique spaces, unique design, unique service, but it's something that's probably six months to a year away depending on how things go with approvals in order to get started. It will be additive to Marina Bay Sands. It will grow the market for us, be a different product and allow us to also have a live entertainment venue in Singapore, which is something that we really haven't had in scale before. And so if you look at the power of the Venetian and what we're doing in The Londoner with the venue that Grant mentioned, we will now have that capability in Singapore to drive high-value tourism to drive further growth and to really work that tourism that's related to live entertainment that we never really could do before. So for us, the expansion of Marina Bay Sands is a step function of growth potential. We're looking forward to doing it. We think it will be an unbelievable product. We've been spending a lot of time on it. And hopefully, we'll get a chance to start soon, but a completely different thing. No problem. I think one thing to highlight is that there was an increase in our tax rate by 3 percentage points and then there was a 1% GST. So what you see there is the impact of that along with inflation of the market. We've been able to manage expenses, manage business mix, manage pricing and push the business to be better. But our long term there is going to be with strong margins, with revenue growth just based on our investment and what we're seeing in the market. So we sort of manage the productivity yield and return on invested capital. Obviously, we look at margins and do our best. But we like where this business is going, and we think the future is very strong. So I'll tell you what's interesting. You heard up Rob earlier reference our retail productivity. We are in very fortunate markets. So Singapore is an unbelievable place to do business. It's just a great place to visit as a tourist. There's a lot of exciting things to do there. It's a great business environment to trade and I think Singapore has benefited from its years of investment in the structure and people are going there and people are going there and consuming. And so we don't have a huge physical plant there. We've got 2,500 hotel rooms are going down as we add more suites. And I think in, Macao, we're less than 1% penetration in the market. And so when you look at business and leisure tourism opportunities, I don't know that we're impacted like a broad-based consumer staple. I think we're for a narrower segment, we don't appeal to everyone, but I think we're a great tourism assets in both of our markets. And we've continued to see growth through different cycles, because of who we appeal to and the volumes that we need to be successful."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yeah. Thank you, Rob. Yeah. I think the repositioning this quarter for more towards base mass tables, that's just a natural part of our optimization between the segments and of course, as you rightly referenced, the summer saw a big increase in visitation and the base mass business. So that was just a natural repositioning to optimize the table count. As you can see, sequentially, a win per unit increased substantially in premium mass up 19% and base mass, even though we reorientated the table count towards base mass, we also increased the win per unit by 7% sequentially. So I think that you can see very clearly that we actually did optimize pretty well for the quarter between the two segments in terms of table capacity and these numbers will change again as the market evolves depending on which segment is growing faster. Sure. Yeah. I think, Robin, the -- Patrick referenced 72% out of non-Guangdong, Actually, if you look at the regional differences between provinces, I mean there are some of the higher spending provinces are actually way above 2019 in terms of visitation and some are lower than 2019. So I think there are just some regional differences depending on the whole host of factors ranging from the transportation to the availability of hotel rooms and so on and so forth, and their propensity to go cross border in their trips. I mean this is the first set of summer holidays since COVID. And then, I think what you see is actually a very strong acceleration in that non- Guangdong visitation this quarter. So we're really up 22% over visitations, but within that Mainland China is up a lot more sequentially. And that is also reflected in the property visitations that we saw this quarter, the 17% increase in the base mass revenue that we saw. So it is picking up, but it just accelerated at a different pace from the premium mass, which as you know, came back right from the start in a stronger fashion than the base mass. So I think as more to inventory is actually opening up and the propensity improves. People know the Macao market is back with all the non-gaming investments and events that are driving the interest in the destination I think that base mass segment will naturally improve over time as it did already significantly this quarter. Yeah. Sure, Rob. I think clearly, we will work to minimize the impact on the guest experience and the business operations, but this is something that we have managed many, many times over the years. And indeed, we did that during 2019 when we started the holiday in conversion into The Londoner hotel. I think you'll see some disruption on the gaming side in the middle of next year. And I think we'll be managing the Sheraton Tower renovation methodically and judiciously over the entire period over the next 15, 18 months. So as to really continue to enhance the yielding on the customer front, but at the same time, try to get these works done as quickly as possible. I think the intent here is to move forward and complete the renovation and the repositioning of the entire south side of the resort, the Sheraton Towers and Pacifica Gaming as quickly as possible. The sooner we make the entire resort Londoner, the better it will be for everyone, our guests, our staff, our business and the brand positioning. So the only other point I would make is, we should take note that this part of the property portfolio is the lowest yielding part of the entire Cotai portfolio that we have both on the hotel and the gaming side. So we do hope to be able to successfully manage to minimize the disruption to the business. But when we get to completion on the other side, in the first half of '25. I think the earnings power through the holistic and expanded experience of the Londoner and Macao will be significantly enhanced. That's the goal. Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. No, I think what you're seeing is the evolution of premium mass coming back first. So for the first couple of quarters after the Board has reopened, you saw the revenue per Macao visit arrival, which is what this page shows, upon skyrocketed versus the historical levels. And you're now obviously getting more of the base mass, especially during the summer, so you are normalizing. But it's important to note that you are still getting a much higher quality mix of customers even with that when you compare to the same quarter in 2019. So I think from this slide, you can see is 610 per visits arrival in this quarter versus 557 in the same quarter in 2019. So the narrative continues that you are getting that higher quality across every segment, a higher spend per capita. But between the premium and base mass, you're now seeing the base mass starting to accelerate, especially during those July and August summer months. No, this is actually showing you that the mass revenue per visit arrival is actually higher than the same quarter in 2019. So actually, you suggest that the higher spend per capita is actually prevalent in all segments of the market right now. And that also shows through in the gaming. I'm sorry, in the retail mall that Rob referenced as well. Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Yeah. I think we've always been pursuing the entertainment strategy to create a better, more attractive destination and that hasn't stopped since the Board has reopened. In fact, we have been redoubling our efforts, as Patrick said, with the opening of The Londoner arena in May and June. So if you look at the third quarter, we actually did around 15 different show events with about 19 performances across the two arenas and obviously, in some only 13 weekends in the quarter, so there were some weekends where we are doing both a show at The Londoner and also in the Venetian. And we believe this is critical to driving not just the diversification in Macao and the non-gaming, but also to enhance the attractiveness and the propensity to come to the destination, especially our properties, and we can see the impact on our business. The economics of this hasn't changed and we've done this for 15 years. So we know how to calibrate the investment in entertainment versus the return we get on the overall resource spending. And also, there are different types of partnerships that we do in entertainment events, and that can range from just pure any rental to us being the actual promoter. So it varies and it's a calibration. It's analysis between the revenue benefit that we get and the visitation benefit that we get versus the cost and also depends also potentially on the entertainment partner as well, whether they invest or they want us to co-invest or us to invest. So that really hasn't changed, and we've been doing it for more than a decade. But what has changed is that we are actually significantly increasing the content because we now have a new spectacular venue in The Londoner for live music, which is already getting great feedback in terms of quality as any both for the audience but also for the office. No, you're exactly right. We don't have a clear answer on that. There's -- in theory, actually, but just a point to make is, in theory, the premium mass being higher, higher mix in the drop actually should be positive for the whole facility. And it could also obviously add more volatility to the metric. But I think Rob is absolutely right that we don't have a clear answer and in truth, I mean this is only like eight, nine months into a recovery where the segments and the customers, I mean, all that is still evolving. So I think it's also premature to make specific pronouncements on what should be the non-rolling total percentage range. So right now, the numbers are what they are. But as you rightly referenced, as Rob also said 0.5 point of different, not even just 1 point, makes a tremendous difference to the numbers, the EBITDA, the margin, et cetera. So we're closely watching this, but there's no clear answer we can give on that in terms of why the whole percentage is where it is versus before."

We continue to invest in both markets for our future growth. We do have a structural advantage in Macao based on our scale. As the market accelerates, we will be a major beneficiary in the future. Singapore continues to do well despite two impediments. We're in the midst of $1 billion renovation, which does impact adversely the results in Singapore. In addition, we haven't seen a full return of the Chinese premium mass segment yet. This iconic building has a very bright future. Cash flow recovery is in full bloom. So it's very, very enjoyable to say, yay, dividends. Let's go to some Q&A. First question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Joe, your line is live.\nJoe Greff: Hey, everyone.\nRob Goldstein: Hi, Joe.\nJoe Greff: Rob, Patrick, Dan, and the team in Macao, I'd love to get your view on margins in Macao, both within the quarter. And then just broadly how you're thinking about it going forward. When you look at the months within the 2Q, was there a differential between margins exiting the quarter in June versus the first couple of months? And then related to that, I'm assuming you're under the belief and impression that monthly GGRs can continue to grow sequentially. I would imagine in the summer months that would follow typical sequential seasonal trends, and margins from here probably have more upsides than downsides from 2Q levels. So my question is specifically this going forward, how do you think about the flow-through on incremental revenue growth from here? And then I have a follow-up.\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. Joe, I'll start and then turn over to Grant for the margin discussion. Obviously, we do believe that the market is starting to get stronger, and you saw that in our numbers. Our June results were the strongest, almost $200 million of EBITDA in June alone, so we had acceleration in the quarter. Our numbers, I think, speak for themselves, they speak loudly. Six months ago we were virtually closed, and in the month of June, again, we do $200 million EBITDA. And visitation increases in the town. I think the visitation issue is going to drive obviously the GGR escalation. I just do believe we will be the beneficiary because of our scale and $15 billion of investment will pay off quite well. We have adequate room to run because we have capacity in every segment of the gaming and nongaming. We have, I think, a very strong advantage in that regard. So, again, we think as the GGRs escalate from more visitation, we will be a major beneficiary. As to margin, Grant, I hope you're awake in Macao. Please answer that.\nGrant Chum: Thanks, Rob. Yeah, Joe, margin obviously has continued to improve as we grow the revenues on optimal cost structure. Normalized margins up about 240 basis points quarter-on-quarter. And I think that will continue to rise as revenues continue to recover. We do have a more profitable business mix than 2019, as does the whole industry because we have a greater proportion of mass relative to VIP. But recall, relative to the industry, we always had a much greater proportion of our GGR in mass. So 87% of our GGR this quarter is in mass versus 71% in Q2 of 2019. And also the shift between gaming and nongaming, and recall, we're the dominant revenue generator in nongaming in the industry, and nongaming is rising as a percentage of our revenues going from 17% in 2019 to 22% this quarter, so both of these mix shifts are positive for margin. We are, obviously, reinvesting our revenues back into the business to increase our capability to handle more visitors, chiefly increasing our headcount to service more hotel rooms. That's for sure one of the things that we've achieved this quarter where our room operating capacity was back to 10,700 rooms on average for the quarter. And as we go into the summer, as we discussed last time, we're heading back to 12,000 rooms in terms of our operable hotel room capacity, so that entire labor shortage issue has dissipated as an impediment. And then in terms of intra-quarter, margins are related to the revenue recovery rate, and June was the standout month for sure for us. We recovered for the second quarter as a whole, as you can see, 85% of 2019 levels in terms of mass revenues for the second quarter. But in June, our mass revenue were about 97%, almost at full recovery to June 2019. So the acceleration in June was really very broad-based. We saw underlying visitation recovery obviously, Macao visitation recovering to almost 70% of 2019. And all of our key volume metrics were up significantly against April and May, so our non-rolling drop increased 15% against April-May. In June, slot handle was up 9% and rolling volume was up 10%, so across the board we saw a very sharp acceleration in June.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: But also reference page 14 of the deck, I think the structure to look at what's happening in the provinces beyond Guangdong and non-Guangdong visitation and lack of penetration. It's just early days, this recovery. And I think if you look at '14, it gives you a really good snapshot of what we believe is the beginning of a strong recovery. Hopefully, this summer will evidence more and more return to pre-pandemic numbers in the non-Guangdong visitation. And that's going to fuel this business. As you know, we have the capacity, gaming, non-gaming to participate across the board. And that's what we believe will happen, that will impact margins, but also in our mind, that's an inevitable factor in Macao, six months into this recovery, and we're still way behind in terms of visitation.\nJoe Greff: Great. My follow-up question is, we've seen within Mainland China more mixed macroeconomic performance year-to-date. And yet at the same time in Macao, gross gaming revenues, visitation, retail sales, pretty much most metrics have steadily improved. How do you reconcile the disconnect between China macro and the fundamentals on the ground in Macao? And how do you see that relationship playing out going forward?\nRob Goldstein: So obviously, we prefer a strong macro economy in China. We're hoping for that in the future, but we can perform and will perform even if the recovery is slower than our business. We'd like to see it come back quickly. But as you see in other businesses, so that will be matures numbers, you see other retail members. The retail market, our business doesn't require -- everyone's been making a strong economic recovery because certain segments can make it happen. But again, we're hoping for a strong rebound and a stronger macro that would impact us positively. I still believe this market will continue to grow in spite of a slower recovery than we like in that region.\nJoe Greff: Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live.\nArpine Kocharian: Hi. Thank you. This is actually Arpine for Robin. I was wondering if you could talk about average spend for mass customer and where you expect that to sort of normalize, thinking about the fact that a portion of higher spender in VIP obviously ends up in mass, but also that as you open up more hotel room capacity, that ramps up probably higher percentage of grind mass returns to Macao. How do you think about that more normalized spend per mass customer, looking forward into the back half?\nRob Goldstein: Grant?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think you can see from the results that premium mass recovered still faster than the base mass. But sequentially, base mass still grew strongly on the back of improving visitation. And as you alluded to, I think as room inventory increases, we're able to cater to more visitors. I would say the spend per head directionally continues to be very strong across both premium mass and base mass. So whilst, obviously, as the base mass picks up, you'll see more of a mix shift, I think, over time. But within each of the segments, spend per head is actually rising. So we are getting high-quality, high-value tourists into Macao at this point. And also, we're broadening this to high-value foreign tourism as well. So we can see strong results this quarter again in terms of the high-end foreigners. So I would say at this stage, the higher-valued segments are growing, recovering still at a faster rate. Base mass is picking up as visitation grows and hotel capacity increases. But within each of the segments, i.e., both premium mass and base mass, the spending is actually continues to be very high, and indeed, spend per visitor is heading in a positive direction.\nArpine Kocharian: Great. Thank you, Grant. And just one quick follow-up. With your dividend restated here, I was wondering if you could update us on your overall kind of capital return strategy and how you think about buybacks. Thank you.\nPatrick Dumont: Hi. How are you? So I think when we view the business in terms of capital allocation, we feel like we have a lot of good opportunities really for big growth, both Macao and Singapore. And that investment will continue to drive our expansion of non-gaming amenities and drive our cash flow. But we also think that we're going to be able to return a lot of capital in the future. We were a very shareholder-friendly company in the past. We're very focused on return on capital. But I think when you look at our prior program and what we're looking to do going forward, I think we'll probably look to have more of a balance between share repurchase and dividends. I think when we talk about the dividend size, it was something that -- there's plenty of room for investments in the future. It allows us to grow over time, which is our focus to really grow our asset base and grow our cash flow capacity. But it also allows for future share repurchases, which is something we're motivated to do. I think the dividend size today gives us flexibility with our capital allocation. And really, over time, we intend to shrink the share count. I think having a balanced capital return program is very important for us. We talked about it with the Board. I think management is very focused on it. We'll probably look to be more programmatic about share repurchase than we have been in the past. And I think really this gives us the flexibility to repurchase more shares over time and to really address our capital expenditure needs. So I think what we're going to try to do is allocate capital to growth, which we think we have a lot of opportunities that are unique for our company. Focus on the dividend as it corresponds to our program as we always have, but allow ourselves to have more balance, more flexibility in the future to do more programmatic share repurchases and really shrink that share count.\nArpine Kocharian: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is live.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, everybody. Thanks. Robert or maybe one of the guys in Macao, I was wondering, as kind of the market has shifted and you've seen a couple of quarters that at least look more normalized, as operators who may have been more VIP-focused in the past or certainly more mix towards VIP relative to you guys, have you seen any change in behavior as it pertains to kind of mass reinvestment levels across the market wide?\nRob Goldstein: Yes. Grant, why don't you take that?\nGrant Chum: Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think on the whole, we see a very stable competitive environment. I think all of the operators, the entire industry is continue to invest in non-gaming and diversification and bringing about, I think, a really stellar event programming into the market, which is helpful, I think, not just for growing the tourism economy, but also increasing the business volumes for all of the operators. So I think you're seeing the positive results from that investment in non-gaming and events programming, even in this past three months, not least in terms of our non-gaming programming that we put in place has been really driving business levels and visitation. In terms of reinvestments, yes, I think it's relatively similar to what we've seen in the recent quarters. Clearly, it's become -- continues to be actually, always been a very competitive market in premium mass and will continue to be. But I think there's very rational behavior amongst the operators in the industry in general, led by the larger players. But as I said, the focus of the industry has been to reinvest in the non-gaming programming, and that's been a tremendous driver to the recovery so far.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you for that. And then if I could, as a follow-up, just in terms of the expansion at Marina Bay Sands, I know you guys were going through some stuff and reviewing some budget needs and design plans and everything else. Is there anything you guys could share at this point in time with how we should be thinking about that time line, spend, et cetera?\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. First off, we're -- we have very strong feelings about the future success of Singapore. If you look at the results from the quarter, look at the visitation that we have, the type of customer we have coming through the building and the fact that China has not fully recovered, and if you look at sort of the nature of where Singapore sits today in the confluence of events in terms of the growing economies in Southeast Asia, we have a very strong view that the future of Singapore is positive. And so we're very motivated to make an investment there and expand our capacity at Marina Bay Sands. Right now, we're in discussions with the government about what the final form of our project will look like. There's obviously been a lot of change to the market in terms of market potential, the government's goals around high-value tourism, and to be fair, the way we want to grow into that market. And so there's some adjustments that we're making. And hopefully, we'll have a better sense of what that will look like in the upcoming quarters. But right now, we're in discussions and hope we have a chance to continue with the final version of our project in the short-term. We're looking forward to getting started.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you, Patrick. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, thanks. As a follow-up on Macao, the $200 million number you mentioned in June, is that a clean number that you would think of to build off of, given normal seasonality? Or should we see that build as base mass continues to recover?\nRob Goldstein: What was the second portion, the last part, last thing you said. Recover?\nStephen Grambling: I guess it's a question of as base mass continues to recover, how should it impact that $200 million number?\nRob Goldstein: It should go up. I think that -- the reason we called that out is because obviously, a strong month, especially in light of the seasonality of June not being a great one. But look, our position is simple. We think Macao will just continue to get stronger. And the recoveries will be predicated on visitation in all segments. And again, our advantage is very structural and very different offers. We have capacity to grow, base mass, premium mass, ropes, retail, everything you think of these customers want, we have the product to service that, that does the business of our competitor. So I think June is the beginning, and hopefully the summer will be evidence of that. We'll see how July, August, September holds up. But our story is pretty simple, more visitation, especially more base mass, more penetration into China will yield bigger GGR and we'll be a huge recipient of that. And I think that's just what we believe in partly. I guess I take comfort in fact, again, six months ago, we weren't sure we'd open. We had basically a closed business in December '22. Here we are in summer of '23, looking at a $2.4 billion run rate. Just based on June, we believe that could accelerate. So we were firm believers in Macao. Always have been. We never vastly in our belief that that market is just special. And the recovery in China is slower, in general, for all segments and probably, but it's coming on now and the summer will be a great indicator how fast to get back to $26 billion, $30 billion, $32 billion. I don't know what the peak is, but just the acceleration will be evidenced this summer. And again, we are in just very, very good position on having target assets to put to work in Macao. Plenty of rooms, the rooms are all open. The retail is open and functioning, slots and tables. So as the market grows, we should be a pretty big beneficiary from that new demand is coming.\nStephen Grambling: And so just to be clear, you don't -- do you think that there was any kind of one-time benefits in June, whether it's Jackie Chung or other things that could have been driving that? And so that may have been an outsized number? Or is that -- you're saying that is a clean number to build off of?\nPatrick Dumont: So I think the key thing to note is that we've had these non-gaming what we call lifestyle programs, which includes entertainment and other activations for years. And they're very successful pre-pandemic because we were able to connect with their customers and bring in very high value tourists in those high frequent. And so we've started those programs again. And so the concept you just referred to is very popular. And I could let Grant comment on that or Wilfred comment on it. But I think the key thing for this is our non-gaming programs are working. That the investment in non-gaming, that the activations, that the driving customer visitation through social media is working. And so the visitation of high-value customers flows through with our results in that month. I think the interesting thing is, air traffic to Macao and to Hong Kong is like around 50% of where it was pre-pandemic. So our story is one of visitation. It was led by higher value customers on premium mass. But now as people can begin the trial of the Macao more easily and more frequently, they're starting to return. They're starting to consume all of our different amenities, not only the hotels, but the concerts, the food and beverage, the retail, all of it's working. And so we'd like to believe we can grow from that number materially as our base mass non rate of play returns as more premium mass customers show up. And as Grant said earlier in the call, more of our hotel rooms come online. So we think we've invested to the pandemic and very high-quality products. The customer response has been very strong. And we're little priced through it. So we'd like to believe that there is margin room there. We'd like to believe that as we activate our non-gaming activities that will draw more customers to concerts and other events, and then that will continue to grow overall the desirability and visitation of Macao. Grant, do you have anything to add?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Yes, I mean, as you rightly say, we've had a very long track record going back 16 years in terms of posting world-class entertainment events at The Venetian Cotai Arena. And this was always part of our lifestyle programming. Jackie has been terrifically successful in the past with us as well. He played in both 2017 and 2018 in the summers of those years. I think what makes this June special is, firstly, he played a record-breaking 12 shows across four weekends. I don't think that's ever been done before in Macao. But not only that, Macao was the first touring stop of the entire global tour that Jackie Chung has just launched. So that he chose to launch this new global tour at The Venetian Macao, I think, is testament to both Macao's rising destination appeal, the importance of it as an entertainment hub regionally, as well as our own track record in partnering with Jackie and his team over many years. So the month was strong, not just the days when the concert was on, which is nine months of the month. So it's a combination of factors. I think the underlying visitation to Macao, like Patrick referenced, was improving throughout the quarter and into June, even though it was into a traditionally weaker part of the travel calendar. Hotel availability improved, transportation improved, concert series undoubtedly played a part, but that's just one component of the ongoing lifestyle program. And I think that programming is not just done by us, but the whole industry. And I think that will make Macao continue to recover rapidly. And it speaks volumes to, I think, the new direction that the government is pursuing and I think is a great start to the new concession.\nStephen Grambling: It makes senses. Thanks so much. I'll leave the floor.\nGrant Chum: Thanks, Stephen.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is life.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. So maybe I just want to go back to the cost side a little bit. It's probably for Grant. But if I caught it correctly, I think in an earlier question, you said room complement was up to 10,700 on average in the quarter, heading to 12,000. Can you just give us a little bit more color on that? Are we at the 12,000, we exit the quarter there? And just what does that imply for kind of necessary either headcount or kind of cost ramp-up from here? Is there a little bit more remaining? Or actually, is this number that we saw in the quarter pretty reflective of kind of what you think the baseline operating cost should look like from here moving forward?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thanks, Shaun. Yes, I think you heard it right, averaged around 10,700 rooms a day in terms of our operable capacity from a labor standpoint during the quarter. We actually increased further towards the end of the quarter. So as we go into third quarter, we're roughly at that 12,000 rooms mark, which I said, plus or minus, typically, there's always a handful of rooms out of order for maintenance, regular maintenance. We're effectively back in full inventory now and ready for the peak summer season, which is getting underway later this month.\nShaun Kelley: Great. Thanks for that. Maybe a similar question, but kind of transferring over to Marina Bay Sands. There, we've seen kind of two quarters in a row with margins kind of in the 46 to 47 camp. That's still a couple of hundred basis points below pre-COVID. And I know there's a lot going on there. I do believe in the slide deck, you guys called out that the -- some of the renovation activity was either over or close to. So maybe just an update on some of that renovation disruption and how we sort of exited the quarter there. And just your thoughts on costs, which I think were up about 10% Q-on-Q. Is there anything -- any -- is there -- as the full complement of rooms comes back, can we also see some margin leverage or improvement sequentially or going forward? And how should we think about that in the second half?\nPatrick Dumont: So I think what's important to note about Marina Bay Sands, as Robert said in his remarks earlier, the building is under a lot of change. It's changed for the better. We're investing a lot and we're creating what is arguably the best product we ever had. And the customer response is very strong, but we're mid-flight in that. And so I think -- a couple of things to consider. Our biggest suites, so our 200 multi-day suites are the last to come online. So that's what's going to come in this quarter and the next quarter. So the full earnings potential of the renovated Tower 1 and Tower 2 will not really be reached until those suites are online. So we've been operating without them. So we'll be able to price better. We'll have higher margin and we'll have like a larger quantum of cash flow from this high-value segment coming into the building because they didn't have any place to stay. And now we're adding 200 suites of the highest quality we've ever had. So that's going to be meaningful, and that will address, let's call it, some of the operating leverage we want to get out of our cost base. We had a significant number of rooms out of inventory. And so I think between some of the cost increases that we've seen in the market for inputs -- and to be fair, the gaming tax increase, there are some things we need to overcome through higher-value customers, through pricing and through volumes. And I think the one thing that's important to note, aside from the fact that we haven't had our most important room inventory available to us, our casino floor has also been in renovation, that's coming to a close. But most importantly, airlift from China is really back yet. And so when you look at play across the quarter from rated play from China, it's increased each month across the quarter. And so as China visitation comes back into the fold and our new multi-day suites come online, we will have an opportunity to price through some of the cost increases and improve margin.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you, Patrick. Thanks everyone.\nRob Goldstein: I just want to say, I think we're going to the labor side more escalate because in every business, be it hospitality or retail, when you've got an exemplary product people want, you've got pricing power. And I think we're finished over there. It's taking a long time. It's a slog, but we get through this thing, the room product offer, the F&B, the retail, rethinking of retail. You see this all over the map in terms of why is Hermes and now Louis Vuitton get these ridiculously high-priced side margins. We want the product. They offer a superior product. Same thing happens in the watch world, same thing happens in the hospitality world. I think we're building something that people don't understand how good it is until you see it, understand it. It's going to be really special, and we'll be able to get pricing in every level, be it rooms, casino gaming, retail. When this building is done -- I'm amazed we're doing these kind of numbers with ripped-up buildings -- when this building is done, our pricing power is going to go to another level. I think that's where MBS takes some different here. The margin have always taken care of itself as long as you have the product people want and will pay for it. And I do believe when you guys have a chance to get over there and see MBS and experience what we're doing, you'll appreciate these comments. It's going to be a pricing power issue. We're not going to cut costs, we're adding cost to add more labor. We're going to have a really good product we want people want to be at. But that enables you to charge prices that are high. And I think that's our strategy, is not to, we're going to earn our way to success by offering a great product and people will pay up for it. It's just that simple. And margin reflects that in the daytime.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live.\nDavid Katz: Afternoon, everyone. Thanks. I know you've touched on this from a number of different perspectives, but I'd love just a little more help or insight in terms of how margins should evolve, specifically for the Macao enterprise in total. And just looking back at where normal was in 2019 and what a new normal could look like now. How high the ceiling is, any qualitative perspectives around there and how we get there in the next several quarters would be helpful? Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: I want to get Grant take that question. But I do want to say, David, again, I think I'll use the words structural advantage. I think we're just a very different position than some people in that we were built for this market in terms of scale and size in every area of our business. Base mass, premium mass, we're still handicapped by the base mass hasn't fully recovered. But I think our reinvestment in the last 20 years is to make this product grow and grow relative to margin and demand. I think we're just built for this environment. So I'm highly confident margins will rise with our increased revenue. Grant, can you add some color?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thanks for the question. And again, we don't have a specific forecast on how high the margins will rise to. I think you can look at the structure of the business. I mean, as Rob says, I mean, we have an excellent structure in terms of our business mix. We have an efficient cost structure. And I think the way you will be looking at this is how high will revenues go. But it is true that the segments that are going to drive more revenue recovery and then eventually growing structurally will be the higher-margin segments within gaming, mass versus VIP, and then also non-gaming versus gaming. I think non-gaming is recovering even more strongly than gaming. We're at 93% of our 2019 non-gaming revenues. Our hotel revenues for the quarter are 8% higher than 2019 on fewer rooms being available. Our retail business is looking very strong. Tenant sales were up 28% this quarter and that will continue especially with full seats. That's ongoing.\nDavid Katz: Thank you. And as my follow-up, with respect to share repurchases, Patrick, which you touched on earlier, obviously not asking for specifics around when and where and how much. But any color on sort of boundaries or accomplishments or how we might think qualitatively as to when we get there and when we can start to think about that in a more tangible way?\nPatrick Dumont: So I think we just restarted our return of capital program this quarter. I think it shows the Board and management's confidence in the long-term performance of the business. And we'll look to grow that dividend over time in a way that also allows us to have repurchase program. I can't give you a specific side about the volume of repurchases for the time of it today because we still have a lot of things to plan for. But in our capital allocation thought process, we're going to think about it in the way that was described previously. I think what's also important to note is that we're going to have variability in our CapEx. We have a lot of large projects that we're considering. Some of them are more certain than others. We're very excited about Marina Bay Sands expansion. We think it's going to be an unbelievable asset. We're very excited about it. The timing may be a little delayed from where we are today. And now we're going to invest as much as we possibly can because we think the growth there will be extraordinary. But we have other options, other things we're looking at. And the timing of that potential outflow is unknown or if it's going to happen. The good news is, we'll have the ability to modulate our CapEx based on how we grow the business and use excess capital and return it to shareholders through share repurchases and hopefully in a programmatic way. So I can't give you an exact amount today, I will tell you [Indiscernible] is to look at our -- what's called, CapEx for growth, CapEx for the future. Our way to grow the business. Look at the dividend program and ensure that it grows in an appropriate manner. And then look at our return of capital program through share repurchases that are shareholder friendly. And I think that's how we'll look at it. But as where we are right now, I can't give you a side yet, but we'll continue to look at it in the upcoming quarters, and we'll talk about it.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks very much. Good-luck.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt, your line is live.\nBrandt Montour: Hey, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. So on the VIP business, which grew nicely for you guys in the quarter, but wasn't as strong as the overall market. Could you just update us how important is this segment to you when you plan the next couple of years? And then can you just touch on the current dynamics of the VIP market overall away from you and how your strategy compares to the broader market?\nRob Goldstein: I'm sure this is the first point, you said we didn't do as well as the market in the VIP?\nBrandt Montour: VIP quarter-over-quarter grew below market-wide VIP.\nRob Goldstein: I think we're very comfortable, we're going to the VIP and the base mass. I think our portfolio is so well rounded. The Venetian is still the king of Macao. It's going to be the first place that the $1 billion plus dollars earned EBITDA-wise. And it shows no signs -- buck the recovery to its previous position. We built a portfolio that is very well grounded. The Four Seasons enables us to meet very well to anybody to run product there, and the game products are pretty much unparalleled. Again, the Londoner, early stages, we're halfway done with the renovation. The full renovation is still a while down the road. But except for The Sands, which I think we give up on the potential, a lot of growth being down here in the peninsula, it's still a very difficult, challenging place to make a lot more money. The shift has been to Cotai, which, of course, all our assets other than The Sands are there. We remain convinced there's more room to grow in the region. But I think our position on the VIP and the base mass is as good as it gets. We've got more suites than anybody else, more share than anybody else. And I think more potential growth because of the pure mass size of our buildings. And again, we referenced lifestyle. We built a business there with Jackie this month or somebody else next month, whether it's the best retail, the best restaurants. We built the lifestyle approach, I think, puts us at the top of the heap in that area, both as a product offerings, but also quality of product. Very comfortable going and have no reason why we can't grow and keep growing both in base and premium. I think the idea we're not a premium mass player is unfair and unjustified by numbers, Grant?\nGrant Chum: Yes. I think on the VIP, our strategy hasn't changed. And in fact, obviously, the way the market has evolved in Macao for VIP, it fits our strategy more than ever because we're focused on the -- we've always focused on the premium direct segment out of the VIP. And we've historically had a very strong sales network around the rest of Asia. So we're working very hard, bringing foreign top-tier players into Macao, and we're having I would say, initially great success in doing so. Our foreign rolling volumes are already back to 2019 levels in the second quarter. Obviously far ahead of the general tourism recovery from overseas markets for Macao. So I think -- I think it's anchored around premium direct, our very strong sales network around Asia and our continued effort -- intensifying the effort to bring more foreign top-tier patrons to Macao. As Rob said, it's a great destination for all of those markets, and we intend to make full use of our great product and destination to attract those foreigners.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Thanks for that. And just a follow-up on CapEx. I'm trying to reconcile slide 23, this really helpful year-by-year build you guys do for us with last quarter. It looks like MBS expansion, I guess, was temporarily taken off. You guys commented on that already. You added Londoner Phase 2. Wanted make sure that that's new and hear any maybe thoughts about targets -- return targets for that project. And then lastly, I think there were some reports from you guys or came from you guys through the media mid-quarter about a new hotel tower at The Venetian. And if that's a true or a plan, I'm just curious if that's going to be included in the $3.5 billion CapEx commitment that you've agreed with the government on.\nPatrick Dumont: So just a few points. We did take Singapore expansion off because until we finalize the program and have final approval from the government, we don't know exactly what it will cost. So we're going to hold off on that until we have a project decided upon. In terms of The Londoner under Phase II -- I think the great thing about The Londonder is when we first started, we actually did it pre-concession during the pandemic, and we built through the pandemic and into the concession renewal and came out of the other side. And the thesis was validated. It's incredibly well received by the market. It looks spectacular. Customer response has been very strong. And we're excited about the result, and that market validation was very important. And now we're going to roll into the second part of the building and really hopefully tap into the absolute earning power of that, let's call it, really well laid out, really thought through hotel offering and amenity offering. And so in our long-term view, that's something that we'll open one day, come close to the Mid-East in terms of its productivity. The potential is there. Very excited about that opportunity. In terms of return targets, I think it's not something that we talk about directly, but in our mind, there's a lot of potential growth in our deepest and most profitable segments, which is mass and premium mass. And so with the revised or renovated hotel suite -- hotel rooms and suites that we'll have there, we think we'll be able to address the market incredibly well, just like we did with the first phase of The Londonder. So I think that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And in terms of a new hotel tower, I don't think we can comment on rumors. I don't think that's something we're familiar with. I think for us, we're really focused on really delivering against our concession renewal requirements, investing in the non-gaming amenities that really help define our portfolio in Macao and really drive visitation. So Grant, do you have any other comments you'd like to add?\nGrant Chum: Patrick, you covered it very well. I think The Londoner's success, we've had the wholesale reinvention of the property's positioning and the branding and the functionality. And actually, it's easy to forget that most of the hotel room accommodation today still remains the original Sands Cotai Central rooms, as is half of our main gaming floors. So Phase 2 is really about making Londoner more Londoner. We need to reposition and upgrade Sheraton and the Conrad hotels as well as a comprehensive upgrade of the Pacifica Casino on the Sheraton side. And we'll be adding more non-gaming amenities and attractions to The Londoner, many of which are also included in our concession commitments. More signature restaurants that have international appeal, state-of-the-art wellness center, other sort of lifestyle attractions. And then beyond that, over a longer time frame, we\u2019ve always committed since the concession, retender to developing this new landmark garden-themed attraction, the conservatory located -- to be located in the gardens south of The Londoner resort. That will take a longer time frame to develop. But first off, we're able to get right down to work on Londoner Phase 2, on the hotels and the casino refresh because we've been working on this during the pandemic on the designs. So we're now -- as Patrick said, I mean we've seen it, the product that we have come out with being hugely validated and with the market recovery with return of visitation and the hotel guests. We're keen to get moving on to this Phase II, and that's why we're able to start the actual construction in the second half of this year.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Thanks all.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve, your line is live.\nSteven Wieczynski: Hey. So Rob or whoever wants to take this -- and Patrick, you touched on this a little bit, so this might be you. But Slide 14, I think, is pretty interesting. Around visitation trends during the quarter, with Hong Kong back to actually above pre-COVID levels, Guangdong pretty much back. The rest of China, though, remains well below pre-COVID levels. So wondering how you guys are thinking about the recovery in that segment moving forward? And what you're watching. And I know, Patrick, you talked about air capacity. Is it really just air capacity? Or are there other factors out there that -- but might be holding that segment back?\nPatrick Dumont: I think one thing I do want to say is we're really excited about it. Seeing the visitation come back has been thrilling. Customer responses, seeing -- seeing patrons from before, see new patrons. It's really a fantastic place. We were in Macao recently, and it just -- there's great energy, great electricity in the city. So I think some of it is air capacity. To be fair, some of it's the, let's call it, the more mass player, the unrated play that The Venetian and other of our assets were so strongly set up for that really drove a lot of high volume and high margin business. All those segments still haven't come back and forth. So between the airlift -- and if you turn to the next page, actually, page 15, where it shows the visitation for 2019, and then compared to this last quarter, you can kind of see that we have a lot of room to go. We have a lot of patrons who will want to come back and see us. And they're just starting now to make their trips happen. So I think from where we sit, we have a great ability to accommodate these customers than we've done in the past. We have the capacity. We have very interesting non-gaming amenities, we have entertainment. And we think this is the most important tourism market in Asia and the region and people are going to show up. We also have international visitors showing up, which is kind of a new thing. So I think the power of Macao is going to continue to grow and grow. But when I look at slide 15, I just see a lot of potential, and our team is working hard to try to capture that potential. Grant, I want to turn it over to you and see if you have additional remarks.\nGrant Chum: Yes. I was going to point to that page as well. Patrick. Yes, Dan's famous Page 15 on the penetration. Actually, you can see from the Eastern China, Yanxi River Delta region, especially Shanghai and Zhejiang Province. In fact, the recovery rate is higher than Guangdong's because I think you have better airlift, better propensity to travel cross-border from those source markets. And we've already seen a very big upward shift in the recovery rate of non-Guangdong, relative to first quarter. So I think in the first quarter, when we're looking at that recovery rate, it was less than 30%, and now we're approaching 50%. So non-Guangdong visitation second quarter grew almost, I think, in the high 40s sequentially. So it is coming back, as we said, as airlift improves, transportation in general improves, and also our hotel room availability has been increasing. And actually, we'll be further increasing for Macao as a whole in the third quarter. We have some new hotel rooms coming online. So all of that, I think, is positive for the outlook for continued recovery in the visitation outside of Guangdong Province.\nRob Goldstein: Maybe I'd just add, the trajectory may be uncertain, but the end result is very certain. I mean this market always comes back, and I think it walks the summer, you'll see some very positive indications. I don't think anybody knows when or exactly why it's not fully recovering in certain areas, but we just know it's going to recover. It's a question of when that happens. The result, I think, is on the question. And again, I hope this summer, we showed some strong evidence. And July, hopefully, will show a big number, the best number of the year thus far and that starts to add in this recovery.\nSteven Wieczynski: Okay. Great. I'll leave it there, guys. I appreciate the color. Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And a final question today is coming from Daniel Politzer from Wells Fargo. Daniel, your line is live.\nDaniel Politzer: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick follow-up, Rob, on that comment about July. I mean, is there any reason other than just the airlift capacity that we wouldn't expect that normal seasonality and the build off the momentum that you saw in June, whether it's macro concerns, behavioral or entertainment calendar? Is it really just simply airlift? Or there are other reasons in particular?\nRob Goldstein: No, there's multiple variables at work here. And I wouldn't want pigeonhole, the economy, Visa, I don't think we really know the answer to that. It's an aggregate answer, it can't be unpacked really. I do think though, seasonality, summer has always been the time. This is the first time, post-COVID. I, for one, believe summer has improved very strong. Some business people boasting about what the joint numbers look like. I hope they're right. I believe some will be very indicative of new growth in this market. And look, again, I think you have to look back on how quickly we see this recovery. Six months ago, we were in dire straits. And now we're unpacking $200 million a month in June. So we're very bullish when we think long-term. And again, the trajectory may be uncertain but the end result's very clear. We're going to get there. We're going to make a lot of money in Macao, definitely. And we hope we have more good news in the near future to offer to you. So I'm hoping for a big summer for the market.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it. And just 1 more quick one. We haven't touched on the digital strategy. And there's been some headlines lately that there's been some progress there. Do you have anything that you could possibly share? And as you just -- in high level, as you think about the strategy, how do you reconcile that with regulatory concerns, given your presence in Macao and your relationship with the government there?\nPatrick Dumont: So I think we said a while ago that we were going to invest in ground up digital activities. So we're -- we're not buyers, we're builders. And I think for a while, we've been working on a couple of digital initiatives. And I think the key thing for us is, it's still early days yet. We don't really have much to talk about. We're very confident about it. We think long-term, there's real potential there. But our focus is going to be on highly regulated markets. So that would mean Europe and North America. Our goal is to make sure that we maintain our regulatory standards in the best possible way, only working with partners where that makes sense and being very selective. But in our mind, we're very focused on regulatory certainty and being in strong [Technical difficulty] I'm going to put this on hold. Sorry about that. So I think our view is that the digital issues have potential. We're going to continue to invest in them for the long-term. We are committed for the long-term. And I think our goal is going to be to focus on highly regulated markets.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you, everybody.\nPatrick Dumont: Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "Hi. How are you? So I think when we view the business in terms of capital allocation, we feel like we have a lot of good opportunities really for big growth, both Macao and Singapore. And that investment will continue to drive our expansion of non-gaming amenities and drive our cash flow. But we also think that we're going to be able to return a lot of capital in the future. We were a very shareholder-friendly company in the past. We're very focused on return on capital. But I think when you look at our prior program and what we're looking to do going forward, I think we'll probably look to have more of a balance between share repurchase and dividends. I think when we talk about the dividend size, it was something that -- there's plenty of room for investments in the future. It allows us to grow over time, which is our focus to really grow our asset base and grow our cash flow capacity. But it also allows for future share repurchases, which is something we're motivated to do. I think the dividend size today gives us flexibility with our capital allocation. And really, over time, we intend to shrink the share count. I think having a balanced capital return program is very important for us. We talked about it with the Board. I think management is very focused on it. We'll probably look to be more programmatic about share repurchase than we have been in the past. And I think really this gives us the flexibility to repurchase more shares over time and to really address our capital expenditure needs. So I think what we're going to try to do is allocate capital to growth, which we think we have a lot of opportunities that are unique for our company. Focus on the dividend as it corresponds to our program as we always have, but allow ourselves to have more balance, more flexibility in the future to do more programmatic share repurchases and really shrink that share count. Sure. First off, we're -- we have very strong feelings about the future success of Singapore. If you look at the results from the quarter, look at the visitation that we have, the type of customer we have coming through the building and the fact that China has not fully recovered, and if you look at sort of the nature of where Singapore sits today in the confluence of events in terms of the growing economies in Southeast Asia, we have a very strong view that the future of Singapore is positive. And so we're very motivated to make an investment there and expand our capacity at Marina Bay Sands. Right now, we're in discussions with the government about what the final form of our project will look like. There's obviously been a lot of change to the market in terms of market potential, the government's goals around high-value tourism, and to be fair, the way we want to grow into that market. And so there's some adjustments that we're making. And hopefully, we'll have a better sense of what that will look like in the upcoming quarters. But right now, we're in discussions and hope we have a chance to continue with the final version of our project in the short-term. We're looking forward to getting started. So I think the key thing to note is that we've had these non-gaming what we call lifestyle programs, which includes entertainment and other activations for years. And they're very successful pre-pandemic because we were able to connect with their customers and bring in very high value tourists in those high frequent. And so we've started those programs again. And so the concept you just referred to is very popular. And I could let Grant comment on that or Wilfred comment on it. But I think the key thing for this is our non-gaming programs are working. That the investment in non-gaming, that the activations, that the driving customer visitation through social media is working. And so the visitation of high-value customers flows through with our results in that month. I think the interesting thing is, air traffic to Macao and to Hong Kong is like around 50% of where it was pre-pandemic. So our story is one of visitation. It was led by higher value customers on premium mass. But now as people can begin the trial of the Macao more easily and more frequently, they're starting to return. They're starting to consume all of our different amenities, not only the hotels, but the concerts, the food and beverage, the retail, all of it's working. And so we'd like to believe we can grow from that number materially as our base mass non rate of play returns as more premium mass customers show up. And as Grant said earlier in the call, more of our hotel rooms come online. So we think we've invested to the pandemic and very high-quality products. The customer response has been very strong. And we're little priced through it. So we'd like to believe that there is margin room there. We'd like to believe that as we activate our non-gaming activities that will draw more customers to concerts and other events, and then that will continue to grow overall the desirability and visitation of Macao. Grant, do you have anything to add? So I think what's important to note about Marina Bay Sands, as Robert said in his remarks earlier, the building is under a lot of change. It's changed for the better. We're investing a lot and we're creating what is arguably the best product we ever had. And the customer response is very strong, but we're mid-flight in that. And so I think -- a couple of things to consider. Our biggest suites, so our 200 multi-day suites are the last to come online. So that's what's going to come in this quarter and the next quarter. So the full earnings potential of the renovated Tower 1 and Tower 2 will not really be reached until those suites are online. So we've been operating without them. So we'll be able to price better. We'll have higher margin and we'll have like a larger quantum of cash flow from this high-value segment coming into the building because they didn't have any place to stay. And now we're adding 200 suites of the highest quality we've ever had. So that's going to be meaningful, and that will address, let's call it, some of the operating leverage we want to get out of our cost base. We had a significant number of rooms out of inventory. And so I think between some of the cost increases that we've seen in the market for inputs -- and to be fair, the gaming tax increase, there are some things we need to overcome through higher-value customers, through pricing and through volumes. And I think the one thing that's important to note, aside from the fact that we haven't had our most important room inventory available to us, our casino floor has also been in renovation, that's coming to a close. But most importantly, airlift from China is really back yet. And so when you look at play across the quarter from rated play from China, it's increased each month across the quarter. And so as China visitation comes back into the fold and our new multi-day suites come online, we will have an opportunity to price through some of the cost increases and improve margin. So I think we just restarted our return of capital program this quarter. I think it shows the Board and management's confidence in the long-term performance of the business. And we'll look to grow that dividend over time in a way that also allows us to have repurchase program. I can't give you a specific side about the volume of repurchases for the time of it today because we still have a lot of things to plan for. But in our capital allocation thought process, we're going to think about it in the way that was described previously. I think what's also important to note is that we're going to have variability in our CapEx. We have a lot of large projects that we're considering. Some of them are more certain than others. We're very excited about Marina Bay Sands expansion. We think it's going to be an unbelievable asset. We're very excited about it. The timing may be a little delayed from where we are today. And now we're going to invest as much as we possibly can because we think the growth there will be extraordinary. But we have other options, other things we're looking at. And the timing of that potential outflow is unknown or if it's going to happen. The good news is, we'll have the ability to modulate our CapEx based on how we grow the business and use excess capital and return it to shareholders through share repurchases and hopefully in a programmatic way. So I can't give you an exact amount today, I will tell you [Indiscernible] is to look at our -- what's called, CapEx for growth, CapEx for the future. Our way to grow the business. Look at the dividend program and ensure that it grows in an appropriate manner. And then look at our return of capital program through share repurchases that are shareholder friendly. And I think that's how we'll look at it. But as where we are right now, I can't give you a side yet, but we'll continue to look at it in the upcoming quarters, and we'll talk about it. So just a few points. We did take Singapore expansion off because until we finalize the program and have final approval from the government, we don't know exactly what it will cost. So we're going to hold off on that until we have a project decided upon. In terms of The Londoner under Phase II -- I think the great thing about The Londonder is when we first started, we actually did it pre-concession during the pandemic, and we built through the pandemic and into the concession renewal and came out of the other side. And the thesis was validated. It's incredibly well received by the market. It looks spectacular. Customer response has been very strong. And we're excited about the result, and that market validation was very important. And now we're going to roll into the second part of the building and really hopefully tap into the absolute earning power of that, let's call it, really well laid out, really thought through hotel offering and amenity offering. And so in our long-term view, that's something that we'll open one day, come close to the Mid-East in terms of its productivity. The potential is there. Very excited about that opportunity. In terms of return targets, I think it's not something that we talk about directly, but in our mind, there's a lot of potential growth in our deepest and most profitable segments, which is mass and premium mass. And so with the revised or renovated hotel suite -- hotel rooms and suites that we'll have there, we think we'll be able to address the market incredibly well, just like we did with the first phase of The Londonder. So I think that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And in terms of a new hotel tower, I don't think we can comment on rumors. I don't think that's something we're familiar with. I think for us, we're really focused on really delivering against our concession renewal requirements, investing in the non-gaming amenities that really help define our portfolio in Macao and really drive visitation. So Grant, do you have any other comments you'd like to add? I think one thing I do want to say is we're really excited about it. Seeing the visitation come back has been thrilling. Customer responses, seeing -- seeing patrons from before, see new patrons. It's really a fantastic place.

We have a lot of patrons who will want to come back and see us. And they're just starting now to make their trips happen.

But when I look at slide 15, I just see a lot of potential, and our team is working hard to try to capture that potential. Grant, I want to turn it over to you and see if you have additional remarks. So I think we said a while ago that we were going to invest in ground up digital activities. So we're -- we're not buyers, we're builders. And I think for a while, we've been working on a couple of digital initiatives. And I think the key thing for us is, it's still early days yet. We don't really have much to talk about.

            "name": "Rob Goldstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. The powerful recovery taking place in Macao and Singapore is evident in our results. We believe it's early days and there's still room to run in both those markets. We continue to invest in both markets for our future growth. We do have a structural advantage in Macao based on our scale. As the market accelerates, we will be a major beneficiary in the future. Singapore continues to do well despite two impediments. We're in the midst of $1 billion renovation, which does impact adversely the results in Singapore. In addition, we haven't seen a full return of the Chinese premium mass segment yet. This iconic building has a very bright future. Cash flow recovery is in full bloom. So it's very, very enjoyable to say, yay, dividends. Let's go to some Q&A. First question, please. Hi, Joe. Yeah. Joe, I'll start and then turn over to Grant for the margin discussion. Obviously, we do believe that the market is starting to get stronger, and you saw that in our numbers. Our June results were the strongest, almost $200 million of EBITDA in June alone, so we had acceleration in the quarter. Our numbers, I think, speak for themselves, they speak loudly. Six months ago we were virtually closed, and in the month of June, again, we do $200 million EBITDA. And visitation increases in the town. I think the visitation issue is going to drive obviously the GGR escalation. I just do believe we will be the beneficiary because of our scale and $15 billion of investment will pay off quite well. We have adequate room to run because we have capacity in every segment of the gaming and nongaming. We have, I think, a very strong advantage in that regard. So, again, we think as the GGRs escalate from more visitation, we will be a major beneficiary. As to margin, Grant, I hope you're awake in Macao. Please answer that. But also reference page 14 of the deck, I think the structure to look at what's happening in the provinces beyond Guangdong and non-Guangdong visitation and lack of penetration. It's just early days, this recovery. And I think if you look at '14, it gives you a really good snapshot of what we believe is the beginning of a strong recovery. Hopefully, this summer will evidence more and more return to pre-pandemic numbers in the non-Guangdong visitation. And that's going to fuel this business. As you know, we have the capacity, gaming, non-gaming to participate across the board. And that's what we believe will happen, that will impact margins, but also in our mind, that's an inevitable factor in Macao, six months into this recovery, and we're still way behind in terms of visitation. So obviously, we prefer a strong macro economy in China. We're hoping for that in the future, but we can perform and will perform even if the recovery is slower than our business. We'd like to see it come back quickly. But as you see in other businesses, so that will be matures numbers, you see other retail members. The retail market, our business doesn't require -- everyone's been making a strong economic recovery because certain segments can make it happen. But again, we're hoping for a strong rebound and a stronger macro that would impact us positively. I still believe this market will continue to grow in spite of a slower recovery than we like in that region. Thanks, Joe. Grant? Yes. Grant, why don't you take that? What was the second portion, the last part, last thing you said. Recover? It should go up. I think that -- the reason we called that out is because obviously, a strong month, especially in light of the seasonality of June not being a great one. But look, our position is simple. We think Macao will just continue to get stronger. And the recoveries will be predicated on visitation in all segments. And again, our advantage is very structural and very different offers. We have capacity to grow, base mass, premium mass, ropes, retail, everything you think of these customers want, we have the product to service that, that does the business of our competitor. So I think June is the beginning, and hopefully the summer will be evidence of that. We'll see how July, August, September holds up. But our story is pretty simple, more visitation, especially more base mass, more penetration into China will yield bigger GGR and we'll be a huge recipient of that. And I think that's just what we believe in partly. I guess I take comfort in fact, again, six months ago, we weren't sure we'd open. We had basically a closed business in December '22. Here we are in summer of '23, looking at a $2.4 billion run rate. Just based on June, we believe that could accelerate. So we were firm believers in Macao. Always have been. We never vastly in our belief that that market is just special. And the recovery in China is slower, in general, for all segments and probably, but it's coming on now and the summer will be a great indicator how fast to get back to $26 billion, $30 billion, $32 billion. I don't know what the peak is, but just the acceleration will be evidenced this summer. And again, we are in just very, very good position on having target assets to put to work in Macao. Plenty of rooms, the rooms are all open. The retail is open and functioning, slots and tables. So as the market grows, we should be a pretty big beneficiary from that new demand is coming. I just want to say, I think we're going to the labor side more escalate because in every business, be it hospitality or retail, when you've got an exemplary product people want, you've got pricing power. And I think we're finished over there. It's taking a long time. It's a slog, but we get through this thing, the room product offer, the F&B, the retail, rethinking of retail. You see this all over the map in terms of why is Hermes and now Louis Vuitton get these ridiculously high-priced side margins. We want the product. They offer a superior product. Same thing happens in the watch world, same thing happens in the hospitality world. I think we're building something that people don't understand how good it is until you see it, understand it. It's going to be really special, and we'll be able to get pricing in every level, be it rooms, casino gaming, retail. When this building is done -- I'm amazed we're doing these kind of numbers with ripped-up buildings -- when this building is done, our pricing power is going to go to another level. I think that's where MBS takes some different here. The margin have always taken care of itself as long as you have the product people want and will pay for it. And I do believe when you guys have a chance to get over there and see MBS and experience what we're doing, you'll appreciate these comments. It's going to be a pricing power issue. We're not going to cut costs, we're adding cost to add more labor. We're going to have a really good product we want people want to be at. But that enables you to charge prices that are high. And I think that's our strategy, is not to, we're going to earn our way to success by offering a great product and people will pay up for it. It's just that simple. And margin reflects that in the daytime. I want to get Grant take that question. But I do want to say, David, again, I think I'll use the words structural advantage. I think we're just a very different position than some people in that we were built for this market in terms of scale and size in every area of our business. Base mass, premium mass, we're still handicapped by the base mass hasn't fully recovered. But I think our reinvestment in the last 20 years is to make this product grow and grow relative to margin and demand. I think we're just built for this environment. So I'm highly confident margins will rise with our increased revenue. Grant, can you add some color? I'm sure this is the first point, you said we didn't do as well as the market in the VIP? I think we're very comfortable, we're going to the VIP and the base mass. I think our portfolio is so well rounded. The Venetian is still the king of Macao. It's going to be the first place that the $1 billion plus dollars earned EBITDA-wise. And it shows no signs -- buck the recovery to its previous position. We built a portfolio that is very well grounded. The Four Seasons enables us to meet very well to anybody to run product there, and the game products are pretty much unparalleled. Again, the Londoner, early stages, we're halfway done with the renovation. The full renovation is still a while down the road. But except for The Sands, which I think we give up on the potential, a lot of growth being down here in the peninsula, it's still a very difficult, challenging place to make a lot more money. The shift has been to Cotai, which, of course, all our assets other than The Sands are there. We remain convinced there's more room to grow in the region. But I think our position on the VIP and the base mass is as good as it gets. We've got more suites than anybody else, more share than anybody else. And I think more potential growth because of the pure mass size of our buildings. And again, we referenced lifestyle. We built a business there with Jackie this month or somebody else next month, whether it's the best retail, the best restaurants. We built the lifestyle approach, I think, puts us at the top of the heap in that area, both as a product offerings, but also quality of product. Very comfortable going and have no reason why we can't grow and keep growing both in base and premium. I think the idea we're not a premium mass player is unfair and unjustified by numbers, Grant? Maybe I'd just add, the trajectory may be uncertain, but the end result is very certain. I mean this market always comes back, and I think it walks the summer, you'll see some very positive indications. I don't think anybody knows when or exactly why it's not fully recovering in certain areas, but we just know it's going to recover. It's a question of when that happens. The result, I think, is on the question. And again, I hope this summer, we showed some strong evidence. And July, hopefully, will show a big number, the best number of the year thus far and that starts to add in this recovery. Thank you. No, there's multiple variables at work here. And I wouldn't want pigeonhole, the economy, Visa, I don't think we really know the answer to that. It's an aggregate answer, it can't be unpacked really. I do think though, seasonality, summer has always been the time. This is the first time, post-COVID. I, for one, believe summer has improved very strong. Some business people boasting about what the joint numbers look like. I hope they're right. I believe some will be very indicative of new growth in this market. And look, again, I think you have to look back on how quickly we see this recovery. Six months ago, we were in dire straits. And now we're unpacking $200 million a month in June. So we're very bullish when we think long-term. And again, the trajectory may be uncertain but the end result's very clear. We're going to get there. We're going to make a lot of money in Macao, definitely. And we hope we have more good news in the near future to offer to you. So I'm hoping for a big summer for the market. Thank you, everybody."

            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Yeah, Joe, margin obviously has continued to improve as we grow the revenues on optimal cost structure. Normalized margins up about 240 basis points quarter-on-quarter. And I think that will continue to rise as revenues continue to recover. We do have a more profitable business mix than 2019, as does the whole industry because we have a greater proportion of mass relative to VIP. But recall, relative to the industry, we always had a much greater proportion of our GGR in mass. So 87% of our GGR this quarter is in mass versus 71% in Q2 of 2019. And also the shift between gaming and nongaming, and recall, we're the dominant revenue generator in nongaming in the industry, and nongaming is rising as a percentage of our revenues going from 17% in 2019 to 22% this quarter, so both of these mix shifts are positive for margin. We are, obviously, reinvesting our revenues back into the business to increase our capability to handle more visitors, chiefly increasing our headcount to service more hotel rooms. That's for sure one of the things that we've achieved this quarter where our room operating capacity was back to 10,700 rooms on average for the quarter. And as we go into the summer, as we discussed last time, we're heading back to 12,000 rooms in terms of our operable hotel room capacity, so that entire labor shortage issue has dissipated as an impediment. And then in terms of intra-quarter, margins are related to the revenue recovery rate, and June was the standout month for sure for us. We recovered for the second quarter as a whole, as you can see, 85% of 2019 levels in terms of mass revenues for the second quarter. But in June, our mass revenue were about 97%, almost at full recovery to June 2019. So the acceleration in June was really very broad-based. We saw underlying visitation recovery obviously, Macao visitation recovering to almost 70% of 2019. And all of our key volume metrics were up significantly against April and May, so our non-rolling drop increased 15% against April-May. In June, slot handle was up 9% and rolling volume was up 10%, so across the board we saw a very sharp acceleration in June. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think you can see from the results that premium mass recovered still faster than the base mass. But sequentially, base mass still grew strongly on the back of improving visitation. And as you alluded to, I think as room inventory increases, we're able to cater to more visitors. I would say the spend per head directionally continues to be very strong across both premium mass and base mass. So whilst, obviously, as the base mass picks up, you'll see more of a mix shift, I think, over time. But within each of the segments, spend per head is actually rising. So we are getting high-quality, high-value tourists into Macao at this point. And also, we're broadening this to high-value foreign tourism as well. So we can see strong results this quarter again in terms of the high-end foreigners. So I would say at this stage, the higher-valued segments are growing, recovering still at a faster rate. Base mass is picking up as visitation grows and hotel capacity increases. But within each of the segments, i.e., both premium mass and base mass, the spending is actually continues to be very high, and indeed, spend per visitor is heading in a positive direction. Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think on the whole, we see a very stable competitive environment. I think all of the operators, the entire industry is continue to invest in non-gaming and diversification and bringing about, I think, a really stellar event programming into the market, which is helpful, I think, not just for growing the tourism economy, but also increasing the business volumes for all of the operators. So I think you're seeing the positive results from that investment in non-gaming and events programming, even in this past three months, not least in terms of our non-gaming programming that we put in place has been really driving business levels and visitation. In terms of reinvestments, yes, I think it's relatively similar to what we've seen in the recent quarters. Clearly, it's become -- continues to be actually, always been a very competitive market in premium mass and will continue to be. But I think there's very rational behavior amongst the operators in the industry in general, led by the larger players. But as I said, the focus of the industry has been to reinvest in the non-gaming programming, and that's been a tremendous driver to the recovery so far. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Yes, I mean, as you rightly say, we've had a very long track record going back 16 years in terms of posting world-class entertainment events at The Venetian Cotai Arena. And this was always part of our lifestyle programming. Jackie has been terrifically successful in the past with us as well. He played in both 2017 and 2018 in the summers of those years. I think what makes this June special is, firstly, he played a record-breaking 12 shows across four weekends. I don't think that's ever been done before in Macao. But not only that, Macao was the first touring stop of the entire global tour that Jackie Chung has just launched. So that he chose to launch this new global tour at The Venetian Macao, I think, is testament to both Macao's rising destination appeal, the importance of it as an entertainment hub regionally, as well as our own track record in partnering with Jackie and his team over many years. So the month was strong, not just the days when the concert was on, which is nine months of the month. So it's a combination of factors. I think the underlying visitation to Macao, like Patrick referenced, was improving throughout the quarter and into June, even though it was into a traditionally weaker part of the travel calendar. Hotel availability improved, transportation improved, concert series undoubtedly played a part, but that's just one component of the ongoing lifestyle program. And I think that programming is not just done by us, but the whole industry. And I think that will make Macao continue to recover rapidly. And it speaks volumes to, I think, the new direction that the government is pursuing and I think is a great start to the new concession. Thanks, Stephen. Yes. Thanks, Shaun. Yes, I think you heard it right, averaged around 10,700 rooms a day in terms of our operable capacity from a labor standpoint during the quarter. We actually increased further towards the end of the quarter. So as we go into third quarter, we're roughly at that 12,000 rooms mark, which I said, plus or minus, typically, there's always a handful of rooms out of order for maintenance, regular maintenance. We're effectively back in full inventory now and ready for the peak summer season, which is getting underway later this month. Yes. Thanks for the question. And again, we don't have a specific forecast on how high the margins will rise to. I think you can look at the structure of the business. I mean, as Rob says, I mean, we have an excellent structure in terms of our business mix. We have an efficient cost structure. And I think the way you will be looking at this is how high will revenues go. But it is true that the segments that are going to drive more revenue recovery and then eventually growing structurally will be the higher-margin segments within gaming, mass versus VIP, and then also non-gaming versus gaming. I think non-gaming is recovering even more strongly than gaming. We're at 93% of our 2019 non-gaming revenues. Our hotel revenues for the quarter are 8% higher than 2019 on fewer rooms being available. Our retail business is looking very strong. Tenant sales were up 28% this quarter and that will continue especially with full seats. That's ongoing. Yes. I think on the VIP, our strategy hasn't changed. And in fact, obviously, the way the market has evolved in Macao for VIP, it fits our strategy more than ever because we're focused on the -- we've always focused on the premium direct segment out of the VIP. And we've historically had a very strong sales network around the rest of Asia. So we're working very hard, bringing foreign top-tier players into Macao, and we're having I would say, initially great success in doing so. Our foreign rolling volumes are already back to 2019 levels in the second quarter. Obviously far ahead of the general tourism recovery from overseas markets for Macao. So I think -- I think it's anchored around premium direct, our very strong sales network around Asia and our continued effort -- intensifying the effort to bring more foreign top-tier patrons to Macao. As Rob said, it's a great destination for all of those markets, and we intend to make full use of our great product and destination to attract those foreigners. Patrick, you covered it very well. I think The Londoner's success, we've had the wholesale reinvention of the property's positioning and the branding and the functionality. And actually, it's easy to forget that most of the hotel room accommodation today still remains the original Sands Cotai Central rooms, as is half of our main gaming floors. So Phase 2 is really about making Londoner more Londoner. We need to reposition and upgrade Sheraton and the Conrad hotels as well as a comprehensive upgrade of the Pacifica Casino on the Sheraton side. And we'll be adding more non-gaming amenities and attractions to The Londoner, many of which are also included in our concession commitments. More signature restaurants that have international appeal, state-of-the-art wellness center, other sort of lifestyle attractions. And then beyond that, over a longer time frame, we've always committed since the concession, retender to developing this new landmark garden-themed attraction, the conservatory located -- to be located in the gardens south of The Londoner resort. That will take a longer time frame to develop. But first off, we're able to get right down to work on Londoner Phase 2, on the hotels and the casino refresh because we've been working on this during the pandemic on the designs. So we're now -- as Patrick said, I mean we've seen it, the product that we have come out with being hugely validated and with the market recovery with return of visitation and the hotel guests. We're keen to get moving on to this Phase II, and that's why we're able to start the actual construction in the second half of this year. Yes. I was going to point to that page as well. Patrick. Yes, Dan's famous Page 15 on the penetration. Actually, you can see from the Eastern China, Yanxi River Delta region, especially Shanghai and Zhejiang Province. In fact, the recovery rate is higher than Guangdong's because I think you have better airlift, better propensity to travel cross-border from those source markets. And we've already seen a very big upward shift in the recovery rate of non-Guangdong, relative to first quarter. So I think in the first quarter, when we're looking at that recovery rate, it was less than 30%, and now we're approaching 50%. So non-Guangdong visitation second quarter grew almost, I think, in the high 40s sequentially. So it is coming back, as we said, as airlift improves, transportation in general improves, and also our hotel room availability has been increasing. And actually, we'll be further increasing for Macao as a whole in the third quarter. We have some new hotel rooms coming online. So all of that, I think, is positive for the outlook for continued recovery in the visitation outside of Guangdong Province."

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, but we will open the floor for your questions and comments following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours.\nDaniel Briggs: Thanks, Paul. Thank you all for joining the call today. With me today are Rob Goldstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Patrick Dumont, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Dr. Wilfred Wong, President of Sands China; and Grant Chum, EVP of Asia Operations and COO of Sands China. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. We will be making those statements under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results may differ materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are included in our press release. We have posted an earnings presentation on our website. We may refer to that presentation during the call. And finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those with interest to please pose one question and one follow-up question, so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. This presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining the call. The results speak for themselves. There is a powerful recovery underway in Macao in both gaming and the non-gaming segments. The future looks very good for both markets. Our commitment to investing in both Macao and Singapore has never wavered. In Macao, following the relaxation of travel restrictions, increased visitation has driven gaming volumes, retail sales and hotel occupancy during the quarter. In other words, business is back. Sands China is in unique position to capture the opportunities. Our diversified IR model with continuous investment in non-gaming segments MICE, hotel suites, live entertainment, retail, food and beverage, positions us well to deliver strong growth in the years ahead. Our focus is on all segments in the Macao market, including international tourists. We're excited to have the opportunity to develop -- to deploy more capital to expand our non-gaming offerings in Macao. The $3.8 billion commitment we made as part of the concession tender is just the baseline. We will invest more in this extraordinary market. I look forward to everyone having the opportunity to see, to witness The Londoner and the Four Seasons. The quality of our new products is exceptional. Marina Bay Sands delivered EBITDA of $394 million for the quarter. Mass win was an all-time property record of $549 million. Rolling volumes have nearly equalled the 2019 level. Our $1 billion suite and casino renovation program is progressing. More suite inventory will continue to come online throughout the remainder of the year. We will have 400 suites available by the end of 2023, up from just 150 prior to our renovation. Okay, let's take some questions, and please ask away.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Joe Greff from J.P. Morgan. Joe, your line is live.\nJoe Greff: Hey, everybody. Congratulations on these results.\nRob Goldstein: Thanks, Joe.\nJoe Greff: Rob, Patrick or Dan, whoever wants to take this first one. In Macao, presumably, March was better than February, and February, obviously, was better than January from an EBITDA and an EBITDA margin perspective. I was hoping you can maybe help us understand maybe the margin exit rate coming out of the quarter as we head here into the second quarter. If you've reported 31% margins for the quarter, March was something much higher than that. I was hoping you can help us maybe understand the cadence of EBITDA generation by month and maybe the same thing for margins by month, just so we're, I guess, thinking about it the right way in terms of our projections going forward.\nRob Goldstein: Joe, I'll ask Patrick to take it. But before I do, I'll just say, I think you have to realize, I think you do realize that Macao is in its infancy as far as a return to a more normal operating environment. It's not even -- I think we're -- it's still early days there. This first quarter is still not representation of what can happen in Macao or will happen. So, I wouldn't call it normal operating mode. And as you referenced, the acceleration in revenues is clearly there and that will accelerate margins. Patrick, you want to add some more color.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks. Rob. Joe, it's an interesting question. I think we've been very focused on margins for many years at SCL. Unfortunately, operating environment during the pandemic made it very hard to see the benefit of some of the work that the team has done over the years to make the business itself more efficient. I think in the long-run, we're going to look to see some significant operating leverage and the performance out of Macao, particularly as we reach a higher level of performance in a more normalized environment. I will say that there was a material difference in performance across the quarter. January was obviously impacted because, on January 8, the opening occurred. And then, subsequent to that, February is typically a very slow month post the Lunar New Year. But March was a very exciting time. A lot of things were going full steam ahead. It's very excited to see the recovery, the increase in tourism. And so, margins did recover to a more normal level. There's a lot of noise in the quarter because of the start-up. But I think overall, our long-term outlook for margins is quite strong. I think we've done a good job managing costs historically. I think the business itself was set up to be efficient. And I think in the long-run, given the mix of business, we should see a favorable margin operating environment. Grant, I don't know if you have any comments you'd like to add to that.\nGrant Chum: Sure. Yeah, thanks, Patrick. Yeah, maybe I can just give some color on the March trends. I think, Joe, you're right, the market experienced strong recovery through the quarter. So, pretty much across all operating metrics, March was better than January and February average. I mean, just as a starting point, in Macao, overall visitations city-wide were up 22% in March versus the first two months of the year. For our portfolio, the gaming volume, non-rolling drop and slot handle were both up 10% in March versus the first two months. Rolling volumes accelerated a lot more than that during that month, not least because we're starting to get some traction on the foreign VIPs coming to Macao, to our properties. Hotel occupancy improved. Occupied room nights increased by 8% in the month versus the first two months, as we were able to operate more hotel rooms with the additional manpower that's coming on board in the second half of the first quarter, and that will significantly increase further into the second quarter. So, overall, yes, I mean, March was a very pleasing month in terms of evolving trends. And as Patrick said, operating margin did recover and did recover more in March, but hopefully this is just the beginning.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thank you for your comments there. You mentioned that 31% of your rooms in Macao were out of service related to labor constraints. Where does that stand now? And can you talk about labor constraints now? And how are you remedying that?\nGrant Chum: Sure. Rob, shall I take that?\nRob Goldstein: Yes, please, Grant. Yeah, you're closest to that. Sure.\nGrant Chum: I mean, hotel room inventory, Joe, availability, the actual availability for the first quarter, yeah, was around 7,700 rooms for SCL portfolio-wide. So effectively, we were accommodating as many rooms as we could, given the manpower constraints during the quarter. As I just referenced, it did improve somewhat in March as the additional hiring of the labor came on board, and the Macao government and the labor bureau have been very supportive in helping us to bring on the labor that we need to operate, especially the hospitality side of the business, the hotel and restaurants. As we go into second quarter, we would expect that, on average, second quarter, we can reach 10,700 rooms in terms of operating capacity. So that's roughly 3,000 additional hotel rooms that we will be able to operate in the second quarter, and that, obviously, takes us up to the much close to our physical available inventory. And we will reach the 12,000 probably sometime in the third quarter, in time for the summer peak season, as additional hiring and training completes through the second quarter.\nRob Goldstein: So, Grant, is it safe to say the labor issues are not event for the entire market by summertime?\nGrant Chum: Yeah, Rob, I think for most of the market, for the second quarter, it's effectively a non-issue from a hotel operating capacity. Obviously, the size of our inventories is the biggest. We'll take a little bit time to get up to full capacity, but obviously, there is a big difference already that we can see between operating 10,700 rooms versus 7,700.\nRob Goldstein: Thanks, Grant. Good job.\nJoe Greff: Thank you, guys.\nRob Goldstein: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, everybody, thank you. Rob, just as it pertains to MBS, obviously, now Macao has gotten up and running and you're starting to see things normalize with obviously the comments there on March. Have you guys seen anything change behaviorally? I mean, we see the results. It doesn't look like anything's changed. But I was just wondering if there was anything that you've seen change in terms of demand around either the high end or the premium mass segments in MBS post kind of resumption of activity in Macao, as it continues to ramp?\nRob Goldstein: Carlo, one thing I thought I understood and I think I was wrong in that respect was the super high-end premium customer in Asia. I thought we would dominate completely in Singapore. We're seeing Singapore is doing very well. We've equalled our 2019 rolling volumes. But what surprised me to the upside is the international demand for Macao, and rolling volume in Macao has been very pleasant, much more than I thought, that we could be rolling in that market far in excess of $20 billion, $25 billion annually, this keeps going. So, there has been a pleasant surprise -- has not hurt us in Singapore if you look at the numbers, but of course, there's only so much money out there, so it might have some impact. Singapore, as you see, had record numbers on the -- the slot numbers are astounding, to be at 900-plus per unit. I've never seen that in any market I've worked in, on especially the scale of machines, the market plus our non-rolling win. To exceed 6 million a day, it's pretty extraordinary. And that's what the impediments and the big headwinds of our rooms being down, our casino being torn up and there is yet to be a recovery of the Chinese consumer into Singapore at the level I think it will get to. So, the pleasant surprise is, Macao is attracting a very strong international Asian high-end customer and yet we're doing fine in Singapore. We may be sharing a very large rolling business between Singapore and Macao for long time to come. I had that wrong pleasantly. I do think the slot business in Singapore and the non-rolling is just the beginning of a trend, a very strong trend. Once we get these rooms back and the casino and -- who knows where it goes. If we make $2.5 billion, $3 billion of those segments in the years to come, maybe. But clearly, we're very happy with the results. For Singapore to do this well this early [in the day] (ph) without a full blown China recovery, it's pretty impressive. I think, we can believe we can make $500 million a quarter in the near future when things get back to a stronger place. So, we're very pleased in both markets for different reasons.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up. I guess, my question is more along the lines of, are you surprised by -- when you are looking at deck, obviously, your premium mass business looks like it's recovering or I should say, your base mass business is recovering relative to the first quarter of '19, very similarly to the premium mass business. And given where visitation is today relative to '19, is that dynamic surprising to you guys at all?\nRob Goldstein: It is to me. I think if we go Page 14 of our deck to see the visitation [being like] (ph) 40% and yet see a recovery where it's at, it's very encouraging for future. The trajectory of Macao feels very good to us. And as Joe alluded to, the growth between January, February, March, it looks very [indiscernible] not be encouraged when you see. We made $400 million roughly without visitation really coming back very much, without hotel rooms being fully occupied, without a lot of impediments, a lot of headwinds and yet here we are. So, yeah, it's very encouraging for us and to the market. And of course, we're the biggest beneficiary of the recovery of base mass since we -- that's our dominant position. But I want also allude to the fact that we believe with our new Londoner and Four Seasons suite and physical product, we're going to compete very favorably, not just the base mass, not just retail, we're going for the very top-end of the market as well to dominate that, and we believe we can do it in both the rolling and non-rolling segments. We have both scale in terms of suite product, but also great aesthetic. When you see what we've done, we were there, and you see the new Londoner, you see the new Four Seasons, I promise you, you will be overwhelmed with the product of quality. What that team has done is exceptional work. So, for us, we see no segment in Macao to our competitors. We want to be first in every category. I believe it's possible with our new products.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great, thanks very much.\nGrant Chum: Rob, maybe I can just add something on the...\nRob Goldstein: Yes, please, jump in, Grant.\nGrant Chum: Sorry. Okay. Just to add something to Rob's comment on the premium mass versus mass off the question, yes, it looks like from the deck that we recovered at a similar rate on the premium mass and mass win versus first quarter of 2019. But overall, in terms of volumes and headcount, it was definitely a premium mass led recovery and the quality of customer has been increasing and the spend per head. The win comparison with 2019 is more hold related issue on the premium mass segment for both 2019 and 2023. But overall, premium mass gaming volume, gaming drop and headcount recovery is faster than base mass. But I think to Rob's points, we've been essentially out competing in the premium segments in both VIP and premium mass as you can see from the market share in the first quarter. Our non-rolling drop recovered to two-thirds of the first quarter of 2019 level. That's in line with the overall market recovery in mass, despite a much bigger dependence on base mass. So, as the base mass, which has been lagging in the recovery, starts to ramp up, especially as more hotel rooms come online for city -- for the whole city and for our portfolio, and also that visitations pickup and transportation and logistics improve, we should obviously be the biggest beneficiary of that base mass recovery. And some of that you can already see in the way we've outperformed in a slot electronic gaming market. Slot handle recovering to over 73% of 2019. And that has a lot more exposure. I mean, Hong Kong base mass is a much bigger part of slot and tables, and obviously, Hong Kong base mass has recovered faster as you can see from the visitations where Hong Kong visitations are already 75% of where they were in 2019, and you can see that outperformance in electronic gaming has been strong, both in absolute terms and relative to the market.\nCarlo Santarelli: Certainly. Thank you very much for the additional context. I appreciate it.\nRob Goldstein: Thanks, Carlo. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live.\nRobin Farley: Great, thank you. Grant, following on your comments about the strength of the recovery being that by the premium mass side, I'm curious if you're seeing any impact at all from visa policy that is sometimes turning down kind of frequent visitors or multiple visits in a period. Sounds like it's not impacting the recovery in your view. But I'm just curious if you're seeing any impacts from that.\nRob Goldstein: Grant?\nGrant Chum: Rob, shall I take that?\nRob Goldstein: Please, yes.\nGrant Chum: Yeah, Robin, I think for -- if you look at the visitation, overall, we are seeing a much faster recovery from Guangdong than from the non-Guangdong provinces. I think that's for obvious reasons, the proximity, the ease with which the visitors from the neighboring province can get to Macao. From my point of view, I think the biggest impediment to a higher rate of recovery in non-Guangdong visitation is actually the amount of hotel room inventory that was unavailable in the first quarter. I mean, we're the biggest repository of hotel rooms and we're with offline by 36%. And for the city as a whole, obviously, the percentage of out of rooms availability was also very significant. So, I think people have kind of high propensity to think about coming to Macao. I think the hotel room inventory issue has been a big impediment. But that's obviously easing dramatically as we get into the second quarter. And then, transportation is still only a fraction of what it was, especially in routes like from Hong Kong to Macao. Our ferries are only 20% of where they were in 2019 during the first quarter. And yeah, obviously, the visitation from Hong Kong has been so strong. So, I think overall, the visitation recovery is progressing very well, but you've got to bear in mind a couple of those pain points that are both, I think, I would say, easing quite significantly, and that's the hotel room inventory and the transportation.\nRobin Farley: Great, and that's helpful. Thanks. And then, just as my follow-up, if I could. Understanding, it's going to take a couple of quarters for all your hotel rooms to be up and running, at that point, when you think about the run rate where you are for operating expense, how would you compare that to 2019? Is there any kind of permanent reduction in some way in operating expense? Or in fact is -- does the labor issue, mean that costs are going to be higher when you're kind of fully ramped up? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: Take it, Grant.\nGrant Chum: Yeah. I think clearly we -- as we add headcount to man, to operate all of our inventory on the hospitality side, our payroll cost will start to go up. But obviously, we expect the revenue to be rebounding a lot more. So, I think this is just the ordinary course of ramping up the capacity. We achieved multiple rounds of cost savings over the years. After the 2014 downturn, we achieved some sustainable savings from that round. We made some additional structural cost savings on our expenses during the pandemic, and we hope to hold on to some of those savings. But, in terms of the labor portion, absolutely we have to invest in the manpower to get our assets back up to full operating capacity and, obviously, the cost will grow in line with that. But clearly, we want to be operating 12,000 rooms, not 7,700. So, this is something we're trying to do as quickly as we can.\nRobin Farley: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun. your line is live.\nShaun Kelley: Hi, great. Thanks. Just, maybe to start, if we could go back to a couple of your comments, Rob, on that base mass versus some of the premium mass mix and the surprise there. I mean, is -- a healthy way to think about the mix that we're seeing in the market today, just kind of low double digit increase in spend per visit, is that -- if I look at the 62% base mass versus, let's call it, 48% overall visitation growth, is that reflective of market conditions, or is there some subtext or some difference that we should be thinking about, or did that change throughout the quarter at all? Just trying to kind of get a sense of what's pent-up demand and how much of this is just getting the bodies back into the property.\nRob Goldstein: I think, one thing we would be careful of, we're -- again, we're in early innings here. In fact, we haven't -- I would say, if you're playing golf, we're still in the driving range. I mean, we haven't gotten the first tee yet. This market, 100 days ago, Grant reminded me, we're kidding about the market, hoping to see a profitable quarter in '22. We now just gave you a $400 million number. I think my point is, it's evolving so quickly and the movement -- if you look at -- I don't think it's easy to spot trends. I think clearly the base mass to Grant's comment, has been somewhat confusing and his thoughts recovered much better than base mass tables. But again, I think it's very difficult to assign the certainty to where the trends are going. I just think, when you look at the page -- Slide 16 or 14, you'll see the non-Guangdong visitation, which is pretty weak, and there is so much more room to run here. I think when this is all said and done, we'll make a lot more money with a very healthy margin and all this will be left behind the desk. I just don't think we can take -- what really effectively half of January, two months subsequent and assign real value to it. Yeah, it's just too early to figure it out. Grant, please jump in.\nGrant Chum: No, not a lot more to that, Rob. Yeah, I think you covered it well.\nRob Goldstein: Shaun, what else you got?\nRob Goldstein: Great. I mean, the other question would be the follow-up and maybe a little bit indulgent, but I'll try. Just trying to get a sense of kind of...\nRob Goldstein: Indulge us.\nShaun Kelley: Just trying to get a sense of market share as we, let's call, exited the quarter, be it March or some [amount] (ph) of run rate, as we look at it, some of the checks suggested that it was accelerating and you did very well. It probably depended a little bit of the timing on some of that base mass recovery, but for the quarter, we calculated you at around 27% share. And just kind of curious if that was level across the quarter? Did you kind of -- was it your exit rate meaningfully higher than that? I'm just kind of trying to, again, probably extract a little too much from where we are in the recovery, but we want try anyways.\nRob Goldstein: All right. Patrick is going to take a look at that.\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah, it's an interesting question. I think when we look at Macao, it's a story of investment. So, if you think about the growth in Macao and the asset base that we have and why we're able to get the visitation and the productivity out of the assets, it's because of our scale of investment in non-gaming. It's the rooms, it's the retail, it's the entertainment, it's the food and beverage, it's all the things that drive tourism value. And so, we invested $2.2 billion across the pandemic. So, from our standpoint, it's a new day. And we have probably one of the most important assets we have created in The Londoner, which was Sands Cotai Central. There's a lot of productivity that's available there. We have 650 new suite that we didn't have pre-pandemic. There's a lot of volume that we're going to be getting that we never had access to, now that the pandemic recovery is underway. And I think the other thing that's important to note is we've done this two other times. So, we were in the Las Vegas market during the recovery. And we saw the schedule and let's call it the slope of recovery related to pent-up demand in the marketplace and recovery of tourism. We went through that. We saw it in Singapore and the different stages of tourism access that occurred in a very controlled market in that recovery. And now we're seeing unfettered access to what is probably the best cluster tourism assets in all of Macao globally. And they've been continued to be invested in. There's a lot of depth to the market. And it is the beginning innings. It's early. So to call a market share now is a little tough, because it's not really comparable to pre-pandemic, because of the amount of investment and some of the dynamics changes that have happened to the market in the last three years. So, from our standpoint, I think we put up a good quarter. I think we're positioned well. As Grant mentioned, we're very excited about the additional inventory coming online as we get manpower into the buildings. And I think we're in a good place to continue to grow. So, we're not really looking at market share right now as much as we're looking at investment, visitation, access, customer service and then margin and outcome. And you saw the results of that in the quarter that we just had. So, March was really good. We're really excited about it. We're in a great trend. And we're going to keep pushing.\nShaun Kelley: Congratulations. Thanks very much.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live.\nDavid Katz: Hi, afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just go back to the direct VIP business in both markets. And I know you made some commentary about sort of where Singapore is coming from and where some of the extra business is coming from. But can you help us understand the direct VIP opportunity in Macao? And are there any insights that we can learn from about where that could evolve to over time relative to what we saw in the past, understanding it's a completely different business today?\nRob Goldstein: Yeah, I think we're all in the same boat here as far as not really knowing how -- I think the first quarter is indicative that there is a VIP market. Our rolling volumes indicate that. We wonder if it can increase, keep going. One surprise to me has been the acceptance of foreign visitation from non-China countries into Macao. It makes sense to me. The quality of product there, the diversity of product, the experience, there is very -- it's an exciting place to visit, easy to access, getting easier, especially for foreigners. So, I think that's going to continue to build. Also the people there -- it's obvious because the structural junk is disappearing. It's a much different approach. And these are people you have to know who they are, credit wise, et cetera, to be in business with them. But I don't think it slows down. My sense is, Macao has such a compelling product and such diversity of compelling products and has such great food and retail, it's just an exceptional place for visitor internationally. And I think you'll see more and more of that trend. I don't think it will cost as business in Singapore in terms of -- I think people will still obviously get to Singapore for the same reasons. But Macao, I think has a better future on the direct rolling business that I anticipated. And I think it's driven by, again, access, quality of product and people want to go there, and it's evident here in the first quarter. Obviously, the -- it's impacted by our retail sales as well. You can see the quality of our retail business in Macao, it's a direct relationship with the super high-end that come to visit. That's again, early innings, non-junket, liquidity issues, a lot of unknowns at this point. I don't think we should pretend to know what the future looks like, but I think there is a very positive trend in the right direction. Grant, do you want to comment?\nGrant Chum: Sure. Yeah. I think Rob is absolutely right. The attraction of Macao to foreign VIP gamer is immense and I think the pleasant surprise, although we are obviously redoubling our assets post the concession tender in bringing international visitation to Macao and the VIP gaming was the first natural place to start, given that the general airlift, commercial air flights are still a fraction of where they were in 2019. So, I think this direct VIP performance that you referenced, it was very healthy during the quarter and kept growing and we don't know where it grows to, but there's no reason to believe that it wouldn't continue to grow, given the quality of the product. And you can see, not just the strong product appeal for the premium customer that we provide, but we provide such a diversity of -- such a clustering effect of so many world-class resorts and we already have four of them in our portfolio. But together with all of the other colleagues in the industry, it's an amazing clustering of world-class premium gaming destination that should appeal to the Asian regional players over time. And then, I think the other point that is, I think specifically for us, we've been doing this for a long, long time in terms of our international direct VIP around the Asia region. Las Vegas, Macao, Singapore, this is not a new structure to us. We've just got enormous ability to promote Macao now to the foreign countries, because we have the capacity, and to Patrick's point, we have the new product that we've never had before, the availability of the top-quality suites, the top-quality salons. So, we're going to be -- we have been and we're going to continue to use our international sales network that we have the biggest infrastructure across Asia in the industry and that's where we're going to combine the benefit of this premium product, Macao as a destination for these Asian gamers. With our sales infrastructure that will continue to expand. So, I think the future is very bright for foreign visitation and foreign VIP market into Macao.\nDavid Katz: If I can just -- thank you for that. And if I can just follow-up quickly. In terms of which -- any color on sort of which countries and where this is sort of coming from and any sensibility about kind of the sustainability? Obviously, you feel like you can continue to grow them, but the non-Chinese, other countries, and the degree to which extending credit may cost a little bit more along the way. Any color there would be helpful too.\nRob Goldstein: We won't be, David, country-specific, we won't do that. But I would just say to you, the demand is in a number of countries. And I think Grant's last point was very interesting. I was juffling, because he's actually right. We've been doing this for decades. In Asia, we have a very strong sales force. A lot of same people have been with us for 20 years and represents in Las Vegas and of course Singapore, Macao. So, we are the beneficiaries of that sales system. But I think the high-end is probably built now in Singapore and Macao is going to drive that customer. Is this sustainable? Does it grow? I don't want to predict the future. I just don't know. But if it does, I think we will be the biggest beneficiary of it, because again, we have the biggest network and we have all these different places that we can take people within Macao, and of course to Singapore. So, it's hard to predict because again, it's early innings here. But I think if there's a strong rolling business in Macao, I think we'll get a big chunk of that. And time will tell how big it is, liquidity issues. But the MICE and the junket business clearly has a new day there. But if we can roll $20 billion, $30 billion, it would feel like a good place to be, if that's possible.\nDavid Katz: Thank you very much. Londoner looks great.\nRob Goldstein: Oh, thank you. You saw it? We love people seeing it, because it's only halfway there, but what we've built so far is, we're just very proud of it. Thank you.\nDavid Katz: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Brandt, your line is live.\nBrandt Montour: Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions.\nRob Goldstein: Hey, Brandt.\nBrandt Montour: So, given -- thanks. So, given Grant laid out a pretty good case based on the transportation impediments and the hotel room inventory impediments, that premium mass visitation could very well outgrow base mass visitation from here. I hope I'm not putting words in anybody's mouth. But could you give us some insight into what you're seeing in terms of premium mass win per visitor and compare that to other markets that you saw reopening post-COVID and sort of an index to 2019? Just trying to get a sense for how the pent-up demand on a per person basis is really trending.\nRob Goldstein: I'll just make a few comments and I'll pass on to Grant. I think the key thing here is having seen this, as we said before, in several other markets. This is an impressive recovery. It's very strong. The people who can get there are consuming meaningfully in all segments, retail, food and beverage, on the gaming side, on the hospitality side. So, it's great to see. It's very exciting. I don't know that in any of our markets, we had a quarter with this amount of EBITDA recovery this quickly after opening. So that's a good indicator. And so, I think we're very excited about that. I think, it's hard to call these things are -- it's -- I wish we had a crystal ball, but I think at this point, we look at the recovery and it's very encouraging. I will turn it over to Grant to see if he has an additional remark.\nGrant Chum: Yeah. I would say, the points that we're making on the hotel room inventory and transportation, it's more a reflection of what happened in the first quarter. I think, if anything, those factors obviously improve and has been improving dramatically into March and into second quarter. So, we obviously hope that the base mass would catch up assuming as we are the biggest beneficiary of that segment. And then, I think spend per head for the entire market is clearly up and the quality of customer is very high. And I think it really applies to all segments. You only have to walk through the different properties. You can see the level of spending power, not least in our retail, more -- we're up 18% in overall retail sales versus 2019, but clearly the luxury segment, it's up a lot more. And that's with obviously only [40%-something] (ph) of visitations that we had in 2019. So, not just in gaming, but also in the non-gaming and retail, you can see those trends were consistent in the first quarter. But hopefully, we can start to see the base mass visitation growing and the hotel room occupancy growing for the entire market.\nBrandt Montour: Great, thanks for that. And switching gears maybe to New York. Just curious if you're willing to give any updated thoughts on the RFP process there? If you think the timeline has shifted since we've talked about it three months ago? Any other comments on the factors for winning that third license? Thank you.\nRob Goldstein: Yeah. New York, work in progress, waiting response from the government. Obviously, it has pushed back. We're here and we don't know for a fact, let's begin there. But we've been told, it could be early first quarter of 2024. But again we have no definitive date at this time. We do believe we have a very compelling bid. The project is in sync with our historical approach to development. It's large scale resort with enormous non-gaming amenities, hotel, convention space, entertainment, spa, et cetera, very beautiful design, very much LVS spirit, the way hotel should be designed as a real resort, a real destination. We have close to 80 acres. So, I think we have a very special bid, a very compelling bid, and I hope the market sees it that way. Timing will reign with New York State's government, and again we hope it's the first part of '24. No more to say about that at this time.\nRob Goldstein: Thanks, Grant.\nBrandt Montour: Great, thanks, again.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel. Steve, your line is live.\nSteven Wieczynski: Hey, guys, good afternoon. So, Rob or whoever wants to take this. I mean, if we look at visitation into Macao over the last, let's call a month or so, it seems like there might have been or there might has been a change in the makeup of the typical visitor coming into the market. And based on some reports that have been out there in the market, it seems like there are potentially more tour groups and stuff like that coming into the market versus pre-pandemic. So just -- I'm just trying to -- just wondering how you're thinking about the spending characteristics or wallet size of the typical customer today versus what that typical customer looked like previously. I'm not sure I asked that question really the right way. So, if I didn't, let me know.\nRob Goldstein: I think you asked it perfectly. It's a good question. Grant, do you want tackle that first?\nGrant Chum: Sure. Yeah. I mean, I think we're trying to get recovery in all segments of the market, as the tourism market is multifaceted in terms of the different segments. And the tour groups with the last segment to really be recovering. So that's only been taking place in the second half of the first quarter. So yes, the first visitors to come back been more at the premium end and over time, you're going to get all the other segments recovering in good time. And I don't think there's any difference fundamentally in terms of how these different segments behave or perform versus 2019. I think in general, of the people who have been coming back, I think you've seen a higher propensity to spend. But over time, as the other segments come back, I don't think we should necessarily expect a fundamentally different mix or fundamentally different profile within each of those segments. Yeah, so the only different point to make at this juncture is that, yes, across all segments, the spend -- spending power is higher than what it was and propensity spend is higher, and we'll see where that evolves over time.\nRob Goldstein: Steve, I think we all agree that what Grant just said, we have total confidence that this market will look a lot like it did before. The only difference structurally is the junket situation. But maybe the more affluent have gotten better access earlier, but I'm a staunch believer that that market will come roaring back in the base mass. You walk around the Peninsula, you see already the base mass is booming down there, although it's just lower-quality spend than premium base mass. But I think the base mass market will come back, the question is how quickly it does come back. But this market will look fundamentally the same in 2023 and '24 as it did in '18 '19, I'm pretty confident of that.\nSteven Wieczynski: Okay, thanks for that, guys. I appreciate that. And then, Rob, I think the slide - what number is it, number 23, it's pretty interesting in terms of how you laid out your Macao capital commitments for the next 10 years or so. I don't know if you answered this, but if you think about that potential all-in, the $4.5 billion that you might have to spend over the next 10 years, is there any way you could help us think about what you guys are kind of targeting for a potential return on that commitment?\nRob Goldstein: Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah, I think we've always said publicly that we look towards a 20% return on invested capital there. But I have to tell you, Macao is a bit of fantastic market to invest in over the last 20 years. We're very excited to follow through this commitment and we look forward to the opportunity to actually invest more. If you look at the growth of our company, it's because of the investments we've made in Macao in non-gaming. It's an extraordinary tourism market. The consumer responds very well, and we're very excited about the opportunity this new concession to invest more than what we have on this page. So, it's something that we're very focused on and we look forward to the opportunity to do it.\nRob Goldstein: I think we're going to be raging bulls on Macao, investing in the future. And they're fairly look-back to our past and further, you can see our future, which is going to be, we believe non-gaming assets are wildly profitable, but they also drive gaming assets. It's all in sync. So we build more hotels or we build more retail or anything, it drives the gaming win. We've got plenty of positions to fill and to grow those numbers. When you look at the slot number coming to Singapore and the win per unit and tables, you realize just how far Macao can get to. So, we never saw the investment in the concession being an ending point. We saw it the beginning point. We much believe that Macao in next 10 years will make a lot of money for us. We're very bullish on the market and we're thrilled to be there.\nSteven Wieczynski: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.\nRob Goldstein: Sure.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. And the last question today is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is live.\nDan Politzer: Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and congrats on the quarter.\nRob Goldstein: Thank you, Dan.\nDan Politzer: First, I wanted to touch on Macao. Can you talk a little bit about the recovery level across the properties there, and which have been most impacted by room and labor constraints versus mass versus premium mass mix? And then, similarly with Londoner and the suite investments that you've made, what's kind of been the kind of the early read out of the gate and your expectation on recouping that typical 20% return on those investments in terms of timing? Thanks.\nRob Goldstein: Grant, are you still awake? Grant, please take that.\nGrant Chum: Yeah, sure. I think between the properties, Londoner clearly is the most impacted by the hotel room availability. So, you can see that the reported, like physical inventory, occupancy is only 46%, 47% for the property as a whole. And that's the biggest repository of hotel rooms in our portfolio. So, clearly the impact for that property was the greatest. But at the same time, it kind of flips into your -- second part of your question. The portion that we were operating, especially the newer product on the north side of the building and the new suites, we've really had an exceptional customer response to the product. I think not just the excellence of the design and hardware, but also combined with the actual programing of the hospitality, and just the levels of service that bespoke hospitality that we're offering, but doing so at scale. So in terms of those return questions that you asked, we see the early signs are very, very positive from the new product, including the new suites at Londoner hotel, and also the brand new Londoner Court, which is offering very different kinds of bespoke luxury hotel experiences for the customer. But overall for the property, it's a big property. We are hampered by the lack of hotel room availability during the quarter for sure, but, of the new product that we're actually operating, the initial results are, I think, very-very pleasing.\nDan Politzer: Got it, thanks. And then just turning to Singapore. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes the reopening of China? And I know inbound travel from China has been a little bit slower to recover, but, I guess how do you think about that recovering over the course of the year? And then, similarly, China customer base that had been in Singapore, are you still seeing that customer, or have those -- has that base gone back to China?\nRob Goldstein: Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks. It's a very interesting question. I think with the opening of China on January 8, there hasn't been a huge influx of Chinese visitation in the early part of the quarter. But there is an ongoing ramp of outbound tourism from China, that we will be the beneficiaries from. And that's something that we've been anticipating a long time. There is not the normal level of flights. There is not the, let's call, the normal airlift capacity that you would expect during a normal run rate period, which they're going to slowly ramp into. So across the year, our expectation is that, that visitation will recover. It's such a strong market for Singapore, has been historically, and yet we're able to execute these levels without that market really contributing. So we're very bullish on the opportunity of outbound tourism from China to support Marina Bay Sands and its ultimate growth to where Rob has mentioned earlier in the call and beyond. There is one other comment that I do want to make. We had a very interesting question from Steve just prior to yours about the level of investment that we're willing to make in Macao. And I think we're very optimistic about our investments there. It's a high return environment. We're very focused on continued investment there, not only through the fulfillment of our concession renewal, but also in general, to grow our non-gaming asset base. But the same thing was true in Singapore. I think we're very focused on growing Singapore as a market. The opportunity there is very unique. It's a really high-value tourism market that has a different catchment area than Macao. We're very excited about the Marina Bay Sands expansion. Although, just to sort of comment on it, kind of going down that vein, we have very high expectations for return on invested capital in both these markets. But when we first went into the Marina Bay Sands expansion in 2019 and we entered into a development agreement in April of 2019, a lot of things have changed. So it's probably going to be a lot more expensive. The pandemic brought additional costs. There has been material -- labor and material cost increases. There has been significant inflation globally, as everyone knows. It's just overall market conditions. But I think from what you see in this quarter, is that the strength in the market is on full display. We really believe that it's going to get stronger over-time. And particularly with investment in high-quality tourism assets, which is what the Marina Bay Sands expansion is. But I think it's really important to note that there's been significant inflation since we began discussions a year ago. So the cost at Marina Bay Sands expansion is going be a lot higher. The good news is, the market is so good. We think the opportunity is going to be a lot stronger or will do a lot better. So, I think to set expectations, the investments that we make, both in Macao, are going to be very strong return. We're very excited about them over the next concession periods. We're really looking forward to investing in Marina Bay Sands expansion. We think it's going to be a great asset. But both of these are going to be expensive. The good news is that we believe the returns are there or we wouldn't be doing them. So, I don't think our investment thesis has changed in either market with the cost inflation. We believe in our long-term success in these markets. We sort of have a very long-term thesis in both of them and going to deploy capital into both in scale. And we're going to look for high returns, and we feel very strongly about the opportunity in both of these markets. But I did want to say that it's going to be expensive and it's going to be worth it.\nRob Goldstein: We are fortunate to be in two markets: one, our expense, the two, reward the money spend. I think we're very fortunate to be in a market that can grow and grow, and we will continue to invest heavily because we believe we'll get back to much bigger numbers in both markets. So stay tuned. We appreciate your time today. Thank you very much.\nDan Politzer: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Dumont",
            "content": "Thanks. Rob. Joe, it's an interesting question. I think we've been very focused on margins for many years at SCL. Unfortunately, operating environment during the pandemic made it very hard to see the benefit of some of the work that the team has done over the years to make the business itself more efficient. I think in the long-run, we're going to look to see some significant operating leverage and the performance out of Macao, particularly as we reach a higher level of performance in a more normalized environment. I will say that there was a material difference in performance across the quarter. January was obviously impacted because, on January 8, the opening occurred. And then, subsequent to that, February is typically a very slow month post the Lunar New Year. But March was a very exciting time. A lot of things were going full steam ahead. It's very excited to see the recovery, the increase in tourism. And so, margins did recover to a more normal level. There's a lot of noise in the quarter because of the start-up. But I think overall, our long-term outlook for margins is quite strong. I think we've done a good job managing costs historically. I think the business itself was set up to be efficient. And I think in the long-run, given the mix of business, we should see a favorable margin operating environment. Grant, I don't know if you have any comments you'd like to add to that. Yeah, it's an interesting question. I think when we look at Macao, it's a story of investment. So, if you think about the growth in Macao and the asset base that we have and why we're able to get the visitation and the productivity out of the assets, it's because of our scale of investment in non-gaming. It's the rooms, it's the retail, it's the entertainment, it's the food and beverage, it's all the things that drive tourism value. And so, we invested $2.2 billion across the pandemic. So, from our standpoint, it's a new day. And we have probably one of the most important assets we have created in The Londoner, which was Sands Cotai Central. There's a lot of productivity that's available there. We have 650 new suite that we didn't have pre-pandemic. There's a lot of volume that we're going to be getting that we never had access to, now that the pandemic recovery is underway. And I think the other thing that's important to note is we've done this two other times. So, we were in the Las Vegas market during the recovery. And we saw the schedule and let's call it the slope of recovery related to pent-up demand in the marketplace and recovery of tourism. We went through that. We saw it in Singapore and the different stages of tourism access that occurred in a very controlled market in that recovery. And now we're seeing unfettered access to what is probably the best cluster tourism assets in all of Macao globally. And they've been continued to be invested in. There's a lot of depth to the market. And it is the beginning innings. It's early. So to call a market share now is a little tough, because it's not really comparable to pre-pandemic, because of the amount of investment and some of the dynamics changes that have happened to the market in the last three years. So, from our standpoint, I think we put up a good quarter. I think we're positioned well. As Grant mentioned, we're very excited about the additional inventory coming online as we get manpower into the buildings. And I think we're in a good place to continue to grow. So, we're not really looking at market share right now as much as we're looking at investment, visitation, access, customer service and then margin and outcome. And you saw the results of that in the quarter that we just had. So, March was really good. We're really excited about it. We're in a great trend. And we're going to keep pushing. Yeah, I think we've always said publicly that we look towards a 20% return on invested capital there. But I have to tell you, Macao is a bit of fantastic market to invest in over the last 20 years. We're very excited to follow through this commitment and we look forward to the opportunity to actually invest more. If you look at the growth of our company, it's because of the investments we've made in Macao in non-gaming. It's an extraordinary tourism market. The consumer responds very well, and we're very excited about the opportunity this new concession to invest more than what we have on this page. So, it's something that we're very focused on and we look forward to the opportunity to do it. Thanks, Steve. Thanks. It's a very interesting question. I think with the opening of China on January 8, there hasn't been a huge influx of Chinese visitation in the early part of the quarter. But there is an ongoing ramp of outbound tourism from China, that we will be the beneficiaries from. And that's something that we've been anticipating a long time. There is not the normal level of flights. There is not the, let's call, the normal airlift capacity that you would expect during a normal run rate period, which they're going to slowly ramp into. So across the year, our expectation is that, that visitation will recover. It's such a strong market for Singapore, has been historically, and yet we're able to execute these levels without that market really contributing. So we're very bullish on the opportunity of outbound tourism from China to support Marina Bay Sands and its ultimate growth to where Rob has mentioned earlier in the call and beyond. There is one other comment that I do want to make. We had a very interesting question from Steve just prior to yours about the level of investment that we're willing to make in Macao. And I think we're very optimistic about our investments there. It's a high return environment. We're very focused on continued investment there, not only through the fulfillment of our concession renewal, but also in general, to grow our non-gaming asset base. But the same thing was true in Singapore. I think we're very focused on growing Singapore as a market. The opportunity there is very unique. It's a really high-value tourism market that has a different catchment area than Macao. We're very excited about the Marina Bay Sands expansion. Although, just to sort of comment on it, kind of going down that vein, we have very high expectations for return on invested capital in both these markets. But when we first went into the Marina Bay Sands expansion in 2019 and we entered into a development agreement in April of 2019, a lot of things have changed. So it's probably going to be a lot more expensive. The pandemic brought additional costs. There has been material -- labor and material cost increases. There has been significant inflation globally, as everyone knows. It's just overall market conditions. But I think from what you see in this quarter, is that the strength in the market is on full display. We really believe that it's going to get stronger over-time. And particularly with investment in high-quality tourism assets, which is what the Marina Bay Sands expansion is. But I think it's really important to note that there's been significant inflation since we began discussions a year ago. So the cost at Marina Bay Sands expansion is going be a lot higher. The good news is, the market is so good. We think the opportunity is going to be a lot stronger or will do a lot better. So, I think to set expectations, the investments that we make, both in Macao, are going to be very strong return. We're very excited about them over the next concession periods. We're really looking forward to investing in Marina Bay Sands expansion. We think it's going to be a great asset. But both of these are going to be expensive. The good news is that we believe the returns are there or we wouldn't be doing them. So, I don't think our investment thesis has changed in either market with the cost inflation. We believe in our long-term success in these markets. We sort of have a very long-term thesis in both of them and going to deploy capital into both in scale. And we're going to look for high returns, and we feel very strongly about the opportunity in both of these markets. But I did want to say that it's going to be expensive and it's going to be worth it."

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and thank you for joining the call. The results speak for themselves. There is a powerful recovery underway in Macao in both gaming and the non-gaming segments. The future looks very good for both markets. Our commitment to investing in both Macao and Singapore has never wavered. In Macao, following the relaxation of travel restrictions, increased visitation has driven gaming volumes, retail sales and hotel occupancy during the quarter. In other words, business is back. Sands China is in unique position to capture the opportunities. Our diversified IR model with continuous investment in non-gaming segments MICE, hotel suites, live entertainment, retail, food and beverage, positions us well to deliver strong growth in the years ahead. Our focus is on all segments in the Macao market, including international tourists. We're excited to have the opportunity to develop -- to deploy more capital to expand our non-gaming offerings in Macao. The $3.8 billion commitment we made as part of the concession tender is just the baseline. We will invest more in this extraordinary market. I look forward to everyone having the opportunity to see, to witness The Londoner and the Four Seasons. The quality of our new products is exceptional. Marina Bay Sands delivered EBITDA of $394 million for the quarter. Mass win was an all-time property record of $549 million. Rolling volumes have nearly equalled the 2019 level. Our $1 billion suite and casino renovation program is progressing. More suite inventory will continue to come online throughout the remainder of the year. We will have 400 suites available by the end of 2023, up from just 150 prior to our renovation. Okay, let's take some questions, and please ask away. Thanks, Joe. Joe, I'll ask Patrick to take it. But before I do, I'll just say, I think you have to realize, I think you do realize that Macao is in its infancy as far as a return to a more normal operating environment. It's not even -- I think we're -- it's still early days there. This first quarter is still not representation of what can happen in Macao or will happen. So, I wouldn't call it normal operating mode. And as you referenced, the acceleration in revenues is clearly there and that will accelerate margins. Patrick, you want to add some more color. Yes, please, Grant. Yeah, you're closest to that. Sure. So, Grant, is it safe to say the labor issues are not event for the entire market by summertime? Thanks, Grant. Good job. Okay. Thank you. Carlo, one thing I thought I understood and I think I was wrong in that respect was the super high-end premium customer in Asia. I thought we would dominate completely in Singapore. We're seeing Singapore is doing very well. We've equalled our 2019 rolling volumes. But what surprised me to the upside is the international demand for Macao, and rolling volume in Macao has been very pleasant, much more than I thought, that we could be rolling in that market far in excess of $20 billion, $25 billion annually, this keeps going. So, there has been a pleasant surprise -- has not hurt us in Singapore if you look at the numbers, but of course, there's only so much money out there, so it might have some impact. Singapore, as you see, had record numbers on the -- the slot numbers are astounding, to be at 900-plus per unit. I've never seen that in any market I've worked in, on especially the scale of machines, the market plus our non-rolling win. To exceed 6 million a day, it's pretty extraordinary. And that's what the impediments and the big headwinds of our rooms being down, our casino being torn up and there is yet to be a recovery of the Chinese consumer into Singapore at the level I think it will get to. So, the pleasant surprise is, Macao is attracting a very strong international Asian high-end customer and yet we're doing fine in Singapore. We may be sharing a very large rolling business between Singapore and Macao for long time to come. I had that wrong pleasantly. I do think the slot business in Singapore and the non-rolling is just the beginning of a trend, a very strong trend. Once we get these rooms back and the casino and -- who knows where it goes. If we make $2.5 billion, $3 billion of those segments in the years to come, maybe. But clearly, we're very happy with the results. For Singapore to do this well this early [in the day] (ph) without a full blown China recovery, it's pretty impressive. I think, we can believe we can make $500 million a quarter in the near future when things get back to a stronger place. So, we're very pleased in both markets for different reasons. It is to me. I think if we go Page 14 of our deck to see the visitation [being like] (ph) 40% and yet see a recovery where it's at, it's very encouraging for future. The trajectory of Macao feels very good to us. And as Joe alluded to, the growth between January, February, March, it looks very [indiscernible] not be encouraged when you see. We made $400 million roughly without visitation really coming back very much, without hotel rooms being fully occupied, without a lot of impediments, a lot of headwinds and yet here we are. So, yeah, it's very encouraging for us and to the market. And of course, we're the biggest beneficiary of the recovery of base mass since we -- that's our dominant position. But I want also allude to the fact that we believe with our new Londoner and Four Seasons suite and physical product, we're going to compete very favorably, not just the base mass, not just retail, we're going for the very top-end of the market as well to dominate that, and we believe we can do it in both the rolling and non-rolling segments. We have both scale in terms of suite product, but also great aesthetic. When you see what we've done, we were there, and you see the new Londoner, you see the new Four Seasons, I promise you, you will be overwhelmed with the product of quality. What that team has done is exceptional work. So, for us, we see no segment in Macao to our competitors. We want to be first in every category. I believe it's possible with our new products. Yes, please, jump in, Grant. Thanks, Carlo. Appreciate it. Grant? Please, yes. Take it, Grant. I think, one thing we would be careful of, we're -- again, we're in early innings here. In fact, we haven't -- I would say, if you're playing golf, we're still in the driving range. I mean, we haven't gotten the first tee yet. This market, 100 days ago, Grant reminded me, we're kidding about the market, hoping to see a profitable quarter in '22. We now just gave you a $400 million number. I think my point is, it's evolving so quickly and the movement -- if you look at -- I don't think it's easy to spot trends. I think clearly the base mass to Grant's comment, has been somewhat confusing and his thoughts recovered much better than base mass tables. But again, I think it's very difficult to assign the certainty to where the trends are going. I just think, when you look at the page -- Slide 16 or 14, you'll see the non-Guangdong visitation, which is pretty weak, and there is so much more room to run here. I think when this is all said and done, we'll make a lot more money with a very healthy margin and all this will be left behind the desk. I just don't think we can take -- what really effectively half of January, two months subsequent and assign real value to it. Yeah, it's just too early to figure it out. Grant, please jump in. Shaun, what else you got? Great. I mean, the other question would be the follow-up and maybe a little bit indulgent, but I'll try. Just trying to get a sense of kind of... Indulge us. All right. Patrick is going to take a look at that. Thank you. Yeah, I think we're all in the same boat here as far as not really knowing how -- I think the first quarter is indicative that there is a VIP market. Our rolling volumes indicate that. We wonder if it can increase, keep going. One surprise to me has been the acceptance of foreign visitation from non-China countries into Macao. It makes sense to me. The quality of product there, the diversity of product, the experience, there is very -- it's an exciting place to visit, easy to access, getting easier, especially for foreigners. So, I think that's going to continue to build. Also the people there -- it's obvious because the structural junk is disappearing. It's a much different approach. And these are people you have to know who they are, credit wise, et cetera, to be in business with them. But I don't think it slows down. My sense is, Macao has such a compelling product and such diversity of compelling products and has such great food and retail, it's just an exceptional place for visitor internationally. And I think you'll see more and more of that trend. I don't think it will cost as business in Singapore in terms of -- I think people will still obviously get to Singapore for the same reasons. But Macao, I think has a better future on the direct rolling business that I anticipated. And I think it's driven by, again, access, quality of product and people want to go there, and it's evident here in the first quarter. Obviously, the -- it's impacted by our retail sales as well. You can see the quality of our retail business in Macao, it's a direct relationship with the super high-end that come to visit. That's again, early innings, non-junket, liquidity issues, a lot of unknowns at this point. I don't think we should pretend to know what the future looks like, but I think there is a very positive trend in the right direction. Grant, do you want to comment? We won't be, David, country-specific, we won't do that. But I would just say to you, the demand is in a number of countries. And I think Grant's last point was very interesting. I was juffling, because he's actually right. We've been doing this for decades. In Asia, we have a very strong sales force. A lot of same people have been with us for 20 years and represents in Las Vegas and of course Singapore, Macao. So, we are the beneficiaries of that sales system. But I think the high-end is probably built now in Singapore and Macao is going to drive that customer. Is this sustainable? Does it grow? I don't want to predict the future. I just don't know. But if it does, I think we will be the biggest beneficiary of it, because again, we have the biggest network and we have all these different places that we can take people within Macao, and of course to Singapore. So, it's hard to predict because again, it's early innings here. But I think if there's a strong rolling business in Macao, I think we'll get a big chunk of that. And time will tell how big it is, liquidity issues. But the MICE and the junket business clearly has a new day there. But if we can roll $20 billion, $30 billion, it would feel like a good place to be, if that's possible. Oh, thank you. You saw it? We love people seeing it, because it's only halfway there, but what we've built so far is, we're just very proud of it. Thank you. Hey, Brandt. I'll just make a few comments and I'll pass on to Grant. I think the key thing here is having seen this, as we said before, in several other markets. This is an impressive recovery. It's very strong. The people who can get there are consuming meaningfully in all segments, retail, food and beverage, on the gaming side, on the hospitality side. So, it's great to see. It's very exciting. I don't know that in any of our markets, we had a quarter with this amount of EBITDA recovery this quickly after opening. So that's a good indicator. And so, I think we're very excited about that. I think, it's hard to call these things are -- it's -- I wish we had a crystal ball, but I think at this point, we look at the recovery and it's very encouraging. I will turn it over to Grant to see if he has an additional remark. Yeah. New York, work in progress, waiting response from the government. Obviously, it has pushed back. We're here and we don't know for a fact, let's begin there. But we've been told, it could be early first quarter of 2024. But again we have no definitive date at this time. We do believe we have a very compelling bid. The project is in sync with our historical approach to development. It's large scale resort with enormous non-gaming amenities, hotel, convention space, entertainment, spa, et cetera, very beautiful design, very much LVS spirit, the way hotel should be designed as a real resort, a real destination. We have close to 80 acres. So, I think we have a very special bid, a very compelling bid, and I hope the market sees it that way. Timing will reign with New York State's government, and again we hope it's the first part of '24. No more to say about that at this time. Thanks, Grant. I think you asked it perfectly. It's a good question. Grant, do you want tackle that first? Steve, I think we all agree that what Grant just said, we have total confidence that this market will look a lot like it did before. The only difference structurally is the junket situation. But maybe the more affluent have gotten better access earlier, but I'm a staunch believer that that market will come roaring back in the base mass. You walk around the Peninsula, you see already the base mass is booming down there, although it's just lower-quality spend than premium base mass. But I think the base mass market will come back, the question is how quickly it does come back. But this market will look fundamentally the same in 2023 and '24 as it did in '18 '19, I'm pretty confident of that. Patrick? I think we're going to be raging bulls on Macao, investing in the future. And they're fairly look-back to our past and further, you can see our future, which is going to be, we believe non-gaming assets are wildly profitable, but they also drive gaming assets. It's all in sync. So we build more hotels or we build more retail or anything, it drives the gaming win. We've got plenty of positions to fill and to grow those numbers. When you look at the slot number coming to Singapore and the win per unit and tables, you realize just how far Macao can get to. So, we never saw the investment in the concession being an ending point. We saw it the beginning point. We much believe that Macao in next 10 years will make a lot of money for us. We're very bullish on the market and we're thrilled to be there. Sure. Thank you, Dan. Grant, are you still awake? Grant, please take that. Patrick? We are fortunate to be in two markets: one, our expense, the two, reward the money spend. I think we're very fortunate to be in a market that can grow and grow, and we will continue to invest heavily because we believe we'll get back to much bigger numbers in both markets. So stay tuned. We appreciate your time today. Thank you very much."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Sure. Yeah, thanks, Patrick. Yeah, maybe I can just give some color on the March trends. I think, Joe, you're right, the market experienced strong recovery through the quarter. So, pretty much across all operating metrics, March was better than January and February average. I mean, just as a starting point, in Macao, overall visitations city-wide were up 22% in March versus the first two months of the year. For our portfolio, the gaming volume, non-rolling drop and slot handle were both up 10% in March versus the first two months. Rolling volumes accelerated a lot more than that during that month, not least because we're starting to get some traction on the foreign VIPs coming to Macao, to our properties. Hotel occupancy improved. Occupied room nights increased by 8% in the month versus the first two months, as we were able to operate more hotel rooms with the additional manpower that's coming on board in the second half of the first quarter, and that will significantly increase further into the second quarter. So, overall, yes, I mean, March was a very pleasing month in terms of evolving trends. And as Patrick said, operating margin did recover and did recover more in March, but hopefully this is just the beginning. Sure. Rob, shall I take that? I mean, hotel room inventory, Joe, availability, the actual availability for the first quarter, yeah, was around 7,700 rooms for SCL portfolio-wide. So effectively, we were accommodating as many rooms as we could, given the manpower constraints during the quarter. As I just referenced, it did improve somewhat in March as the additional hiring of the labor came on board, and the Macao government and the labor bureau have been very supportive in helping us to bring on the labor that we need to operate, especially the hospitality side of the business, the hotel and restaurants. As we go into second quarter, we would expect that, on average, second quarter, we can reach 10,700 rooms in terms of operating capacity. So that's roughly 3,000 additional hotel rooms that we will be able to operate in the second quarter, and that, obviously, takes us up to the much close to our physical available inventory. And we will reach the 12,000 probably sometime in the third quarter, in time for the summer peak season, as additional hiring and training completes through the second quarter. Yeah, Rob, I think for most of the market, for the second quarter, it's effectively a non-issue from a hotel operating capacity. Obviously, the size of our inventories is the biggest. We'll take a little bit time to get up to full capacity, but obviously, there is a big difference already that we can see between operating 10,700 rooms versus 7,700. Rob, maybe I can just add something on the... Sorry. Okay. Just to add something to Rob's comment on the premium mass versus mass off the question, yes, it looks like from the deck that we recovered at a similar rate on the premium mass and mass win versus first quarter of 2019. But overall, in terms of volumes and headcount, it was definitely a premium mass led recovery and the quality of customer has been increasing and the spend per head. The win comparison with 2019 is more hold related issue on the premium mass segment for both 2019 and 2023. But overall, premium mass gaming volume, gaming drop and headcount recovery is faster than base mass. But I think to Rob's points, we've been essentially out competing in the premium segments in both VIP and premium mass as you can see from the market share in the first quarter. Our non-rolling drop recovered to two-thirds of the first quarter of 2019 level. That's in line with the overall market recovery in mass, despite a much bigger dependence on base mass. So, as the base mass, which has been lagging in the recovery, starts to ramp up, especially as more hotel rooms come online for city -- for the whole city and for our portfolio, and also that visitations pickup and transportation and logistics improve, we should obviously be the biggest beneficiary of that base mass recovery. And some of that you can already see in the way we've outperformed in a slot electronic gaming market. Slot handle recovering to over 73% of 2019. And that has a lot more exposure. I mean, Hong Kong base mass is a much bigger part of slot and tables, and obviously, Hong Kong base mass has recovered faster as you can see from the visitations where Hong Kong visitations are already 75% of where they were in 2019, and you can see that outperformance in electronic gaming has been strong, both in absolute terms and relative to the market. Rob, shall I take that? Yeah, Robin, I think for -- if you look at the visitation, overall, we are seeing a much faster recovery from Guangdong than from the non-Guangdong provinces. I think that's for obvious reasons, the proximity, the ease with which the visitors from the neighboring province can get to Macao. From my point of view, I think the biggest impediment to a higher rate of recovery in non-Guangdong visitation is actually the amount of hotel room inventory that was unavailable in the first quarter. I mean, we're the biggest repository of hotel rooms and we're with offline by 36%. And for the city as a whole, obviously, the percentage of out of rooms availability was also very significant. So, I think people have kind of high propensity to think about coming to Macao. I think the hotel room inventory issue has been a big impediment. But that's obviously easing dramatically as we get into the second quarter. And then, transportation is still only a fraction of what it was, especially in routes like from Hong Kong to Macao. Our ferries are only 20% of where they were in 2019 during the first quarter. And yeah, obviously, the visitation from Hong Kong has been so strong. So, I think overall, the visitation recovery is progressing very well, but you've got to bear in mind a couple of those pain points that are both, I think, I would say, easing quite significantly, and that's the hotel room inventory and the transportation. Yeah. I think clearly we -- as we add headcount to man, to operate all of our inventory on the hospitality side, our payroll cost will start to go up. But obviously, we expect the revenue to be rebounding a lot more. So, I think this is just the ordinary course of ramping up the capacity. We achieved multiple rounds of cost savings over the years. After the 2014 downturn, we achieved some sustainable savings from that round. We made some additional structural cost savings on our expenses during the pandemic, and we hope to hold on to some of those savings. But, in terms of the labor portion, absolutely we have to invest in the manpower to get our assets back up to full operating capacity and, obviously, the cost will grow in line with that. But clearly, we want to be operating 12,000 rooms, not 7,700. So, this is something we're trying to do as quickly as we can. No, not a lot more to that, Rob. Yeah, I think you covered it well. Sure. Yeah. I think Rob is absolutely right. The attraction of Macao to foreign VIP gamer is immense and I think the pleasant surprise, although we are obviously redoubling our assets post the concession tender in bringing international visitation to Macao and the VIP gaming was the first natural place to start, given that the general airlift, commercial air flights are still a fraction of where they were in 2019. So, I think this direct VIP performance that you referenced, it was very healthy during the quarter and kept growing and we don't know where it grows to, but there's no reason to believe that it wouldn't continue to grow, given the quality of the product. And you can see, not just the strong product appeal for the premium customer that we provide, but we provide such a diversity of -- such a clustering effect of so many world-class resorts and we already have four of them in our portfolio. But together with all of the other colleagues in the industry, it's an amazing clustering of world-class premium gaming destination that should appeal to the Asian regional players over time. And then, I think the other point that is, I think specifically for us, we've been doing this for a long, long time in terms of our international direct VIP around the Asia region. Las Vegas, Macao, Singapore, this is not a new structure to us. We've just got enormous ability to promote Macao now to the foreign countries, because we have the capacity, and to Patrick's point, we have the new product that we've never had before, the availability of the top-quality suites, the top-quality salons. So, we're going to be -- we have been and we're going to continue to use our international sales network that we have the biggest infrastructure across Asia in the industry and that's where we're going to combine the benefit of this premium product, Macao as a destination for these Asian gamers. With our sales infrastructure that will continue to expand. So, I think the future is very bright for foreign visitation and foreign VIP market into Macao. Yeah. I would say, the points that we're making on the hotel room inventory and transportation, it's more a reflection of what happened in the first quarter. I think, if anything, those factors obviously improve and has been improving dramatically into March and into second quarter. So, we obviously hope that the base mass would catch up assuming as we are the biggest beneficiary of that segment. And then, I think spend per head for the entire market is clearly up and the quality of customer is very high. And I think it really applies to all segments. You only have to walk through the different properties. You can see the level of spending power, not least in our retail, more -- we're up 18% in overall retail sales versus 2019, but clearly the luxury segment, it's up a lot more. And that's with obviously only [40%-something] (ph) of visitations that we had in 2019. So, not just in gaming, but also in the non-gaming and retail, you can see those trends were consistent in the first quarter. But hopefully, we can start to see the base mass visitation growing and the hotel room occupancy growing for the entire market. Sure. Yeah. I mean, I think we're trying to get recovery in all segments of the market, as the tourism market is multifaceted in terms of the different segments. And the tour groups with the last segment to really be recovering. So that's only been taking place in the second half of the first quarter. So yes, the first visitors to come back been more at the premium end and over time, you're going to get all the other segments recovering in good time. And I don't think there's any difference fundamentally in terms of how these different segments behave or perform versus 2019. I think in general, of the people who have been coming back, I think you've seen a higher propensity to spend. But over time, as the other segments come back, I don't think we should necessarily expect a fundamentally different mix or fundamentally different profile within each of those segments. Yeah, so the only different point to make at this juncture is that, yes, across all segments, the spend -- spending power is higher than what it was and propensity spend is higher, and we'll see where that evolves over time. Yeah, sure. I think between the properties, Londoner clearly is the most impacted by the hotel room availability. So, you can see that the reported, like physical inventory, occupancy is only 46%, 47% for the property as a whole. And that's the biggest repository of hotel rooms in our portfolio. So, clearly the impact for that property was the greatest. But at the same time, it kind of flips into your -- second part of your question. The portion that we were operating, especially the newer product on the north side of the building and the new suites, we've really had an exceptional customer response to the product. I think not just the excellence of the design and hardware, but also combined with the actual programing of the hospitality, and just the levels of service that bespoke hospitality that we're offering, but doing so at scale. So in terms of those return questions that you asked, we see the early signs are very, very positive from the new product, including the new suites at Londoner hotel, and also the brand new Londoner Court, which is offering very different kinds of bespoke luxury hotel experiences for the customer. But overall for the property, it's a big property. We are hampered by the lack of hotel room availability during the quarter for sure, but, of the new product that we're actually operating, the initial results are, I think, very-very pleasing."

Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our press release. We have posted an earnings presentation on our website. We will refer to that presentation during the call. Finally, for the Q&A session, we ask those with interest to please pose one question and one follow-up so we might allow everyone with interest the opportunity to participate. The presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Goldstein: Thanks, Dan. Thanks for joining us today. The Macao market continues to grow. Total gaming revenue for the market grew 13% in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Mass gaming revenue grew 14% in the quarter compared to one year ago. We believe the Chinese economy will grow and flourish in the future. It remains steadfast that the Macao market will grow along with it. I believe that the Macao market gross gaming revenues will exceed $30 billion in 2025 and grow from there. The scale and quality of the assets we have built are second to none. We believe that our assets position us to grow faster than the market as growth expands beyond the premium customer segment. Our business strategy is predicated on investing in high-quality assets that also have scale. We've designed our capital investment programs to ensure that we will continue to be the market leader in the years ahead. We believe our approach will enable us to grow faster in the long-term, grow our share of EBITDA in the Macao market and generate industry-leading returns on invested capital. Turning to our results in Macao. We delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter despite material disruption at the Londoner, which peaked during the third quarter. We opened the Londoner Grand Casino in the last week of September. We also opened 300, the first 300 Londoner Grand suites. We will introduce more Londoner Grand suites throughout the next three quarters. The total 1,300 Londoner Grand suites and rooms in service by Lunar New Year 2025 with a full complement of 1,500 suites and 905 rooms in service by Golden Week 2025. SCL continues to lead the market in gaming and non-gaming revenue and in-market share of EBITDA. Our objective is to capture a high-value, high-margin tourism over the long-term. We have a unique competitive advantage in terms of scale, quality and diversity of product offerings. Upon completion of the second phase of the Londoner in 2025, our product and management more pronounced than ever. We delivered another strong quarter in Singapore despite poor hold percentage. The results in rate base stands reflect the positive impact of our capital investment program and the growth of high value tourism. The growing appeal of Singapore as a destination is enhanced by the robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendar. As we complete the balance of our investment programs in the first half of 2025, there will be considerable runway for growth. Thank you for joining us. Let me turn it over to Patrick before we go to Q&A.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Rob. Macao EBITDA was $585 million. If we had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been higher by $2 million. When adjusted for lower-than-expected hold in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin from Macao portfolio of properties, excluding the Londoner, would have been 35.1% or down 110 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our margins at the Londoner were directly impacted by disruption of the Londoner Grand renovation. We closed the casino and had around 2,500 keys out of inventory during the quarter. Margin at the Venetian was 38.6% and we expect margin improvement as the Venetian Cotai Arena comes back online in November and as visitation to the market and grows in unrated play both increase in the future. Margin at the Plaza and Four Seasons was 39.7% for the quarter. As Rob mentioned, we continue to progress our Londoner Grand renovation program. As these products come online, our competitive position will be stronger than ever. We expect meaningful EBITDA growth and margin expansion in the future. Turning to Singapore. MBS' EBITDA came in at $406 million. Assuming expected hold on our rolling play, our EBITDA would have been approximately $78 million higher. The strong financial results reflect the impact of high-quality tourism investment and market-leading product and growth in high-value tourism overall. Had we held as expected in our Rolling Play segment, MBS EBITDA margin would have been 47.5%, 40 basis points higher than that of the third quarter of 2023. While we have made substantial progress on our $1.75 billion refurbishment program in MBS, we are still in the initial stages of realizing the benefits of these products, including from our tower gaming offering, which opened in September. The next phase of our capital investment program at Marina Bay Sands is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2025. This will support further growth in 2025 and beyond. Also, please note on Page 44 of our earnings presentation, we have provided estimated costs for our Marina Bay Sands IR2 project. We couldn't be more enthusiastic about investing in the long-term growth of high-value leisure and business tourism in Singapore. The original concept was in effect an expansion of Marina Bay Sands, including Arena. Our new program creates a full-scale integrated resort development with a full suite of amenities, including gaming capacity. We look forward to discussing that long-term growth driver in the Q&A session. Turning our program to return capital to shareholders. We repurchased $450 million of LVS stock during the quarter and our Board increased our repurchase authorization to $2 billion for future repurchases. We paid our recurring quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share in the quarter. In addition, our Board increased our annual dividend to $1 per share or $0.25 per quarter for the 2025 calendar year. We really look forward to continue to utilize the company's capital return program to increase returns to shareholders in the future. Thanks again for joining the call today. Now let's take some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nJoe Greff: Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the results. One question two-part related to Macao. In the 3Q, if we look at contra gaming revenues as a percentage of gross gaming revenues, that percentage went down almost 200 basis points, how much of that is you're managing the business differently offering promotions differently than before? How much of that is just the market level of promotional activity is down? How much of that relates to mix between base, mass and premium mass? And then I have a follow-up.\nPatrick Dumont: So, Joe, it's a great question. And I think it's something we've been focused on for a long time. If you realize what happened in the quarter and the quarter before and actually in the first quarter, we've been impacted by disruption. And so we haven't really been able to manage our business with all of our capabilities. And so what we've been doing now is as things have been coming online and we've been focusing on managing the business for the future, we've been looking to become more efficient. So we'll look to improve our margins from managing the business more closely. And what you're seeing is a direct result of that. I think 1 thing that did impact our margins this quarter and they would have looked better was the fact that we took so many rooms out of inventory. So the majority of our, let's call it, our margin change and decline was related to the fact that that's a very high-margin business, and we still didn't have it because the rooms weren't there. So I think what you're seeing is the beginning of the cost discipline and the pricing power because of the assets we've invested in slowly coming into place. So I think it's a good signal for the future in the way that we're going to manage the business with discipline. I would like to turn it over to Grant for any additional comments.\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think, Joe, it's more that last quarter, I think, we mentioned that as we were preparing for the full closure of the old Pacifico Casino. We did deploy some tactical measures to manage the transition of customers to the other properties. And we did that very carefully during second quarter. But for the third quarter, we're really back to our core strategy, which is we compete on the basis of our products and the content that we bring despite the fact that, obviously, third quarter, our disruption actually increased, like Patrick referenced, with many more rooms out of inventory. But we stick to our core strategy and we had a very strong quarter in how we managed customer reinvestments and still maintain market share relative to the second quarter despite rising disruption during the quarter. And despite the fact that the base mass did not recover as strongly as the summer months normally would indicate. So overall, it was a very strong margin performance. And obviously, we're very pleased that we managed to actually grow EBITDA sequentially despite the fact that the market GGR is down marginally against second quarter.\nJoe Greff: Thank you. And my follow-up question related to Macao, obviously, Golden Week was pretty strong October, for the most part, has been better than expected. Can you talk about what you think the drivers of that better-than-expected performance? I'm assuming it's probably better-than-expected for you guys as well. But how much of that is driven by the increases in equity prices locally? How much of that is seasonally strong events like Golden Week or New Year's typically see a step change is a little bit stronger than maybe typical seasonality? Any kind of comments about how the typical Macao consumer is behaving since the quarter ended, given all these generally more encouraging than not trends thus far in October? Thank you.\nPatrick Dumont: Yes, Joe, I think we're not going to talk too much about the current quarter just because we have a policy of not doing that. But I think directionally, we're very pleased about the quality of people we have coming into our buildings, both in Macao and in Singapore. And I think that there's some real opportunities going forward as our new product comes online, and people continue to spend their buildings. And I think even with the disruption that you're seeing, you're finding that the consumer, high-frequent, high-value tourists is coming to our properties and recognizing that there's a great experience to be had there. Entertainment definitely plays a big part of that. Entertainment has been super important for us in both markets. And we continue to look to schedule entertainment and take advantage of entertainment as it occurs in the market, even if it's not scheduled by us.\nJoe Greff: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, thank you. Maybe turning to Marina Bay Sands. It's been hovering from an EBITDA standpoint around $450 million to $500 million for the past couple of quarters. Can you just remind us of the cadence of disruption, some of the work going on to add suites and how that might subside and then build into next year?\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. So just to give you a sense, during the quarter, we had about 1,600 rooms available versus about 2,800 rooms available last year. So there's pretty substantial disruption going on just from a room count standpoint. We also have some casino floor work going on, which is disruptive. We did just open up some additional salon capacity there. So I think by the end of September, we should have about 27 newly renovated salons. So there's just -- there's a lot of stuff happening. I think we did Tower 1, Tower 2. We did what we call our paiza area. We just introduced Sky Gaming, which is something that we've ever had before, which was actually granted us as part of the development agreement for IR2. We've redone some dining and updated some retail. I think the biggest disruption is really Tower 3 that's ongoing. And hopefully, by the end of the quarter, we'll add another 150 rooms. We'll see how that goes. But our biggest disruption right now is we have a, one of our casino floor areas is kind of mid-flight. And so that's disrupting a little bit the casino operation. But I would say that by middle of next year, hopefully, we're going to stop talking about disruption. I think my dream not talking about disruption at this point.\nRobert Goldstein: Yeah, I think by the country's point, by May of '25, both Londoner and Singapore pretty much are clear sailing. We're going to stop telling you that all the rooms are innovating, all disruption, all difficulties. It all comes to a head, and no more excuses. We'll start seeing I think some stellar results that will reflect the end of disruption in the beginning of making more money both in Singapore and Macao. I think Singapore is it's gone through a lot. It's amazing how it's done in spite of this, but Londoner having returned from that place. I can't wait to see a finished employee open, but the casino floor is very, very exciting work done.\nPatrick Dumont: I would like to just point out, if you look at our earnings deck, you can see some of the results for renovation on Page 40, Page 41. You can kind of see the quality of work there. I'd like to give a big shout out to our design team. We don't really produce anything like this in our company's history. Our customers are taking notice. You can see that by the high-quality customers we have coming in, the ADR that we have, the demand we have, the reviews we have for these rooms, the customer feedback very proud of what we've done in Marina Bay Sands. And if this is what we're able to do with this level of disruption, we're very excited about the future and the trajectory of the business. It's really amazing how strong the market is, how quality of tourists is coming into Singapore and the fact that they are really interested in coming to Marina Bay Sands. And so I think the investment has been very positive, and we're very happy about it. But unfortunately we're still talking about disruption.\nStephen Grambling: And maybe as a follow-up, just on Marina Bay Sands, realizing that you put out the number, the updated numbers in terms of capital spend on IR2. I guess, has the scope changed at all? Are there any updated thoughts on how you think about the returns on that project potentially versus other projects, realizing that you'll probably get into this both later this year and next?\nRobert Goldstein: Well, obviously, the biggest change that you may be aware of is that there's a full casino amenities that's built. No longer just a hotel supporting IR1. And, so that's obviously, the biggest change is that. And I think you'll see it from the design there, it is laser focus on the premium mass segment. We believe this is a market that has grown to what $6.5 billion of GGR probably in '24. We believe we can easily get to $11 billion by quarter end. So this project reflects a lot of capital being directed at a very, very strong customer segment and a unique asset. It's a unique market that is stellar and it's unique. There's barriers to entry. There's a proven market. We'll guess who the customer is. We've been there for 14 years. So we feel very, very confident that these results are going to be terrific by we've told you before we expect IR1 to get to 2.5 billion and we believe this new building can make, in excess of $1 billion on top of that. So we're very confident that we've built the right thing in the market and its unique, location destination to our business. Like, you have a tested market, you know the competition, you know the government, you know the infrastructure, barriers to entry. So the biggest single change, obviously, is a full blown casino as opposed to just a hotel.\nStephen Grambling: Makes sense. That's it for me. Look forward to seeing it in November. See you.\nOperator: Up next, we have Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. Last week, investors heard a bit about some pressure on luxury spend from the Chinese consumer. I wonder if you could talk about what you might be seeing there and how much do you think how much overlap is that with, you know, your premium mass consumer?\nRobert Goldstein: Robin, let me just talk about that for a second. I think we're I think everyone should be impressed the resilience of Macao. We all know what's happening in China and the very confidence will return to a stronger place in the near future. But the fact is Macao is performing showing growth and strong growth, I think, despite the economic environment there. Hopefully, we'll see more, insight to the government's perspective on the economy in the near future. But unlike retailers, you're right, has struggled and we struggled as well with our top end retail, retail in general in Asia, there's no disputing until the LVMH numbers, [indiscernible] numbers, caring numbers. But it has not been a similar path for gaming in Macao. Macao is showing growth, double-digit growth in the quarter. It's very -- it's very exciting if this continues. I think it will. I think we'll exceed $30 billion plus next year. We're waiting for the day when the base mass determines. And so our current assets speak very well to the, I mean, the Londoner completion and the Venetian will be talking to each other. I think, creates two most impressive assets in the market by far making billions of dollars in the future for us. But the real kicker comes when the basement does return because, as you know, our assets are built for scale and built for, you know, huge throughput. So but even when that happens, the world turns very, very sunny for us. But in the interim, unlike retail, unlike other consumer spending, businesses, Macao is proving very resilient and very powerful, and we're grateful for it. And you saw the numbers coming out of the market numbers for October, looked awfully good for the industry where we saw the first weeks of October. So it's a very positive story relative to other businesses operating in China.\nRobin Farley: Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And maybe just one quick follow-up is, with some of the stimulus that was announced a few weeks ago, did that change your expectation for timing of recovery in the base mass? Or in other words, where should investors maybe look to see that show up if you, in fact, if you think, you know, it will show up? Thanks.\nRobert Goldstein: I think it's I was in Beijing two weeks ago. I think it, first of all, it was very well received by everyone to see the government stepping in. It is wonderful and hopefully continues. But I think it's too early to predict where and when and how and how quickly. Again, I think it was great to see is that before the stimulus, Macao continues to show strong growth. And with our product offering, they will participate in that. When this thing shows up, how it impacts the customer, we hope it would be sooner or later. It will be all segments, but I think time will tell. We have I don't think we have any insights. Grant or Wilfred, do you feel differently about that?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Rob, I think the main point here, which you referenced just now is that Macao GGR remains very resilient before any of these stimulus measures have the chance to take impact. And I think that's very clear in the premium segments. And I think any economic tailwind we get as a market from the stimulus measures over time, obviously, will help the other segments, in particular, I think, base mass and retail, which are two very important segments for us. So overall, we should acknowledge this Macao GGR, Macao Gaming is a very big out performer in the whole consumer universe in the region right now. And that's powered by the premium segment, where we are extremely well placed with the great products that we bring online. But of course, as the economy gets better, as some of these measures have positive impact over time, we obviously expect the other segments, which are also important to us, will follow through and give us a further boost to what these assets can actually deliver into 2025 and beyond.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Okay.\nGrant Chum: I'll add a couple of points. The first thing is that the economic stimulus measures introduced by China are still unfolding, but the directional development is welcoming. We have confidence in the Chinese Mainland's economic future and we'll continue to invest in Macao's future. The second point is that in 2024, Macao has been rated by the Chinese tourists as the most desired destination out of the Chinese market. So we see that Macao will stand to benefit once economic activities return to normal.\nRobert Goldstein: Well said.\nRobin Farley: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is live.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to go back to IR2 to start. Thank you for the additional just numbers and disclosure there. Rob or whoever is right, obviously, an increase in the casino scope and capacity and what's always been a supply constrained market is pretty interesting. Any details that you can provide there in terms of how many positions or what form some of the gaming expansion may take? Or imagine if it's too early, when might we look forward to hearing some additional details like that?\nPatrick Dumont: We're going to publish the final details, over the next coming months, but the idea is that it has, casino gaming in the podium and Sky Gaming in the tower. Look, our goal with this tower is to make it something very different. This is going to be the most important gaming and hospitality building in the world. It's going to be the best hotel in the world. That's our goal. The best service, the best experience, the best F&B. Our goal is to create something that is really extraordinary and helps address the Singapore market, which we know quite well now, has been consuming some of our highest end products, over the last 14 years. And so we're very aware of the market segments that we're addressing. And so we feel like this is a project that will be very accretive to our overall portfolio and create substantial value to us in the long-term. What I can tell you is that it's a very robust program. So it will have, great food and beverage, great other amenities. It will have a public access component. It will have a Skypark, as you can see, its own version of the Skypark. It will have MySpace. So it's going to be a very important, globally significant asset, for tourism, but it's going to be very specific to a very high end segment that we're dealing with today, and so hence the investment.\nShaun Kelley: Great. Thanks, Patrick. And then as my follow-up, if I could just turn to Macao, obviously, it was encouraging to see a bit of the market wide recovery in visitation. And I was just wondering if somebody could provide a little bit more color on how sort of visitation played out through the quarter. I think as we look back, second quarter things were light and kind of little soft relative to kind of where we sit in 2019. Clearly, sequentially that improves. So just what was behavior like as things improved? And what were you seeing from sort of the customer patterns on the visitation front? Thank you.\nRobert Goldstein: Grant, do you want to take that?\nGrant Chum: No, I'll take that. Yes, thanks for the question, Shaun. Yes, as you rightly pointed out, visitation improved in terms of the recovery rate in third quarter as relative to second quarter. So we're up to about 93% recovery versus 2019 third quarter. And actually, August, the visitations exceeded 2019 levels. This quarter, it was primarily especially when you look at it on year-on-year basis, primarily driven by day trip visitor increase. And probably as a result of that, but probably I think as a general macro conditions didn't translate as much as you would have expected into the actual spending, especially in the base mass and the retail. So what we saw in the third quarter is actually continuation of the strength in the premium segments. We had better visitations, yes, but that didn't necessarily translate into the base mass business or help the retail business to any great extent. But it's encouraging to see the interest and desirability of consumers to come to Macao. Clearly, the Sheraton keys being 2,400 fewer rooms available versus the prior summer didn't help us, but also frankly didn't help the market as a whole because that's a very large amount of inventory to be out of the market. So overnight, as it is, that obviously hampered that segment. And overnight, visitors typically spend multiple times what day trippers spend. But like I think Wilfred mentioned, Macao remains very desirable as a tourist destination for the region. And I think it's encouraging to see that come through just in the volume of visitations for the quarter.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you, everyone.\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you, Shaun.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Shaun.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carlos Santarelli with Deutsche. Please proceed.\nCarlos Santarelli: Hey, guys. Basically, just one question, but maybe two parts to it. I don't know if Grant wants to take this, but just thinking about the cadence of rooms coming back online in Macao relative from where we are today, what the total room count will be acknowledging some regular rooms got compressed to suites come Golden Week of next year. And then kind of bucketing the rooms out of service and thinking about the impact they've had on a good slide that you guys have in your deck that kind of shows EBITDA share in 2019 of about 34% and that trending at roughly 30% kind of this year. How much of that 400 basis point delta do you think returns with the rooms coming back online?\nGrant Chum: Should I take it?\nRobert Goldstein: Yes, please.\nGrant Chum: Yes. I think on the construction and the delivery of the new rooms, I mean, first of all, I think the team has done a fantastic job in delivering the assets back the way they have by the end of September, where we opened a new casino, Londoner Grand Casino as well as the get licensed for 300 the first 300 suites in Londoner Grand. I think it's important to understand that in the fourth quarter, we actually go down further in the total number of keys available during the quarter versus third quarter because we will be losing the rest of the Sheraton rooms and we will be staying in terms of licensed new suites at this 300 number for pretty much the whole quarter. So we'll actually reduce further in terms of key count by about 600 to 700 rooms in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. So it's really only until January that we start to get a significant uplift in the critical mass of new suites and we hope to be above 1,000 new suites by January or at least by Chinese New Year in January. And then it just ramps up from there until May or middle of the second quarter to the full inventory of 2,400 keys. And by then, we'll be back up to over 10,600 keys or just on the 11,000 thereabouts by the second quarter. Obviously, the room inventory being out by so much does impact our EBITDA and EBITDA share. And to your question on the prospect for the EBITDA share recovery, I think, we're very confident that Londoner Grand and the whole Londoner Macao will deliver as we roll out the what is really, I think, top product at unprecedented scale. This Londoner Macao will be 4,400 suite hotel with about over 60% of the keys being suites. There's really no building like it in our industry in terms of that scale of quality and the offerings it has between the F&B, the arena inside of the actual building. So we're very positive about how this will help to drive our EBITDA and ultimately our share of EBITDA as it ramps up and 2025 unfolds and hopefully with some of these tailwinds that we just referenced earlier in the call. So, yes, we are very excited about how this asset will deliver for us. And to Rob's point, between Venetian and Londoner Macao, I think you've got two amazing assets that's really going to deliver for us, but also deliver for our customers.\nCarlos Santarelli: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nGrant Chum: Thanks, Carlos.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please proceed.\nBrandt Montour: Hey, good evening, afternoon everybody. So first question in Singapore, the ADR reported RevPAR, but ADR specifically of $900 was staggering. I'm just curious, I know there was a lot of rooms out, with sort of the trough. It seems like in terms of rooms out of service, when we look at that ADR, you know, I'm trying to figure out, was it is there compression happening in that ADR because there are rooms out or is that number sort of, illustrative of the quality and the sort of higher level product that, you know, that you're coming out with, for that asset?\nPatrick Dumont: The answer is yes. So, the first thing is you can see the pictures. Hopefully, you have a chance to actually see the rooms in person. The rooms are extraordinary. The design is fantastic. The service levels are incredible and we get that feedback from our customers. And so the ADR is a direct result of the market's view of the quality of the rooms after the renovation. And, hopefully, the entire building will be like that by the middle of next year. We're very proud about it. We've made a lot of strides. We've done a lot of work. The team there has been phenomenal. It's been our goal to make that the number one hotel, in Asia and the world. And so we've been working towards that. Been doing a lot of benchmarking work and trying to figure out how to get there, which is unusual for a property of this size. I think actually one of the things that will help grow that ADR further is when IR2 is open and we have an arena. That arena is going to be an incredibly powerful tourism driver for the overall complex. Having a 15,000 seat live performance venue with great technology, great viewing lines and a great experience is going to be very unique things. And so the ability to schedule that asset, to program it, will drive a lot of visitation, not only to Singapore, but to Marina Bay Sands and will help us drive ADR further. So we feel very strongly that this ADR is a reflection of some compression. Very fair. We took rooms out of our keys out of the building. But more importantly, it's really, something that points to the quality and the service levels of this, newly renovated building. And we think it will grow over time as more amenities are put in around it.\nRobert Goldstein: I think, to be fair to us, I don't think compression is that big a deal. In every market, there is extraordinary product people have said, gamers and non-gamers. This is that product. What's happening in Marina Bay Sands isn't just a compression. Sure, a few more or less rooms help you, but I believe demand is going to continue to soar once they experience the product. There's just nothing like it anywhere in terms of the room quality, the food and beverage product, any and all this hotel, the architecture, the public spaces. It's the place people want to stay. We have to get 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 keys, you can sell them all easily at price that will continue to grow. I think it's really a testament to the quality of product and the strong leisure demand and gamer demand in the market. And it's just going to get better and better because Singapore is that desirable. Infrastructure, government, accessibility, it's a very special place. So we built a building that's going to be, for many years ahead, the most desirable place for everyone to stay at. So rates should again, just go up and up. And gaming capacity will, you know, obviously grow more gaming demand, but it's a very different place than anything else in Singapore.\nBrandt Montour: Okay. Thank you for that. That's helpful. And then a question on Macao, on the arena. You know, we don't talk about the arena as much as we hear about the casino floor and the Londoner suites. And I wanted to hear, you know, your level of excitement about that, arena renovation. And specifically, you know, when we think about '25, is there a calendar associated with that where we would expect periods where you can look out now and say, okay. Well, this quarter this quarter has, you know, a great slate of events and where it will be a needle mover or if there's a lag associated with sort of getting it, you know, up to the place that you'd want it to be?\nPatrick Dumont: So the great thing about entertainment in Macao is that it's a very important part of our premium mass business. And we use it and we have used it successfully to drive premium mass visitation. And we have programs that help sort of leverage that asset. It's been very successful for us all over Asia in terms of scheduling live entertainment. But, you know, the venue there is really an incredible one. Great visionary move by Sheldon early on to build that arena. And, you know, the updating is going to make it, more powerful. And so I think we're very excited about the types of programs that we can run using it. And there will be a schedule and it will be within our control, and it will allow us to create more visitation and better spend at the Venetian and the rest of the property portfolio. But Grant or Wilfred, I don't know if you have any additional comments you'd like to add?\nGrant Chum: Yes, I think, we have referenced it in the deck, but we are progressing very well on the construction, the upgrade for the Venetian arena. And it will relaunch actually towards the end of November into December. And we already have the first events lined up in terms of entertainment, but also sports. So that would get start getting some traction actually even at the end of this year. But we also should note like Patrick referenced on the entertainment offer in general, with the Londoner arena, with the 6,000 seat Londoner arena, we have been programming very actively even during the downtime of the Venetian arena or especially, I should say. And we did around 17 shows in the Londoner arena during third quarter and many of these shows actually did help us in driving the traffic and the spend. So we're very excited to have the Venetian Arena fully upgraded. I think it's going to be great for entertainment, sports, MICE, events. So it's really serving multiple segments and boosting the diversification drive in Macao. I think with the great setup there with the VIP boxes, with the backstage, the locker rooms and obviously the state-of-the-art technology, I think is going to be basically like a new arena launching. So we are very excited about that. But another point to know is we will be programming both arenas and sometimes there will be shows concurrently in both venues on both sides of the Strip. So we're excited to see how that could help our business too. So, yes, you will continuously see us showcasing new events in the calendar. There's already three events selling tickets now towards the end of the quarter and we are looking forward to do some announcements on some more major events before the end of the year as well.\nBrandt Montour: Great. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nDaniel Politzer: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. First question on Singapore on IR2. Can you talk us a bit about the regulatory landscape and outlook? Remind us maybe in terms of when the licensing goes through as it currently stands? And I assume you expect this to remain a duopoly market or maybe even better, but is there any expectation for how you think about gaming tax rates as you underwrite the returns on this building?\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. So I think for us, the way we model this is that we have a, we basically have a moratorium on the changes in gaming tax, until the early 2030s. And I think for us, I think, you know, we view this investment as a very long-term thing and we'd like to believe that we'll continue to add value to Singapore and that we'll continue to be a good partner to the government and accomplish the goals in tourism that are necessary. So I think from that standpoint, we feel like it's a very stable operating environment. It's a wonderful place to deploy capital. It has been a wonderful place to deploy capital. We feel, as Rob referenced earlier, that there's a stability there and, you know, a very strong trajectory forward for us. So I think as we look at underwriting this, it's a very long dated investment, right? It doesn't open for six years, hopefully sooner, but we'll see. And that's obviously pending government approval, along with, you know, the final pros that we need to begin by the summer of next year. But we think about this as a very long-term thing, and we feel very excited about what we can build there. The gaming is a nice add, but there's also a lot of things that are going to drive tourism that would be very beneficial to us as well, like the arena, like the hospitality, like the food and beverage to enhance the overall appeal of the entire complex. So I think for us, look at this in a very long term way, we feel like there's very high barriers to entry there. I think right now, it seems like the feeling is that we're, it's a duopoly market for the foreseeable future, and we certainly hope it stays that way. But from our standpoint, we look forward to the opportunity to invest in scale, and that's what we're doing.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it. And then just turning to Macao, the promotions obviously came down quarter-over-quarter. I mean, as we think about getting back to those mid to high 30% type margins in Macao, is this really a function of recapturing shares, seeing more of the visitation come back or at least kind of gaming oriented visitation? Or is this really kind of you need the market to grow to get back to those levels?\nPatrick Dumont: Well, I think the first thing is, for us to get to high, you know, to get to the high 30s, low 40s margin, we need revenue growth, and we need all the segments to return. You know, right now, some of our segments have not returned, particularly the base mass segment, to where they were pre-pandemic, and we are built for that. Our investment is one for scale. We have the ability to service the premium mass segment very well. The Londoner is an incredible product. The rest of our portfolio has incredible products as well. But if you look at the scale and the amenities that we have, everything from food and beverage to the bus terminals to the grand entryways to the theming, we're very much able to accommodate leisure tourists. And so for us, you know, that missing visitation, if you will, from 2019 and also, you know, the lack of the base mass play is impactful to us. So the way, the way we would get to the higher margins is through revenue growth. That being said, I have to hand it to the team there. They've been wonderful in terms of cost discipline and being disciplined in the way that they spend money to ensure that we maintain our margins up against the current revenue that we have. But I think as we look forward, our investments will ultimately drive, higher value visitation, in the long run. And we firmly believe that. We see that historically and we've experienced it in other markets and in this market, particularly when we do high value renovations. So I think for us, you know, as visitation continues to improve, hopefully, as the base mass market continues to improve and as we continue to get our premium mass segment assets back online, you'll start to see a normalization of revenue and then a normalization of margins. Grant, do you have any additional comments?\nGrant Chum: I think you covered it hopefully. Thanks.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it. Thanks so much.\nDaniel Briggs: Thanks, Dan. Operator, do we have any additional questions?\nOperator: Yes. The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please proceed.\nChad Beynon: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You've been asked a lot about Macao, but I'm going to add one more to the stack here. So, obviously you and the other concessionaires went through the whole retendering process two years ago and we've gone through the checklist of items including your industry leading employment and other items. But with the new Chief Executive coming into his position in Macao, and I believe a month or so, is there anything that we should expect in terms of market focus, concessionaire focus or is it kind of business as usual as they transition through that? Thanks.\nRobert Goldstein: Let me say we're always very focused on making sure we're doing our job with the government and adhering to the things we were asked to do. I don't believe that new Chief Executive will change that, but we will stay focused and listen very carefully to make sure doing our part. We always do that historically in Macao. And we've always been, I think, a leading company as far as investing in Macao and hearing Macao's principle. But I don't expect to see radical change at all. I think it's going to be business as usual for the most part. Wilfred, do you have an opinion on that?\nWilfred Wong: Yes. I think the concession commitment maps out a long term development focus. So all six of us have thought very carefully and comprehensively what we want to do under the guidance of the Macao SAR Government. And I think the change of at the top will not have material changes to the directional change, because what has been emphasized so far is that Macao really aims to diversify. We should invest in non-gaming. I think these directions will remain. We just feel that as Rob pointed out that as long as we conduct our business as usual and listen very carefully to what the government has to say depending on what happens in the next few years, we should be able to continue to operate favorably in Macao.\nChad Beynon: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then separately one of your global competitors was recently granted a license in the Middle East. They presented some pretty favorable investment returns to investors in the past couple of weeks. They also mentioned that they expect competition in that region from others. So is this a region that you continue to study or are there reasons why this would be a pencils down, investment opportunity as you think about it? Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: I think we're always looking at new investment opportunities, for Las Vegas Sands. I think it's a market that we'll continue to study and look at and we'll see how it goes.\nChad Beynon: Okay. Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vitaly Umansky with Seaport. Please proceed.\nVitaly Umansky: Hey, guys. How's it going? Look I think I have two questions. First one for Patrick. When we look at Sands China and kind of cash flows coming in, how are you guys thinking about distribution of that cash going forward? Obviously, there this future CapEx requirements under the retendering process. There's other expenditures that need to take place, but there's also an intercompany note that's still outstanding between LVS and Sands China. There's also I think investors looking at Sands China and thinking about can China can Sands China get back to being a higher dividend paying stock, the way it used to be in the past. So maybe for Sands China, how are you thinking about capital outflows? And then I think for LVS as a whole, with the announcement and kind of the CapEx layout now for Marina Bay Sands, how are you thinking about number one financing for MBS Phase 2? And also what does that mean for return of capital to investors of LVS? And then maybe the second question is around --\nDaniel Briggs: Wait, that was one question.\nVitaly Umansky: Sorry, sorry, guys.\nDaniel Briggs: Keep going.\nPatrick Dumont: Keep going, Vital. You're good. Keep going.\nVitaly Umansky: Yeah, just a question around New York. What your current thinking and thought process is around the New York licensing process.\nPatrick Dumont: So, really appreciate the questions. A couple of thoughts. So first off, in terms of SCL, you know, I think SCL is performing incredibly well given the disruptions there and I think we'd like to believe that EBITDA will grow meaningfully over time, you know, as will our cash flow. And so, you know, in years past, part of the pandemic, SCL was very shareholder friendly in terms of dividends. And, as you can see that LVS is actually buying SCL stock, as we can in the market because we have a lot of conviction about the value of SCL equity as well as LVS equity as you can see by the buybacks at the LVS level as well. And I think as we think about SCL, we're very hopeful that it will be a dividend payer in the upcoming year. We think that that's a possibility and we'd like to believe that it's going to occur. But again, that's up to the board there. And I think the, in terms of the note, I'd like to believe that's also something that could be repaid to the parent level at some point and provide some additional, capital allocation flexibility for the parent co. And we'll see how that goes and be able to hopefully maybe buy some stock with it, if that's possible. So we'll see. But I think in the long term, we'd like to believe that SCL becomes a dividend payer again. We think that makes sense for the shareholders there. At the LVS level, we'd like to own more of it and you'll probably see us do a little bit more of that. But in the long run, we think there's going to be a very high quality return to capital program coming out of SCL assuming the trajectory of the business, given the investment we've made and our belief long-term in the market. I think at the LVS level, there's a couple of things that you've raised there. I think first and foremost, I think when we think about capital allocation, we think about growth. You know, our highest and best use of capital is new ground up development. So you see us doing that, both in Macao as part of some of our concessional renewal work as well as in Singapore along with this IR2 development that has just a panoply of great amenities, including which is going to be, what we believe, the best hotel in the world and an unbelievable arena. So, you know, we think these are great investments that will create a lot of growth and growth and cash flow for our company. So that leads to your next question, which is how do we finance this? And our goal is actually to follow what we've always said, which is, raise some cost efficient debt capital. It's one of the reasons why we like being investment grade name. It makes our cost of financing efficient for new growth developments and we'll look to do that. And, you know, if you think about the proportion of debt to equity, I think it's pretty consistent what we've talked about. You know, let's call it in the, you know, 35% context of equity, and the rest will be financed, given the debt capacity that we have at the MBS balance sheet. And the great news is that we've run a little leverage of level, full leverage level there with the anticipation of funding an IR2 development. And so now that's coming to be. So we're prepared for it and we look forward to the opportunity to work with our lenders to create that financing facility, to allow for it to be built. So I think as we move forward, you'll see, a delayed draw term loan at the MBS level to fund the construction with equity checks going in as well over time. Over the construction schedule, we actually have construction schedule will be provided. Again, it's kind of illustrative. It's something that is a rough estimate today, but designed to give people a sense of timing of cash flows. And that's actually on Page 46 of the deck if you want to get a sense of kind of what we're thinking. It may not exactly be this, but this is context, you know, from what we can understand and see today. And so our goal is to, in effect, create the flexibility to continue to invest in high growth opportunities, continue to pay a dividend and continue to repurchase shares at both levels. And, hopefully, we'll be able to do that, but that's our plan. And then I'll turn over to Rob for New York.\nRobert Goldstein: What was it, I'm sorry, it's a long, the question was on New York that was the issue itself?\nVitaly Umansky: Yeah, Rob, just kind of what the --\nRobert Goldstein: Yeah, New York, just refresh my memory.\nVitaly Umansky: The capital allocation.\nRobert Goldstein: Was the question on New York in what regard? I didn't hear the whole question. Are you there?\nVitaly Umansky: Rob, it's just about what the current, yes, from your end in terms of what the New York process is and where do you expect it to go from here because there's been delays.\nRobert Goldstein: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Got it. Yeah, so the thinking right now is that the license will be submitted sometime in I mean applications for licensure sometime in the spring of '25 with a decision. This morning, I was told probably the first quarter of '26, but they have to make a decision. We remain interested in the process. One fine, I've always been the biggest advocate for New York and other jurisdictions. The only concern I have these days is the ongoing strength of online gambling, which you can't ignore what's happening in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and Michigan. And I think it's for the markets. But, you know, we build capital intense business buildings that require long-term perspective. And I must admit that there's got to be some kind of way of thinking about how the online impact would be, not where you are in the US. It's just a concern and it's something I've been looking at closely. I'd love to be in New York with the right capital structure and the right licensure process. But that's the newest wrinkle, as far as the process, New York itself has really changed. They're still talking late '25, early '26 for decision. I just my personal thinking has been influenced somewhat by the last six months as I see the growth of online gambling. So there's some to think about as we move forward in any market where online gambling is possible. You know, I think sometime in next year or two, you're going to see online exceed land based revenues in New Jersey, which is pretty exceptional.\nVitaly Umansky: Rob, sorry, does that mean if New York, for instance, were to legalize online gaming that you would have to reevaluate what your proposal would be for New York?\nRobert Goldstein: It goes beyond that. My concern is we don't know what, you know, our buildings take a long time as you see that Singapore they take years to finish. I need some understanding of how the market any market thinks that online gambling anywhere you go. If you're going to spend, time, if Singapore legalize online gambling, you make a stop and think about IR2. If any market does legalize it to think, what does it mean to me in my capital investment? And I think that it's New York or Michigan or Florida any place that's online, it makes you stop and scratch your head. There's going to be some resolution of the issue. I'm not saying they'll tell you definitively, but you can't ignore that possibility when you see the impact of online in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan and probably the other four states are coming online. You can't ignore the, the impact on land based revenue.\nVitaly Umansky: Yes, that makes sense. Thanks for the update.\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. The next question comes from George Choi with Citigroup. George, your line is live.\nGeorge Choi: Thanks very much. So we were at the Londoner Grand a few weeks ago and noticed that the minimum bets at the baccarat tables there, were noticeably lower versus the Londoner Casino. I just wondered if that is temporary or does that signal any difference in market positioning between the two phases?\nRobert Goldstein: I think it signals you more rooms above that. I was there, I guess, 10 days ago or so. I think what you're going to see, George, over time is the Londoner like Venetian will become the most dominant players in the market. No questions asked about it. No change in marketing. Just need to complete the product, get the rooms done on top. There's a lot of people in the building, but you need to get the right premium mass customer to achieve the minimum bets you want to achieve. I stand by we've done this now for -- we show Londoner, I think, five, six, seven years that began with Sheldon, the Londoner process. It finally completes in the spring of '25. I remain completely steadfast to my belief that it's going to dominate that in Londoner and the Venetian will dominate the market. I have no concern whatsoever. And the minimum bets when you count them, you'd be very happy with them as getting rooms above the building above the casino. In any building in the world that is gambling, there's always a complete I mean having the rooms connected to the casino, having easy access is always an essential element of success. So Londoner while it's open, it's not going to achieve the same goals as Venetian or the Londoner one to have the rooms open.\nGeorge Choi: That's very good color. And as a follow-up, when the Londoner is fully open next year, how should we think about the EBITDA trajectory going forward at the neighboring properties, the Parisian Macao?\nRobert Goldstein: There was a question how it affects other businesses?\nGeorge Choi: Yeah. That's right.\nRobert Goldstein: Yeah, from my perspective and the team, and Grant may have a different take on. I've always said that I think Londoner and Venetian will be the one or two players or two and one players, each making $1 billion. My goal is $1 billion plus for each of those buildings and the rest of the portfolio will be, you know, another $1 billion plus. That's my goal for our company long term over the next few years. And but again as Patrick referenced and Grant and everybody in this call, we need to see return to more base mass gaming. You saw the differential between visitation and gaming. In the past, visitation was a complete predictor of gaming revenue. That broke rank [indiscernible]. We're seeing lots of visitation, but not the gaming to a company. And that's a negative. I mean, there's no hiding from the fact that it disappoints yet a bigger base mass tail. I have full faith that China will figure out its economy. It's too important to the world not to. And as China recovers and base mass recovers, that our company, SCL, LVS will be the biggest recipient of revenue, margin and growth in Macao. It's going to happen for sure. And as Sheldon used to say, day follows night, night follows day. China will get back to a better place. It will recover. The accountants will recover. Macao will continue to grow in the 30s and beyond. And someday, we'll get back to $3 billion plus EBITDA. And those two buildings will stand very, very tall. Does it negatively impact the Four Seasons? Not really. It's a stellar small product. The Parisian as well. I think we have a lot of confidence that in the aggregate, that portfolio is unique and they all speak to each other. We have the ability to market within the portfolio. So again as long as we get stronger, it doesn't mean others get weaker. It just means there's more strength in the market. But I would tell you that the real upside of this company will be the day when, yes, we'll do very well premium mass, but when that base mass recovers, that tail will drive us to a whole new level of opportunity. And that day is coming.\nGeorge Choi: That's very clear. Thank you very much.\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you. Enjoy your reports, George. The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Golden Week for a moment if I may. You know, I would say that, you know, we, the street collectively had a set of expectations going into Golden Week. And, you know, the result turned out to be, you know, quite a bit stronger than that. And for better or worse to where we get our information, how those expectations are set. I'm curious where yours were and, you know, whether Golden Week turned out to be materially better than, you know, what you were looking for and exactly what the drivers of that were please.\nRobert Goldstein: So as typical, you know, we'll talk about this in 92 days. We don't talk about current quarter, on the earnings call, but appreciate the question.\nDavid Katz: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Thanks for joining us today. The Macao market continues to grow. Total gaming revenue for the market grew 13% in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023. Mass gaming revenue grew 14% in the quarter compared to one year ago. We believe the Chinese economy will grow and flourish in the future. It remains steadfast that the Macao market will grow along with it. I believe that the Macao market gross gaming revenues will exceed $30 billion in 2025 and grow from there. The scale and quality of the assets we have built are second to none. We believe that our assets position us to grow faster than the market as growth expands beyond the premium customer segment. Our business strategy is predicated on investing in high-quality assets that also have scale. We've designed our capital investment programs to ensure that we will continue to be the market leader in the years ahead. We believe our approach will enable us to grow faster in the long-term, grow our share of EBITDA in the Macao market and generate industry-leading returns on invested capital. Turning to our results in Macao. We delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter despite material disruption at the Londoner, which peaked during the third quarter. We opened the Londoner Grand Casino in the last week of September. We also opened 300, the first 300 Londoner Grand suites. We will introduce more Londoner Grand suites throughout the next three quarters. The total 1,300 Londoner Grand suites and rooms in service by Lunar New Year 2025 with a full complement of 1,500 suites and 905 rooms in service by Golden Week 2025. SCL continues to lead the market in gaming and non-gaming revenue and in-market share of EBITDA. Our objective is to capture a high-value, high-margin tourism over the long-term. We have a unique competitive advantage in terms of scale, quality and diversity of product offerings. Upon completion of the second phase of the Londoner in 2025, our product and management more pronounced than ever. We delivered another strong quarter in Singapore despite poor hold percentage. The results in rate base stands reflect the positive impact of our capital investment program and the growth of high value tourism. The growing appeal of Singapore as a destination is enhanced by the robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendar. As we complete the balance of our investment programs in the first half of 2025, there will be considerable runway for growth. Thank you for joining us. Let me turn it over to Patrick before we go to Q&A. Yeah, I think by the country's point, by May of '25, both Londoner and Singapore pretty much are clear sailing. We're going to stop telling you that all the rooms are innovating, all disruption, all difficulties. It all comes to a head, and no more excuses. We'll start seeing I think some stellar results that will reflect the end of disruption in the beginning of making more money both in Singapore and Macao. I think Singapore is it's gone through a lot. It's amazing how it's done in spite of this, but Londoner having returned from that place. I can't wait to see a finished employee open, but the casino floor is very, very exciting work done. Well, obviously, the biggest change that you may be aware of is that there's a full casino amenities that's built. No longer just a hotel supporting IR1. And, so that's obviously, the biggest change is that. And I think you'll see it from the design there, it is laser focus on the premium mass segment. We believe this is a market that has grown to what $6.5 billion of GGR probably in '24. We believe we can easily get to $11 billion by quarter end. So this project reflects a lot of capital being directed at a very, very strong customer segment and a unique asset. It's a unique market that is stellar and it's unique. There's barriers to entry. There's a proven market. We'll guess who the customer is. We've been there for 14 years. So we feel very, very confident that these results are going to be terrific by we've told you before we expect IR1 to get to 2.5 billion and we believe this new building can make, in excess of $1 billion on top of that. So we're very confident that we've built the right thing in the market and its unique, location destination to our business. Like, you have a tested market, you know the competition, you know the government, you know the infrastructure, barriers to entry. So the biggest single change, obviously, is a full blown casino as opposed to just a hotel. Robin, let me just talk about that for a second. I think we're I think everyone should be impressed the resilience of Macao. We all know what's happening in China and the very confidence will return to a stronger place in the near future. But the fact is Macao is performing showing growth and strong growth, I think, despite the economic environment there. Hopefully, we'll see more, insight to the government's perspective on the economy in the near future. But unlike retailers, you're right, has struggled and we struggled as well with our top end retail, retail in general in Asia, there's no disputing until the LVMH numbers, [indiscernible] numbers, caring numbers. But it has not been a similar path for gaming in Macao. Macao is showing growth, double-digit growth in the quarter. It's very -- it's very exciting if this continues. I think it will. I think we'll exceed $30 billion plus next year. We're waiting for the day when the base mass determines. And so our current assets speak very well to the, I mean, the Londoner completion and the Venetian will be talking to each other. I think, creates two most impressive assets in the market by far making billions of dollars in the future for us. But the real kicker comes when the basement does return because, as you know, our assets are built for scale and built for, you know, huge throughput. So but even when that happens, the world turns very, very sunny for us. But in the interim, unlike retail, unlike other consumer spending, businesses, Macao is proving very resilient and very powerful, and we're grateful for it. And you saw the numbers coming out of the market numbers for October, looked awfully good for the industry where we saw the first weeks of October. So it's a very positive story relative to other businesses operating in China. I think it's I was in Beijing two weeks ago. I think it, first of all, it was very well received by everyone to see the government stepping in. It is wonderful and hopefully continues. But I think it's too early to predict where and when and how and how quickly. Again, I think it was great to see is that before the stimulus, Macao continues to show strong growth. And with our product offering, they will participate in that. When this thing shows up, how it impacts the customer, we hope it would be sooner or later. It will be all segments, but I think time will tell. We have I don't think we have any insights. Grant or Wilfred, do you feel differently about that? Well said. Grant, do you want to take that? Thank you, Shaun. Yes, please. I think, to be fair to us, I don't think compression is that big a deal. In every market, there is extraordinary product people have said, gamers and non-gamers. This is that product. What's happening in Marina Bay Sands isn't just a compression. Sure, a few more or less rooms help you, but I believe demand is going to continue to soar once they experience the product. There's just nothing like it anywhere in terms of the room quality, the food and beverage product, any and all this hotel, the architecture, the public spaces. It's the place people want to stay. We have to get 2,000, 3,000, 5,000 keys, you can sell them all easily at price that will continue to grow. I think it's really a testament to the quality of product and the strong leisure demand and gamer demand in the market. And it's just going to get better and better because Singapore is that desirable. Infrastructure, government, accessibility, it's a very special place. So we built a building that's going to be, for many years ahead, the most desirable place for everyone to stay at. So rates should again, just go up and up. And gaming capacity will, you know, obviously grow more gaming demand, but it's a very different place than anything else in Singapore. Let me say we're always very focused on making sure we're doing our job with the government and adhering to the things we were asked to do. I don't believe that new Chief Executive will change that, but we will stay focused and listen very carefully to make sure doing our part. We always do that historically in Macao. And we've always been, I think, a leading company as far as investing in Macao and hearing Macao's principle. But I don't expect to see radical change at all. I think it's going to be business as usual for the most part. Wilfred, do you have an opinion on that? What was it, I'm sorry, it's a long, the question was on New York that was the issue itself? Yeah, New York, just refresh my memory. Was the question on New York in what regard? I didn't hear the whole question. Are you there? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Got it. Yeah, so the thinking right now is that the license will be submitted sometime in I mean applications for licensure sometime in the spring of '25 with a decision. This morning, I was told probably the first quarter of '26, but they have to make a decision. We remain interested in the process. One fine, I've always been the biggest advocate for New York and other jurisdictions. The only concern I have these days is the ongoing strength of online gambling, which you can't ignore what's happening in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and Michigan. And I think it's for the markets. But, you know, we build capital intense business buildings that require long-term perspective. And I must admit that there's got to be some kind of way of thinking about how the online impact would be, not where you are in the US. It's just a concern and it's something I've been looking at closely. I'd love to be in New York with the right capital structure and the right licensure process. But that's the newest wrinkle, as far as the process, New York itself has really changed. They're still talking late '25, early '26 for decision. I just my personal thinking has been influenced somewhat by the last six months as I see the growth of online gambling. So there's some to think about as we move forward in any market where online gambling is possible. You know, I think sometime in next year or two, you're going to see online exceed land based revenues in New Jersey, which is pretty exceptional. It goes beyond that. My concern is we don't know what, you know, our buildings take a long time as you see that Singapore they take years to finish. I need some understanding of how the market any market thinks that online gambling anywhere you go. If you're going to spend, time, if Singapore legalize online gambling, you make a stop and think about IR2. If any market does legalize it to think, what does it mean to me in my capital investment? And I think that it's New York or Michigan or Florida any place that's online, it makes you stop and scratch your head. There's going to be some resolution of the issue. I'm not saying they'll tell you definitively, but you can't ignore that possibility when you see the impact of online in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan and probably the other four states are coming online. You can't ignore the, the impact on land based revenue. Thank you. I think it signals you more rooms above that. I was there, I guess, 10 days ago or so. I think what you're going to see, George, over time is the Londoner like Venetian will become the most dominant players in the market. No questions asked about it. No change in marketing. Just need to complete the product, get the rooms done on top. There's a lot of people in the building, but you need to get the right premium mass customer to achieve the minimum bets you want to achieve. I stand by we've done this now for -- we show Londoner, I think, five, six, seven years that began with Sheldon, the Londoner process. It finally completes in the spring of '25. I remain completely steadfast to my belief that it's going to dominate that in Londoner and the Venetian will dominate the market. I have no concern whatsoever. And the minimum bets when you count them, you'd be very happy with them as getting rooms above the building above the casino. In any building in the world that is gambling, there's always a complete I mean having the rooms connected to the casino, having easy access is always an essential element of success. So Londoner while it's open, it's not going to achieve the same goals as Venetian or the Londoner one to have the rooms open. There was a question how it affects other businesses? Yeah, from my perspective and the team, and Grant may have a different take on. I've always said that I think Londoner and Venetian will be the one or two players or two and one players, each making $1 billion. My goal is $1 billion plus for each of those buildings and the rest of the portfolio will be, you know, another $1 billion plus. That's my goal for our company long term over the next few years. And but again as Patrick referenced and Grant and everybody in this call, we need to see return to more base mass gaming. You saw the differential between visitation and gaming. In the past, visitation was a complete predictor of gaming revenue. That broke rank [indiscernible]. We're seeing lots of visitation, but not the gaming to a company. And that's a negative. I mean, there's no hiding from the fact that it disappoints yet a bigger base mass tail. I have full faith that China will figure out its economy. It's too important to the world not to. And as China recovers and base mass recovers, that our company, SCL, LVS will be the biggest recipient of revenue, margin and growth in Macao. It's going to happen for sure. And as Sheldon used to say, day follows night, night follows day. China will get back to a better place. It will recover. The accountants will recover. Macao will continue to grow in the 30s and beyond. And someday, we'll get back to $3 billion plus EBITDA. And those two buildings will stand very, very tall. Does it negatively impact the Four Seasons? Not really. It's a stellar small product. The Parisian as well. I think we have a lot of confidence that in the aggregate, that portfolio is unique and they all speak to each other. We have the ability to market within the portfolio. So again as long as we get stronger, it doesn't mean others get weaker. It just means there's more strength in the market. But I would tell you that the real upside of this company will be the day when, yes, we'll do very well premium mass, but when that base mass recovers, that tail will drive us to a whole new level of opportunity. And that day is coming. Thank you. Enjoy your reports, George. The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed. So as typical, you know, we'll talk about this in 92 days. We don't talk about current quarter, on the earnings call, but appreciate the question."

            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Macao EBITDA was $585 million. If we had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been higher by $2 million. When adjusted for lower-than-expected hold in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin from Macao portfolio of properties, excluding the Londoner, would have been 35.1% or down 110 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our margins at the Londoner were directly impacted by disruption of the Londoner Grand renovation. We closed the casino and had around 2,500 keys out of inventory during the quarter. Margin at the Venetian was 38.6% and we expect margin improvement as the Venetian Cotai Arena comes back online in November and as visitation to the market and grows in unrated play both increase in the future. Margin at the Plaza and Four Seasons was 39.7% for the quarter. As Rob mentioned, we continue to progress our Londoner Grand renovation program. As these products come online, our competitive position will be stronger than ever. We expect meaningful EBITDA growth and margin expansion in the future. Turning to Singapore. MBS' EBITDA came in at $406 million. Assuming expected hold on our rolling play, our EBITDA would have been approximately $78 million higher. The strong financial results reflect the impact of high-quality tourism investment and market-leading product and growth in high-value tourism overall. Had we held as expected in our Rolling Play segment, MBS EBITDA margin would have been 47.5%, 40 basis points higher than that of the third quarter of 2023. While we have made substantial progress on our $1.75 billion refurbishment program in MBS, we are still in the initial stages of realizing the benefits of these products, including from our tower gaming offering, which opened in September. The next phase of our capital investment program at Marina Bay Sands is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of 2025. This will support further growth in 2025 and beyond. Also, please note on Page 44 of our earnings presentation, we have provided estimated costs for our Marina Bay Sands IR2 project. We couldn't be more enthusiastic about investing in the long-term growth of high-value leisure and business tourism in Singapore. The original concept was in effect an expansion of Marina Bay Sands, including Arena. Our new program creates a full-scale integrated resort development with a full suite of amenities, including gaming capacity. We look forward to discussing that long-term growth driver in the Q&A session. Turning our program to return capital to shareholders. We repurchased $450 million of LVS stock during the quarter and our Board increased our repurchase authorization to $2 billion for future repurchases. We paid our recurring quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share in the quarter. In addition, our Board increased our annual dividend to $1 per share or $0.25 per quarter for the 2025 calendar year. We really look forward to continue to utilize the company's capital return program to increase returns to shareholders in the future. Thanks again for joining the call today. Now let's take some questions. So, Joe, it's a great question. And I think it's something we've been focused on for a long time. If you realize what happened in the quarter and the quarter before and actually in the first quarter, we've been impacted by disruption. And so we haven't really been able to manage our business with all of our capabilities. And so what we've been doing now is as things have been coming online and we've been focusing on managing the business for the future, we've been looking to become more efficient. So we'll look to improve our margins from managing the business more closely. And what you're seeing is a direct result of that. I think 1 thing that did impact our margins this quarter and they would have looked better was the fact that we took so many rooms out of inventory. So the majority of our, let's call it, our margin change and decline was related to the fact that that's a very high-margin business, and we still didn't have it because the rooms weren't there. So I think what you're seeing is the beginning of the cost discipline and the pricing power because of the assets we've invested in slowly coming into place. So I think it's a good signal for the future in the way that we're going to manage the business with discipline. I would like to turn it over to Grant for any additional comments. Yes, Joe, I think we're not going to talk too much about the current quarter just because we have a policy of not doing that. But I think directionally, we're very pleased about the quality of people we have coming into our buildings, both in Macao and in Singapore. And I think that there's some real opportunities going forward as our new product comes online, and people continue to spend their buildings. And I think even with the disruption that you're seeing, you're finding that the consumer, high-frequent, high-value tourists is coming to our properties and recognizing that there's a great experience to be had there. Entertainment definitely plays a big part of that. Entertainment has been super important for us in both markets. And we continue to look to schedule entertainment and take advantage of entertainment as it occurs in the market, even if it's not scheduled by us. Sure. So just to give you a sense, during the quarter, we had about 1,600 rooms available versus about 2,800 rooms available last year. So there's pretty substantial disruption going on just from a room count standpoint. We also have some casino floor work going on, which is disruptive. We did just open up some additional salon capacity there. So I think by the end of September, we should have about 27 newly renovated salons. So there's just -- there's a lot of stuff happening. I think we did Tower 1, Tower 2. We did what we call our paiza area. We just introduced Sky Gaming, which is something that we've ever had before, which was actually granted us as part of the development agreement for IR2. We've redone some dining and updated some retail. I think the biggest disruption is really Tower 3 that's ongoing. And hopefully, by the end of the quarter, we'll add another 150 rooms. We'll see how that goes. But our biggest disruption right now is we have a, one of our casino floor areas is kind of mid-flight. And so that's disrupting a little bit the casino operation. But I would say that by middle of next year, hopefully, we're going to stop talking about disruption. I think my dream not talking about disruption at this point. I would like to just point out, if you look at our earnings deck, you can see some of the results for renovation on Page 40, Page 41. You can kind of see the quality of work there. I'd like to give a big shout out to our design team. We don't really produce anything like this in our company's history. Our customers are taking notice. You can see that by the high-quality customers we have coming in, the ADR that we have, the demand we have, the reviews we have for these rooms, the customer feedback very proud of what we've done in Marina Bay Sands. And if this is what we're able to do with this level of disruption, we're very excited about the future and the trajectory of the business. It's really amazing how strong the market is, how quality of tourists is coming into Singapore and the fact that they are really interested in coming to Marina Bay Sands. And so I think the investment has been very positive, and we're very happy about it. But unfortunately we're still talking about disruption. We're going to publish the final details, over the next coming months, but the idea is that it has, casino gaming in the podium and Sky Gaming in the tower. Look, our goal with this tower is to make it something very different. This is going to be the most important gaming and hospitality building in the world. It's going to be the best hotel in the world. That's our goal. The best service, the best experience, the best F&B. Our goal is to create something that is really extraordinary and helps address the Singapore market, which we know quite well now, has been consuming some of our highest end products, over the last 14 years. And so we're very aware of the market segments that we're addressing. And so we feel like this is a project that will be very accretive to our overall portfolio and create substantial value to us in the long-term. What I can tell you is that it's a very robust program. So it will have, great food and beverage, great other amenities. It will have a public access component. It will have a Skypark, as you can see, its own version of the Skypark. It will have MySpace. So it's going to be a very important, globally significant asset, for tourism, but it's going to be very specific to a very high end segment that we're dealing with today, and so hence the investment. Thanks, Shaun. The answer is yes. So, the first thing is you can see the pictures. Hopefully, you have a chance to actually see the rooms in person. The rooms are extraordinary. The design is fantastic. The service levels are incredible and we get that feedback from our customers. And so the ADR is a direct result of the market's view of the quality of the rooms after the renovation. And, hopefully, the entire building will be like that by the middle of next year. We're very proud about it. We've made a lot of strides. We've done a lot of work. The team there has been phenomenal. It's been our goal to make that the number one hotel, in Asia and the world. And so we've been working towards that. Been doing a lot of benchmarking work and trying to figure out how to get there, which is unusual for a property of this size. I think actually one of the things that will help grow that ADR further is when IR2 is open and we have an arena. That arena is going to be an incredibly powerful tourism driver for the overall complex. Having a 15,000 seat live performance venue with great technology, great viewing lines and a great experience is going to be very unique things. And so the ability to schedule that asset, to program it, will drive a lot of visitation, not only to Singapore, but to Marina Bay Sands and will help us drive ADR further. So we feel very strongly that this ADR is a reflection of some compression. Very fair. We took rooms out of our keys out of the building. But more importantly, it's really, something that points to the quality and the service levels of this, newly renovated building. And we think it will grow over time as more amenities are put in around it. So the great thing about entertainment in Macao is that it's a very important part of our premium mass business. And we use it and we have used it successfully to drive premium mass visitation. And we have programs that help sort of leverage that asset. It's been very successful for us all over Asia in terms of scheduling live entertainment. But, you know, the venue there is really an incredible one. Great visionary move by Sheldon early on to build that arena. And, you know, the updating is going to make it, more powerful. And so I think we're very excited about the types of programs that we can run using it. And there will be a schedule and it will be within our control, and it will allow us to create more visitation and better spend at the Venetian and the rest of the property portfolio. But Grant or Wilfred, I don't know if you have any additional comments you'd like to add? Yeah. So I think for us, the way we model this is that we have a, we basically have a moratorium on the changes in gaming tax, until the early 2030s. And I think for us, I think, you know, we view this investment as a very long-term thing and we'd like to believe that we'll continue to add value to Singapore and that we'll continue to be a good partner to the government and accomplish the goals in tourism that are necessary. So I think from that standpoint, we feel like it's a very stable operating environment. It's a wonderful place to deploy capital. It has been a wonderful place to deploy capital. We feel, as Rob referenced earlier, that there's a stability there and, you know, a very strong trajectory forward for us. So I think as we look at underwriting this, it's a very long dated investment, right? It doesn't open for six years, hopefully sooner, but we'll see. And that's obviously pending government approval, along with, you know, the final pros that we need to begin by the summer of next year. But we think about this as a very long-term thing, and we feel very excited about what we can build there. The gaming is a nice add, but there's also a lot of things that are going to drive tourism that would be very beneficial to us as well, like the arena, like the hospitality, like the food and beverage to enhance the overall appeal of the entire complex. So I think for us, look at this in a very long term way, we feel like there's very high barriers to entry there. I think right now, it seems like the feeling is that we're, it's a duopoly market for the foreseeable future, and we certainly hope it stays that way. But from our standpoint, we look forward to the opportunity to invest in scale, and that's what we're doing. Well, I think the first thing is, for us to get to high, you know, to get to the high 30s, low 40s margin, we need revenue growth, and we need all the segments to return. You know, right now, some of our segments have not returned, particularly the base mass segment, to where they were pre-pandemic, and we are built for that. Our investment is one for scale. We have the ability to service the premium mass segment very well. The Londoner is an incredible product. The rest of our portfolio has incredible products as well. But if you look at the scale and the amenities that we have, everything from food and beverage to the bus terminals to the grand entryways to the theming, we're very much able to accommodate leisure tourists. And so for us, you know, that missing visitation, if you will, from 2019 and also, you know, the lack of the base mass play is impactful to us. So the way, the way we would get to the higher margins is through revenue growth. That being said, I have to hand it to the team there. They've been wonderful in terms of cost discipline and being disciplined in the way that they spend money to ensure that we maintain our margins up against the current revenue that we have. But I think as we look forward, our investments will ultimately drive, higher value visitation, in the long run. And we firmly believe that. We see that historically and we've experienced it in other markets and in this market, particularly when we do high value renovations. So I think for us, you know, as visitation continues to improve, hopefully, as the base mass market continues to improve and as we continue to get our premium mass segment assets back online, you'll start to see a normalization of revenue and then a normalization of margins. Grant, do you have any additional comments? I think we're always looking at new investment opportunities, for Las Vegas Sands. I think it's a market that we'll continue to study and look at and we'll see how it goes. Keep going, Vital. You're good. Keep going. So, really appreciate the questions. A couple of thoughts. So first off, in terms of SCL, you know, I think SCL is performing incredibly well given the disruptions there and I think we'd like to believe that EBITDA will grow meaningfully over time, you know, as will our cash flow. And so, you know, in years past, part of the pandemic, SCL was very shareholder friendly in terms of dividends. And, as you can see that LVS is actually buying SCL stock, as we can in the market because we have a lot of conviction about the value of SCL equity as well as LVS equity as you can see by the buybacks at the LVS level as well. And I think as we think about SCL, we're very hopeful that it will be a dividend payer in the upcoming year. We think that that's a possibility and we'd like to believe that it's going to occur. But again, that's up to the board there. And I think the, in terms of the note, I'd like to believe that's also something that could be repaid to the parent level at some point and provide some additional, capital allocation flexibility for the parent co. And we'll see how that goes and be able to hopefully maybe buy some stock with it, if that's possible. So we'll see. But I think in the long term, we'd like to believe that SCL becomes a dividend payer again. We think that makes sense for the shareholders there. At the LVS level, we'd like to own more of it and you'll probably see us do a little bit more of that. But in the long run, we think there's going to be a very high quality return to capital program coming out of SCL assuming the trajectory of the business, given the investment we've made and our belief long-term in the market. I think at the LVS level, there's a couple of things that you've raised there. I think first and foremost, I think when we think about capital allocation, we think about growth. You know, our highest and best use of capital is new ground up development. So you see us doing that, both in Macao as part of some of our concessional renewal work as well as in Singapore along with this IR2 development that has just a panoply of great amenities, including which is going to be, what we believe, the best hotel in the world and an unbelievable arena. So, you know, we think these are great investments that will create a lot of growth and growth and cash flow for our company. So that leads to your next question, which is how do we finance this? And our goal is actually to follow what we've always said, which is, raise some cost efficient debt capital. It's one of the reasons why we like being investment grade name. It makes our cost of financing efficient for new growth developments and we'll look to do that. And, you know, if you think about the proportion of debt to equity, I think it's pretty consistent what we've talked about. You know, let's call it in the, you know, 35% context of equity, and the rest will be financed, given the debt capacity that we have at the MBS balance sheet. And the great news is that we've run a little leverage of level, full leverage level there with the anticipation of funding an IR2 development. And so now that's coming to be. So we're prepared for it and we look forward to the opportunity to work with our lenders to create that financing facility, to allow for it to be built. So I think as we move forward, you'll see, a delayed draw term loan at the MBS level to fund the construction with equity checks going in as well over time. Over the construction schedule, we actually have construction schedule will be provided. Again, it's kind of illustrative. It's something that is a rough estimate today, but designed to give people a sense of timing of cash flows. And that's actually on Page 46 of the deck if you want to get a sense of kind of what we're thinking. It may not exactly be this, but this is context, you know, from what we can understand and see today. And so our goal is to, in effect, create the flexibility to continue to invest in high growth opportunities, continue to pay a dividend and continue to repurchase shares at both levels. And, hopefully, we'll be able to do that, but that's our plan. And then I'll turn over to Rob for New York."

            "content": "Yes. I think the concession commitment maps out a long term development focus. So all six of us have thought very carefully and comprehensively what we want to do under the guidance of the Macao SAR Government. And I think the change of at the top will not have material changes to the directional change, because what has been emphasized so far is that Macao really aims to diversify. We should invest in non-gaming. I think these directions will remain. We just feel that as Rob pointed out that as long as we conduct our business as usual and listen very carefully to what the government has to say depending on what happens in the next few years, we should be able to continue to operate favorably in Macao."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Patrick. I think, Joe, it's more that last quarter, I think, we mentioned that as we were preparing for the full closure of the old Pacifico Casino. We did deploy some tactical measures to manage the transition of customers to the other properties. And we did that very carefully during second quarter. But for the third quarter, we're really back to our core strategy, which is we compete on the basis of our products and the content that we bring despite the fact that, obviously, third quarter, our disruption actually increased, like Patrick referenced, with many more rooms out of inventory. But we stick to our core strategy and we had a very strong quarter in how we managed customer reinvestments and still maintain market share relative to the second quarter despite rising disruption during the quarter. And despite the fact that the base mass did not recover as strongly as the summer months normally would indicate. So overall, it was a very strong margin performance. And obviously, we're very pleased that we managed to actually grow EBITDA sequentially despite the fact that the market GGR is down marginally against second quarter. Yes. Rob, I think the main point here, which you referenced just now is that Macao GGR remains very resilient before any of these stimulus measures have the chance to take impact. And I think that's very clear in the premium segments. And I think any economic tailwind we get as a market from the stimulus measures over time, obviously, will help the other segments, in particular, I think, base mass and retail, which are two very important segments for us. So overall, we should acknowledge this Macao GGR, Macao Gaming is a very big out performer in the whole consumer universe in the region right now. And that's powered by the premium segment, where we are extremely well placed with the great products that we bring online. But of course, as the economy gets better, as some of these measures have positive impact over time, we obviously expect the other segments, which are also important to us, will follow through and give us a further boost to what these assets can actually deliver into 2025 and beyond. I'll add a couple of points. The first thing is that the economic stimulus measures introduced by China are still unfolding, but the directional development is welcoming. We have confidence in the Chinese Mainland's economic future and we'll continue to invest in Macao's future. The second point is that in 2024, Macao has been rated by the Chinese tourists as the most desired destination out of the Chinese market. So we see that Macao will stand to benefit once economic activities return to normal. No, I'll take that. Yes, thanks for the question, Shaun. Yes, as you rightly pointed out, visitation improved in terms of the recovery rate in third quarter as relative to second quarter. So we're up to about 93% recovery versus 2019 third quarter. And actually, August, the visitations exceeded 2019 levels. This quarter, it was primarily especially when you look at it on year-on-year basis, primarily driven by day trip visitor increase. And probably as a result of that, but probably I think as a general macro conditions didn't translate as much as you would have expected into the actual spending, especially in the base mass and the retail. So what we saw in the third quarter is actually continuation of the strength in the premium segments. We had better visitations, yes, but that didn't necessarily translate into the base mass business or help the retail business to any great extent. But it's encouraging to see the interest and desirability of consumers to come to Macao. Clearly, the Sheraton keys being 2,400 fewer rooms available versus the prior summer didn't help us, but also frankly didn't help the market as a whole because that's a very large amount of inventory to be out of the market. So overnight, as it is, that obviously hampered that segment. And overnight, visitors typically spend multiple times what day trippers spend. But like I think Wilfred mentioned, Macao remains very desirable as a tourist destination for the region. And I think it's encouraging to see that come through just in the volume of visitations for the quarter. Should I take it? Yes. I think on the construction and the delivery of the new rooms, I mean, first of all, I think the team has done a fantastic job in delivering the assets back the way they have by the end of September, where we opened a new casino, Londoner Grand Casino as well as the get licensed for 300 the first 300 suites in Londoner Grand. I think it's important to understand that in the fourth quarter, we actually go down further in the total number of keys available during the quarter versus third quarter because we will be losing the rest of the Sheraton rooms and we will be staying in terms of licensed new suites at this 300 number for pretty much the whole quarter. So we'll actually reduce further in terms of key count by about 600 to 700 rooms in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. So it's really only until January that we start to get a significant uplift in the critical mass of new suites and we hope to be above 1,000 new suites by January or at least by Chinese New Year in January. And then it just ramps up from there until May or middle of the second quarter to the full inventory of 2,400 keys. And by then, we'll be back up to over 10,600 keys or just on the 11,000 thereabouts by the second quarter. Obviously, the room inventory being out by so much does impact our EBITDA and EBITDA share. And to your question on the prospect for the EBITDA share recovery, I think, we're very confident that Londoner Grand and the whole Londoner Macao will deliver as we roll out the what is really, I think, top product at unprecedented scale. This Londoner Macao will be 4,400 suite hotel with about over 60% of the keys being suites. There's really no building like it in our industry in terms of that scale of quality and the offerings it has between the F&B, the arena inside of the actual building. So we're very positive about how this will help to drive our EBITDA and ultimately our share of EBITDA as it ramps up and 2025 unfolds and hopefully with some of these tailwinds that we just referenced earlier in the call. So, yes, we are very excited about how this asset will deliver for us. And to Rob's point, between Venetian and Londoner Macao, I think you've got two amazing assets that's really going to deliver for us, but also deliver for our customers. Thanks, Carlos. Yes, I think, we have referenced it in the deck, but we are progressing very well on the construction, the upgrade for the Venetian arena. And it will relaunch actually towards the end of November into December. And we already have the first events lined up in terms of entertainment, but also sports. So that would get start getting some traction actually even at the end of this year. But we also should note like Patrick referenced on the entertainment offer in general, with the Londoner arena, with the 6,000 seat Londoner arena, we have been programming very actively even during the downtime of the Venetian arena or especially, I should say. And we did around 17 shows in the Londoner arena during third quarter and many of these shows actually did help us in driving the traffic and the spend. So we're very excited to have the Venetian Arena fully upgraded. I think it's going to be great for entertainment, sports, MICE, events. So it's really serving multiple segments and boosting the diversification drive in Macao. I think with the great setup there with the VIP boxes, with the backstage, the locker rooms and obviously the state-of-the-art technology, I think is going to be basically like a new arena launching. So we are very excited about that. But another point to know is we will be programming both arenas and sometimes there will be shows concurrently in both venues on both sides of the Strip. So we're excited to see how that could help our business too. So, yes, you will continuously see us showcasing new events in the calendar. There's already three events selling tickets now towards the end of the quarter and we are looking forward to do some announcements on some more major events before the end of the year as well. I think you covered it hopefully. Thanks."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Sands. Sir, the floor is yours.\nDaniel Briggs: Thank you, Matthew. Joining the call today are Rob Goldstein, Patrick Dumont, Dr. Wolford Wong and Grant Chum. Today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. We'll be making these statements under the safe harbor provision of federal securities laws. The company's actual results may materially from the results reflected in those forward-looking statements. In addition, we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are included in our press release. We've also posted an earnings presentation on our website. We will refer to that presentation during the call. Timing for the Q&A, we ask those of interest to please pose one question and one follow-up, so we might allow everyone within the opportunity to participate. The presentation is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Goldstein: Thanks, Dan, and thanks for joining us today. Macau market continues to grow. Total gain revenues for the market grew 24% in the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2023. In addition, mass play revenue grew 29% compared to 1 year ago. We remain confident in the future growth in Macao market. I believe Macao market gross gain revenue will exceed $30 billion next year and continue to grow year after year. Our business strategy is predicated or investing in high-quality assets and also have scale. Macau is and always has a deeper competitive market. Our strategic approach has enabled us to compete very effectively. We have designed our capital investment programs to ensure that we will continue to be the market leader years ahead. Our approach allows us to grow fast from the long term and large share EBITDA and generate industry-leading returns on invested capital. Turning to our results in Macau, we delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter despite material disruption at [indiscernible]. SCL continues to lead the market in gaming and non-gaming revenue and a market share of EBITDA. We will continue -- we will capture high-value, high-margin tourism over the long term. We have a unique competitive position in terms of scale, quality and diversity of product of offerings. Upon completion of the second phase of the [indiscernible] and our Cotai Arena, our product advantage will be more pronounced than ever. Another strong quarter in Singapore despite ongoing disruption from construction. The financial results of [indiscernible] stands reflect the positive impact of our capital investment program and the growth of high-value tours. Enrolling FPL Singapore as a destination is enhanced by the robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendars. As we complete the balance of our investment programs, there will be considerable runway for growth. Thanks for joining our call. I'll turn it over to Patrick down, and then we'll go to Q&A. Patrick?\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Rob. Macao EBITDA was $561 million. We had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been higher by $4 million. When adjusted for lower-than-expected hold in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin for the Macau portfolio of properties would have been 32.1% or down 80 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2023. Context here is important. Our margins at London were directly impacted by the disruption of the London grand renovation. We closed the casino at 1,500 keys out during the quarter. Margin at The Venetian was 38.2%, and we expect margin improvement as The Venetian Cotai Arena comes back online later this year and as visitation to the market and growth in unrated play in the market both increased in the future. Margin at The Plaza and Four Seasons was 40%. We are now deep into our land grand renovation program. We plan the completion of the first tower by year-end 2024 and of the second tower by May of 2025. The [ Londoner Grand ] Casino has been closed since May and is scheduled to reopen in December. As these products come online, between the end of 2024 and the first half of 2025, our competitive position will be stronger than ever. We expect meaningful EBITDA growth and margin expansion in the future. Now turning to Singapore. MBS' EBITDA came in at $512 million. Our strong results reflect the impact of high-quality investments in market-leading products and growth in high value tourism. Had we held as expected at our roll-in Play segment, EBITDA would have been $64 million lower. Had we held as expected in our rolling play segment, MBS margin would have been 48% or 220 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023. While we have substantially completed the original $1 billion refurbishment program at MBS, we are still in the initial stages of realizing the benefits of these new products. Tower gaming at Marina Bay Sands will be offered for the first time at the property in the third quarter of 2024. The next phase of our capital investment program at Radio-based Sands is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of '25. This will further support growth in 2025 and beyond. Turning to our program to return capital to state to shareholders. We repurchased $400 million of LVS stock during the quarter. We also paid our recurring quarterly dividend. We look forward to continuing to utilize the company's capital return program to increase returns to shareholders in the future. Thanks again for joining the call today. Now let's take some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.\nJoe Greff: I'd like to start off on Singapore, if we could. I was hoping, can you give us a sense of maybe how players and visitors geographically, how they are performing? I guess more specifically, are you seeing any kind of slowdown from Mainland Chinese visitation or mainland Chinese spend into MBS? And was there any more material trend change towards the end of the 2Q versus maybe what you've seen over the last couple of quarters as that's been sort of a growing segment?\nRobert Goldstein: Joe, as you know, in the past calls, we have a diverse customer base in Singapore. We got them all on the region and certainly China is part of that, but we're all over the place, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, ,Malaysia. So I don't think we saw much different than the past year, except where obviously, your seasonality is in play in Q2. But our business, looking forward, the only thing I would say late is impacted is we keep self-inflicting loans by facing our building. And it's near the end, finally as it feels like a long time. But despite seasonality despite the difficulties of construction, Tower 3, Tower gaming, we continue to move forward towards $500-plus million quarters and diversity of business tours is very clear to be really the -- where they're coming from. They're coming [indiscernible]. We've not seen a slowdown in China. We just simply see the same as we see in the last couple of quarters, which is solid. There's also [indiscernible] more of the region. So Singapore moving forward, I think you'll see a real important transition probably in the early part of Q2 when the building is really full bore, complete and tower gaming is intact, all the suites are intact. We're really playing the game with one hand behind our back out now, still delivering $2-plus billion run rate. So we feel very good about our prospects to single. Probably the most -- not probably, is the most the largest or the EBITDA building [indiscernible] gaming. So -- and it continues to get stronger. We think it's -- we said before, we think that our goal is $2.5 billion out of Singapore. I think you'll see it happen in the oncoming years.\nJoe Greff: Great. And then people have not really asked me a question about Macau -- is Macao self-sufficient or speaks for itself. But Rob, Patrick, maybe you can give us an update on any development opportunities, specifically Thailand, and I'm not sure there's much to add to what's going on in New York.\nPatrick Dumont: So first off, I think the great news is we're very ready to develop new ground of developments in new jurisdictions. We're very excited about it. Rob, the team, I spend a lot of time looking at opportunities for our company to expand and grow new jurisdictions. As you know, we're spending a lot of time in New York. We've been spending a lot of time in Texas. We've been looking at Thailand. I think Thailand is a very interesting opportunity. The market there is very strong for different types of tourism. And I think depending on the way it's set up and the opportunity that's there in terms of structure, it could be very interesting for us. We love the market as a place to source customers. We think the tourism, our quality here is quite high. If you go and visit, you'll have a great experience there, and we'd love to be part of it. So if Thailand becomes available, we'd be very interested. But I think it's early days yet. I think we've been spending time there along with the rest of our industry, looking to see if we could be hopeful to that process. And we're waiting and seeing what happens.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley.\nStephen Grambling: I appreciate the comments on the Londoner Grand renovation impacting margins in Macau. But can you get back to 2019 levels in the current environment as that comes through and ramps up? Or do we need to see some change either in growth in the market or the competitive and promotional environment to get back there?\nPatrick Dumont: So a couple of things. And I think this is really important to note, the Macau market has always been super competitive from day one, it's been a very competitive market. And we've been very effective in the way that we compete because we have an investment-driven model. So if you go back pre-pandemic, if you go back in 2010, it was a very competitive market. And in fact, I remember when the premium mass segment didn't exist. And when it started, people -- Rob can reference this as well some other people in the room can as well. When there was no pre-VMF segment. It was really rolling volume and mass play. And the market has always evolved over time. But the one thing that's been consistent is that our company has driven success through investment and through leading and nongaming amenities. And to be fair, innovating on the gaming side as well. And so when you look at our performance, if you go to Page 14 of the slide deck, you can kind of see what happened in the quarter. So The Venetian Macau did $262 million of EBITDA in the quarter at a 38.2% margin. And it's missing about half its volume of unrated play. So just with the arena out, which is also a very valuable amenity to drive premium mass performance, look at the strength of the performance of The Venetian. Same thing is true in The Plaza. Look at what the Four Seasons did. 40% margin, $100 million of EBITDA. So when we look at the Londoner, we basically took out an equivalent property like [ Melco ] or an equivalent property to win Palace. We took that capacity out of the market for ourselves to renovate it. So for us to put up $550 million in the quarter, in my mind, this is a great result because we know that we have a limiter in place. We're missing one of a significant portion of what is ultimately going to be one of the best properties in Macau, if not the best property. And if you look at the success of the Londoner right now, if you look at the win fee per day on the table side, the Londoner is the second best in our system. So in Macau -- so when you think about that, the model has been proven and the investment has been validated. Now we're going to open up the better half, hopefully, by the end of the year in major [ part ], suddenly, the limiters are going to come off. So in my mind, this is a very positive investment for us. And we'll get to the margins. We're already doing it in other properties. It's just a function of renovation because we're carrying all the costs now associated with the shuttered casino and 1,500 rooms. So the Londoner or impact is really, one half of it is working. You see the performance, you see the slot win, you see the slot performance win per unit. You see the table win performance, you look at the hotel performance and the nongaming and the performance. And then you look at the side that's shut and you realize that's the better side, but we're carrying all the cost. The potential of the future is really there. We feel very strong about the potential for the margins to reach where we need to go. And just remember, pre-pandemic we were at 35% to 36% EBITDA margin on a whole normalized basis business in aggregate. So we're -- we'd like to believe we're in a good spot. We're competing effectively. We have great assets. We're investing for the future. And when we're done, we're going to have the newest and best products in the market. So we feel very strongly about the path that we're on. It's just going to take a little bit of time to get that.\nRobert Goldstein: The only structural change do we need is [indiscernible] Okay. The market is going $30-plus billion next year. We're going to have the two most important assets in the market speaking with each other. I mean that strategic, we're going to have Londoner and The Nation over 7,400 between them. The full power of Cotai Arena, all the amenities between those two. But I think those buildings will be very, very intertwined and give us, by far, $2 billion-plus assets speak each other. At Parisian and Four Seasons and Sands keep doing what they're doing, we will be a $3-plus billion and think will get $2-plus billion. I believe that sometime near future we will have the highest EBITDA creation in this company's history without Las Vegas. So I'm pretty confident that Londoner will perform and outperformed their expectations, but also enhances the [indiscernible] because the back and forth of those two buildings, they're very similar, huge retail, huge suite capacity, entertainment, retail, [indiscernible] they just -- they're much bigger and better than anything else in that market for making money. And when those come online next year, these results today another $150 million out of Londoner of a sudden, you're looking at $3-plus billion of annualized EBITDA. That's how we view the market. The margins being what they are, making EBITDA still the most important thing, and we will get there. We will get there.\nStephen Grambling: So maybe as a quick follow-up. On capital allocation, you noted being consistent with capital return. And it sounds like you're confident in a ramp from here in Macau and really growing in MBS, yet the stock is near the lows during the pandemic. So what's the tolerance to be maybe not as consistent and actually being more aggressive with capital allocation or even rethinking about the leverage profile at least in the near term?\nPatrick Dumont: So I think, first off, we have said this before, we see meaningful value in both equities, where the stock is trading, does it make sense to us. Both on a historical basis and how we view the value of our company and how we look to invest and grow. So we're going to continue to repurchase stock. As you saw we did in the last couple of quarters. We feel very strongly about the value of our business, and we're going to continue to do it. Look, I think for us, we're very focused on being shareholder friendly. We were a very shareholder-friendly company in the past. We're a shareholder-friendly company today. We're going to continue to do that. That's our goal. And I think that the nice thing is that as we complete the Londoner, two things are going to happen. We're going to have less CapEx and more free cash flow. And to be fair, a more productive asset base. And so hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to use that cash flow to return it to shareholders. So we're going to look to do that and continue what we've been doing. But we agree with you think where the stock is today is not reflective of our long-term value.\nRobert Goldstein: And also, if we do invest in new opportunities, that's not in the near future, so [indiscernible] that New York, Texas, Thailand is years ahead. You can find lots of room to invest money to complete the [indiscernible].\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS.\nRobin Farley: Two questions. One is, can you share some thoughts on -- there's a lot of concern about tariff impact on the Chinese economy next year. Just any way to help us think about that broadly how you're thinking about? You have a lot of CapEx going being up and running in the market next year, which should certainly position you well. But just sort of thinking about broader impact there?\nRobert Goldstein: You take tariff impacts on the -- so the U.S., the new president ever he or she may be, I see. I don't think we want to talk about the two reasons. What we don't know what's really going to happen nor do we know the impact. Obviously, China [indiscernible] speaks for itself. It's been a struggle this year. And I think it hopefully just gets better, we see more improvement. But the big thing in our business is the 2 million-plus visitors were lacking quarter-on-quarter. They heard us, and that was just today. I don't think we should comment on politics or what has to happen, we actually don't know. But obviously, the biggest miss for our company, which is both for scale and quality, we lose 8 million annualized business tools that pus us with everybody else. So we'll leave that they are going in the political's going to do what to do with and why.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Fair enough. And then I had a question, and you already commented on your interest in continuing share repurchase. Looking at the rate that you did this quarter, you've been mostly through your remaining authorization at the end of this quarter. Is that -- when we think about like your appetite for continuing beyond that, is that -- if you could just sort of comment on that.\nPatrick Dumont: Yes. I think if you look at our prior practice, you can see that we've always been focused on return on capital, both through share repurchases and dividends. And that our board has been very supportive of trying to create shareholder value through return of capital. So as our current authorization gets used up, we'll go back to the board, and we'll have a discussion about how we want to allocate capital. But the Board has been very supportive of in trying to enhance shareholder returns over time.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.\nCarlo Santarelli: Rob, if you could. I mean, I know this is probably a difficult question, but if you think about...\nRobert Goldstein: Then don't ask.\nCarlo Santarelli: I hear you. The question was -- maybe it's not as difficult as I framed it to be. But when you guys think about the rooms that are out of service at Londoner and those customers and recapture in your existing portfolio, whether you're able to recapture them in Venetian [indiscernible] or elsewhere. What do you think is actually the delta in what you're missing from those rooms being offline, i.e., how much of that shortfall that's being generated there relative to historical periods elsewhere in the portfolio versus how much do you think is just exiting the system and maybe showing up to competitors?\nRobert Goldstein: Right. Before I get this question, Mr. Chum, we woke up [indiscernible] this call in the middle of night in Macao, I want to also reference the fact that the disruption aside the carrying labor, we've been these buildings for when buildings are construction impacts both Londoner [indiscernible] and to want to be clear that the disruption isn't just limited to our current Londoner [indiscernible], which is a beautiful building, also feels the [indiscernible]. Grant, will you answer the question about the rooms and the delta and how you see that?\nKwan Chum: Yes. Thanks, Rob. I think, first of all, yes, the performance definitely was impacted by the Phase I renovation on the Sheraton side. But actually, despite that, we referenced the fact that we -- we obviously worked hard to shift the patronage to other properties in the portfolio. And the team was actually incredibly successful at that. We actually reached the record high in any quarter on non-rolling drop as well as a record high in any quarter on slot handle. So in terms of gaming volumes, I think we've managed to sustain the volumes overall. However, within the mix, I think what you do lose is some of that base mass, which is where Pacifica Casino was primarily positioned. And also, what you also can see in the numbers is the impact of the loss of the rooms impacting the cash hotel revenues because, obviously, when you have fewer rooms, we are yielding accordingly. And when you lose that cash revenues from the hotel side because you have reduced inventory and we need to shift the customers to other properties on the casino side that clearly impacts not just EBITDA, but it's a high flow-through segment. Business segments. So it obviously impacts the percentage margin as well.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. That's helpful. And if I could, just one quick follow-up. Sorry, go ahead, Rob.\nRobert Goldstein: There's -- do you have a dollar amount on the cash wound sales loss in the quarter.\nKwan Chum: I'm sorry Rob.\nRobert Goldstein: I was asking if you can give us a number, but the dollar number we lost in cash room sales for the closure of London.\nKwan Chum: It -- if you look at the actual reduction in cash revenue for -- versus Q1, then you're probably looking at the range of around $15 million, $20 million impact. Although you can't simply add that back because you've also got to consider that's a net impact of shifting more rooms into some customer segments and then having fewer rooms to sell. So it's a net impact that's probably not as high as that. But if you're looking at pure cash revenues, then that's the range of impact.\nRobert Goldstein: Sorry, your second question was on?\nCarlo Santarelli: Yes. The second question was just more of a technical question. And I get it, lot could go both ways, but this is the fourth quarter in a row where hold in Singapore has -- on the VIP side has been very strong. And I think when you look at the last 4 quarters, to $30 billion of volume at an almost 4.4% win percentage. It feels a little bit more structural. And I know in your add-back map, you guys are obviously dinging yourselves for a much lower hold structurally. Is there any thought of perhaps changing what that metric is as the normalized hold for that property going forward?\nRobert Goldstein: It's a great question and one we still have time on. And I think what you should realize -- I think you do realize this, the world is changing in [indiscernible] paper gives a better way of quantifying what the whole percentage should be but also we put games for, I'll call it, prop bets or side bets that changed the whole percentage in baccarat. And your comment is spot on. We're debating how high we can take it. The team there feels is understated. And you're right, we keep digging ourselves quarter-to-quarter. And perhaps in the near future, we'll address that because clearly, something is happening here. But again, the smart table opportunity, which we're deep into now, coupled with the game changes, the [indiscernible] is a pretty predictable game for many years. Player bankers and tie payer is changing dramatically. We were there a few months ago and shocked to see how much money embed on the prop bets. No different than the Super Bowl. We know just about the winning team, you've got every 3,000 side bets, which drives the per way up. We believe that's in flight in Singapore. We're not ready today, but we're coming close to a decision this year for us to address that [indiscernible] issue because you're right. The team would argue something in play. It's not simply better fortune, it's just better mathematics and the best be made and the ability to assess those mathematics smart table, et cetera. Pat do you want to add to it?\nPatrick Dumont: Yes, sure. It's the right question to ask. We've been following this for a while. Some of it depends on what Rob said or it depends on what Rob said, which is the additional wagers that are available on the game mix that we have on the floor at the time. But it's also -- you have to understand propensity. And so you have to observe empirically what people are going to do before you could make that decision. So you'd argue that our theoretical is higher than this. But we're going to continue to look at it, and we'll make adjustments as necessary when we think the statistics warrant it. But you're right, it is a very significant adjustment and one that we're going to continue to look at. But our game mix has changed. The availability for, as Rob calls, and prop bets, but really high-vol bets are on the floor now in a very different way than they have been previously, both pre-pandemic and even a year ago. And there -- the patron uptake is very high. And so that is adjusting the way that mix the floor is being exhibited through gaming win. And so we're going to continue to take a look at it, and we'll make adjustments when we feel that it's appropriate. But it's a very good question to ask. There's more there.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.\nShaun Kelley: For Grant or the team, I just wanted to ask, can we get a little bit more color on just what you think is happening in sort of underlying visitation to the market? I think you captured it well in your Slide 19. But we saw our noted a bigger sequential deceleration than we typically see in the second quarter. And my question for you is twofold. Just, one, what's driving that? Is it macro? Is it something you're seeing or hearing out there? And I guess, just as importantly, is it continuing at all into Q3? Or what's your expectation for this pattern to possibly continue?\nRobert Goldstein: Grant you want to take that one?\nGrant Chum: Yes. I think you're right. The visitation recovery rate has actually reduced. So that's actually taking account of seasonality when you when you compare the visitation recovery versus second quarter of 2019, we're about 79%, but we were as high as 90%. 85% to 90% in the past 6 months in the past 2 quarters. So clearly, there has been, I think, more than just a seasonal slowdown. And that's particularly prominent in the visitation outside of Guangzhou. So that does impact, I think Rob referenced it earlier. It does impact, I think, the base mass business, especially that I'm ready to play. We don't know exactly why, but I think that is a clear feature of this quarter, and it does feed into, as we said, the base mass segment.\nShaun Kelley: And then just as a follow-up, I think you also talked about -- I mean, obviously, I think you mentioned a number of times that the market is always competitive, always promotional. Could you just talk about your own promotional allowance or cadence this quarter? Was it a little higher? Did you need to reinvest a little bit more? I think on our math, that was possibly the case? Or is it all just mix? Just kind of how did you see it play out? And kind of what do you -- how much you're reacting to versus how much are you kind of letting -- kind of letting go on market share just because it's not your game?\nPatrick Dumont: One thing, I just want to say one thing, and then I'll turn it over to Grant. So just note that the visitation is very important. And you referenced Slide 19 and the fact that there's 2 million visitors missing, that were pre-pandemic. We are geared for scale. And that scale is very hard margin for us because of the volumes. And so our mix looks different and our margins look different and our reinvestment looks different because of the shift of business between nonrated and rated play. That's a very important thing when you look at our results and you consider what we're doing today, the mix of business has changed for us pre-pandemic, post-paneic. So that's one thing. The other thing is I would also like to highlight that if you look at the margins of our overall operations, they're consistent with prior performance. And when that unrated play returns and the volumes return of premium mass play, that our margins should improve. So yes, we look at reinvestment rates, but we also look at the total business. We like to understand how much money we're actually making on net. So when you look at the business overall, our margin performance and our competitive positioning is actually quite good given where things are. But I'll turn it over to Grant for some additional detail.\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Yes, I think it's a mixture. Firstly, the business mix point that Patrick referenced. And secondly, because we were closing Pacifica Casino and getting ready for that, yes, there is, for a period of time, a high level of reinvestment as we prepare for that shift, which, as I talked about earlier, we did so very successfully, especially into the Parisian, but also the other properties. So those are the main factors affecting the reinvestment and the overall margin mix. But I think even though there are fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter, day-to-day, even in terms of tactical, I think we're very clear on our strategy which is that we will compete on the quality and the scale of our asset base. And of course, at this point in time, we're hampered because we have a number of our key assets out. But when those assets come back online, really from Q4 this year into 2025, we absolutely intend to be competing on that basis. because at that point, we not only have, I think, scale we always had, but the sheer quality of product that we'll have at that point at scale, I think that will be the fundamental difference from what we had before, and we intend to make full use of that in terms of competing for the market.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie.\nChad Beynon: On Singapore, which has been consistently strong for several quarters, it appears that there's still some quarterly volatility. I think last quarter, we talked about some big events in the first quarter that drove nongaming and obviously, VIP play. As we think about the back half of the year, can you help us kind of square what seasonality should look like? And if there are any big events that are booked on the calendar in Singapore that could drive additional nongaming or VIP business?\nPatrick Dumont: So a couple of things. So typically, 2Q is our trough quarter in the year. And so you saw that in Singapore this quarter. As a practical matter, we were also out keys because of the renovation in Tower 3. So across the back half of the year and into Q1 of next year, all of that stuff is going to come back. So the limiters are going to come off. And so if you look at the tower gaming that we're adding, you look at the additional salons that are coming back online, some of the renovated gaming areas that are coming back, we're finally going to hit full stride of that building. So even though we put up this quarter, and last quarter, which are, I think, the two highest of all time, we have more room to go. We're not operating with full capacity. And so right now, when we look at Singapore, we see strength in the market we've geared ourselves to focus on high-value tourism, which is coming into Singapore at a very high level. We are the premier place to visit from an amenity standpoint, entertainment, food and beverage, and we're benefiting from it. And our hospitality is now second to none, which we spent a lot of years working on, and we're finally there. So we're going to start to see this asset continue to grow and outpace. In terms of the calendar up and coming, I can't point to anything other than Formula One that would be sitting in the category you just laid out. Formula what happens every year. It's a great event. It's something that's good for Singapore. Our patrons really enjoy it, and we look forward to its success. But in terms of calendar, unless Grant has something in mind, I can't think of anything other than that right now that's worth mentioning.\nKwan Chum: Yes, that's the main one, yes.\nRobert Goldstein: This market is so powerful and getting better by the day. And in the past Q2 is one of the weakest quarter in seasonality. But still, what's happening in Singapore is almost unheard of in our industry. [indiscernible] that they -- and we're doing these numbers again with capacity constrained. When that goes away, and the market will continue to thrive, whether it's F1 or Taylor Swift or whosever coming next. They just those events are very additive, but that place as a market just becomes more and more designed by the day you see by the visitation and the quality of visitation. So [indiscernible] will come, but I think our ability will speak for itself.\nChad Beynon: Okay. Appreciate it. And then I'm going to ask you to put on your economist hat again, not looking out to future years, but this year, obviously, the ARR cut could bring some more money back into consumer pockets in China. Just wondering in prior cycles, how long that usually takes for it to trickle down. Obviously, we've seen a nice little improvement in some of the July-foot traffic. I don't think it would happen that fast. But is this something if it's kind of working in terms of some stimulus, you could start to see it in the third or fourth quarter here? Just in terms of spend per play trends. Just wondering if you could kind of opine on what we've seen in prior cycles.\nPatrick Dumont: So this is a fascinating question. One thing I'll tell you, this was the highest volumes we ever had in premium mass and slots in a quarter. So clearly, like something positive is happening. I think if you said that the economy was [indiscernible] and doing incredibly well that we'll be doing better. I think that might be a fair statement. You can say that. But in terms of timing or specific economic actions, there are so many different things that can happen that may influence it. We have no idea. I mean, this isn't anything that we can comment on or have a view on other than that we're hopeful that there will be further economic growth and further beneficial economic activity around the [indiscernible] area. And hopefully, we be beneficiaries of that. But in terms of specific comments around timing or things of that nature, it's not something we can really do.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Brandt Montour from Barclays.\nBrandt Montour: I just wanted to follow up maybe with Grant or anyone on Shaun's question about visitation. And maybe just thinking about what's going on there? I know that you don't have a crystal ball for the future. But in the 2Q, do you think Macro was the biggest factor? Is there still infrastructure friction there with flights to non-Guangdong, particularly? Or is there something else that you think is at play as well?\nPatrick Dumont: Yes. Thanks, Brandt, for the question. Yes, I don't have specific reasons why we have a slowdown in the recovery rate for non-Guangdong. I think what you can say is there is a segment bifurcation here where the premium segments are still doing incredibly well. And you can see, I think it's on Slide 18 on [indiscernible] pack. Actually, this is the highest spend per visitor arrival since the COVID recovery began of any quarter. So clearly, at the premium end, the strength of spending is very high. But at the same time, the I think, the lower price points in terms of, say, the slot performance is also incredibly strong. So those two factors drove record high volumes in our non-rolling drop and soft handle. But in the middle, especially the base [ mass ] tables, especially unrated, that is highly correlated to the strength of visitation and it just wasn't as strong this quarter, even if you adjust for seasonality. So I think we can explain how the segments have performed. But we don't know exactly why the visitation base isn't recovering as fast in the middle in terms of that base mass hesitation.\nBrandt Montour: Great. And then on the disruption, the renovation projects, if we were to try and gauge the level of disruption from these projects in the third quarter versus the second quarter, I know you lose the casino floor for a whole quarter versus half a quarter. Can you maybe give us some finer points on what else is going to be offline in the third quarter versus the second quarter room count, et cetera?\nPatrick Dumont: Yes. You go ahead Grant.\nKwan Chum: Yes, the disruption will actually increase from a room perspective. So we're operating around 2,500 keys at [ Sheraton ] in the second quarter on average over the quarter, and we expect to be down to about 1,300 on average across the third quarter. Obviously, higher number of teams in the first half of the quarter and finishing up with fits. And as you said, we will have a full quarter of Pacifica casino closure versus 60% of the quarter in the second quarter. So yes, the disruption impact will actually increase during the third quarter.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies.\nDavid Katz: I wanted to go back to the repurchases and just take a little bigger picture look, right? Just thinking about the factors, obviously, the stock and where it is, is one of them. But when we look at your capabilities, there are some maturities out there. In the future, there's obviously the issue of the float at the current run rate that shrinks the float and that's a consideration that some companies think about. If you could just sort of walk us through how you're thinking about those other issues in view of all of them, that would be helpful please.\nPatrick Dumont: So all very good questions, all things we talk about all the time, consider with the board and we think about frequently. I think the key thing for us is we always look to invest for growth. So when you think about capital allocation, our primary conversation is how do we grow this business. We had a question earlier about new jurisdictions. We're looking at them. If you look at our Las Vegas sale, the fundamental driver of that was our ability to reallocate capital to faster-growing markets and new growth opportunities. And I think our investments in Macau and Singapore will prove out and that will ultimately allow us to grow those businesses, create additional cash flow, which ultimately will be used for either new growth or shareholder return. And so when you look at our balance sheet, we think being investment grade is incredibly important. We think it provides us with a strategic advantage. It reduces our cost of debt capital, which impacts our overall cost of capital and makes the financing of new projects more efficient and create better returns for equity. And also to be fair, we think when we go to new jurisdictions, it puts us in a more competitive position because we have the financial capability to execute the projects we're proposing. And so all of these things are very helpful for us as we look for our business. When it comes to capital return, I think the idea of shrinking the share count of something we've talked about previously, where we think there's a benefit to doing so. We think there is a positive gearing towards share repurchases. We've been very aggressive over the last couple of quarters. We like to continue to shrink the share count over time. And to be fair, we're also a dividend payer. We think that's helpful to shareholder returns. As a S&P 500 member, we think it's good to have the dividend as well. So I think we have the free cash flow to continue to return of capital. We're very happy about that given our investment opportunities. We have the balance sheet strength, be able to develop a new jurisdictions. And so I think you're going to see a balance between growth and our ability to return capital over time. I think the nice thing is when we're done with the Londoner and we're done with some of the other -- with these major innovation projects in Singapore, given the growth that we're seeing, we'll have the ability, hopefully, to return more capital. And we'll have the ability to increase our program and benefit shareholders. So you'll see us do that over time as our business continues to operate and grow. And so I think the idea of shrinking the share count, I think we're in a good position to do it. I think we have a lot of liquidity out there in the market. We have a very strong ability to execute. So I think we're in good shape in terms of our program and the way that we approach it.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo.\nDan Politzer: The first one on Singapore, the ADR was very impressive. Trends there seen overall, pretty good despite subdued visitation. Can you talk about -- are you starting to see the benefits of the existing CapEx that you put into the ground so far? And should we think about any disruption as it relates to Tower 3 that leading up to the completion next year?\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you. Yes, obviously, the money we put into the building thus far has done very well. You see results are -- when you look into a $2 billion-plus run rate, we're still under construction is more to do. Tower 3 is disrupted because we don't have the product from the room tower gaming isn't there. I mean, we're doing very well there. But again, I reference we have one hand tied behind our back and trying to get through it. So the road ahead still looks very positive to us. We think $500 million, $550 million, $600 million a quarter is in reach in the near future. And as we referenced earlier, once the entire building is complete in '25, I do see better numbers than ever on Singapore. It's a very rosy picture in Singapore. And yes, the CapEx we employed there is paying off very well. And we think it's going to continue to be even stronger in time. And as for EDR, while it's relevant, our cash sales are not the [indiscernible] is the drivers our casino business, especially our ongoing casino drop on the table side [indiscernible]. But it's a very positive picture. The disruption is real for the balance of the year into Q1 and Q2. But once that burns off and we had Tower game open the full complement of suites, I think you'll see Singapore just continue to be stronger and stronger.\nDan Politzer: Got it. And then as far as it relates to the Macau property portfolio, obviously, there's a lot of CapEx going into Londoner. As it relates to the other properties there, is there anything that we should be thinking about as you start to wrap up Londoner later this year? Or should we expect 2025 to be pretty much disruption free there?\nRobert Goldstein: Yes. Good point. Londoner will wrap up again in '25. We should note that we are going to undergo -- there was a misunderstanding perhaps the one call about what happens in [indiscernible]. We are going to rehab some of the [indiscernible] because we always do. But it's typical, you won't see it in the numbers of the building will be hidden from the public view by doing the 4x4 traditional way you approach these things in our industry. So we will undergo a renovation of the room product at Venetian next year at the closure of Londoner renovation. Four Seasons pretty much is done. And then we'll sit and see what we want to do it in those things in Parisian and perhaps some Sand, but nothing beyond the should think about for the time being.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski from Stifel.\nSteve Wieczynski: So Grant, you've been asked -- Grant, you've been asked a question on visitation twice now. I'm actually going to try to ask it a third time. So if we look at Slide 20, it shows that the group visitation was I think we've done about 1.3 million visitors in May and June so far. So I want to ask more about kind of what's going on with the group side? And just trying to figure out maybe has it -- do you think Macau has essentially gotten maybe too expensive? And is pricing certain groups out of the market. And I hope that kind of makes sense.\nKwan Chum: Yes, thanks for the question. I think the two groups is a broader supply chain issue and the change in consumer habits, not just applicable to the Macau market, but to all the key markets that were significant to group markets prior to COVID. I think the other aspect that I should have mentioned perhaps I could get Wilfred to give his perspective as well as actually, during this period, we also have a series of significant announcements on policies that would boost visitation over time, even though in this current quarter, the impact may not be prominent, ranging from individual business scheme expansion to other types of visa relaxation. So I think we need to bear that in mind that things are actually moving extremely positively on the policy side to support future growth in visitation. Wilfred, maybe you want to add to that?\nYing Wai Wong: Sure. I think the government, both at the Macau level and at the national level is monitoring the situation. And that's why you see the recent announcement that there's an additional 10 cities that people that qualify for IVS. And if you look at Macau traditionally, about 55%, 60% of the visitors use the IVS scheme. And this time, they added 10 cities, which has close to 60 million population. So you're increasing that catchment area. And I think the other measures such as a faster and nationwide application for business Visa will also benefit Macau. So it will take time for these policies to be promulgated, fully promulgated and known in these cities. So we are expecting some positive impact in the months to come.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Robert Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and thanks for joining us today. Macau market continues to grow. Total gain revenues for the market grew 24% in the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2023. In addition, mass play revenue grew 29% compared to 1 year ago. We remain confident in the future growth in Macao market. I believe Macao market gross gain revenue will exceed $30 billion next year and continue to grow year after year. Our business strategy is predicated or investing in high-quality assets and also have scale. Macau is and always has a deeper competitive market. Our strategic approach has enabled us to compete very effectively. We have designed our capital investment programs to ensure that we will continue to be the market leader years ahead. Our approach allows us to grow fast from the long term and large share EBITDA and generate industry-leading returns on invested capital. Turning to our results in Macau, we delivered solid EBITDA for the quarter despite material disruption at [indiscernible]. SCL continues to lead the market in gaming and non-gaming revenue and a market share of EBITDA. We will continue -- we will capture high-value, high-margin tourism over the long term. We have a unique competitive position in terms of scale, quality and diversity of product of offerings. Upon completion of the second phase of the [indiscernible] and our Cotai Arena, our product advantage will be more pronounced than ever. Another strong quarter in Singapore despite ongoing disruption from construction. The financial results of [indiscernible] stands reflect the positive impact of our capital investment program and the growth of high-value tours. Enrolling FPL Singapore as a destination is enhanced by the robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendars. As we complete the balance of our investment programs, there will be considerable runway for growth. Thanks for joining our call. I'll turn it over to Patrick down, and then we'll go to Q&A. Patrick? Joe, as you know, in the past calls, we have a diverse customer base in Singapore. We got them all on the region and certainly China is part of that, but we're all over the place, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, ,Malaysia. So I don't think we saw much different than the past year, except where obviously, your seasonality is in play in Q2. But our business, looking forward, the only thing I would say late is impacted is we keep self-inflicting loans by facing our building. And it's near the end, finally as it feels like a long time. But despite seasonality despite the difficulties of construction, Tower 3, Tower gaming, we continue to move forward towards $500-plus million quarters and diversity of business tours is very clear to be really the -- where they're coming from. They're coming [indiscernible]. We've not seen a slowdown in China. We just simply see the same as we see in the last couple of quarters, which is solid. There's also [indiscernible] more of the region. So Singapore moving forward, I think you'll see a real important transition probably in the early part of Q2 when the building is really full bore, complete and tower gaming is intact, all the suites are intact. We're really playing the game with one hand behind our back out now, still delivering $2-plus billion run rate. So we feel very good about our prospects to single. Probably the most -- not probably, is the most the largest or the EBITDA building [indiscernible] gaming. So -- and it continues to get stronger. We think it's -- we said before, we think that our goal is $2.5 billion out of Singapore. I think you'll see it happen in the oncoming years. The only structural change do we need is [indiscernible] Okay. The market is going $30-plus billion next year. We're going to have the two most important assets in the market speaking with each other. I mean that strategic, we're going to have Londoner and The Nation over 7,400 between them. The full power of Cotai Arena, all the amenities between those two. But I think those buildings will be very, very intertwined and give us, by far, $2 billion-plus assets speak each other. At Parisian and Four Seasons and Sands keep doing what they're doing, we will be a $3-plus billion and think will get $2-plus billion. I believe that sometime near future we will have the highest EBITDA creation in this company's history without Las Vegas. So I'm pretty confident that Londoner will perform and outperformed their expectations, but also enhances the [indiscernible] because the back and forth of those two buildings, they're very similar, huge retail, huge suite capacity, entertainment, retail, [indiscernible] they just -- they're much bigger and better than anything else in that market for making money. And when those come online next year, these results today another $150 million out of Londoner of a sudden, you're looking at $3-plus billion of annualized EBITDA. That's how we view the market. The margins being what they are, making EBITDA still the most important thing, and we will get there. We will get there. And also, if we do invest in new opportunities, that's not in the near future, so [indiscernible] that New York, Texas, Thailand is years ahead. You can find lots of room to invest money to complete the [indiscernible]. You take tariff impacts on the -- so the U.S., the new president ever he or she may be, I see. I don't think we want to talk about the two reasons. What we don't know what's really going to happen nor do we know the impact. Obviously, China [indiscernible] speaks for itself. It's been a struggle this year. And I think it hopefully just gets better, we see more improvement. But the big thing in our business is the 2 million-plus visitors were lacking quarter-on-quarter. They heard us, and that was just today. I don't think we should comment on politics or what has to happen, we actually don't know. But obviously, the biggest miss for our company, which is both for scale and quality, we lose 8 million annualized business tools that pus us with everybody else. So we'll leave that they are going in the political's going to do what to do with and why. Then don't ask. Right. Before I get this question, Mr. Chum, we woke up [indiscernible] this call in the middle of night in Macao, I want to also reference the fact that the disruption aside the carrying labor, we've been these buildings for when buildings are construction impacts both Londoner [indiscernible] and to want to be clear that the disruption isn't just limited to our current Londoner [indiscernible], which is a beautiful building, also feels the [indiscernible]. Grant, will you answer the question about the rooms and the delta and how you see that? There's -- do you have a dollar amount on the cash wound sales loss in the quarter. I was asking if you can give us a number, but the dollar number we lost in cash room sales for the closure of London. Sorry, your second question was on? It's a great question and one we still have time on. And I think what you should realize -- I think you do realize this, the world is changing in [indiscernible] paper gives a better way of quantifying what the whole percentage should be but also we put games for, I'll call it, prop bets or side bets that changed the whole percentage in baccarat. And your comment is spot on. We're debating how high we can take it. The team there feels is understated. And you're right, we keep digging ourselves quarter-to-quarter. And perhaps in the near future, we'll address that because clearly, something is happening here. But again, the smart table opportunity, which we're deep into now, coupled with the game changes, the [indiscernible] is a pretty predictable game for many years. Player bankers and tie payer is changing dramatically. We were there a few months ago and shocked to see how much money embed on the prop bets. No different than the Super Bowl. We know just about the winning team, you've got every 3,000 side bets, which drives the per way up. We believe that's in flight in Singapore. We're not ready today, but we're coming close to a decision this year for us to address that [indiscernible] issue because you're right. The team would argue something in play. It's not simply better fortune, it's just better mathematics and the best be made and the ability to assess those mathematics smart table, et cetera. Pat do you want to add to it? Grant you want to take that one? This market is so powerful and getting better by the day. And in the past Q2 is one of the weakest quarter in seasonality. But still, what's happening in Singapore is almost unheard of in our industry. [indiscernible] that they -- and we're doing these numbers again with capacity constrained. When that goes away, and the market will continue to thrive, whether it's F1 or Taylor Swift or whosever coming next. They just those events are very additive, but that place as a market just becomes more and more designed by the day you see by the visitation and the quality of visitation. So [indiscernible] will come, but I think our ability will speak for itself. Thank you. Yes, obviously, the money we put into the building thus far has done very well. You see results are -- when you look into a $2 billion-plus run rate, we're still under construction is more to do. Tower 3 is disrupted because we don't have the product from the room tower gaming isn't there. I mean, we're doing very well there. But again, I reference we have one hand tied behind our back and trying to get through it. So the road ahead still looks very positive to us. We think $500 million, $550 million, $600 million a quarter is in reach in the near future. And as we referenced earlier, once the entire building is complete in '25, I do see better numbers than ever on Singapore. It's a very rosy picture in Singapore. And yes, the CapEx we employed there is paying off very well. And we think it's going to continue to be even stronger in time. And as for EDR, while it's relevant, our cash sales are not the [indiscernible] is the drivers our casino business, especially our ongoing casino drop on the table side [indiscernible]. But it's a very positive picture. The disruption is real for the balance of the year into Q1 and Q2. But once that burns off and we had Tower game open the full complement of suites, I think you'll see Singapore just continue to be stronger and stronger. Yes. Good point. Londoner will wrap up again in '25. We should note that we are going to undergo -- there was a misunderstanding perhaps the one call about what happens in [indiscernible]. We are going to rehab some of the [indiscernible] because we always do. But it's typical, you won't see it in the numbers of the building will be hidden from the public view by doing the 4x4 traditional way you approach these things in our industry. So we will undergo a renovation of the room product at Venetian next year at the closure of Londoner renovation. Four Seasons pretty much is done. And then we'll sit and see what we want to do it in those things in Parisian and perhaps some Sand, but nothing beyond the should think about for the time being."

            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Macao EBITDA was $561 million. We had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been higher by $4 million. When adjusted for lower-than-expected hold in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin for the Macau portfolio of properties would have been 32.1% or down 80 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2023. Context here is important. Our margins at London were directly impacted by the disruption of the London grand renovation. We closed the casino at 1,500 keys out during the quarter. Margin at The Venetian was 38.2%, and we expect margin improvement as The Venetian Cotai Arena comes back online later this year and as visitation to the market and growth in unrated play in the market both increased in the future. Margin at The Plaza and Four Seasons was 40%. We are now deep into our land grand renovation program. We plan the completion of the first tower by year-end 2024 and of the second tower by May of 2025. The [ Londoner Grand ] Casino has been closed since May and is scheduled to reopen in December. As these products come online, between the end of 2024 and the first half of 2025, our competitive position will be stronger than ever. We expect meaningful EBITDA growth and margin expansion in the future. Now turning to Singapore. MBS' EBITDA came in at $512 million. Our strong results reflect the impact of high-quality investments in market-leading products and growth in high value tourism. Had we held as expected at our roll-in Play segment, EBITDA would have been $64 million lower. Had we held as expected in our rolling play segment, MBS margin would have been 48% or 220 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023. While we have substantially completed the original $1 billion refurbishment program at MBS, we are still in the initial stages of realizing the benefits of these new products. Tower gaming at Marina Bay Sands will be offered for the first time at the property in the third quarter of 2024. The next phase of our capital investment program at Radio-based Sands is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of '25. This will further support growth in 2025 and beyond. Turning to our program to return capital to state to shareholders. We repurchased $400 million of LVS stock during the quarter. We also paid our recurring quarterly dividend. We look forward to continuing to utilize the company's capital return program to increase returns to shareholders in the future. Thanks again for joining the call today. Now let's take some questions. So first off, I think the great news is we're very ready to develop new ground of developments in new jurisdictions. We're very excited about it. Rob, the team, I spend a lot of time looking at opportunities for our company to expand and grow new jurisdictions. As you know, we're spending a lot of time in New York. We've been spending a lot of time in Texas. We've been looking at Thailand. I think Thailand is a very interesting opportunity. The market there is very strong for different types of tourism. And I think depending on the way it's set up and the opportunity that's there in terms of structure, it could be very interesting for us. We love the market as a place to source customers. We think the tourism, our quality here is quite high. If you go and visit, you'll have a great experience there, and we'd love to be part of it. So if Thailand becomes available, we'd be very interested. But I think it's early days yet. I think we've been spending time there along with the rest of our industry, looking to see if we could be hopeful to that process. And we're waiting and seeing what happens. So a couple of things. And I think this is really important to note, the Macau market has always been super competitive from day one, it's been a very competitive market. And we've been very effective in the way that we compete because we have an investment-driven model. So if you go back pre-pandemic, if you go back in 2010, it was a very competitive market. And in fact, I remember when the premium mass segment didn't exist. And when it started, people -- Rob can reference this as well some other people in the room can as well. When there was no pre-VMF segment. It was really rolling volume and mass play. And the market has always evolved over time. But the one thing that's been consistent is that our company has driven success through investment and through leading and nongaming amenities. And to be fair, innovating on the gaming side as well. And so when you look at our performance, if you go to Page 14 of the slide deck, you can kind of see what happened in the quarter. So The Venetian Macau did $262 million of EBITDA in the quarter at a 38.2% margin. And it's missing about half its volume of unrated play. So just with the arena out, which is also a very valuable amenity to drive premium mass performance, look at the strength of the performance of The Venetian. Same thing is true in The Plaza. Look at what the Four Seasons did. 40% margin, $100 million of EBITDA. So when we look at the Londoner, we basically took out an equivalent property like [ Melco ] or an equivalent property to win Palace. We took that capacity out of the market for ourselves to renovate it. So for us to put up $550 million in the quarter, in my mind, this is a great result because we know that we have a limiter in place. We're missing one of a significant portion of what is ultimately going to be one of the best properties in Macau, if not the best property. And if you look at the success of the Londoner right now, if you look at the win fee per day on the table side, the Londoner is the second best in our system. So in Macau -- so when you think about that, the model has been proven and the investment has been validated. Now we're going to open up the better half, hopefully, by the end of the year in major [ part ], suddenly, the limiters are going to come off. So in my mind, this is a very positive investment for us. And we'll get to the margins. We're already doing it in other properties. It's just a function of renovation because we're carrying all the costs now associated with the shuttered casino and 1,500 rooms. So the Londoner or impact is really, one half of it is working. You see the performance, you see the slot win, you see the slot performance win per unit. You see the table win performance, you look at the hotel performance and the nongaming and the performance. And then you look at the side that's shut and you realize that's the better side, but we're carrying all the cost. The potential of the future is really there. We feel very strong about the potential for the margins to reach where we need to go. And just remember, pre-pandemic we were at 35% to 36% EBITDA margin on a whole normalized basis business in aggregate. So we're -- we'd like to believe we're in a good spot. We're competing effectively. We have great assets. We're investing for the future. And when we're done, we're going to have the newest and best products in the market. So we feel very strongly about the path that we're on. It's just going to take a little bit of time to get that. So I think, first off, we have said this before, we see meaningful value in both equities, where the stock is trading, does it make sense to us. Both on a historical basis and how we view the value of our company and how we look to invest and grow. So we're going to continue to repurchase stock. As you saw we did in the last couple of quarters. We feel very strongly about the value of our business, and we're going to continue to do it. Look, I think for us, we're very focused on being shareholder friendly. We were a very shareholder-friendly company in the past. We're a shareholder-friendly company today. We're going to continue to do that. That's our goal. And I think that the nice thing is that as we complete the Londoner, two things are going to happen. We're going to have less CapEx and more free cash flow. And to be fair, a more productive asset base. And so hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to use that cash flow to return it to shareholders. So we're going to look to do that and continue what we've been doing. But we agree with you think where the stock is today is not reflective of our long-term value. Yes. I think if you look at our prior practice, you can see that we've always been focused on return on capital, both through share repurchases and dividends. And that our board has been very supportive of trying to create shareholder value through return of capital. So as our current authorization gets used up, we'll go back to the board, and we'll have a discussion about how we want to allocate capital. But the Board has been very supportive of in trying to enhance shareholder returns over time. Yes, sure. It's the right question to ask. We've been following this for a while. Some of it depends on what Rob said or it depends on what Rob said, which is the additional wagers that are available on the game mix that we have on the floor at the time. But it's also -- you have to understand propensity. And so you have to observe empirically what people are going to do before you could make that decision. So you'd argue that our theoretical is higher than this. But we're going to continue to look at it, and we'll make adjustments as necessary when we think the statistics warrant it. But you're right, it is a very significant adjustment and one that we're going to continue to look at. But our game mix has changed. The availability for, as Rob calls, and prop bets, but really high-vol bets are on the floor now in a very different way than they have been previously, both pre-pandemic and even a year ago. And there -- the patron uptake is very high. And so that is adjusting the way that mix the floor is being exhibited through gaming win. And so we're going to continue to take a look at it, and we'll make adjustments when we feel that it's appropriate. But it's a very good question to ask. There's more there. One thing, I just want to say one thing, and then I'll turn it over to Grant. So just note that the visitation is very important. And you referenced Slide 19 and the fact that there's 2 million visitors missing, that were pre-pandemic. We are geared for scale. And that scale is very hard margin for us because of the volumes. And so our mix looks different and our margins look different and our reinvestment looks different because of the shift of business between nonrated and rated play. That's a very important thing when you look at our results and you consider what we're doing today, the mix of business has changed for us pre-pandemic, post-paneic. So that's one thing. The other thing is I would also like to highlight that if you look at the margins of our overall operations, they're consistent with prior performance. And when that unrated play returns and the volumes return of premium mass play, that our margins should improve. So yes, we look at reinvestment rates, but we also look at the total business. We like to understand how much money we're actually making on net. So when you look at the business overall, our margin performance and our competitive positioning is actually quite good given where things are. But I'll turn it over to Grant for some additional detail. So a couple of things. So typically, 2Q is our trough quarter in the year. And so you saw that in Singapore this quarter. As a practical matter, we were also out keys because of the renovation in Tower 3. So across the back half of the year and into Q1 of next year, all of that stuff is going to come back. So the limiters are going to come off. And so if you look at the tower gaming that we're adding, you look at the additional salons that are coming back online, some of the renovated gaming areas that are coming back, we're finally going to hit full stride of that building. So even though we put up this quarter, and last quarter, which are, I think, the two highest of all time, we have more room to go. We're not operating with full capacity. And so right now, when we look at Singapore, we see strength in the market we've geared ourselves to focus on high-value tourism, which is coming into Singapore at a very high level. We are the premier place to visit from an amenity standpoint, entertainment, food and beverage, and we're benefiting from it. And our hospitality is now second to none, which we spent a lot of years working on, and we're finally there. So we're going to start to see this asset continue to grow and outpace. In terms of the calendar up and coming, I can't point to anything other than Formula One that would be sitting in the category you just laid out. Formula what happens every year. It's a great event. It's something that's good for Singapore. Our patrons really enjoy it, and we look forward to its success. But in terms of calendar, unless Grant has something in mind, I can't think of anything other than that right now that's worth mentioning. So this is a fascinating question. One thing I'll tell you, this was the highest volumes we ever had in premium mass and slots in a quarter. So clearly, like something positive is happening. I think if you said that the economy was [indiscernible] and doing incredibly well that we'll be doing better. I think that might be a fair statement. You can say that. But in terms of timing or specific economic actions, there are so many different things that can happen that may influence it. We have no idea. I mean, this isn't anything that we can comment on or have a view on other than that we're hopeful that there will be further economic growth and further beneficial economic activity around the [indiscernible] area. And hopefully, we be beneficiaries of that. But in terms of specific comments around timing or things of that nature, it's not something we can really do. Yes. Thanks, Brandt, for the question. Yes, I don't have specific reasons why we have a slowdown in the recovery rate for non-Guangdong. I think what you can say is there is a segment bifurcation here where the premium segments are still doing incredibly well. And you can see, I think it's on Slide 18 on [indiscernible] pack. Actually, this is the highest spend per visitor arrival since the COVID recovery began of any quarter. So clearly, at the premium end, the strength of spending is very high. But at the same time, the I think, the lower price points in terms of, say, the slot performance is also incredibly strong. So those two factors drove record high volumes in our non-rolling drop and soft handle. But in the middle, especially the base [ mass ] tables, especially unrated, that is highly correlated to the strength of visitation and it just wasn't as strong this quarter, even if you adjust for seasonality. So I think we can explain how the segments have performed. But we don't know exactly why the visitation base isn't recovering as fast in the middle in terms of that base mass hesitation. Yes. You go ahead Grant. So all very good questions, all things we talk about all the time, consider with the board and we think about frequently. I think the key thing for us is we always look to invest for growth. So when you think about capital allocation, our primary conversation is how do we grow this business. We had a question earlier about new jurisdictions. We're looking at them. If you look at our Las Vegas sale, the fundamental driver of that was our ability to reallocate capital to faster-growing markets and new growth opportunities. And I think our investments in Macau and Singapore will prove out and that will ultimately allow us to grow those businesses, create additional cash flow, which ultimately will be used for either new growth or shareholder return. And so when you look at our balance sheet, we think being investment grade is incredibly important. We think it provides us with a strategic advantage. It reduces our cost of debt capital, which impacts our overall cost of capital and makes the financing of new projects more efficient and create better returns for equity. And also to be fair, we think when we go to new jurisdictions, it puts us in a more competitive position because we have the financial capability to execute the projects we're proposing. And so all of these things are very helpful for us as we look for our business. When it comes to capital return, I think the idea of shrinking the share count of something we've talked about previously, where we think there's a benefit to doing so. We think there is a positive gearing towards share repurchases. We've been very aggressive over the last couple of quarters. We like to continue to shrink the share count over time. And to be fair, we're also a dividend payer. We think that's helpful to shareholder returns. As a S&P 500 member, we think it's good to have the dividend as well. So I think we have the free cash flow to continue to return of capital. We're very happy about that given our investment opportunities. We have the balance sheet strength, be able to develop a new jurisdictions. And so I think you're going to see a balance between growth and our ability to return capital over time. I think the nice thing is when we're done with the Londoner and we're done with some of the other -- with these major innovation projects in Singapore, given the growth that we're seeing, we'll have the ability, hopefully, to return more capital. And we'll have the ability to increase our program and benefit shareholders. So you'll see us do that over time as our business continues to operate and grow. And so I think the idea of shrinking the share count, I think we're in a good position to do it. I think we have a lot of liquidity out there in the market. We have a very strong ability to execute. So I think we're in good shape in terms of our program and the way that we approach it."

            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yes. I think you're right. The visitation recovery rate has actually reduced. So that's actually taking account of seasonality when you when you compare the visitation recovery versus second quarter of 2019, we're about 79%, but we were as high as 90%. 85% to 90% in the past 6 months in the past 2 quarters. So clearly, there has been, I think, more than just a seasonal slowdown. And that's particularly prominent in the visitation outside of Guangzhou. So that does impact, I think Rob referenced it earlier. It does impact, I think, the base mass business, especially that I'm ready to play. We don't know exactly why, but I think that is a clear feature of this quarter, and it does feed into, as we said, the base mass segment. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Yes, I think it's a mixture. Firstly, the business mix point that Patrick referenced. And secondly, because we were closing Pacifica Casino and getting ready for that, yes, there is, for a period of time, a high level of reinvestment as we prepare for that shift, which, as I talked about earlier, we did so very successfully, especially into the Parisian, but also the other properties. So those are the main factors affecting the reinvestment and the overall margin mix. But I think even though there are fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter, day-to-day, even in terms of tactical, I think we're very clear on our strategy which is that we will compete on the quality and the scale of our asset base. And of course, at this point in time, we're hampered because we have a number of our key assets out. But when those assets come back online, really from Q4 this year into 2025, we absolutely intend to be competing on that basis. because at that point, we not only have, I think, scale we always had, but the sheer quality of product that we'll have at that point at scale, I think that will be the fundamental difference from what we had before, and we intend to make full use of that in terms of competing for the market."

The Macao market continues to grow as it has each in the past five quarters. Since the reopening in early 2023, the annual run rate of the market has grown every quarter from $17 billion in Q1 of last year to $22 billion, then $24 billion and $26 billion, now reaching $28 billion in annualized gaming revenue. We remain confident -- so fully confident in the future growth of the Macao market. I've said in the past, Macao market will grow to $30 billion and then $35 billion and then $40 billion beyond in the years ahead, I remain steadfast in our belief. We remain equally confident in our business strategy to invest in both the quality and scale of our market-leading assets in Macao. Our capital investment programs ensure that we will continue to be the market leader in the years ahead. Our investments position us to grow faster than the market over the long term to grow our share of EBITDA in the market and to generate industry-leading returns on invested capital. Turning to our current financial results for Macao. We delivered a solid result for the quarter despite the disruption of our ongoing capital investment programs. SCL continues to lead the market in gaming and non-gaming revenue and most importantly, in the market share of EBITDA. Because of our market-leading investments, we will capture high-value, high-margin tourism over the long run. We have a unique competitive position in terms of scale, quality and diversity of product offerings. Upon completion of the second phase of the London and our co-tying redevelopment program, our product advantage will be more substantial than ever. Turning to Singapore, we delivered a record quarter. We believe it's a record for the industry. So the team there has done an extraordinary job, and this is what happens when a superior product is located in the proper market. Our financial results in Singapore reflect the impact of our capital investment programs and our service capabilities. The appeal of Singapore as its tourist and destination and the robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendar also contributed to the growth at MBS. As we complete the balance of our investment programs, there will be a lot more runway for growth in the future. Thanks for joining us today. I'll turn it over to Patrick for more details.\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks, Rob. Macao EBITDA was $610 million. If we had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been higher by $31 million. When adjusted for lower-than-expected holds in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin would have been 34.4%, or up 380 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023. This highlights our focus on cost discipline and profitability. The ongoing capital investment programs at The Londoner and at the Cotai Arena had an impact on our results this quarter. The Cotai Arena was closed for renovation in January this year. After the significant reinvestment and renovation, the arena is expected to reopen in November. In terms of the second phase of the Londoner, we have now commenced the room renovation on the first Sheraton. We plan the completion of the first tower by year-end and of the second tower by Golden Week in May of 2025. The renovation of the casino on the Sheraton side of London will commence in May of this year with the reopening scheduled for December of 2024. While there will be ongoing disruption from these capital projects, as these products come online between the end of '24 and the first half of '25, our competitive position will be stronger than ever. The scale, quality and diversity of product will be better than we have ever offered before. They will be unmatched in the market. Turning to Singapore, MBS and EBITDA came in at $597 million, an all-time record for the property and for the industry. Our strong results reflect the impact of high-quality investment and market-leading products. Had we held as expected in our Rolling Play segment, EBITDA would have been $77 million lower. Had we held as expected in the Rolling Play segment, MBS EBITDA margin would have been 49.1%, or 181 -- 180 basis points higher than in Q1 of 2023. We have now completed both Tower 1 and Tower 2 of the Marina Bay Sands hotel refurbishment. While we have substantially completed the original $1 billion CapEx program, we are still in initial stages of realizing the benefits of these new products. We have now commenced the next phase of our capital investment program at Marina Bay Sands. The $750 million renovation that includes Tower 3. Tower 3 is scheduled to be completed by the second quarter of next year. This will support further growth in 2025 and beyond. Turning to our program to return capital to shareholders. We repurchased $450 million of LVS stock during the quarter. We also paid our recurring quarterly dividend. In addition, LVS has completed the previously announced purchase of $250 million of SCL stock, which increases the parent company's ownership interest in SCL to approximately 71%. We continue to see value in both repurchasing LVS stock and increasing our ownership interest in SCL. We look forward to continuing to utilize the company's capital return program to increase return to shareholders in the future. Thanks again for joining the call today. Now, let's take some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Stephen, your line is live.\nStephen Grambling: Hey, thanks so much. You talked to the March higher for the market in Macau, but this quarter looks like the margin flow through and EBITDA actually went in the other direction. How should we be thinking about flow through in Macau and operating expenses going forward in that market?\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. I just want to say one thing before we turn it over to Grant. I think some of this has to do in Macau with some of the disruption that we experienced during the quarter. So when we take the arena in January, we lose the benefit of our entertainment programs during a peak period. That did have an impact. So when you look at our operation, you compare it to Q1 of last year, Q1 of last year, we were coming out of the pandemic and it really took a while for visitation to get started again. This year, unfortunately, we did this to ourselves. We started renovating our arena. It's a very powerful asset. It has lots of entertainment and went through the Chinese New Year period and unfortunately, with some hotel rooms out and the arena out, we felt on the revenue side. So as we've said before, as the market continues to grow, we will do well. We have the best product. We've invested the most in non-gaming assets. We have the most amenities to offer to our patrons and they're very high quality, diversity of retail, diversity of food and beverage, diversity of entertainment, which is very important. Unfortunately, we didn't have that tool this quarter in full swing. We only had the London arena, which is good, but it can't compete with the Cotai Arena. So I think for us, as the revenues continue to grow, as you've seen in prior quarters, our margins will fall in line. And you see that in the Venetian, as the revenues are where they need to be, the margins fall in line as well. So that's sort of the headline from the margin performance this quarter. I do want to turn it over to Grant to see if he has any additional color.\nGrant Chum: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. I think the most important point is still the GGR is growing in the market, and I think if you look at our profitability, at this level of GGR, I think we should be looking at low to mid-30s in operating margin -- EBITDA margin, and we're right at the high end of the range there. Obviously, each quarter there's seasonality relating to different parts of the business, the revenue mix. So first quarter, I think 34.4% in terms of underlying margin is a really good number. I think 2024 is going to be one that is impacted by our capital works and the renovations that Patrick referenced also in his opening remarks. We have obviously, started the hotel renovation in the first half of Sheraton, and down -- we're probably down about 500, 600 rooms in the first quarter on average in that hotel. But the number of keys that will be out of inventory will increase further in the second and third quarters. And of course, Cotai Arena, as Patrick referenced, that's always been a core part of our content programming, our content offering, and we were able to offer plenty of shows at the London Arena. But if you just compare -- just the sheer number of shows that we had in the first quarter, we had 12 shows compared with the fourth quarter last year, we had 31 shows. It's a big difference. And obviously, in terms of capacity, there's a big difference. So the attendance per show obviously was much higher in the fourth quarter as well. So hopefully, that gives you some color in terms of the disruption that had on our business with the arena being closed for renovation. And as I said, the hotel renovation is ongoing and you're going to see more keys out of inventory in the next couple of quarters.\nStephen Grambling: Got it. And maybe one clarification. I guess in the quarter, industry-wide, I'm not sure, maybe I missed this in the presentation or I haven't seen the slides, but is VIP -- the VIP actually grew faster than mass overall in the first quarter for the industry. And how are you thinking about base mass versus premium mass from here? I know you kind of touched on this a little bit, but would be curious about the industry-wide thought process.\nPatrick Dumont: Rob, should I take that?\nRobert Goldstein: Yes. Yes, please. Yes.\nPatrick Dumont: Yes, you're right. I think if you look at our slides, the mass revenues sequentially would be around 4%, and the overall GGR for the quarter grew at 6% sequentially. So yes, the VIP revenues in the market as a whole grew faster than the mass revenues Q-o-Q. I think in terms of the premium mass versus base mass, again, I think you can see it from our slides. Premium mass grew slightly faster for us in this quarter, but the difference is not material when you account for things like whole percentage and patron counts and so forth. So I wouldn't say, there's a material divergence in the growth rates between premium mass and base mass, and it's part of business for the quarter.\nRobert Goldstein: I think it's important to note that -- it's important that the visitation still isn't like it to be. Obviously, there's still millions of people have not come versus the 2019 visitation numbers. We believe long-term visitation GGRs did grow, whether it be base or premium, we'll get more than our fair share. And I think we've seen obviously, I'll say the obvious, the promotional situation the market has changed and more people incent doing things. And once everyone starts playing that game, I believe that will resolve itself. We believe that assets will prevail. We believe London will be extraordinary asset much like it's happening in Singapore. I think our results in Singapore reflect a fully developed program and the execution in Singapore shows what can be done. We have the right kind of assets. What we have even done in Singapore the number is extraordinary. The same will happen in our business in Macao in time. As DGOs accelerate and they will, visitation accelerates and it will. We'll continue to be margin-focused, even without focus, and get more than a fair share and assets will prevail over promotions from our perspective.\nStephen Grambling: Got it, thanks. I'll jump back in the queue. Appreciate it.\nRobert Goldstein: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Carlo, your line is live.\nCarlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thank you. Just following up on the first quarter margins. If I look at the fourth quarter, for example, and kind of extract the big element of turnover rent that comes in and obviously, very high flow through, it looks like margins are probably fairly similar. So it doesn't seem like a lot changed on that front. Is that accurate? Or am I missing something else seasonally there?\nRobert Goldstein: Primarily you're correct. That's a fair statement to make. The term red does, as you know, as you know to occur in the fourth quarter, and it's material. Grant, do you want to add to that?\nGrant Chum: Yes, it's accurate. You're right.\nCarlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you. And if I could, just one follow-up on capital allocation. Obviously, over $400 million of buyback in this quarter. As you guys think about the capital needs here going forward, the stuff that you've announced, the stuff that obviously, is being contemplated and looking for budgets around and whatnot. Do you feel like that this pace is adequate and where you want to be as you look throughout the balance of this year?\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. So I think first off, I just want to say we see value in both equities. And I think, we have a very long-term bullish view given the market opportunity for growth, our market-leading investments and our assets, and just how we feel about the opportunities in both markets that we have. So as we said before, we're going to be overweight share repurchases. As we think about future capital return, we are going to be more heavily weighted towards share repurchase and dividends. We think the repurchases are going to be more accretive than dividends over time and we want to shrink that denominator. And so I think we're going to look to make purchases that are consistent with our share authorization by the Board and with prior practice. And I think we'll look to be a little bit opportunistic. We may vary levels, but I think we're going to continue to be aggressive in the market. I mean, I think you see with the $450 million of LVS shares, the SCL share repurchases, we think this represents an interesting opportunity just a moment in time. And so we're going to try to take advantage of it. We happen to have a very strong balance sheet. We have a lot of liquidity and we tend to put it to use. So I think we're pretty happy with where the program has taken us so far -- both so far and we'll continue to use it and we'll see how it goes across the year. But we're going to look to repurchase more shares.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thanks for that, Patrick. Just one aside. Guys, I'm not sure the slides are actually posted yet. It certainly could be a user error, but it looks like that they haven't posted yet for the first quarter.\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah, we're working on it.\nCarlo Santarelli: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Joe Greff from J.P. Morgan. Joe, your line is live.\nJoe Greff: Hey, everybody. I was hoping one of you could maybe help quantify the revenue and EBITDA impact from the renovations going on at Londoner and Cotai Arena. And then do you see that renovation disruption impact accelerating, and when do you start to see that decelerate? I know you kind of talked about the two towers and when they open up, but to kind of help understand that renovation impact in terms of how you're seeing it, and I think would be helpful for everybody.\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. I don't know that we can necessarily quantify accurately what the impact was because we can't know what we displaced. You heard Grant describe the number of missing shows and the number of people typically will go to those shows in the Cotai Arena, and you get a sense of the type of high-quality patron that we bring in when we have live entertainment. And it is impactful. I think Q1 typically is a very powerful quarter for us as is Q4, and you kind of see the difference that the impact had for entertainment. We made a decision that if we take the arena offline and do it and make it the high -- one of the highest-quality arenas in Asia, then in the long run, we will benefit from the entertainment. And so we decided to do it as quickly as possible. And so that meant taking it offline in January this year and trying to get it done by October-November. And so once we do that, we're going to have an incredibly high-quality arena with amenities that we've never had before. So it will make us more competitive in the market and actually drive additional high-quality tourism from both traditional markets and other markets and will also help drive high-quality tourism from our core customer base and allow for more repeat visits from our high-value customers. We're very excited about the opportunities this new entertainment asset will present to us. Unfortunately, we're going to take some pain while it's offline, and that really started in January of this year. I can't quantify the exact amount, but you hear the count from Grant and you realize that it is not immaterial. And then the other side is, we're taking the shared it out. And when we're done, it's going to be one of our best properties in Macao. The design will be high-level. The fundamentals of the Sheraton Tower are quite good and both towers are quite good. They're actually a little bit better than the existing Londoner side, believe it or not. The layout of the casino will be very good. The additional food and beverage amenities that we can add. And I think the connectivity will be a very good driver of future results for that property. That's the reason why we're pretty confident that the result, when it's done, will be that or exceed that of the Venetian. So I think for us, we're doing it now. It is going to be disruptive. The worst is going to be across the summer when we have the lowest key count that we've had since we really opened what was then in Sands Cotai Central because we're taking out -- that we're going to take the Sheraton out. And so it's going to be more of this disruption across the summer. But then hopefully, as keys come back online across the phasing, and as we get the arena back, let's call it October-November, we'll have a much more powerful set of assets to drive tourism and create cash flow. So there will be disruption. I can't quantify it for you, but it's not going to be immaterial. Grant, I don't know if you have other things you'd like to add to that.\nGrant Chum: I think you covered it perfectly. I think the only thing I supplement is Londoner phase one really gave us that elevation in the shared quality of product, as well as a very successful rebranding and repositioning of the entire property. But what phase two gives us is that scale of high-quality product and the diversity of it. And that's when I think the earnings power of this resort will be fundamentally transformed.\nJoe Greff: Perfect. And\u2026\nRobert Goldstein: I believe what we think once Londoner -- we think once Londoner is done, Joe, we'll have the one and two -- number one and two assets in the GALP, by far. Not sure whether they'll be fully in front, but that company really gives us a unique positioning for '25 and the years ahead to dominate the market in terms of the largest resorts and those proper resorts, both one and two.\nJoe Greff: Great. Thanks, Rob. You may have answered my follow-up question indirectly on your prior margin commentary, and maybe this is something Grant could talk about. But can you talk about the level of the markets, premium mass reinvestment levels? Has that been pretty consistent in the first quarter? And what you're seeing year to date versus how the end of the year finished? Or is there any kind of trend change on that front? That's all for me. Thanks.\nGrant Chum: Thanks, Joe. For us, yes, our profitability, the structure of a margin in every segment actually, quarter-on-quarter very consistent. No significant changes there. And that obviously, fed through to the result that the earlier question described, which is that we had a very consistent margin quarter-on-quarter despite obviously, some inflation in the payroll costs due to holiday pay and salary increases.\nJoe Greff: Yeah. My question -- maybe I didn't explain it that clearly. The level of premium mass reinvestment from your competitors, how would you characterize that year to date versus the end of last year?\nGrant Chum: Oh. Sorry. You're talking about the overall market now.\nJoe Greff: Yes.\nRobert Goldstein: Direct investment invested to customers.\nPatrick Dumont: I think the promotion activities levels are relatively intense right now. Is it higher than Q4, I don't think so, but it comes and goes and goes up and has ups and downs. But I think over time, there really isn't any necessity in this market to be too aggressive on promotions. The demand and supply, supply-constrained market, the quality of supply is exceptional, and we are a big contributor to that. And as GGR rises, that becomes even less of an issue over time. And for us, it doesn't matter. We stick to our strategy, which is as Rob referenced product based is driven off our asset base. The upgrades we're making, the quality of the assets and the services that go with that in addition to the programming -- the content programming, and like we talked about, we're very big believers in that entertainment being co-offering. That's why we're investing this $200 million in the upgrade of Cotai Arena. So -- yeah, when it's all said and done, we believe that GGR continues to rise, our asset base is going to be better than before and better than ever. And that's the way we're going to compete and that's the only way we think we can compete on a sustainable and profitable basis is really based on the quality execution of a product and the service that go with that.\nJoe Greff: Thank you.\nRobert Goldstein: Joe, we're obviously, keenly aware of the commercial environment down. We're certainly aware of what's happening with Macao promotions, but we remain steadfast. I believe that our product, once completed, will be superior. The scale is greater. The market will grow, and that's how we'll capture our fair share and remain focused on margins and keeping our EBITDA once again. So we're not going to play the game of chasing $10 more for promotions. We don't think it's our business and who we are. We're an asset-driven company with quality assets and scale. And again, we've proven that time and time again, and once Londoner is done, the arena will be just want to be in terms of market leading and margin of the assets and the cap.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Shaun, your line is live.\nShaun Kelley: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Sorry if I'm beating the dead horse here, but I did want to just kind of stick with the margin commentary, but I'll give it a little bit of a longer-term view. My question is really just trying to get a sense of what would it take to get back to let's call it the mid to high thirties on margins here. Is what we're seeing today and now increasingly expecting for the balance of '24 more about customer mix? Or is it about sort of one time callouts around renovations and maybe some lost very high-margin non-gaming revenue?\nPatrick Dumont: So it's a very interesting question, and it's the right question to ask. So as these properties reach run rates so as they reach their full potential, the margin should be upper 30s [Technical Difficulty] Sorry. I think someone in Sands China put us on hold. Please excuse us. So we think about margins in the upper thirties. If you look at the performance of the Venetian, that's a good benchmark, right? It was impacted a little bit this quarter, again, also by the entertainment not being there in the Cotai Arena, but -- and mix-wise, to be fair, pre-pandemic, it had more mass play and that's a higher margin. And so as tourism returns, so as visitation increases, which has more mass play, and we have plenty of capacity for it. So if you look at our asset base, the scale of the assets, the food and beverage we have, the amenities we have, we can accommodate a lot of mass play, and we have the positions to do it. And so for us, as visitation shows up and continues to on an upward trend, our assets are ready to take that visitation, revenue will grow, margins will grow, and they will normalize back towards a more traditional mix. That being said, the Londoner has the opportunity to also bring a lot of high-value tourism. So we're carrying the expense base without the revenue, right? So we have the team members, we have the -- we have all the things going on that you have, that we're fully operating, but it's not fully operating at. So the margins naturally are not going to look right. So as the revenue comes in and as the visitation comes in, as the patrons come in, as the hotel is completed, and as the rest of the amenities are done, that will look more normal. The only problem is it's in '25. So we have a little bit of time that we have to get through with this investment. Are there some high-value things that are very high margin that we're missing because of entertainment or keys out, yes, that's true. But when you look at the asset base that we have, the experience that we have, the team that we have there, their ability to execute and how they've executed so far, and the asset base that we're creating with these investments, we're going to be in a great position. And the margins, we believe, will get there. So we need visitation to continue. That will be helpful for the Venetian. It'll be helpful for the mass to recover. We need to have all of our assets in line. So that's the Cotai Arena to be finished and the Sheraton to become fully Londonerized, that's a word, and get to our full key count. And then you'll see the true power of these assets and the margins will get there. We have a lifestyle program that we run with high-quality amenities. If you haven't been to Macau and you haven't seen what we've done, I would encourage you to do it. It's not simply one thing. It's not simply hospitality. It's not simply gaming. It's not simply retail. It's an ecosystem that allows our customers to travel around all of our assets and have an experience they can't get anyplace else. And that's really what we have on offer and it's unique, and it's been invested in and it will continue to get better. So for us, as Rob said, we're not chasing promotional activity. We're chasing asset development, and that will drive our success.\nShaun Kelley: Thanks, Patrick, and appreciate the insight. As a quick follow-up for whoever as appropriate. Just looking at Singapore, I mean, obviously, a breakout quarter with a run rate above $500 million. There were some one time things in that market, Taylor Swift, I believe, being one and then, of course, which I think you called out event activity broadly speaking. But also there's a change in, I think, Chinese visa policies that was probably potentially fruitful for the market. So just the big question here is, what's the right run rate? And do you think again, maybe event activity agnostic we could sustain above the $500 million mark? And are we kind of off to the race here? And notwithstanding the fact that even that number sounds like it included a little bit of tower three disruption.\nRobert Goldstein: I think the first thing you should note is that the building is still under renovation. I think we believe $500 million a quarter annualized is very durable and more. And the most important thing you should note is two things. The growth in Singapore as a desirable destination is soaring. It's not just Taylor Swift. It's Bruno Mars. It's the Hamilton show. It's endless events, F1. It's a juggernaut. And really, it's become accelerated. This market has become very special in a very short order. And I think that's attributed to government there and the programs happening, entertainment, et cetera. So Singapore is highly desirable, and yes, that's very sustainable. And as good as Taylor Swift was, there's a lot more in the pipeline that will make that continue. Secondly, our building has less than 200 top tier suites. Upon completion, we'll have an excess of 700. The suite-spot on the market is the premium mass and super premium mass, rolling, non-rolling. We can't -- I think we're almost approaching a billion dollars a slot when we may be out of bullets there as we get more capacity. But this is a very special market. Our building is a special building. I don't think there's any reason to doubt that 520, 540, 600. Look, this may keep growing. This is a great place to be. We're lucky to be there. We're lucky that the government is very supportive and excellent team in place. But most importantly, the assets, it didn't happen by luck. We are doing -- spending a lot of money to make sure those assets are superb and the customers come back time and time again. The real question is what happens when the building has four wheels instead of three? That's going to happen later this year, in early 2025, when those suites are rolled out and they are great suites. They are phenomenal suites. Can that building go to two-two, two-four, two-five, it can and it will. And I think, again, what we're trying to tell you about Macau is we're frustrated by Macau. The operating environment is more difficult. We're under construction a self-inflicted wound. But once we emulate in Macau and we've done in Singapore, the same thing will prevail. Londoner I wish neck and neck to drive that market. And again, I think the government recently talked about a lot of things they're trying to do. Increase tourism and visas, et cetera. We see a real nice support system coming out of now, and we're grateful to the government for recognizing a session this week about increased tourism, increased entertainment. We're lucky to be in two very, very special places, and, yes, Singapore can do 500, they can do 550. It's not about Taylor Swift. It's about a great market, a great asset, and a team running it.\nShaun Kelley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS. Robin, your line is live.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to circle back. You were commenting earlier and the slides were not up yet so I haven't been able to go through them. But it sounded like you were saying that your sequential growth in mass and premium were both at a similar rate sequentially. And just wondering if there's anything to add any color around that since, you know, the market has generally speaking been seeing better premium mass recovery. Just any color you'd add there.\nPatrick Dumont: Grant, I think you should take that. Grant?\nGrant Chum: Yeah, Robin. I don't know if the deck is up.\nPatrick Dumont: It's up now.\nRobert Goldstein: It's up now, I mean.\nPatrick Dumont: It's up, guys. Yes.\nGrant Chum: Yeah. So if you look at a premium mass win, we're up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and base maths were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. But I think my point earlier is the difference that's here and there could be related to any number of I think non-substantive factors. So I wouldn't describe this as a divergence in trend, but this quarter we just did slightly better in premium mass versus base mass. Visitations continue just like see the wider market growing. Our property visitations actually grew sequentially as well. So nothing significant to remark on in terms of the segment divergence.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And just any thoughts around New York timing and your expectations there? Sort of anything new to add there? Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. But we're very disappointed by New York. I mean, we've been working there for a long time and we thought it was going to happen in '24. That was the state. Now they're saying '25 or '26, but I don't think we have any real clarity. And to be honest with you, it's confusing and disappointing because we've done a lot of work in New York and a lot of time into it. So I have no guidance because I don't really know what to tell you with candor and insight. Just don't know about New York. And it's just wish -- we wish they figured it out and let us know. We just don't know. So we'll remain hopeful that things turn around there.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you.\nRobert Goldstein: Thanks, Robin.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Vitaly Umansky from Seaport. Vitaly, your line is live.\nVitaly Umansky: Hi. Good morning, guys. I think maybe switching over to Singapore if we think about kind of the quantifying the effect of what the renovations at that property have already done, and Rob, you talked about potentially this property getting up to about $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion. In theory, once the renovations are done in the first phase of the property, where do we see kind of constraints being built in? Because if you look at kind of occupancy rates in the hotel rooms today and we look at ADRs, they continue to expand. At some point, we're going to reach a limit as to how many rooms can be filled, and then we're talking about trying to fill rooms with higher-value customers. So when we think about before we get to the expansion, where is that constraint, and how quickly do you think we can get there?\nRobert Goldstein: It's a good question. I think unfortunately, it's probably an answer that we've seen that we never dreamed slots with a billion dollars on property that they're approaching that. We never dreamed that in this environment. So quickly after COVID, we reached the kind of epic levels we're seeing. The growth in the premium mass is powerful and I was enjoying Grant on the call last week telling us it's still a drop in the bucket. There's so much more to go. And so I think the growth will come out of this super premium mass, both rolling, non-rolling. I don't think ADR is all that impactful because hopefully someday we won't sell many rooms. This will be a product that is mostly gaming customers in the rooms. I hope the suites we're building are just exemplary. And I think that this product is only going to have more good days ahead. I used to do five as a goal for our Company as the decade progresses and it's very attainable. It reached $600 million almost this quarter in actual is very stimulating. It's very exciting. But the cash in capacity, it's already a problem for us in terms of slot machines. It will be a room problem. We wish you had more exposure to Singapore that's why we're building more products. This is a very, very special place that people gravitate to. And as Singapore does its job as a lifestyle, entertainment, exciting place to visit, demands have grown. So the only concern we have in Singapore is how quickly we get there. Once these fleets are unleashed in the market, they see it. I think we'll have some very bright days ahead. But obviously, it's a capacity constraint. You only have so many rooms, only have so many slot machines, and I don't worry about getting there. I just think we get there, we'll be disappointed can't have more exposure, and that's why we're building phase two.\nPatrick Dumont: Hey, Vitaly, one thing, and welcome back to the call. I think the key thing for us is we have a very strong view of the future success of Singapore. So strong that we're investing a couple of billion dollars in this property and we're looking to do IR2 as quickly as we can. We think that this market is benefiting from a lot of the factors that make Singapore, great infrastructure, strong, stable government, great investment, great policy. And to be fair, you're seeing the result of it. And it's only our business, as many businesses in Singapore. And so I think that that's a very helpful indicator. But more importantly, the more other investment that goes into Singapore will help drive further visitation. So the infrastructure is already there. The real question is how many more hotel rooms will go in. We feel very strongly that the more hotel rooms are added will help add to the critical mass of tourism that Singapore already has today. If you look at the wealth creation going around in Southeast Asia, it's pretty substantial. The last four years, even during the pandemic and they're pretty meaningful. And there are a lot of customers that are new to Singapore, new to Marina Bay Sands, and they're affluent and very successful, and they want to consume and they want to take advantage of the Singapore -- things Singapore has on offer. And so we feel very strongly about the future visitation in Singapore. It's an interesting question, where is the peak of demand? We don't really see it right now. What we see is a supply constraint, right? When you look at who is trying to come to Singapore and the activities that are going on, we feel very strongly about future investment. We think it's there.\nVitaly Umansky: Thanks, Patrick and Rob. Maybe just a follow-up, switching gears to Macau. And Grant, you talked a little bit about kind of the base mass and the growth you've seen in the quarter is very similar to premium. But I think overall, if we kind of think about sands in Macau, obviously, you're very strong in the direct VIP business, you're very strong in the premium business, but where you have a massive competitive advantage? In my view, it's just your scale, which then talks about base mass and the higher margin available from base mass. If you look at the recovery in overall base mass, it has not been as strong as the more premium end of the market. Can you maybe give an explanation as to why you think that is, if you agree with that statement, and then how does the market maybe change, or need to change over the next couple of quarters in order to get some of that base mass back, which I think would benefit Sands relative to others in a much stronger way?\nGrant Chum: Yes. Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: Grant, go ahead.\nGrant Chum: Yeah. Yeah, sure, Patrick. Yeah, I'll take it. And I think first point is your -- I agree we have a huge advantage with our scale, but I think the scale advantage speaks to all the segments. I think if you looked at historically, how the company has developed absolutely the base mask with our scale, that has been a core advantage. But in the sense of how we described all of these capital investments that we're making, especially in Londoner, the scale we have on the quality of the premium product is really unprecedented. So I think scale advantage will apply to all segments, in my view. Specifically on base mass, if you look at our actual numbers, the way we break it out between premium mass and base mass through the recovery since the reopening after the COVID restrictions, actually they're not too dissimilar now in terms of rate of recovery from a volume and revenue perspective. But it is true that in terms of customer count patron hours, we're still missing more from the base mass. So really it's two things it tells you. One is the quality of patronage has risen significantly because the revenue per patron is higher than before COVID. And secondly, there is still room for that base mass revenue and visitation to further recover. And I think there are many reasons and it's hard to specifically attribute to one or two factors, but I think over time, especially as the economy improves and also so I think people -- the distribution of content in terms of the lifestyle, the destination attractions, all of the events, all of the non-gaming products and assets and events that are actually distributed out there, I think you see a progressive improvement in that base mass segment. And obviously, we will be -- obviously, best placed to capture that growth when that comes.\nVitaly Umansky: Thanks, Grant. That's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Chad, your line is live.\nChad Beynon: Afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for posting the slides. On Slide 44, the flags of interest remain the same as what we've seen in the past couple of decks, Macau, Singapore, New York, and you've talked through all these. There's been some recent discussions around Thailand and some even think that an integrated resort could open in Thailand, maybe even ahead of Japan. So wondering if you could opine on your views. I know early, but could this market be big enough? Could a resort generate the cash flow meaningful enough for you guys to look at the market? Any views there? Thanks.\nRobert Goldstein: Yeah. We absolutely have interest in Thailand. To your point, it could happen quicker than Japan. I think it's conceivable. It's early days, though we still have work to do with the numbers and understanding it. It's a very, very exciting market in a lot of levels, and just the sheer size of population, the accessibility and the willingness of people travel to Thailand, it's obviously, I think, number one resort destination city in Asia. So, yeah, we're very interested. But again, it's early days. I agree with your comments. It could be faster than Japan, which is possible. Certainly, there's usually a lot of pent-up desire from both business and government to work towards us. So we're interested, we're listening. We're doing the work to find out what makes sense for us there and we'll keep you posted.\nChad Beynon: Thank you. And then on the P&L statement, investors are increasingly looking at EPS just given what you're generating and where the stock is trading. I believe there was a tax benefit in Q1. Could you talk to that potential benefit? And then any additional color in terms of will the tax rate start to look similar to what we saw in prior years, given your mix of Singapore and Macau? Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: I'll answer this in reverse. Yes, it will look more normal. It was a one-time item. It was related to reversal in Macau, $57 million. But the tax rate will look more normal going forward.\nChad Beynon: Thanks, Patrick. Appreciate it, guys.\nPatrick Dumont: No problem.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies. David, your line is live.\nDavid Katz: Hi. Evening. Thanks for taking my questions. When we look at the Macao strategy in view of the renovations that are going on this year, I would think about, you know, reinvestment credit referral programs that people are talking about. What's your philosophy on those this year? And do you dial them back until next year? Or how should we think about that?\nRobert Goldstein: I'm just trying to understand your question. Will we dial back our investment programs because we're under renovation? Is that your question?\nDavid Katz: That's right. Level of conservatism versus aggressiveness and sort of how you\u2026\nRobert Goldstein: No, no. We're not going to -- we will not dial back. We just may not be as aggressive as some of, you know, the competitive pressures on the commercial front right now, it's been talked about quite a bit. We're not believers in that approach. We believe we make our buildings the best in class. We have the scale. We have a lifestyle product. We just believe long-term GGRs will grow. We'll participate in that. We'll be very, very here into good margins, and that's an important part of business. But no, we won't dial back our current reinvestment strategy. We won't necessarily dial it up either to compete in the market right now. So this will be a year of reinvestment, as Patrick and Grant alluded to, both the arena and the Londoner. But we're not going to pull back. If anything, we'll stay consistent.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. And I wanted to just ask about, you know, one of the slides we show your maturities, you know forthcoming '25-'26, any sort of updated thoughts about, you know, how or when you're approaching those. And that's it for me. Thanks.\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. So, you know, we're going to look to deal with. So if you go to Page 32, which is the page I think you're referring to, and you look at the LVS maturities, we should deal with those in short order. That's kind of our intent. And then in August of '25, we have the $8 billion that you see at the SEL level, and we'll address those in due time. We mentioned that we wanted to bring down our total debt level in at SEL given that we borrowed during the pandemic so you'll see us reduce the quantum of debt there. And then as part of the MDS credit facility, we'll address that in course along with the IR2 start. So that's kind of how we'll deal with our capital structure. You'll see us turn that out as we've done previously.\nDavid Katz: Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Daniel Politzer from Wells Fargo. Daniel, you're line is live.\nDaniel Politzer: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First one on Macau. This is, I think, the second quarter in a row your mass shares declined a little bit. Obviously, there was a lot of different factors this quarter, but if you could kind of maybe give us a little bit more color. Is this really just disruption, heightened promotional levels? Or is there a difference in the customer that you're seeing coming into the market, or maybe something else altogether that's kind of driving the market share shifts we're seeing on the mass side?\nPatrick Dumont: Yeah. I do want to point out before Grant answers this question, that when we have less revenue because of disruption, we'll have less market share. So I do want to point out that with the arena being out with less revenue and a slightly lower margin because of the impact, having some hotel rooms out, that our market share will be impacted because it's the same thing. So with that, I'll just turn it over to Grant.\nGrant Chum: Yeah. I think it's hard to say which factors. I mean, you have a promotion environment out there that people have been talking about and that Rob reference you have, obviously, the disruptions that we've encountered because of our own projects. But on the other hand, it's also just looking at a very short time period here and there. So, yes, our mass revenues were flat for the quarter and the market grew 3%, 4%. But there's also a lot of factors that could have swung our way during the quarter and we would have been much closer to the market growth rate. So I wouldn't draw too big a conclusion from that. If you look at historically how we've sustained our share of EBITDA in a pre-pandemic, the market shares fluctuate, but we always end up back in that low to mid-30s range in terms of EBITDA share. And to be fair, let's look at a longer time frame, let's look at the scorecard for 2023, we achieved 35% EBITDA share against a GGR share of 26%. We were leaders in GGR, yes, but we were, by a much bigger margin, the leader in EBITDA share as well as non-gaming revenues, where we had 41% of the share of the market. So in aggregate, for the year, if you look at revenue gaming, non-gaming EBITDA, I think our performance has been solid. But quarter to quarter, obviously there will be fluctuations depending on those factors that we just discussed.\nDaniel Politzer: Got it. And then just for the follow-up, I think you guys have gone up to 71% share of 1928 HK. I mean, can you talk about maybe where that goes over time? Is there an upper limit there and maybe some of the puts and takes to increasing that ownership stake?\nPatrick Dumont: So I think there's an upper limit of 75% by exchange rules, although they do give waivers based on the size of the equity, depending on the name. For us, I think, as I said before, SEL is investing a lot for the future. It has a bright future ahead of it, and we'd like to own more of it. So you'll see us be aggressive, and I think where we stand, we see value in the stocks today meaningfully. So that is a repeat of what we said before, but I think you understand our conviction.\nDaniel Politzer: Understood. Thank you.\nRobert Goldstein: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Colin Mansfield from CBRE Institutional Research. Colin, your line is live.\nColin Mansfield: Hey, everybody, thanks for taking my call, and congratulations on getting the last rating up to investment grade during the quarter. Maybe following on to David's question about the refinancing, maybe just an updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the subordinated term loan down at Sands China. And I know there's a lot of liquidity up at the parent, but how are you guys thinking about timing of potentially taking that out of the capital structure down there? And then I have one follow-up on ratings.\nPatrick Dumont: Sure. I think you'll see us deal with LBS maturities and the SEL 25s before you see any activity around the LVS [Indiscernible] term loan down to SEL. The one thing I'd like to point out is that it benefits SEL. It's a very favorable loan and allows them to have high-quality financing deeply subordinated at a favorable rate. So from that standpoint, the maturity is '28, and we'll see how it goes with SEL and what their needs are and kind of go from there. But I think we have ample liquidity up at parent co we believe to do what we need.\nColin Mansfield: Great. Thanks, Patrick. And then just one follow-up on ratings. I mean, obviously, the company fully back at investment grade now. And I think with the development pipeline that you guys do have ahead of you, I'd just be curious how you're thinking about any sort of change to financial policy as it relates to target ratings. I think this is one of the companies that could eventually get to mid-BBB if you guys so desired. So I guess how do you guys balance any sort of desire to have those levels of ratings as it relates to cost of capital relative to obviously, the development pipeline you have ahead of yourself?\nPatrick Dumont: Thanks. So I think as we look back pre-pandemic, we spent five years working towards investment grade. We think it's very important for us to actually be investment grade. It gives us access to the largest most liquid debt market in the world, gives us a very efficient cost of capital, which in the long run provides us flexibility, but really drives returns on new projects. We have this investment rate balance sheet. It helps us in new jurisdictions. You heard Rob talk about several of them. We have the financial capability to execute on these projects. Our financial policy always been that we like gross leverage to be between 2 times and 3 times. You know, we've said this for many years. Nothing has really changed. It's our consistent view. I think over time, we're going to delever just because of EBITDA expansion. If you look what happened at MBS, it occurred, and our belief is that it will continue to occur at Sands China as well. So I think for us, the investment grade is very important. That gross leverage parameter of 2 times or 3 times is consistent with prior statement, prior practice. And I actually think, you know, we're very favorably levered on a net basis and on a gross basis, and we're looking forward to doing some new development. And I think that will fit within our leverage profile based on sort of the prior discussions that we've had about progression of funding and EBITDA development. So we're very focused on it. We think we can handle our new development, our investment, our existing assets, and have a very healthy return of capital program while balancing all these things and having investment grade balance sheet. That's our goal and that's our view.\nColin Mansfield: Great. Thanks again, guys, for -- thanks again for taking the question, and congrats again on getting fully back to IHE.\nPatrick Dumont: Appreciate it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Robert Goldstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan, and thanks for joining us today. The Macao market continues to grow as it has each in the past five quarters. Since the reopening in early 2023, the annual run rate of the market has grown every quarter from $17 billion in Q1 of last year to $22 billion, then $24 billion and $26 billion, now reaching $28 billion in annualized gaming revenue. We remain confident -- so fully confident in the future growth of the Macao market. I've said in the past, Macao market will grow to $30 billion and then $35 billion and then $40 billion beyond in the years ahead, I remain steadfast in our belief. We remain equally confident in our business strategy to invest in both the quality and scale of our market-leading assets in Macao. Our capital investment programs ensure that we will continue to be the market leader in the years ahead. Our investments position us to grow faster than the market over the long term to grow our share of EBITDA in the market and to generate industry-leading returns on invested capital. Turning to our current financial results for Macao. We delivered a solid result for the quarter despite the disruption of our ongoing capital investment programs. SCL continues to lead the market in gaming and non-gaming revenue and most importantly, in the market share of EBITDA. Because of our market-leading investments, we will capture high-value, high-margin tourism over the long run. We have a unique competitive position in terms of scale, quality and diversity of product offerings. Upon completion of the second phase of the London and our co-tying redevelopment program, our product advantage will be more substantial than ever. Turning to Singapore, we delivered a record quarter. We believe it's a record for the industry. So the team there has done an extraordinary job, and this is what happens when a superior product is located in the proper market. Our financial results in Singapore reflect the impact of our capital investment programs and our service capabilities. The appeal of Singapore as its tourist and destination and the robust entertainment and lifestyle event calendar also contributed to the growth at MBS. As we complete the balance of our investment programs, there will be a lot more runway for growth in the future. Thanks for joining us today. I'll turn it over to Patrick for more details. Yes. Yes, please. Yes. I think it's important to note that -- it's important that the visitation still isn't like it to be. Obviously, there's still millions of people have not come versus the 2019 visitation numbers. We believe long-term visitation GGRs did grow, whether it be base or premium, we'll get more than our fair share. And I think we've seen obviously, I'll say the obvious, the promotional situation the market has changed and more people incent doing things. And once everyone starts playing that game, I believe that will resolve itself. We believe that assets will prevail. We believe London will be extraordinary asset much like it's happening in Singapore. I think our results in Singapore reflect a fully developed program and the execution in Singapore shows what can be done. We have the right kind of assets. What we have even done in Singapore the number is extraordinary. The same will happen in our business in Macao in time. As DGOs accelerate and they will, visitation accelerates and it will. We'll continue to be margin-focused, even without focus, and get more than a fair share and assets will prevail over promotions from our perspective. Thank you. Primarily you're correct. That's a fair statement to make. The term red does, as you know, as you know to occur in the fourth quarter, and it's material. Grant, do you want to add to that? I believe what we think once Londoner -- we think once Londoner is done, Joe, we'll have the one and two -- number one and two assets in the GALP, by far. Not sure whether they'll be fully in front, but that company really gives us a unique positioning for '25 and the years ahead to dominate the market in terms of the largest resorts and those proper resorts, both one and two. Direct investment invested to customers. Joe, we're obviously, keenly aware of the commercial environment down. We're certainly aware of what's happening with Macao promotions, but we remain steadfast. I believe that our product, once completed, will be superior. The scale is greater. The market will grow, and that's how we'll capture our fair share and remain focused on margins and keeping our EBITDA once again. So we're not going to play the game of chasing $10 more for promotions. We don't think it's our business and who we are. We're an asset-driven company with quality assets and scale. And again, we've proven that time and time again, and once Londoner is done, the arena will be just want to be in terms of market leading and margin of the assets and the cap. I think the first thing you should note is that the building is still under renovation. I think we believe $500 million a quarter annualized is very durable and more. And the most important thing you should note is two things. The growth in Singapore as a desirable destination is soaring. It's not just Taylor Swift. It's Bruno Mars. It's the Hamilton show. It's endless events, F1. It's a juggernaut. And really, it's become accelerated. This market has become very special in a very short order. And I think that's attributed to government there and the programs happening, entertainment, et cetera. So Singapore is highly desirable, and yes, that's very sustainable. And as good as Taylor Swift was, there's a lot more in the pipeline that will make that continue. Secondly, our building has less than 200 top tier suites. Upon completion, we'll have an excess of 700. The suite-spot on the market is the premium mass and super premium mass, rolling, non-rolling. We can't -- I think we're almost approaching a billion dollars a slot when we may be out of bullets there as we get more capacity. But this is a very special market. Our building is a special building. I don't think there's any reason to doubt that 520, 540, 600. Look, this may keep growing. This is a great place to be. We're lucky to be there. We're lucky that the government is very supportive and excellent team in place. But most importantly, the assets, it didn't happen by luck. We are doing -- spending a lot of money to make sure those assets are superb and the customers come back time and time again. The real question is what happens when the building has four wheels instead of three? That's going to happen later this year, in early 2025, when those suites are rolled out and they are great suites. They are phenomenal suites. Can that building go to two-two, two-four, two-five, it can and it will. And I think, again, what we're trying to tell you about Macau is we're frustrated by Macau. The operating environment is more difficult. We're under construction a self-inflicted wound. But once we emulate in Macau and we've done in Singapore, the same thing will prevail. Londoner I wish neck and neck to drive that market. And again, I think the government recently talked about a lot of things they're trying to do. Increase tourism and visas, et cetera. We see a real nice support system coming out of now, and we're grateful to the government for recognizing a session this week about increased tourism, increased entertainment. We're lucky to be in two very, very special places, and, yes, Singapore can do 500, they can do 550. It's not about Taylor Swift. It's about a great market, a great asset, and a team running it. It's up now, I mean. Thanks, Robin. It's a good question. I think unfortunately, it's probably an answer that we've seen that we never dreamed slots with a billion dollars on property that they're approaching that. We never dreamed that in this environment. So quickly after COVID, we reached the kind of epic levels we're seeing. The growth in the premium mass is powerful and I was enjoying Grant on the call last week telling us it's still a drop in the bucket. There's so much more to go. And so I think the growth will come out of this super premium mass, both rolling, non-rolling. I don't think ADR is all that impactful because hopefully someday we won't sell many rooms. This will be a product that is mostly gaming customers in the rooms. I hope the suites we're building are just exemplary. And I think that this product is only going to have more good days ahead. I used to do five as a goal for our Company as the decade progresses and it's very attainable. It reached $600 million almost this quarter in actual is very stimulating. It's very exciting. But the cash in capacity, it's already a problem for us in terms of slot machines. It will be a room problem. We wish you had more exposure to Singapore that's why we're building more products. This is a very, very special place that people gravitate to. And as Singapore does its job as a lifestyle, entertainment, exciting place to visit, demands have grown. So the only concern we have in Singapore is how quickly we get there. Once these fleets are unleashed in the market, they see it. I think we'll have some very bright days ahead. But obviously, it's a capacity constraint. You only have so many rooms, only have so many slot machines, and I don't worry about getting there. I just think we get there, we'll be disappointed can't have more exposure, and that's why we're building phase two. Yeah. We absolutely have interest in Thailand. To your point, it could happen quicker than Japan. I think it's conceivable. It's early days, though we still have work to do with the numbers and understanding it. It's a very, very exciting market in a lot of levels, and just the sheer size of population, the accessibility and the willingness of people travel to Thailand, it's obviously, I think, number one resort destination city in Asia. So, yeah, we're very interested. But again, it's early days. I agree with your comments. It could be faster than Japan, which is possible. Certainly, there's usually a lot of pent-up desire from both business and government to work towards us. So we're interested, we're listening. We're doing the work to find out what makes sense for us there and we'll keep you posted. I'm just trying to understand your question. Will we dial back our investment programs because we're under renovation? Is that your question? No, no. We're not going to -- we will not dial back. We just may not be as aggressive as some of, you know, the competitive pressures on the commercial front right now, it's been talked about quite a bit. We're not believers in that approach. We believe we make our buildings the best in class. We have the scale. We have a lifestyle product. We just believe long-term GGRs will grow. We'll participate in that. We'll be very, very here into good margins, and that's an important part of business. But no, we won't dial back our current reinvestment strategy. We won't necessarily dial it up either to compete in the market right now. So this will be a year of reinvestment, as Patrick and Grant alluded to, both the arena and the Londoner. But we're not going to pull back. If anything, we'll stay consistent. Thanks, Dan."

            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Macao EBITDA was $610 million. If we had held as expected in our rolling program, our EBITDA would have been higher by $31 million. When adjusted for lower-than-expected holds in the rolling segment, our EBITDA margin would have been 34.4%, or up 380 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023. This highlights our focus on cost discipline and profitability. The ongoing capital investment programs at The Londoner and at the Cotai Arena had an impact on our results this quarter. The Cotai Arena was closed for renovation in January this year. After the significant reinvestment and renovation, the arena is expected to reopen in November. In terms of the second phase of the Londoner, we have now commenced the room renovation on the first Sheraton. We plan the completion of the first tower by year-end and of the second tower by Golden Week in May of 2025. The renovation of the casino on the Sheraton side of London will commence in May of this year with the reopening scheduled for December of 2024. While there will be ongoing disruption from these capital projects, as these products come online between the end of '24 and the first half of '25, our competitive position will be stronger than ever. The scale, quality and diversity of product will be better than we have ever offered before. They will be unmatched in the market. Turning to Singapore, MBS and EBITDA came in at $597 million, an all-time record for the property and for the industry. Our strong results reflect the impact of high-quality investment and market-leading products. Had we held as expected in our Rolling Play segment, EBITDA would have been $77 million lower. Had we held as expected in the Rolling Play segment, MBS EBITDA margin would have been 49.1%, or 181 -- 180 basis points higher than in Q1 of 2023. We have now completed both Tower 1 and Tower 2 of the Marina Bay Sands hotel refurbishment. While we have substantially completed the original $1 billion CapEx program, we are still in initial stages of realizing the benefits of these new products. We have now commenced the next phase of our capital investment program at Marina Bay Sands. The $750 million renovation that includes Tower 3. Tower 3 is scheduled to be completed by the second quarter of next year. This will support further growth in 2025 and beyond. Turning to our program to return capital to shareholders. We repurchased $450 million of LVS stock during the quarter. We also paid our recurring quarterly dividend. In addition, LVS has completed the previously announced purchase of $250 million of SCL stock, which increases the parent company's ownership interest in SCL to approximately 71%. We continue to see value in both repurchasing LVS stock and increasing our ownership interest in SCL. We look forward to continuing to utilize the company's capital return program to increase return to shareholders in the future. Thanks again for joining the call today. Now, let's take some questions. Yeah. I just want to say one thing before we turn it over to Grant. I think some of this has to do in Macau with some of the disruption that we experienced during the quarter. So when we take the arena in January, we lose the benefit of our entertainment programs during a peak period. That did have an impact. So when you look at our operation, you compare it to Q1 of last year, Q1 of last year, we were coming out of the pandemic and it really took a while for visitation to get started again. This year, unfortunately, we did this to ourselves. We started renovating our arena. It's a very powerful asset. It has lots of entertainment and went through the Chinese New Year period and unfortunately, with some hotel rooms out and the arena out, we felt on the revenue side. So as we've said before, as the market continues to grow, we will do well. We have the best product. We've invested the most in non-gaming assets. We have the most amenities to offer to our patrons and they're very high quality, diversity of retail, diversity of food and beverage, diversity of entertainment, which is very important. Unfortunately, we didn't have that tool this quarter in full swing. We only had the London arena, which is good, but it can't compete with the Cotai Arena. So I think for us, as the revenues continue to grow, as you've seen in prior quarters, our margins will fall in line. And you see that in the Venetian, as the revenues are where they need to be, the margins fall in line as well. So that's sort of the headline from the margin performance this quarter. I do want to turn it over to Grant to see if he has any additional color. Rob, should I take that? Yes, you're right. I think if you look at our slides, the mass revenues sequentially would be around 4%, and the overall GGR for the quarter grew at 6% sequentially. So yes, the VIP revenues in the market as a whole grew faster than the mass revenues Q-o-Q. I think in terms of the premium mass versus base mass, again, I think you can see it from our slides. Premium mass grew slightly faster for us in this quarter, but the difference is not material when you account for things like whole percentage and patron counts and so forth. So I wouldn't say, there's a material divergence in the growth rates between premium mass and base mass, and it's part of business for the quarter. Yeah. So I think first off, I just want to say we see value in both equities. And I think, we have a very long-term bullish view given the market opportunity for growth, our market-leading investments and our assets, and just how we feel about the opportunities in both markets that we have. So as we said before, we're going to be overweight share repurchases. As we think about future capital return, we are going to be more heavily weighted towards share repurchase and dividends. We think the repurchases are going to be more accretive than dividends over time and we want to shrink that denominator. And so I think we're going to look to make purchases that are consistent with our share authorization by the Board and with prior practice. And I think we'll look to be a little bit opportunistic. We may vary levels, but I think we're going to continue to be aggressive in the market. I mean, I think you see with the $450 million of LVS shares, the SCL share repurchases, we think this represents an interesting opportunity just a moment in time. And so we're going to try to take advantage of it. We happen to have a very strong balance sheet. We have a lot of liquidity and we tend to put it to use. So I think we're pretty happy with where the program has taken us so far -- both so far and we'll continue to use it and we'll see how it goes across the year. But we're going to look to repurchase more shares. Yeah, we're working on it. Yeah. I don't know that we can necessarily quantify accurately what the impact was because we can't know what we displaced. You heard Grant describe the number of missing shows and the number of people typically will go to those shows in the Cotai Arena, and you get a sense of the type of high-quality patron that we bring in when we have live entertainment. And it is impactful. I think Q1 typically is a very powerful quarter for us as is Q4, and you kind of see the difference that the impact had for entertainment. We made a decision that if we take the arena offline and do it and make it the high -- one of the highest-quality arenas in Asia, then in the long run, we will benefit from the entertainment. And so we decided to do it as quickly as possible. And so that meant taking it offline in January this year and trying to get it done by October-November. And so once we do that, we're going to have an incredibly high-quality arena with amenities that we've never had before. So it will make us more competitive in the market and actually drive additional high-quality tourism from both traditional markets and other markets and will also help drive high-quality tourism from our core customer base and allow for more repeat visits from our high-value customers. We're very excited about the opportunities this new entertainment asset will present to us. Unfortunately, we're going to take some pain while it's offline, and that really started in January of this year. I can't quantify the exact amount, but you hear the count from Grant and you realize that it is not immaterial. And then the other side is, we're taking the shared it out. And when we're done, it's going to be one of our best properties in Macao. The design will be high-level. The fundamentals of the Sheraton Tower are quite good and both towers are quite good. They're actually a little bit better than the existing Londoner side, believe it or not. The layout of the casino will be very good. The additional food and beverage amenities that we can add. And I think the connectivity will be a very good driver of future results for that property. That's the reason why we're pretty confident that the result, when it's done, will be that or exceed that of the Venetian. So I think for us, we're doing it now. It is going to be disruptive. The worst is going to be across the summer when we have the lowest key count that we've had since we really opened what was then in Sands Cotai Central because we're taking out -- that we're going to take the Sheraton out. And so it's going to be more of this disruption across the summer. But then hopefully, as keys come back online across the phasing, and as we get the arena back, let's call it October-November, we'll have a much more powerful set of assets to drive tourism and create cash flow. So there will be disruption. I can't quantify it for you, but it's not going to be immaterial. Grant, I don't know if you have other things you'd like to add to that. I think the promotion activities levels are relatively intense right now. Is it higher than Q4, I don't think so, but it comes and goes and goes up and has ups and downs. But I think over time, there really isn't any necessity in this market to be too aggressive on promotions. The demand and supply, supply-constrained market, the quality of supply is exceptional, and we are a big contributor to that. And as GGR rises, that becomes even less of an issue over time. And for us, it doesn't matter. We stick to our strategy, which is as Rob referenced product based is driven off our asset base. The upgrades we're making, the quality of the assets and the services that go with that in addition to the programming -- the content programming, and like we talked about, we're very big believers in that entertainment being co-offering. That's why we're investing this $200 million in the upgrade of Cotai Arena. So -- yeah, when it's all said and done, we believe that GGR continues to rise, our asset base is going to be better than before and better than ever. And that's the way we're going to compete and that's the only way we think we can compete on a sustainable and profitable basis is really based on the quality execution of a product and the service that go with that. So it's a very interesting question, and it's the right question to ask. So as these properties reach run rates so as they reach their full potential, the margin should be upper 30s [Technical Difficulty] Sorry. I think someone in Sands China put us on hold. Please excuse us. So we think about margins in the upper thirties. If you look at the performance of the Venetian, that's a good benchmark, right? It was impacted a little bit this quarter, again, also by the entertainment not being there in the Cotai Arena, but -- and mix-wise, to be fair, pre-pandemic, it had more mass play and that's a higher margin. And so as tourism returns, so as visitation increases, which has more mass play, and we have plenty of capacity for it. So if you look at our asset base, the scale of the assets, the food and beverage we have, the amenities we have, we can accommodate a lot of mass play, and we have the positions to do it. And so for us, as visitation shows up and continues to on an upward trend, our assets are ready to take that visitation, revenue will grow, margins will grow, and they will normalize back towards a more traditional mix. That being said, the Londoner has the opportunity to also bring a lot of high-value tourism. So we're carrying the expense base without the revenue, right? So we have the team members, we have the -- we have all the things going on that you have, that we're fully operating, but it's not fully operating at. So the margins naturally are not going to look right. So as the revenue comes in and as the visitation comes in, as the patrons come in, as the hotel is completed, and as the rest of the amenities are done, that will look more normal. The only problem is it's in '25. So we have a little bit of time that we have to get through with this investment. Are there some high-value things that are very high margin that we're missing because of entertainment or keys out, yes, that's true. But when you look at the asset base that we have, the experience that we have, the team that we have there, their ability to execute and how they've executed so far, and the asset base that we're creating with these investments, we're going to be in a great position. And the margins, we believe, will get there. So we need visitation to continue. That will be helpful for the Venetian. It'll be helpful for the mass to recover. We need to have all of our assets in line. So that's the Cotai Arena to be finished and the Sheraton to become fully Londonerized, that's a word, and get to our full key count. And then you'll see the true power of these assets and the margins will get there. We have a lifestyle program that we run with high-quality amenities. If you haven't been to Macau and you haven't seen what we've done, I would encourage you to do it. It's not simply one thing. It's not simply hospitality. It's not simply gaming. It's not simply retail. It's an ecosystem that allows our customers to travel around all of our assets and have an experience they can't get anyplace else. And that's really what we have on offer and it's unique, and it's been invested in and it will continue to get better. So for us, as Rob said, we're not chasing promotional activity. We're chasing asset development, and that will drive our success. Grant, I think you should take that. Grant? It's up now. It's up, guys. Yes. Yeah. But we're very disappointed by New York. I mean, we've been working there for a long time and we thought it was going to happen in '24. That was the state. Now they're saying '25 or '26, but I don't think we have any real clarity. And to be honest with you, it's confusing and disappointing because we've done a lot of work in New York and a lot of time into it. So I have no guidance because I don't really know what to tell you with candor and insight. Just don't know about New York. And it's just wish -- we wish they figured it out and let us know. We just don't know. So we'll remain hopeful that things turn around there. Hey, Vitaly, one thing, and welcome back to the call. I think the key thing for us is we have a very strong view of the future success of Singapore. So strong that we're investing a couple of billion dollars in this property and we're looking to do IR2 as quickly as we can. We think that this market is benefiting from a lot of the factors that make Singapore, great infrastructure, strong, stable government, great investment, great policy. And to be fair, you're seeing the result of it. And it's only our business, as many businesses in Singapore. And so I think that that's a very helpful indicator. But more importantly, the more other investment that goes into Singapore will help drive further visitation. So the infrastructure is already there. The real question is how many more hotel rooms will go in. We feel very strongly that the more hotel rooms are added will help add to the critical mass of tourism that Singapore already has today. If you look at the wealth creation going around in Southeast Asia, it's pretty substantial. The last four years, even during the pandemic and they're pretty meaningful. And there are a lot of customers that are new to Singapore, new to Marina Bay Sands, and they're affluent and very successful, and they want to consume and they want to take advantage of the Singapore -- things Singapore has on offer. And so we feel very strongly about the future visitation in Singapore. It's an interesting question, where is the peak of demand? We don't really see it right now. What we see is a supply constraint, right? When you look at who is trying to come to Singapore and the activities that are going on, we feel very strongly about future investment. We think it's there. Grant, go ahead. I'll answer this in reverse. Yes, it will look more normal. It was a one-time item. It was related to reversal in Macau, $57 million. But the tax rate will look more normal going forward. No problem. Yeah. So, you know, we're going to look to deal with. So if you go to Page 32, which is the page I think you're referring to, and you look at the LVS maturities, we should deal with those in short order. That's kind of our intent. And then in August of '25, we have the $8 billion that you see at the SEL level, and we'll address those in due time. We mentioned that we wanted to bring down our total debt level in at SEL given that we borrowed during the pandemic so you'll see us reduce the quantum of debt there. And then as part of the MDS credit facility, we'll address that in course along with the IR2 start. So that's kind of how we'll deal with our capital structure. You'll see us turn that out as we've done previously. Yeah. I do want to point out before Grant answers this question, that when we have less revenue because of disruption, we'll have less market share. So I do want to point out that with the arena being out with less revenue and a slightly lower margin because of the impact, having some hotel rooms out, that our market share will be impacted because it's the same thing. So with that, I'll just turn it over to Grant. So I think there's an upper limit of 75% by exchange rules, although they do give waivers based on the size of the equity, depending on the name. For us, I think, as I said before, SEL is investing a lot for the future. It has a bright future ahead of it, and we'd like to own more of it. So you'll see us be aggressive, and I think where we stand, we see value in the stocks today meaningfully. So that is a repeat of what we said before, but I think you understand our conviction. Sure. I think you'll see us deal with LBS maturities and the SEL 25s before you see any activity around the LVS [Indiscernible] term loan down to SEL. The one thing I'd like to point out is that it benefits SEL. It's a very favorable loan and allows them to have high-quality financing deeply subordinated at a favorable rate. So from that standpoint, the maturity is '28, and we'll see how it goes with SEL and what their needs are and kind of go from there. But I think we have ample liquidity up at parent co we believe to do what we need. Thanks. So I think as we look back pre-pandemic, we spent five years working towards investment grade. We think it's very important for us to actually be investment grade. It gives us access to the largest most liquid debt market in the world, gives us a very efficient cost of capital, which in the long run provides us flexibility, but really drives returns on new projects. We have this investment rate balance sheet. It helps us in new jurisdictions. You heard Rob talk about several of them. We have the financial capability to execute on these projects. Our financial policy always been that we like gross leverage to be between 2 times and 3 times. You know, we've said this for many years. Nothing has really changed. It's our consistent view. I think over time, we're going to delever just because of EBITDA expansion. If you look what happened at MBS, it occurred, and our belief is that it will continue to occur at Sands China as well. So I think for us, the investment grade is very important. That gross leverage parameter of 2 times or 3 times is consistent with prior statement, prior practice. And I actually think, you know, we're very favorably levered on a net basis and on a gross basis, and we're looking forward to doing some new development. And I think that will fit within our leverage profile based on sort of the prior discussions that we've had about progression of funding and EBITDA development. So we're very focused on it. We think we can handle our new development, our investment, our existing assets, and have a very healthy return of capital program while balancing all these things and having investment grade balance sheet. That's our goal and that's our view. Appreciate it. Thanks so much."

            "name": "Grant Chum",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. I think the most important point is still the GGR is growing in the market, and I think if you look at our profitability, at this level of GGR, I think we should be looking at low to mid-30s in operating margin -- EBITDA margin, and we're right at the high end of the range there. Obviously, each quarter there's seasonality relating to different parts of the business, the revenue mix. So first quarter, I think 34.4% in terms of underlying margin is a really good number. I think 2024 is going to be one that is impacted by our capital works and the renovations that Patrick referenced also in his opening remarks. We have obviously, started the hotel renovation in the first half of Sheraton, and down -- we're probably down about 500, 600 rooms in the first quarter on average in that hotel. But the number of keys that will be out of inventory will increase further in the second and third quarters. And of course, Cotai Arena, as Patrick referenced, that's always been a core part of our content programming, our content offering, and we were able to offer plenty of shows at the London Arena. But if you just compare -- just the sheer number of shows that we had in the first quarter, we had 12 shows compared with the fourth quarter last year, we had 31 shows. It's a big difference. And obviously, in terms of capacity, there's a big difference. So the attendance per show obviously was much higher in the fourth quarter as well. So hopefully, that gives you some color in terms of the disruption that had on our business with the arena being closed for renovation. And as I said, the hotel renovation is ongoing and you're going to see more keys out of inventory in the next couple of quarters. Yes, it's accurate. You're right. I think you covered it perfectly. I think the only thing I supplement is Londoner phase one really gave us that elevation in the shared quality of product, as well as a very successful rebranding and repositioning of the entire property. But what phase two gives us is that scale of high-quality product and the diversity of it. And that's when I think the earnings power of this resort will be fundamentally transformed. Thanks, Joe. For us, yes, our profitability, the structure of a margin in every segment actually, quarter-on-quarter very consistent. No significant changes there. And that obviously, fed through to the result that the earlier question described, which is that we had a very consistent margin quarter-on-quarter despite obviously, some inflation in the payroll costs due to holiday pay and salary increases. Oh. Sorry. You're talking about the overall market now. Yeah, Robin. I don't know if the deck is up. Yeah. So if you look at a premium mass win, we're up 2% quarter-on-quarter, and base maths were down 3% quarter-on-quarter. But I think my point earlier is the difference that's here and there could be related to any number of I think non-substantive factors. So I wouldn't describe this as a divergence in trend, but this quarter we just did slightly better in premium mass versus base mass. Visitations continue just like see the wider market growing. Our property visitations actually grew sequentially as well. So nothing significant to remark on in terms of the segment divergence. Yes. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, sure, Patrick. Yeah, I'll take it. And I think first point is your -- I agree we have a huge advantage with our scale, but I think the scale advantage speaks to all the segments. I think if you looked at historically, how the company has developed absolutely the base mask with our scale, that has been a core advantage. But in the sense of how we described all of these capital investments that we're making, especially in Londoner, the scale we have on the quality of the premium product is really unprecedented. So I think scale advantage will apply to all segments, in my view. Specifically on base mass, if you look at our actual numbers, the way we break it out between premium mass and base mass through the recovery since the reopening after the COVID restrictions, actually they're not too dissimilar now in terms of rate of recovery from a volume and revenue perspective. But it is true that in terms of customer count patron hours, we're still missing more from the base mass. So really it's two things it tells you. One is the quality of patronage has risen significantly because the revenue per patron is higher than before COVID. And secondly, there is still room for that base mass revenue and visitation to further recover. And I think there are many reasons and it's hard to specifically attribute to one or two factors, but I think over time, especially as the economy improves and also so I think people -- the distribution of content in terms of the lifestyle, the destination attractions, all of the events, all of the non-gaming products and assets and events that are actually distributed out there, I think you see a progressive improvement in that base mass segment. And obviously, we will be -- obviously, best placed to capture that growth when that comes. Yeah. I think it's hard to say which factors. I mean, you have a promotion environment out there that people have been talking about and that Rob reference you have, obviously, the disruptions that we've encountered because of our own projects. But on the other hand, it's also just looking at a very short time period here and there. So, yes, our mass revenues were flat for the quarter and the market grew 3%, 4%. But there's also a lot of factors that could have swung our way during the quarter and we would have been much closer to the market growth rate. So I wouldn't draw too big a conclusion from that. If you look at historically how we've sustained our share of EBITDA in a pre-pandemic, the market shares fluctuate, but we always end up back in that low to mid-30s range in terms of EBITDA share. And to be fair, let's look at a longer time frame, let's look at the scorecard for 2023, we achieved 35% EBITDA share against a GGR share of 26%. We were leaders in GGR, yes, but we were, by a much bigger margin, the leader in EBITDA share as well as non-gaming revenues, where we had 41% of the share of the market. So in aggregate, for the year, if you look at revenue gaming, non-gaming EBITDA, I think our performance has been solid. But quarter to quarter, obviously there will be fluctuations depending on those factors that we just discussed."
