        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nLiz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; and Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AbbVie's operations and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full year -- full current year and historical results for Allergan. For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast to conform to AbbVie's revenue recognition accounting policies and exclude the divestitures of Zenpep and Viokace. References to operational growth further excludes the impact of exchange. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.\nRichard Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 performance as well as our expectations for 2021. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our pipeline, and Rob will discuss the quarter and our 2021 guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08. Fourth quarter total net revenues were up nearly 7% on a comparable operational basis. This performance was driven by robust double-digit sales growth from our immunology, hem/onc and neuroscience franchises, as well as 9% comparable operational sales growth of Botox Cosmetic, which is demonstrating a rapid recovery. Our fourth quarter performance topped off another excellent and truly transformational year for AbbVie, which included the successful acquisition and integration of Allergan, creating a stronger and much more diverse AbbVie with leadership across numerous attractive high-growth markets. Significant contributions from our two new best in category immunology medicines, RINVOQ and SKYRIZI , which combined for more than $2.3 billion in 2020 sales, their first full year on the market. We expect the combined contribution from RINVOQ and SKYRIZI to nearly double in 2021 to approximately $4.6 billion based on their continued strong uptake in RA and psoriasis as well as RINVOQ\u2019s anticipated approvals in PSA, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis later this year. We delivered continued robust growth from our leading hem/onc portfolio, with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA contributing more than $6.6 billion in combined 2020 sales. We expect our hem/onc franchise to grow double digits again in 2021. We also added two compelling oncology pipeline assets, Epcoritamab, a potential best-in-class CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody in development for B-cell malignancies and lemzoparlimab, an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody being studied in multiple cancers. These two assets will further support the growth of our hem/onc franchise across our long-range plan. The acquisition of Allergan brought us a substantial neuroscience portfolio with compelling therapies for migraine and psychiatric conditions augmenting our already existing neuro franchise. The newly combined neuroscience franchise delivered nearly $4.9 billion in comparable 2020 revenue and is expected to grow double digits in 2021. We also added the leading global Aesthetics franchise, a largely cash pay portfolio with roughly $3.5 billion in comparable 2020 revenues. As I previously noted, this portfolio has demonstrated a rapid V-shape recovery and we view Aesthetics as an extremely attractive long-term growth opportunity. And importantly, we made excellent progress in 2020 with our pipeline. We expect our R&D pipeline advancements to lead to the approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including a total of six additional indications for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which will cover all of Humira's major indications plus new significant disease areas, including atopic dermatitis, expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and Vraylar and several new product approvals, including Atogepant for episodic migraine, Navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. These new opportunities will collectively add meaningful revenue growth in advance of the U.S. Humira LOE. We've entered 2021 in a strong position, which is reflected in our revenue and earnings per share guidance. Based on the recent outperformance of our business, we expect full-year 2021 comparable operational sales growth of approximately 9.4% with total AbbVie sales expected to be approximately $1.7 billion above current consensus, and we anticipate 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.32 to $12.52, representing growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. This level of guidance represents impressive performance with nearly all aspects of our business expected to perform at or above current consensus for 2021. The Allergan integration continues to go very well. The transition has been seamless despite the size of the transaction and the timing of the COVID pandemic. While we're making excellent progress against our expense synergies, which Rob will cover in more detail here momentarily, it remains increasingly clear to us that there are significant opportunities for long-term revenue contributions across numerous Allergan growth platforms. As we recently disclosed, we believe UBRELVY , the first-to-market in leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. Atogepant, a potential once-daily oral treatment for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine also represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. We expect Vraylar's peak sales to approach $4 billion within its currently approved indications of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression with major depressive disorder or MDD, representing a potentially significant incremental growth opportunity. Aesthetics, which is poised to regain its growth trajectory this year is expected to generate high single-digit revenue growth over the next decade. We continue to closely monitor the COVID dynamics, which will have an impact on our business again in 2021, predominantly in the first half of the year, but significantly moderated from the 2020 impact. And despite the recent COVID resurgence within select geographies, we feel the global healthcare system is much better equipped with COVID treatment protocols in PPE to safely see and treat patients throughout the current year. That said, some therapeutic areas continue to be more impacted than others, like CLL, HCV, certain hospital-based procedures, among others, which we have contemplated in our 2021 guidance. Overall, we've been pleased with the rate of recovery across our business, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and our commercial execution. So in summary, we've assembled an impressive set of growth assets and the outlook for AbbVie's business remains strong. With RINVOQ and SKYRIZI expected to contribute more than $15 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2025 and our expectations for continued robust growth across hem/onc, neuroscience, and aesthetics, we have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to successfully absorb the Humira LOE impact in 2023, support an immediate return to total sales growth in 2024 and produce compelling high single-digit compounded annual total sales growth in 2025 through the remainder of the decade with the diversified portfolio and pipeline that we have today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?\nMichael Severino: Thank you, Rick. We've clearly made significant progress with our pipeline over the past few years, particularly our late-stage programs in hematologic oncology with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, and in immunology with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. Since inception, our R&D organization has delivered an impressive set of new products, which collectively contributed approximately $11 billion in revenue in 2020. We also continue to see significant evolution of our early and mid-stage clinical programs with many assets expected to transition to late-stage registrational studies over the next several years. We will continue to replenish our late-stage pipeline with innovative assets that have the potential to drive additional growth for AbbVie in the second half of the decade. At our recent immunology investor event in December, we provided a detailed overview of our immunology programs, highlighting the robust data generated to-date for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI across approved and pipeline indications. Included in this event, we presented positive topline data from two new Phase 3 studies for RINVOQ . Results from the first induction study in ulcerative colitis and results from the head-to-head study versus dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. We expect to see results from the second Phase 3 UC induction study later this quarter, and from the UC maintenance study in the middle of this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis are currently under review and we expect an approval decision in the US in the second quarter based on priority review and in Europe in the second half of the year. We recently received European Commission approval for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and expect approval decisions for those indications in the US in the first half of this year. I want to take a moment to address the topic of safety, specifically MACE and malignancies following the results from tofacitinib's post-marketing safety study. At present, there are no data to suggest the safety outcomes from their study applied to a specific JAK1 inhibitor such as RINVOQ. We are not aware of any signal for an elevated risk of MACE or malignancies with the RINVOQ or any JAK inhibitor other than Xeljanz. We conducted a pooled database analysis across our clinical trials for DVT, MACE and malignancies at the time of RINVOQ\u2019s regulatory submission and have updated it periodically including up to the present. Rates with RINVOQ have not been elevated relative to competitors or to expected baseline rates. Importantly, there has been no increase or meaningful change in those rates over time. Additionally, we adjudicate events for MACE and DVT, which is considered the highest standard of evidence. If we look across our long-term database in RA, a population that is at increased risk for MACE events, our rates remain low. At the approved dose in RA, we have followed more than 3,700 treated patients totaling more than 9,000 patient-years' experience. Our rate of MACE events is 0.4 per 100 patient-years, which compares favorably to the expected rate of 1.0 to 1.7 events for 100 patient-years. In addition, there is no evidence of a dose-response between the 15 and 30-milligram doses. Similarly, the rate of malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer with similar follow-up is 0.8 events per100 patient-years. This rate is also consistent with the expected range of rates of 0.86 to 0.94 per 100 patient-years. And again, we see no evidence of a dose-response between 15 and 30-milligrams. Moving now to SKYRIZI; we also recently reported top-line results from the Phase 3 programs for SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. In the two Crohn's induction studies, SKYRIZI demonstrated significant improvements in clinical remission and endoscopic endpoints compared to placebo with symptom improvement seen as early as week four. Based on the data generated to date, we believe SKYRIZI has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We expect to see results from the maintenance study in Crohn's disease later this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. We're also very pleased with SKYRIZI\u2019s results in the Phase 3 studies in psoriatic arthritis, where we saw significant improvements in disease activity across both skin and joint endpoints compared to placebo. We believe that the activity we have seen on joint disease and the impressive skin clearance that is a hallmark of the SKYRIZI program make it a compelling offering for patients with mixed joint and skin involvement. We plan to submit our regulatory applications for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis in the first half of this year. We're making good progress with our early and mid-stage immunology programs as well where we expect several data readouts and phase transitions in 2021. We expect to begin three new studies for ABBV-154, our TNF steroid conjugate including a Phase 2b dose-ranging study in RA as well as Phase 2 studies in Crohn's disease and polymyalgia rheumatica. And we'll see proof-of-concept data in the second quarter for ravagalimab, our CD40 antagonist in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, and for ABBV-157, our oral ROR-gamma T inhibitor in Phase 1 for psoriasis. Both of these programs experienced slight COVID-related delays with results now expected for both in the second quarter of this year. In oncology, we continue to make significant progress advancing our pipeline with numerous data readouts and regulatory milestones last year. As well as the addition of several new assets brought in through our in-licensing efforts, including Genmab's CD3xCD20 epcoritamab and I-Mab's anti-CD47 lemzoparlimab. We showcased new data from several programs at the recent ASH meeting where we presented nearly 40 abstracts from eight different assets. Notable presentations included data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE trial evaluating IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL, which showed patients who achieved undetectable MRD following this combination maintain their deep remission at the one-year mark after stopping therapy with a 95% rate of disease free survival. We also presented new five-year data from VENCLEXTA\u2019s Murano trial demonstrating the benefits of fixed duration VENCLEXTA combinations and helping patients achieve sustained progression-free survival. The latest results from Murano in the relapsed refractory CLL setting showed a median progression-free survival of 54 months in the VENCLEXTA and rituximab group, compared to 17 months in the bendamustine-rituximab group, three or more years after stopping treatment. Updated dose-escalation data from a Phase 1 study evaluating epcoritamab in B-cell malignancies were also presented at ASH. Epcoritamab is a subcutaneously delivered bispecific CD3xCD20 antibody being developed in collaboration with Genmab. In the Phase 1 study, epcoritamab demonstrated encouraging single agent anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with a consistent and favorable safety profile showing no Grade 3 or higher CRS events as well as limited neurotoxicity. We believe epcoritamab has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy across a number of B-cell malignancies including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. The Phase 3 trial in relapsed-refractory DLBCL recently began and we will provide updates on epcoritamab as its development program progresses. Initial results were also presented from a Phase 1 study evaluating TNB-383B in relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma. TNB-383B is a novel bispecific T-cell engaging immunotherapy targeting BCMA and CD3 being developed in collaboration with TeneoBio. These Phase 1 results demonstrated that the BCMA/CD3 bispecific provided overall response rates of 80% with a large number of patients achieving a very good partial response or better despite having received multiple prior lines of therapy. TNB-383B was well tolerated at all doses tested with a few off-target toxicities and no Grade 3 or higher CRS observed. With its safety profile efficacy and the convenience of once every three-week dosing, this agent has the potential to become a promising treatment option for myeloma patients. And our partner I-Mab published an abstract with initial results from a Phase 1 study evaluating lemzoparlimab in AML and MDS. These results demonstrated encouraging activity in relapsed-refractory AML patients and lemzoparlimab was well tolerated with no serious hematological adverse events reported today. Based on these promising initial results, we plan to begin new studies this year for lemzoparlimab in AML, MDS and in multiple myeloma. We also recently saw data from an interim analysis of a Phase 2 study evaluating Teliso-V in heavily pretreated non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients. The encouraging results from Stage 1 of this study met the criteria for advancing the program. With Teliso-V demonstrating a 54% objective response rate in patients with wild-type EGFR with highly expressed c-MET. In EGFR wild-type patients with over-expressed c-MET, which includes both high and intermediate expression, the objective response rate was 35%. Based on these results, we believe that there is an important role for Teliso-V in this target population, which represents roughly 25% of the non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer population. We will be opening the second stage of the study and are planning discussions with regulators regarding the potential of this study to support an accelerated filing. We expect 2021 to be another important year for our oncology pipeline with several regulatory submissions as well as data readouts across all stages of development. This year, we expect to see data for IMBRUVICA in the Phase 3 SHINE study in frontline MCL with regulatory submissions expected in the second half of the year. Data for IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA in second line or greater MCL and frontline CLL with regulatory submission for frontline CLL expected in the second half of the year. We also expect to see data from registration enabling studies for VENCLEXTA in high-risk MDS and navitoclax in relapsed-refractory myelofibrosis. And we expect to see data from numerous programs in our early-stage oncology pipeline. In addition, the programs under collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. Our partnered effort is comprised of a strong pipeline of novel targets, which includes more than 20 active programs in discovery or preclinical development. Importantly, we currently have programs, which have advanced into clinical development in two areas immuno-oncology and neurodegeneration. The lead Calico program in oncology is focused on PTPN2 inhibitors, which act at multiple steps in the cancer immunity cycle and have potential applicability in a broad variety of tumor types. The discovery of novel orally bio-available PTPN2 inhibitors represents a significant breakthrough and a target class that has historically been considered un-druggable. We currently have two assets in Phase 1 development ABBV-CLS-579 and 484. We've seen evidence of immune activation in the clinic with this pathway and we expect to see proof-of-concept data from this program in 2022. The lead Calico program in neuroscience is an eIF2B activator, which targets a key regulator of the highly conserved integrated stress response pathway. Inhibition of this pathway has the potential to prevent pathology and restore function in a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Parkinson's disease as well as in traumatic brain injury. Our lead eIF2B activator ABBV-CLS-7262 is currently progressing through Phase 1 and we plan to begin a study later this year in patients with ALS. In other neuroscience updates, last year, we completed our registrational program for atogepant in episodic migraine prevention and we recently submitted our regulatory application to the FDA. We expect an approval decision by the end of the third quarter. The data generated in our Phase 3 programs support a strong benefit-risk profile and we believe that atogepant has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients as a safe, effective, oral treatment option for the prevention of episodic migraine. In 2021, we expect to see data from several late-stage neuroscience assets, including results from two Phase 3 studies for Vraylar in major depressive disorder and results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease with regulatory submissions for 951 expected in the second half of the year. We also expect to see proof-of-concept data for Elezanumab in a Phase 2 study in multiple sclerosis and ABBV-8E12, our lead anti-tau antibody in a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease. In addition to 8E12, we have a number of promising approaches in Alzheimer's, including our neuroinflammation programs aimed at TREM2 and CD33, currently in clinical development, as well as other tau approaches in preclinical development. These include tau antibodies with different epitope specificity as well as approaches to clear intracellular tau. In Aesthetics, we continue to make excellent progress with our portfolio of facial toxins and dermal fillers with several regulatory submissions, data readouts and pivotal study starts expected this year. Our programs include new indications for Botox as well as innovative toxins such as new liquid formulations and both the long and short-acting toxins. We also have programs to develop new indications for the Juvederm Collection as well as novel dermal fillers such as HArmonyCa, which will be entering registration enabling studies in the U.S. And in eye care, based on the positive results from the Phase 3 studies evaluating our topical eye drop AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. We plan to submit our regulatory application later this month and expect an approval decision in the fourth quarter of this year. So in summary, our R&D productivity remained high last year despite multiple COVID-related challenges and we were able to maintain steady continuity and minimize delays. We're entering 2021 well-positioned for continued success and we expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline, again this year. This includes five new asset or major indication approvals, half a dozen regulatory submissions, more than 10 pivotal study readouts, and more than 15 data readouts from early and mid-stage programs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2021 guidance. Rob?\nRobert Michael: Thank you, Mike. Starting with fourth quarter results, we once again delivered strong top and bottom-line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.92 above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total net revenues were approximately $13.9 billion, up 6.8% on a comparable operational basis and ahead of our expectations. Immunology global sales were approximately $6 billion, up 14.8% on an operational basis. Within immunology, Humira sales were approximately $5.2 billion, up 4.4% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit growth in the US offset by biosimilar competition across international markets. SKYRIZI sales were $525 million and RINVOQ sales were $281 million with both products demonstrating strong sequential growth above expectations. Hematologic Oncology delivered another strong quarter with revenue of approximately $1.8 billion, up 15.5% on an operational basis with solid growth from IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. Aesthetic sales were more than $1.1 billion with Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm both experiencing a rapid recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, up 14.9% on a comparable operational basis, led by Vraylar and our migraine portfolio. We also saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had sales of more than $900 million. Turning now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 12.6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.3% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.9% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $618 million and the adjusted tax rate was 11.6%. As we look ahead to 2021, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.32 and $12.52, reflecting growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.63 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $55.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This forecast comprehends the following assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect immunology global sales of approximately $25 billion, including US Humira growth of approximately 8%, internationally Humira revenue of approximately $3 billion at current exchange rates, SKYRIZI global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, and RINVOQ global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. We expect hematologic oncology to grow double-digits with IMBRUVICA global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion and VENCLEXTA global sales of approximately $1.8 billion. For Aesthetics, we expect global sales of approximately $4.5 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion from Botox Cosmetic and approximately $1.3 billion from Juvederm. For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, including Botox Therapeutic sales of approximately $2.3 billion, Vraylar sales of approximately $1.8 billion, and UBRELVY sales of approximately $400 million. For eye care, we expect global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, including approximately $550 million from RESTASIS, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2021. For women's health, we expect global revenue of approximately $1.1 billion. For remaining larger products, we expect global sales of approximately $2 billion from Mavyret, $1.2 billion from Creon, $1 billion from Linzess, $800 million from Synthroid, and $750 million from Lupron. Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 83% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.6 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $11.8 billion. This guidance includes approximately $1.7 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales, which represents an improvement of roughly 200 basis points versus 2020. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.5% and our share count to be roughly flat to Q4 2020. As we look ahead to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $12.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales. And we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.79 and $2.83, excluding approximately $1.32 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $8.4 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $21 billion in 2021. This fully supports a strong and growing dividend, which we have more than tripled since inception, as well as rapid debt repayment where we expect to pay down $17 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021, including the $8.6 billion that was repaid in 2020. We expect to achieve a net debt to EBITDA ratio just below 2.5 times by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. We anticipate that our net leverage ratio will be approximately 2 times by the end of 2022. Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative mid to late-stage assets. In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2020. We've driven top tier growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and we expect to deliver robust performance in 2021 and over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. And as usual, appreciate all the detail in the guidance, and congratulations on the results. A quick question on SKYRIZI and one on RINVOQ. First, one of your competitors had a negative result of a post-marketing study recently. I'm just wondering if you've had any discussions with regulators about conducting any other studies for RINVOQ or updating the label for RINVOQ as a result of that negative signal? And then, secondly on SKYRIZI, a commercial question. Your current price for the 150-milligram dose is about $85,000 and you're using 4x, the dose for ulcerative colitis. Could you just tell us how you can manage that? And is it feasible to have sort of different prices despite the big difference in dosing? Thanks.\nMichael Severino: Okay, this is Mike. I will take your second question first and then we can cover the SKYRIZI question. With respect to RINVOQ, I assume you're talking about the tofacitinib safety study, which top line results fairly recently in the last several days and showed in that program that they were unable to exclude a risk of MACE or malignancy based on the criteria that were used to analyze that data sets. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've kept a very, very close eye on our data, both at the time of the NDA and in an ongoing manner since that time and we've not seen a signal. Our rates have not been elevated with respect to comparator or baseline rates and the rates overall remain low. With respect to your specific question about whether we've had discussions with regulators, regulators have not asked us to do long-term safety study in the way that Pfizer was asked. So that has not been discussed with regulators and we have not had any contact with regulators around labeling updates up to the present time.\nGeoffrey Porges: Great.\nMichael Severino: And with respect to SKYRIZI?...\nJeffrey Stewart: Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. It's Jeff Stewart on the commercial question. We have anticipated the different markets and how we will approach the pricing. Now, it's important that we're just starting to see the SKYRIZI data. We saw the induction data, we'll see the maintenance data. I think it's important that as we look at our strategy that we're honing is for SKYRIZI, you're going to -- for Crohn's, you're going to have an induction dose, which is an IV at a different dose and we know that based on the form and some things we can believe we can price that to market. And also, we are coming with a unique approach for the maintenance as well depending on where that dosing falls out. And we would be using at that point, which is known as on-body injector. So the combination of the forms as well as basically the ways that we will deliver the medication when we get there, we believe that we can price effectively to the market and manage it across the indications.\nRichard Gonzalez: So this is Rick. So I think the bottom line is, we've contemplated that. It's a good question, Geoff, but I think we have a strategy that will allow us to deal with that and impact the market in an appropriate way.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities.\nVamil Divan: Hi, great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. And maybe two if I could. So I want to appreciate the long-term guidance you've given recently on the top line. I'm just wondering how we should maybe think about the margin progression as we think about the Humira LOE in a couple of years? And then as we sort of get past that and your sales touch ramp up again, if you could maybe give us some sense of where you think your margins could sort of come back to? And then, the other one I have is just on Vraylar. Again, appreciate the guidance you've given there. I think one of the big events for you guys this year will be the Phase 3 data in MDD. I\u2019m just curious kind of what gives you confidence that maybe you can just talk about whether it's around the drug or the study design, sort of, what gives you confidence or why should we be confident sort of going into that data readout? Thanks.\nRobert Michael: Vamil, this is Rob. I'll take your question on margin progression. I think when you consider the greater than $2 billion expense synergies from Allergan by next year and the P&L leverage that will come from the sales growth, we also expect for next year, you should expect that our operating margin will continue to expand through 2022. Upon the entry of U.S. biosimilars in 2023 and given Humira's profitability, it is reasonable to expect operating margin pull back. We've indicated before the 45% range based on our current LRP, I think it'll be a little bit higher than that. But then we've returned to growth immediately \u2013 in 2024, we'll return to revenue growth, a very strong revenue growth starting in 2025, you can expect then operating margins once again expand. We've had a long history of expanding operating margin by leveraging the P&L. And I would expect that to continue as we start to see very strong revenue growth starting in 2025 and beyond.\nRichard Gonzalez: Yes, Vamil, this is Rick. Mike and I'll cover the second question on Vraylar. It's important to recognize that what we've communicated in long-term guidance on Vraylar is based on the three currently approved indications. So it doesn't count on the fact that MDD would be successful. Now having said that, I think we do have -- I'd say, we're cautiously optimistic about the MDD indication and I'll let Mike kind of walk through how we look at it and what gives us that level of confidence. But in the event, it weren't to play out, that doesn't impact the guidance that we gave.\nMichael Severino: So, this is Mike. I'll pick up from here. I think that our optimism and I think that's the right way to express it in a disease like MDD, which is a challenging disease to work and is based on a couple of features. One is based on the basic pharmacology of Vraylar, which has a unique mix of D3, D2 specificity and other features that lead clinically to what's been described as a brightening effect, which seems to be beneficial in a number of settings. It's also driven by the results that we have from the MDD study that is positive that we already have in hand. So with one positive study, we would need only one -- at least one or, of course, both of the next two studies to read out positive, either of those outcomes would support a filing. We've done a deep dive into the study design and the patient population. We think it's a well-designed study. And we think the patient characteristics with respect to baseline factors and other elements are all very appropriate for this sort of study and we can assess that in a blinded aggregate way in a way that's completely consistent with the study rules for the conduct of the study. And so all of those things make us feel optimistic that it's a molecule with a good chance to work, well-designed study, well-conducted study, and we look forward to seeing the results. But as I mentioned, MDD is a challenging area. And for that reason, we didn't build into our deal model and we didn't factor it into our guidance, as Rick said, so we view this as upside.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.\nRandall Stanicky: Great. Back to RINVOQ in atopic derm, how quickly do you guys expect that launch to ramp? And maybe just help us with expectations given coinciding JAK competition from abrocitinib , the timing to payer ramp and coverage. And then we sense of a lot of patient warehousing, maybe if you could help quantify your thinking around that opportunity within the $1.7 billion outlook for the year, that would be helpful? And then a quick follow-up, Rick. You don't get asked about eye care a lot. It's a $3 billion global franchise. You have some pipeline behind it. It could be a good growth business, but it's declining. Any appetite to strategically add to that business or reposition it? Or should we view it more as a mature cash flow generator? Thanks.\nJeffrey Stewart: Yes, hi. It's Jeff Stewart. I'll start off with the atopic derm commercial question. We're very encouraged with the market that we're about to enter and I'll give you some context there. So when we look at the population, we see that just on the moderate to severe atopic derm patients that the market size or the potential is at least 2 times and probably closer to 3 times the size of the psoriasis market. And so this is very, very encouraging in terms of our ability to enter. It's also significantly under-penetrated. I mean if you look at the psoriasis market, you're talking about far greater than 10% or 12% penetration and in the single-digit, the low-single digits, where we are right now with the one biologic dupilumab. So it's very, very attractive. The other thing that I would say is that we see from our go-to-market approach that we know the HCPs very intimately. So about 85% of the market is driven by the derms, we know the derms very well and there is a 90% -- roughly 90% overlap with the big prescribers of dupilumab and drugs like SKYRIZI and our Humira. So we are very, very encouraged at the ability for this segment to rapidly expand, despite the fact there will be multiple new entrants coming in. To get to your specific question about the access ramp, we have a very strong position, as you know with RINVOQ right now in the existing indication of RA. We had greater than 95% commercial access, that's the dominant channel for atopic derm and our anticipation is we will have very strong access that we'll build to that level over the course of '21. Obviously, it's going to take some time, once we get the approval to go through the final approvals on the big commercial plans and so we see it's starting off slow, but then building into the middle of the year and certainly getting to a significant level at the end of the year. So the combination of the market, the asset itself, which looks very, very strong, as you've seen from the data and the way that we will play in our derm segment as well as the allergy segment give us a lot of confidence for a strong ramp in '21 and beyond.\nRichard Gonzalez: The only thing I would add to Jeff's comments, I mean if you look at RINVOQ did $731 million last year. Obviously, if you look at the running rate out of the fourth quarter had [ph] strong running rate coming out of the fourth quarter but that's a $1 billion worth of growth from '20 to '21. The majority of that growth is going to come from continued performance in RA. I think where you will see the most significant impact from atopic dermatitis will be as we flow into '22, much like as you saw what happened in the RA market, it takes time for physicians to start to get adapted. Once they do, their momentum picks up. So, I don't remember the specific number. I'm not sure we gave that guidance anyway, but I would be thinking about it more than its continued penetration and growth in RA which drive in the bulk of that growth. Rob, anything you want to add?\nRobert Michael: Yes, I just -- on your question regarding warehouse patients who have a very modest amount of warehouse patients assumed [ph] in the forecast. So we're not count -- the $1.7 billion doesn't really count on that. And keep in mind that RINVOQ was of the product that was lesser impacted by COVID and so there's not really significant how warehousing in that forecast.\nRichard Gonzalez: And then, Randall, on your second question; I would say we absolutely agree with your point of view. I think eye care is a very attractive market. The kinds of markets that I think we look for and that we are the very best at is where there are specialized physicians who really drive the use of medications based on the clinical data and being able to restate markets and improve standard-of-care in those markets, and certainly, eye-care, I think it fits that description. And so we would have a strong appetite to look for opportunities and we are looking for opportunities now that we could add to that eye care business to be able to drive growth. Obviously, RESTASIS, as Rob indicated in his formal remarks, we've built in a half a year that's still an unknown of when that product will go generic or if it will go generic. But I think even aside from that regardless of what happens with RESTASIS longer-term, this is an area that we would have interest in and if we could find the right kind of assets to add to it, we would enthusiastically do that.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Randall. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on Aesthetics and maybe some of the learnings you've had in that franchise since you've acquired it? Have there been changes in the way you think about approaching the business commercially in your levels of investment? I'm just trying to get my hands around that high single-digit growth over time does seem healthier than the street have been anticipating. I'm just trying to get a little bit more color of what you're seeing in the market that gives you confidence in that. And then, my second question was just on IMBRUVICA, the growth has slowed here a bit. Can you just elaborate a bit more and how much of this is -- is there any COVID related dynamics playing out here? How much of this is competitive? I'm just trying to [ph] sense of just how you're seeing that the health of that franchise over time? Thanks so much.\nRichard Gonzalez: Yes, Chris, this is Rick. So I'll cover the Aesthetics question for you. I'd say as we've studied the Aesthetics market and had an opportunity to be able to operate the business now for some time, I think we're even more enthusiastic about the long-term ability to be able to grow this market. I would say some of the areas that were a bit of a surprise to us is the responsiveness of this market to patient activation, and I would say that the strategy that we've put in place is one where we are funding the business on a very -- on a continuous basis at a high level to achieve the level of activation that we're looking for and we think that will, certainly, you can see, the response I guess an example in Botox already, we are seeing a very aggressive response in being able to grow the market, you saw the Botox grew -- Botox Cosmetic grew in the fourth quarter to 9%. I would expect that we can continue to drive that level of growth. And as part of legacy Allergan, I think it was much more episodic in the way this was funded quarter-to-quarter where we basically built a funding plan that will allow them to continue to drive activation over a longer term [ph]. I'd say the second thing that's it's of interest to us is, I think this is a market where you can drive significant innovation. If you fund that innovation in a way, again on a more continuous basis and advance those programs more aggressively, and have a well thought out strategic roadmap as to where you're trying to drive some of these markets. As Mike mentioned in his comments, our goal is to basically try to advance the level of performance of the toxin market significantly over time. And the same with the filler market. There are certainly things that we can do to expand the areas that you could use fillers, both within the US and globally and that's a significant opportunity. But long term, we think there is an opportunity to take some of the biologic expertise that we have here at AbbVie and create more biologically active fillers, and not only do physical filling but also improve collagen, improve elastin, and other kinds of characteristics that will improve skin quality. And we think that will be -- if we're successful, we think that will be a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth. And then, the last thing I'd say is the geographic footprint that AbbVie has. We obviously have a very broad geographic footprint and the structure that we've set up is this totally integrated global unit that we're operating the Aesthetics business really gives them the freedom to go out and expand or more aggressively fund areas around the globe that they think there is a significant opportunity. A good case in point is I believe it was in the fourth quarter, we funded a significant expansion in China to be able to increase the sales force there to be able to drive it more deeply into a broader set of the cities in China to the next level down and we are already seeing the benefits of that, China is already back to growing much like it did pre-COVID. So I think there's a lot of attractive attributes about that. On IMBRUVICA maybe Jeff and I will tag team on that one. What we're clearly seeing is the COVID is having an impact on patient starts in CLL. We're not only seeing it IMBRUVICA, but we're seeing in VENCLEXTA as well. And then somewhat logical when you think about these oncology practices of trying to reduce density and CLL is a disease where you can, in many patients' cases, you can delay therapy for some period of time. I would say that's the vast majority of it. When we look at -- when I look at the overall share. And the reason why I'm talking about the overall share is VENCLEXTA is now gaining a significant level of momentum in this market as well. When I look at our overall shares in first line, second line or third line, we continue to have the dominant share position. And I'd say probably, partially due to your question, if I look at Calico [ph] I'd say it's performing at the expectation we have. I think the first line share is about 12%, slightly higher in second line maybe 14%, and I don't recall the third line share...\nJeffrey Stewart: Very similar, yes.\nRichard Gonzalez: So I'd say that's within the range or we saw with MCL, it's within the range of what we had modeled. So it's not really a competitive issue that we're dealing with. It's more a function of getting those patients starts back up to the level they were before. Anything, you want to add, Jeff?\nJeffrey Stewart: No, I think Rick, that's exactly right. The only thing I would say in terms of our forecast, we think that in the first part of the year, the early part of the year, we continue to see some suppression in the new patient starts. But as we hit the second and third quarter, we anticipate that the market will recover.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nNicole Maher: Hi. Can you hear me? This is Nicole Maher on for Tim Anderson. What does your long-term guidance assume for potential austerity measures in the ex-U.S. countries in 2021 and beyond, similar to what we saw in the post-2008 time period except this time around, it would be the fall from the COVID impact?\nRichard Gonzalez: Hey, Nicole. This is Rick. I think this is something we've got experience with, if you think about the economic crisis, I thought we saw a similar kind of uptick in price erosion outside the United States and in particular, I'd say in the European Union, we have factored in a reasonable assumption into our guidance for 2021, I feel good about that. I think it is reflective of what we're likely to see. So I think we're covered from that perspective. Anything you want to add Rob?\nRobert Michael: No, that covered it.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Nicole. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. Two questions. AbbVie delivered one of the first completely clean and compelling quarters in pharma this cycle, and I have to believe, has something in reserve for upside as the year unfolds. I'm sure you monitor the competition, so beyond the AbbVie management team itself, what about your business do you think is allowing you to execute in this way? Would you attribute it to -- mainly to the products themselves, the payer strategies, geographic mix, or is there something else? And the second question is the ongoing Vraylar Phase 3 trials utilize doses up to 3-milligrams while the successful prior trials were up to 4.5-milligrams, so why were the doses lowered in the first place? And what placebo response mitigation methods are included in the ongoing trials? Thank you.\nRichard Gonzalez: Okay. Steve, this is Rick, I'll cover the first one, and Mike can cover the second one. I would say, first and foremost, we are a very disciplined organization in how we approach execution in the marketplace. We tend to probably, in [ph] some extent, obsessively plan and then go out and try to execute against that plan and I think in times of difficulties that kind of discipline tends to demonstrate itself and that's when you see the biggest differences. So that's not say [ph] other people don't do it like that. I'm not that familiar with how others operate, but I know how we operate and I know how we contingency plan and we look at. Okay, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do and we do that ahead of time, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do. And I think that kind of contingency planning and focus on execution is helpful. I'd say the second thing is, if I look at our business, we put a strategy in place and I feel very good about how the business is performing overall. I mean I would say the business is firing on all cylinders. And you can look at our fourth quarter performance, to your point, and I think it demonstrates that and you can look at our guidance and it demonstrates that almost every single product area is performing at or above, most of them above what consensus was and then I think it's another indicator for you and we have a much more diverse business now. We have four major growth platforms that are helping us drive that level of growth. Our new product launches are doing extremely well. Obviously, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are, but I'd also say UBRELVY and Vraylar are performing extremely well and the pipeline, I would say one of the things gives me the most confidence is when I look at the pipeline behind that. It's designed to be able to drive our long-term growth because one of the things that we focus on is how we're going to make sure that we continue to drive this business to perform at the level its performing over the long term. And so if I look at the SKYRIZI and RINVOQ R&D execution around the follow-on indications, it's been nothing less than spectacular both from a timing standpoint and the kind of data that we have been able to produce. When I look at our hem/onc strategy, we've had a very disciplined strategy there ensuring that we have enough assets to continue to grow. What has become a very large franchise for us. Our franchise is $6.6 billion as we said, we're going to grow in double digits. Over the long term, what's going to allow us to do that? Well obviously IMBRUVICA is going to continue to drive share, VENCLEXTA is going to continue to drive share in CLL but VENCLEXTA has indication expansions in the area of potential, in the areas of T1114 and a broader AML population and several other areas. Then I look at Navitoclax. We should get that product approved and give us an opportunity in myelofibrosis and then you look at Genmab and you look at our CD47, those will all allow us to ensure that we can sustain that growth profile over the long term. In neuroscience, same thing, atogepant will allow us to expand into the broader migraine population. So I feel very good about what we put in place and our ability to execute against that. So I think there is not one silver bullet that I can point to. I think it's all of those things, certainly, our ability in market access has helped a lot in the US. I think we're very good at that, but you have to have the right kinds of assets in order to execute that. You have to have assets that are differentiative like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. So it's the combination of all of that gives you this performance and gives you the long-term sustainable ability to deliver that kind of performance and I feel awfully good about where we are.\nMichael Severino: So, this is Mike. I'll take the Vraylar question. I believe you're talking about the ongoing MDD studies and what I would say there is that the dose selection was based on everything we know about dose-response, not only from the prior MDD studies but across the program and we've done a deep dive into that and we're confident that we're at a dose that ought to have optimal effect in these indications -- in this indication. With respect to your question about placebo response rate, managing or controlling the placebo response is extremely important in all studies, but particularly in depression studies and other studies in psychiatry. And I would say that there are many different approaches that are taken that are complementary to each other. The first and most important is appropriate site selection, one has to select sites with an appropriate patient population with experienced investigators who are also experienced evaluators in a clinical trial setting and that's one of the most important things to getting high-quality data to determine whether a drug works. The next element has to do with investigator training, investigator manuals, protocol design and also with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria to make sure that you have a patient population that is representative of the population that you would expect to treat post-registration if the study is successful. And we've taken a look at all of these things, we've taken a look at the blinded aggregate data and we feel good that the measures that we have in place will effectively control the placebo response and give us a quality readout.\nSteve Scala: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets.\nGary Nachman: Hi, good morning. Could you talk about how much more you plan on investing behind the neuroscience franchise to accelerate growth there to get to the long-term targets you talked about like the $4 billion in Vraylar even with that MDD, and how you see the long-term potential in Botox Therapeutic? And then how are you thinking about the launch for atogepant later this year? And how will you leverage the work that you've done so far with Ubrelvy? And how do you think that product will take off in the migraine market? Thank you.\nRichard Gonzalez: Well, I'd say, on the neuroscience investment, I mean we obviously have a very broad neuroscience investment. I mean we have a significant investment from an R&D standpoint. And in disease-modifying approaches for a number of different neurological diseases that Mike has talked about and mentioned in his comments earlier. So I'd say we have a significant R&D investment. We obviously are investing in Vraylar to continue to expand that asset. Again, our goal will be to invest in these areas where you can get maximum capture -- market share capture. I think if you look at Vraylar and you look at the projections that we made over time, if you look at the sequential year-over-year dollar growth of that business, that's how you get to that number. And basically, we're going to be able to sustain that, we expect to continue to sustain it as relatively low market share, but that's not unusual. And in this market, because there's a lot of generic products that psychiatrists, cycle patients through and sometimes in combination with patients. So we're going to invest in the business to be able to drive the maximum level of profitable share as we do in any other segment that we're in. Same thing on Botox Therapeutics, obviously, we have R&D programs in there to continue to expand the opportunities in therapeutics. Anything you want to add from an investment standpoint, Rob?\nRobert Michael: I think if you look at the overall portfolio, we've detailed out what we expect for Vraylar and that's without the additional indication. We think we can get to approaching $4 billion. When you look at the migraine portfolio, peak sales are greater than $1 billion for both the UBRELVY and Atogepant. We have 951 in the pipeline that we think can be a significant contributor, obviously, Botox Therapeutic will continue to grow. So we feel pretty good about the portfolio we have and that double-digit growth outlook is supported by a number of very promising assets.\nJeffrey Stewart: Yes, hi. And it's Jeff, I'll take the second question on atogepant. I think first, the asset itself is very, very attractive. And when you look at the response on the migraine free days at the 10 to 60-milligram, it's really impressive data, very impressive data as this very strong oral. And so we think that we can come at this in a couple of different ways. Obviously, you highlighted the leveraging Ubrelvy. We've got a dedicated sales force that calls on the specialty organization, the neurologists as well as the headache specialists will actually carry both UBRELVY and atogepant in their call plan to really leverage the knowledge of a very established sales force and as well as focus on the big primary care writers that see a lot of migraine sufferers. So this is -- this is an important dynamic that will, we'll be able to leverage when we get into the market towards the end of the year. Also, we are looking at the ability to see how you look on the back end of the migraine journey so patients are on Botox Therapeutics, for example, which is very substantial. It's the leading in play share for chronic migraine. But many of those patients don't get full efficacy results. So ultimately the combination of Botox plus atogepant as a way to get really migraine freedom in the toughest patients is another area over the long term that we think can leverage these assets across the board, whether it's you UBRELVY on the front end with acute atogepant in the middle, oral for episodic and chronic or Botox on the back end. We think it's a nice portfolio that we can commercially manage over time to hit our ambitions that Rob described.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Gary. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Naveen Jacob from UBS.\nNaveen Jacob: Hi Naveen from UBS. Thanks for taking the question. So first on the ADC steroid you see for inflammatory conditions. Just wanted to get an update there, it's been, I believe you said delayed for COVID-19 do you still believe that this approach can lead to success for refractory RA or other inflammatory conditions. Just wondering about your confidence in this technology understanding, it's still early in development. And then secondly, as it relates to your current state of affairs with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, could you remind us of what the current in-play market share for our RINVOQ is in RA and SKYRIZI in psoriasis. Thank you so much.\nMichael Severino: Okay. This is Mike, I'll take your first question on ABBV 154 our TNF steroid conjugate has not been delayed because of COVID. There were some delays in other early immunology programs. Our CD 40 and our ROR gamma-T program experienced modest delays but 154 did not. As we said at the time of the COVID peak over the course of last summer, there were a small number of studies that we delayed initiation and delayed enrollment, is the programs that I'm talking about TD 40 and ROR gamma T were impacted modestly in that time period but 154 was not so that remains on-track. We remain confident in it. We have selected 154 as the agent to go forward. Remember that we had two 3373 and 154 and we selected 154 because of advantages it had in linker technology, we're planning to initiate a large Phase 2 B study in the first half of this year and then today, we're now saying that we will also be studying Phase 2 Crohn's disease, as well as polymyalgia rheumatica, and that's an important set of indication that covers a wide range of opportunities, RA and Crohn's disease areas where we are very active, PMR polymyalgia rheumatica is a new area where there is not a lot of therapeutics, unfortunately, it is a well-established area in medicine but there is very little in terms of treatment for these patients, they have considerable pain and suffering from their condition and it's -- and it's particularly steroid responsive. So we think it is a very attractive target for our steroid ADC approach. The 154 remains on track and we continue to have confidence.\nJeffrey Stewart: Thanks, Mike. It's Jeff, I'll take the in-play [ph] share. So if we look at the psoriasis market and SKYRIZI we have on our latest data point 33% of in-play share, which is of course is new patients coming in or newly switch patients. If you look at the total AbbVie share, it's approximately 45%, so very remarkable when you add Humira plus SKYRIZI in the dermatology space. If you look at the RA space, our latest data points are between 15% and 16% in terms of in-play share for RINVOQ in RA and that's basically neck and neck with Humira, so for a total AbbVie share of roughly a third of the RA market.\nRichard Gonzalez: This is, Rick. The only thing I'd add on that is when you look at that SKYRIZI 33% in-play share, it's almost double what the next closest competitor is, I mean it's impressive. The gap between SKYRIZI and the number two player and the other thing is, as these brands get more experience in the market, we'll also start to talk about the total TRx share and I think SKYRIZI is at that point now. I think it's total TRx share now is 14% [indiscernible] or something like that. That's right. And that's pretty impressive for this short period of time and it is close to number two in the market in TRx share. So they are both doing very, very well.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Naveen. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And the next question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler.\nChris Raymond: Hi, thanks. Just a couple of questions. First, on the relationship with BI and SKYRIZI. We had a few inbound questions on the treatment of the royalty and I know you've answered this question a little bit in the past, but also just noticing the big non-cash GAAP charge you took this quarter, you back out a non-GAAP earnings. So I know you have described accounting for this as a business combination. But can you maybe give a little bit more color on the rationale and the accounting behind that non-cash charge and then is there also some threshold number or other event where you'd add this royalty expense back to non-GAAP. And then, on AbbVie 951; we picked up a decent amount of KOL excitement around this asset in Parkinson's. I know Phase 3 is expected later this year, but I wonder if you could maybe talk about the launch -- your launch expectations on this and maybe contrast it to the Duodopa experience just from our feedback, it seems like this could expand the addressable PD population pretty sizably and Rick maybe frame how this sort of factors into your long range $10 billion neuroscience guidance. Thanks.\nRichard Gonzalez: Yes, Chris, I'll take your question on Contingent considerations and yes, we did account for this as a business combination. So that means each quarter we do a mark-to-market, the fair value of the future milestone royalty payments and you did see us take a fair value write up this quarter. Based on the higher sales outlook as we communicated during the Immunology Day event in December and you see in the guidance provided today, obviously the outlook for SKYRIZI continue to increase. And so we're recognizing that liability going forward. We also take into a consideration because it's a fair value measure what the market is assuming. So it's not just our own forecast. It's also what street expectations are and those have also increased as we've seen a very nice ramp. We are starting to see obviously the confidence from the street increase that's translated into a higher outlook for SKYRIZI which then translates in a higher future potential royalties. One of the reasons I wanted to stress, also on the free cash flow in my remarks today is because there is some confusion over that's how we account for, but it's important to keep in mind that when I talk about free cash flow of $21 billion this year, that accounts for the royalty payments of - to BI. And so you can look at a few different ways, you can look at it from a \u2013 if you can track the consideration accretion that we're recording and the liability on the balance sheet as an indicator of the future outlook, but also as we monitor our cash flow pretty carefully what does that contribute to overall cash flow. So we would not be going back, we made a determination as a business combination. We don't -- should not anticipate that we would reverse that but we'll provide obviously more clarity on what those royalties look like going forward given the size of the asset.\nMichael Severino: I also say in that time period when we did BI it was an absolute requirement on the account, right. Well, that was really, it wasn't like a judgment call or something thing to desire to do the accounting, said to be accounted for in that fashion. It's since been changed going forward. But the window in which we that occurred that was the required accounting treatment. So number two, Jeff and I will cover number two, sort of a high level look and then Jeff, maybe can give more specificity around that. If you look at Duodopa I mean this is a -- this is a therapy that has absolutely phenomenal efficacy and you can see these patients who cannot move early and you turn on the pump and you start giving them the drug and within a very short period of time, they will gain their motion. The challenge is a very difficult treatment to the patient to basically deal with and the caregiver to deal with on a long term sustainable basis; you have to do surgery, insert a G-Tube, you got to maintain that G-Tube opened, so that does somewhat limit the population is able to use it. And so we view this as a way to significantly expand the market. Jeff is obviously far more familiar with it. So I'll let him, give you a little more specific, but that's the general concept. I think this could be a significant -- wanting to be a significant treatment for these patients who need this kind of therapy. And two, I think we could expand the market pretty significantly.\nJeffrey Stewart: Yes, I think just to add on that. Rick, it's we hear the same thing from our KOLs, they're very, very encouraged and with the perspective you look at Duopa or Duodopa, about $0.5 billion product with a really difficult challenge on on-boarding for these patients. Right. You have to do the J-Peg surgery. You have challenges with the size of the pump. Nonetheless, it's still remarkable that we do get that level of sales. So if I give you some perspective on the market. If you look at the advanced Parkinson disease market, 90% of it is really old generic orals where the patients just have to take more and more oral medication before they can have any -- any relief. And then, they are still in big trouble. So, only a minority about 10% ever get to let's say more advanced device-aided therapy, which is Duopa or Duodopa and deep brain stimulation. So, as we studied the market we agree that as we look at the ability to sort of move from a more convenient way a simple way for neurologists to get a more advanced therapy without doing a procedure, whether it's brain surgery or the -- or the GI surgery we think we can start to move upstream into that 90% of really non-workable oral segment. So, we are encouraged at the recent feedback from our KOLs and our study sites and are anticipating and planning for launch in the coming years.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Truist.\nGregg Gilbert: Yes, hi, I was curious if your Botox Cosmetic guidance in the US assumes that as you've always on the market or off the market this year and then longer-term curious about Botox Cosmetic versus therapeutic many years ago Allergan started to explore the idea of separating the two from a reimbursement and pricing standpoint, I believe it involved litigation with the government at one point, but I don't know if that's still ongoing or if you're still thinking through that possibility since it has implications longer-term about keeping those that together possibly spending Aesthetics someday if conditions warrant. Thank you.\nRichard Gonzalez: Yes, so I don't know that we're going to specifically comment on what we've assumed as it relates to [indiscernible]. I just don't think it's probably appropriate. First of all, it's not that large of a product to begin with. So wouldn't have a material impact on Botox Cosmetics. I'd say on the -- on the -- on your second question, I will tell you emphatically we have no interest in spinning off the Aesthetics business. We have a program in place where we manage the differences between the reimbursement associated with Botox Therapeutics and the cash pay portion of the Cosmetics business, it's been in place for quite some time. We're quite comfortable that we can manage it quite effectively. So It's an important thing that you -- that you track carefully, but we have a good system in place to be able to do that, but we have no interest in getting off the Aesthetics business or any aspects of the of the Aesthetics business.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Gregg. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys, it's Austin [ph] on for Geoff. Thanks so much for the questions. A couple of quick ones. So -- and within the context of the Xeljanz's data, do you guys have an early view from the field as to whether docs are differentiating RINVOQ and -- sorry, RINVOQ and Xeljanz's safety profiles? And then quickly on the mid to early stage pipeline there's obviously a lot going on in your Heme-onc space but just going to want to get a sense of how strategically important some more newer disruptive technologies are to AbbVie such as cell or gene therapy. Thanks.\nJeffrey Stewart: Yes, I'll take the early view from the field. I think it's important, at least, we've heard from our teams that some of this data is not really new. It was available in the interim analysis that helped -- led to the label that we have and so really the early reports from our -- from our field particularly from the KOLs and the big prescribers is a little bit of a shoulder shrug like not that, not that new news. I would say, from the standpoint of the comparison between RINVOQ and Xeljanz. I mean if you look at the penetration of the jack-class really across the world, and particularly in the U.S., there has been a significant lift that we just talked about with that in play share. And so really what we're -- what we're hearing from the -- from the field and from the prescribers are they view RINVOQ as a differentiated asset in terms of the overall risk benefit and that's why that share is moving so quickly and so that's really what we -- what we hear in the early days from our -- from our teams that are connected to those big rheumatologists.\nMichael Severino: So, this is Mike. I'll take the question on the heme-onc portfolio mid stage and newer technologies, but I would say is there is a lot going on in our heme-onc portfolio. Obviously with our late-stage molecules in the mid-stage. I think you'll see a focus on T-cell redirection, which is of course a newer technology. And I think a very attractive approach to harness the immune system to control these cancers and you see good progress with our CD3 by CD20 and our BCMA T cell redirecting therapies. And so, that is clearly an area of focus for us now and I think we'll continue to be in the future. With respect to gene therapy, gene therapy is not a single thing it can be used in different ways. Gene replacement is not an area that we've been focused on. Gene delivery is an enabling technology for other therapeutic approaches like cell-based therapies and we have early programs and cell-based therapies in heme-onc and in other areas. Solid tumor oncology and potentially other areas in the future. And so that's something that we are keeping a close eye on and making sure that we have access to the enabling technologies we need to prosecute those targets. I think that for those sorts of approaches we're probably one generation away from things that are broadly applicable. But we are exploring possibilities that we think can fulfill that next generation need. And so we are keeping up a broad eye and are essentially therapeutically agnostic. What I mean by that is we look for the best tool to do the job. We don't find it tool and then figure out how to use it. And so in each of these cases we're going after strong biology. We're going after things that we think will raise the bar on the standard of care. And I think a number of the newer technologies that I mentioned fit that bill.\nLiz Shea: Thanks. Operator, we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Luisa Hector from Berenberg.\nLuisa Hector: Hello, thank you for taking my question and thank you for the guidance on the cost lines. And I just wondered given that we have various layers to consider with COVID and then the Allergan inclusion and the synergies could you comment on the implied cost ratio for 2021 and how representative are the combined entity. And is there anything else we should be thinking about for those cost line as we look out to 22 COVID related savings may be sticky ones that may reverse? And could you tell us the level of synergies you achieved already in 2020? Thank you.\nRobert Michael: Hi, Luis. This is Rob. So I think now that we have first full year with combined company and you're looking at these profiles. I think you could assume they're indicative in the range of what you'd expect going forward. And so that is a cleaner guide then say when you have a partial year like we had in 2020 as it relates to the synergies we achieved in 2020 which is about $600 million of synergies about $400 million that was an R&D and $200 million SG&A and you see we've now increased that to $1.7 billion in 2021 with about a little bit roughly half of that coming from R&D about in the 40% range SG&A and about 10% from cost of goods.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Luisa. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.AbbVie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Jeffrey Stewart",
            "content": "Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. It's Jeff Stewart on the commercial question. We have anticipated the different markets and how we will approach the pricing. Now, it's important that we're just starting to see the SKYRIZI data. We saw the induction data, we'll see the maintenance data. I think it's important that as we look at our strategy that we're honing is for SKYRIZI, you're going to -- for Crohn's, you're going to have an induction dose, which is an IV at a different dose and we know that based on the form and some things we can believe we can price that to market. And also, we are coming with a unique approach for the maintenance as well depending on where that dosing falls out. And we would be using at that point, which is known as on-body injector. So the combination of the forms as well as basically the ways that we will deliver the medication when we get there, we believe that we can price effectively to the market and manage it across the indications. Yes, hi. It's Jeff Stewart. I'll start off with the atopic derm commercial question. We're very encouraged with the market that we're about to enter and I'll give you some context there. So when we look at the population, we see that just on the moderate to severe atopic derm patients that the market size or the potential is at least 2 times and probably closer to 3 times the size of the psoriasis market. And so this is very, very encouraging in terms of our ability to enter. It's also significantly under-penetrated. I mean if you look at the psoriasis market, you're talking about far greater than 10% or 12% penetration and in the single-digit, the low-single digits, where we are right now with the one biologic dupilumab. So it's very, very attractive. The other thing that I would say is that we see from our go-to-market approach that we know the HCPs very intimately. So about 85% of the market is driven by the derms, we know the derms very well and there is a 90% -- roughly 90% overlap with the big prescribers of dupilumab and drugs like SKYRIZI and our Humira. So we are very, very encouraged at the ability for this segment to rapidly expand, despite the fact there will be multiple new entrants coming in. To get to your specific question about the access ramp, we have a very strong position, as you know with RINVOQ right now in the existing indication of RA. We had greater than 95% commercial access, that's the dominant channel for atopic derm and our anticipation is we will have very strong access that we'll build to that level over the course of '21. Obviously, it's going to take some time, once we get the approval to go through the final approvals on the big commercial plans and so we see it's starting off slow, but then building into the middle of the year and certainly getting to a significant level at the end of the year. So the combination of the market, the asset itself, which looks very, very strong, as you've seen from the data and the way that we will play in our derm segment as well as the allergy segment give us a lot of confidence for a strong ramp in '21 and beyond. Very similar, yes. No, I think Rick, that's exactly right. The only thing I would say in terms of our forecast, we think that in the first part of the year, the early part of the year, we continue to see some suppression in the new patient starts. But as we hit the second and third quarter, we anticipate that the market will recover. Yes, hi. And it's Jeff, I'll take the second question on atogepant. I think first, the asset itself is very, very attractive. And when you look at the response on the migraine free days at the 10 to 60-milligram, it's really impressive data, very impressive data as this very strong oral. And so we think that we can come at this in a couple of different ways. Obviously, you highlighted the leveraging Ubrelvy. We've got a dedicated sales force that calls on the specialty organization, the neurologists as well as the headache specialists will actually carry both UBRELVY and atogepant in their call plan to really leverage the knowledge of a very established sales force and as well as focus on the big primary care writers that see a lot of migraine sufferers. So this is -- this is an important dynamic that will, we'll be able to leverage when we get into the market towards the end of the year. Also, we are looking at the ability to see how you look on the back end of the migraine journey so patients are on Botox Therapeutics, for example, which is very substantial. It's the leading in play share for chronic migraine. But many of those patients don't get full efficacy results. So ultimately the combination of Botox plus atogepant as a way to get really migraine freedom in the toughest patients is another area over the long term that we think can leverage these assets across the board, whether it's you UBRELVY on the front end with acute atogepant in the middle, oral for episodic and chronic or Botox on the back end. We think it's a nice portfolio that we can commercially manage over time to hit our ambitions that Rob described. Thanks, Mike. It's Jeff, I'll take the in-play [ph] share. So if we look at the psoriasis market and SKYRIZI we have on our latest data point 33% of in-play share, which is of course is new patients coming in or newly switch patients. If you look at the total AbbVie share, it's approximately 45%, so very remarkable when you add Humira plus SKYRIZI in the dermatology space. If you look at the RA space, our latest data points are between 15% and 16% in terms of in-play share for RINVOQ in RA and that's basically neck and neck with Humira, so for a total AbbVie share of roughly a third of the RA market. Yes, I think just to add on that. Rick, it's we hear the same thing from our KOLs, they're very, very encouraged and with the perspective you look at Duopa or Duodopa, about $0.5 billion product with a really difficult challenge on on-boarding for these patients. Right. You have to do the J-Peg surgery. You have challenges with the size of the pump. Nonetheless, it's still remarkable that we do get that level of sales. So if I give you some perspective on the market. If you look at the advanced Parkinson disease market, 90% of it is really old generic orals where the patients just have to take more and more oral medication before they can have any -- any relief. And then, they are still in big trouble. So, only a minority about 10% ever get to let's say more advanced device-aided therapy, which is Duopa or Duodopa and deep brain stimulation. So, as we studied the market we agree that as we look at the ability to sort of move from a more convenient way a simple way for neurologists to get a more advanced therapy without doing a procedure, whether it's brain surgery or the -- or the GI surgery we think we can start to move upstream into that 90% of really non-workable oral segment. So, we are encouraged at the recent feedback from our KOLs and our study sites and are anticipating and planning for launch in the coming years. Yes, I'll take the early view from the field.

            "name": "Robert Michael",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Starting with fourth quarter results, we once again delivered strong top and bottom-line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.92 above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total net revenues were approximately $13.9 billion, up 6.8% on a comparable operational basis and ahead of our expectations. Immunology global sales were approximately $6 billion, up 14.8% on an operational basis. Within immunology, Humira sales were approximately $5.2 billion, up 4.4% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit growth in the US offset by biosimilar competition across international markets. SKYRIZI sales were $525 million and RINVOQ sales were $281 million with both products demonstrating strong sequential growth above expectations. Hematologic Oncology delivered another strong quarter with revenue of approximately $1.8 billion, up 15.5% on an operational basis with solid growth from IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. Aesthetic sales were more than $1.1 billion with Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm both experiencing a rapid recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, up 14.9% on a comparable operational basis, led by Vraylar and our migraine portfolio. We also saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had sales of more than $900 million. Turning now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 12.6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.3% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.9% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $618 million and the adjusted tax rate was 11.6%. As we look ahead to 2021, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.32 and $12.52, reflecting growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.63 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $55.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This forecast comprehends the following assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect immunology global sales of approximately $25 billion, including US Humira growth of approximately 8%, internationally Humira revenue of approximately $3 billion at current exchange rates, SKYRIZI global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, and RINVOQ global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. We expect hematologic oncology to grow double-digits with IMBRUVICA global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion and VENCLEXTA global sales of approximately $1.8 billion. For Aesthetics, we expect global sales of approximately $4.5 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion from Botox Cosmetic and approximately $1.3 billion from Juvederm. For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, including Botox Therapeutic sales of approximately $2.3 billion, Vraylar sales of approximately $1.8 billion, and UBRELVY sales of approximately $400 million. For eye care, we expect global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, including approximately $550 million from RESTASIS, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2021. For women's health, we expect global revenue of approximately $1.1 billion. For remaining larger products, we expect global sales of approximately $2 billion from Mavyret, $1.2 billion from Creon, $1 billion from Linzess, $800 million from Synthroid, and $750 million from Lupron. Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 83% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.6 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $11.8 billion. This guidance includes approximately $1.7 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales, which represents an improvement of roughly 200 basis points versus 2020. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.5% and our share count to be roughly flat to Q4 2020. As we look ahead to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $12.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales. And we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.79 and $2.83, excluding approximately $1.32 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $8.4 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $21 billion in 2021. This fully supports a strong and growing dividend, which we have more than tripled since inception, as well as rapid debt repayment where we expect to pay down $17 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021, including the $8.6 billion that was repaid in 2020. We expect to achieve a net debt to EBITDA ratio just below 2.5 times by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. We anticipate that our net leverage ratio will be approximately 2 times by the end of 2022. Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative mid to late-stage assets. In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2020. We've driven top tier growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and we expect to deliver robust performance in 2021 and over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. Vamil, this is Rob. I'll take your question on margin progression. I think when you consider the greater than $2 billion expense synergies from Allergan by next year and the P&L leverage that will come from the sales growth, we also expect for next year, you should expect that our operating margin will continue to expand through 2022. Upon the entry of U.S. biosimilars in 2023 and given Humira's profitability, it is reasonable to expect operating margin pull back. We've indicated before the 45% range based on our current LRP, I think it'll be a little bit higher than that. But then we've returned to growth immediately \u2013 in 2024, we'll return to revenue growth, a very strong revenue growth starting in 2025, you can expect then operating margins once again expand. We've had a long history of expanding operating margin by leveraging the P&L. And I would expect that to continue as we start to see very strong revenue growth starting in 2025 and beyond. Yes, I just -- on your question regarding warehouse patients who have a very modest amount of warehouse patients assumed [ph] in the forecast. So we're not count -- the $1.7 billion doesn't really count on that. And keep in mind that RINVOQ was of the product that was lesser impacted by COVID and so there's not really significant how warehousing in that forecast. No, that covered it. I think if you look at the overall portfolio, we've detailed out what we expect for Vraylar and that's without the additional indication. We think we can get to approaching $4 billion. When you look at the migraine portfolio, peak sales are greater than $1 billion for both the UBRELVY and Atogepant. We have 951 in the pipeline that we think can be a significant contributor, obviously, Botox Therapeutic will continue to grow. So we feel pretty good about the portfolio we have and that double-digit growth outlook is supported by a number of very promising assets. Hi, Luis. This is Rob. So I think now that we have first full year with combined company and you're looking at these profiles. I think you could assume they're indicative in the range of what you'd expect going forward. And so that is a cleaner guide then say when you have a partial year like we had in 2020 as it relates to the synergies we achieved in 2020 which is about $600 million of synergies about $400 million that was an R&D and $200 million SG&A and you see we've now increased that to $1.7 billion in 2021 with about a little bit roughly half of that coming from R&D about in the 40% range SG&A and about 10% from cost of goods."

            "name": "Michael Severino",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. We've clearly made significant progress with our pipeline over the past few years, particularly our late-stage programs in hematologic oncology with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, and in immunology with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. Since inception, our R&D organization has delivered an impressive set of new products, which collectively contributed approximately $11 billion in revenue in 2020. We also continue to see significant evolution of our early and mid-stage clinical programs with many assets expected to transition to late-stage registrational studies over the next several years. We will continue to replenish our late-stage pipeline with innovative assets that have the potential to drive additional growth for AbbVie in the second half of the decade. At our recent immunology investor event in December, we provided a detailed overview of our immunology programs, highlighting the robust data generated to-date for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI across approved and pipeline indications. Included in this event, we presented positive topline data from two new Phase 3 studies for RINVOQ . Results from the first induction study in ulcerative colitis and results from the head-to-head study versus dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. We expect to see results from the second Phase 3 UC induction study later this quarter, and from the UC maintenance study in the middle of this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis are currently under review and we expect an approval decision in the US in the second quarter based on priority review and in Europe in the second half of the year. We recently received European Commission approval for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and expect approval decisions for those indications in the US in the first half of this year. I want to take a moment to address the topic of safety, specifically MACE and malignancies following the results from tofacitinib's post-marketing safety study. At present, there are no data to suggest the safety outcomes from their study applied to a specific JAK1 inhibitor such as RINVOQ. We are not aware of any signal for an elevated risk of MACE or malignancies with the RINVOQ or any JAK inhibitor other than Xeljanz. We conducted a pooled database analysis across our clinical trials for DVT, MACE and malignancies at the time of RINVOQ\u2019s regulatory submission and have updated it periodically including up to the present. Rates with RINVOQ have not been elevated relative to competitors or to expected baseline rates. Importantly, there has been no increase or meaningful change in those rates over time. Additionally, we adjudicate events for MACE and DVT, which is considered the highest standard of evidence. If we look across our long-term database in RA, a population that is at increased risk for MACE events, our rates remain low. At the approved dose in RA, we have followed more than 3,700 treated patients totaling more than 9,000 patient-years' experience. Our rate of MACE events is 0.4 per 100 patient-years, which compares favorably to the expected rate of 1.0 to 1.7 events for 100 patient-years. In addition, there is no evidence of a dose-response between the 15 and 30-milligram doses. Similarly, the rate of malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer with similar follow-up is 0.8 events per100 patient-years. This rate is also consistent with the expected range of rates of 0.86 to 0.94 per 100 patient-years. And again, we see no evidence of a dose-response between 15 and 30-milligrams. Moving now to SKYRIZI; we also recently reported top-line results from the Phase 3 programs for SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. In the two Crohn's induction studies, SKYRIZI demonstrated significant improvements in clinical remission and endoscopic endpoints compared to placebo with symptom improvement seen as early as week four. Based on the data generated to date, we believe SKYRIZI has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We expect to see results from the maintenance study in Crohn's disease later this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. We're also very pleased with SKYRIZI\u2019s results in the Phase 3 studies in psoriatic arthritis, where we saw significant improvements in disease activity across both skin and joint endpoints compared to placebo. We believe that the activity we have seen on joint disease and the impressive skin clearance that is a hallmark of the SKYRIZI program make it a compelling offering for patients with mixed joint and skin involvement. We plan to submit our regulatory applications for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis in the first half of this year. We're making good progress with our early and mid-stage immunology programs as well where we expect several data readouts and phase transitions in 2021. We expect to begin three new studies for ABBV-154, our TNF steroid conjugate including a Phase 2b dose-ranging study in RA as well as Phase 2 studies in Crohn's disease and polymyalgia rheumatica. And we'll see proof-of-concept data in the second quarter for ravagalimab, our CD40 antagonist in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, and for ABBV-157, our oral ROR-gamma T inhibitor in Phase 1 for psoriasis. Both of these programs experienced slight COVID-related delays with results now expected for both in the second quarter of this year. In oncology, we continue to make significant progress advancing our pipeline with numerous data readouts and regulatory milestones last year. As well as the addition of several new assets brought in through our in-licensing efforts, including Genmab's CD3xCD20 epcoritamab and I-Mab's anti-CD47 lemzoparlimab. We showcased new data from several programs at the recent ASH meeting where we presented nearly 40 abstracts from eight different assets. Notable presentations included data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE trial evaluating IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL, which showed patients who achieved undetectable MRD following this combination maintain their deep remission at the one-year mark after stopping therapy with a 95% rate of disease free survival. We also presented new five-year data from VENCLEXTA\u2019s Murano trial demonstrating the benefits of fixed duration VENCLEXTA combinations and helping patients achieve sustained progression-free survival. The latest results from Murano in the relapsed refractory CLL setting showed a median progression-free survival of 54 months in the VENCLEXTA and rituximab group, compared to 17 months in the bendamustine-rituximab group, three or more years after stopping treatment. Updated dose-escalation data from a Phase 1 study evaluating epcoritamab in B-cell malignancies were also presented at ASH. Epcoritamab is a subcutaneously delivered bispecific CD3xCD20 antibody being developed in collaboration with Genmab. In the Phase 1 study, epcoritamab demonstrated encouraging single agent anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with a consistent and favorable safety profile showing no Grade 3 or higher CRS events as well as limited neurotoxicity. We believe epcoritamab has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy across a number of B-cell malignancies including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. The Phase 3 trial in relapsed-refractory DLBCL recently began and we will provide updates on epcoritamab as its development program progresses. Initial results were also presented from a Phase 1 study evaluating TNB-383B in relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma. TNB-383B is a novel bispecific T-cell engaging immunotherapy targeting BCMA and CD3 being developed in collaboration with TeneoBio. These Phase 1 results demonstrated that the BCMA/CD3 bispecific provided overall response rates of 80% with a large number of patients achieving a very good partial response or better despite having received multiple prior lines of therapy. TNB-383B was well tolerated at all doses tested with a few off-target toxicities and no Grade 3 or higher CRS observed. With its safety profile efficacy and the convenience of once every three-week dosing, this agent has the potential to become a promising treatment option for myeloma patients. And our partner I-Mab published an abstract with initial results from a Phase 1 study evaluating lemzoparlimab in AML and MDS. These results demonstrated encouraging activity in relapsed-refractory AML patients and lemzoparlimab was well tolerated with no serious hematological adverse events reported today. Based on these promising initial results, we plan to begin new studies this year for lemzoparlimab in AML, MDS and in multiple myeloma. We also recently saw data from an interim analysis of a Phase 2 study evaluating Teliso-V in heavily pretreated non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients. The encouraging results from Stage 1 of this study met the criteria for advancing the program. With Teliso-V demonstrating a 54% objective response rate in patients with wild-type EGFR with highly expressed c-MET. In EGFR wild-type patients with over-expressed c-MET, which includes both high and intermediate expression, the objective response rate was 35%. Based on these results, we believe that there is an important role for Teliso-V in this target population, which represents roughly 25% of the non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer population. We will be opening the second stage of the study and are planning discussions with regulators regarding the potential of this study to support an accelerated filing. We expect 2021 to be another important year for our oncology pipeline with several regulatory submissions as well as data readouts across all stages of development. This year, we expect to see data for IMBRUVICA in the Phase 3 SHINE study in frontline MCL with regulatory submissions expected in the second half of the year. Data for IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA in second line or greater MCL and frontline CLL with regulatory submission for frontline CLL expected in the second half of the year. We also expect to see data from registration enabling studies for VENCLEXTA in high-risk MDS and navitoclax in relapsed-refractory myelofibrosis. And we expect to see data from numerous programs in our early-stage oncology pipeline. In addition, the programs under collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. Our partnered effort is comprised of a strong pipeline of novel targets, which includes more than 20 active programs in discovery or preclinical development. Importantly, we currently have programs, which have advanced into clinical development in two areas immuno-oncology and neurodegeneration. The lead Calico program in oncology is focused on PTPN2 inhibitors, which act at multiple steps in the cancer immunity cycle and have potential applicability in a broad variety of tumor types. The discovery of novel orally bio-available PTPN2 inhibitors represents a significant breakthrough and a target class that has historically been considered un-druggable. We currently have two assets in Phase 1 development ABBV-CLS-579 and 484. We've seen evidence of immune activation in the clinic with this pathway and we expect to see proof-of-concept data from this program in 2022. The lead Calico program in neuroscience is an eIF2B activator, which targets a key regulator of the highly conserved integrated stress response pathway. Inhibition of this pathway has the potential to prevent pathology and restore function in a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Parkinson's disease as well as in traumatic brain injury. Our lead eIF2B activator ABBV-CLS-7262 is currently progressing through Phase 1 and we plan to begin a study later this year in patients with ALS. In other neuroscience updates, last year, we completed our registrational program for atogepant in episodic migraine prevention and we recently submitted our regulatory application to the FDA. We expect an approval decision by the end of the third quarter. The data generated in our Phase 3 programs support a strong benefit-risk profile and we believe that atogepant has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients as a safe, effective, oral treatment option for the prevention of episodic migraine. In 2021, we expect to see data from several late-stage neuroscience assets, including results from two Phase 3 studies for Vraylar in major depressive disorder and results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease with regulatory submissions for 951 expected in the second half of the year. We also expect to see proof-of-concept data for Elezanumab in a Phase 2 study in multiple sclerosis and ABBV-8E12, our lead anti-tau antibody in a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease. In addition to 8E12, we have a number of promising approaches in Alzheimer's, including our neuroinflammation programs aimed at TREM2 and CD33, currently in clinical development, as well as other tau approaches in preclinical development. These include tau antibodies with different epitope specificity as well as approaches to clear intracellular tau. In Aesthetics, we continue to make excellent progress with our portfolio of facial toxins and dermal fillers with several regulatory submissions, data readouts and pivotal study starts expected this year. Our programs include new indications for Botox as well as innovative toxins such as new liquid formulations and both the long and short-acting toxins. We also have programs to develop new indications for the Juvederm Collection as well as novel dermal fillers such as HArmonyCa, which will be entering registration enabling studies in the U.S. And in eye care, based on the positive results from the Phase 3 studies evaluating our topical eye drop AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. We plan to submit our regulatory application later this month and expect an approval decision in the fourth quarter of this year. So in summary, our R&D productivity remained high last year despite multiple COVID-related challenges and we were able to maintain steady continuity and minimize delays. We're entering 2021 well-positioned for continued success and we expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline, again this year. This includes five new asset or major indication approvals, half a dozen regulatory submissions, more than 10 pivotal study readouts, and more than 15 data readouts from early and mid-stage programs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2021 guidance. Rob? Okay, this is Mike. I will take your second question first and then we can cover the SKYRIZI question. With respect to RINVOQ, I assume you're talking about the tofacitinib safety study, which top line results fairly recently in the last several days and showed in that program that they were unable to exclude a risk of MACE or malignancy based on the criteria that were used to analyze that data sets. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've kept a very, very close eye on our data, both at the time of the NDA and in an ongoing manner since that time and we've not seen a signal. Our rates have not been elevated with respect to comparator or baseline rates and the rates overall remain low. With respect to your specific question about whether we've had discussions with regulators, regulators have not asked us to do long-term safety study in the way that Pfizer was asked. So that has not been discussed with regulators and we have not had any contact with regulators around labeling updates up to the present time. And with respect to SKYRIZI?... So, this is Mike. I'll pick up from here. I think that our optimism and I think that's the right way to express it in a disease like MDD, which is a challenging disease to work and is based on a couple of features. One is based on the basic pharmacology of Vraylar, which has a unique mix of D3, D2 specificity and other features that lead clinically to what's been described as a brightening effect, which seems to be beneficial in a number of settings. It's also driven by the results that we have from the MDD study that is positive that we already have in hand. So with one positive study, we would need only one -- at least one or, of course, both of the next two studies to read out positive, either of those outcomes would support a filing. We've done a deep dive into the study design and the patient population. We think it's a well-designed study. And we think the patient characteristics with respect to baseline factors and other elements are all very appropriate for this sort of study and we can assess that in a blinded aggregate way in a way that's completely consistent with the study rules for the conduct of the study. And so all of those things make us feel optimistic that it's a molecule with a good chance to work, well-designed study, well-conducted study, and we look forward to seeing the results. But as I mentioned, MDD is a challenging area. And for that reason, we didn't build into our deal model and we didn't factor it into our guidance, as Rick said, so we view this as upside. So, this is Mike. I'll take the Vraylar question. I believe you're talking about the ongoing MDD studies and what I would say there is that the dose selection was based on everything we know about dose-response, not only from the prior MDD studies but across the program and we've done a deep dive into that and we're confident that we're at a dose that ought to have optimal effect in these indications -- in this indication. With respect to your question about placebo response rate, managing or controlling the placebo response is extremely important in all studies, but particularly in depression studies and other studies in psychiatry. And I would say that there are many different approaches that are taken that are complementary to each other. The first and most important is appropriate site selection, one has to select sites with an appropriate patient population with experienced investigators who are also experienced evaluators in a clinical trial setting and that's one of the most important things to getting high-quality data to determine whether a drug works. The next element has to do with investigator training, investigator manuals, protocol design and also with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria to make sure that you have a patient population that is representative of the population that you would expect to treat post-registration if the study is successful. And we've taken a look at all of these things, we've taken a look at the blinded aggregate data and we feel good that the measures that we have in place will effectively control the placebo response and give us a quality readout. Okay. This is Mike, I'll take your first question on ABBV 154 our TNF steroid conjugate has not been delayed because of COVID. There were some delays in other early immunology programs. Our CD 40 and our ROR gamma-T program experienced modest delays but 154 did not. As we said at the time of the COVID peak over the course of last summer, there were a small number of studies that we delayed initiation and delayed enrollment, is the programs that I'm talking about TD 40 and ROR gamma T were impacted modestly in that time period but 154 was not so that remains on-track. We remain confident in it. We have selected 154 as the agent to go forward. Remember that we had two 3373 and 154 and we selected 154 because of advantages it had in linker technology, we're planning to initiate a large Phase 2 B study in the first half of this year and then today, we're now saying that we will also be studying Phase 2 Crohn's disease, as well as polymyalgia rheumatica, and that's an important set of indication that covers a wide range of opportunities, RA and Crohn's disease areas where we are very active, PMR polymyalgia rheumatica is a new area where there is not a lot of therapeutics, unfortunately, it is a well-established area in medicine but there is very little in terms of treatment for these patients, they have considerable pain and suffering from their condition and it's -- and it's particularly steroid responsive. So we think it is a very attractive target for our steroid ADC approach. The 154 remains on track and we continue to have confidence. I also say in that time period when we did BI it was an absolute requirement on the account, right. Well, that was really, it wasn't like a judgment call or something thing to desire to do the accounting, said to be accounted for in that fashion. It's since been changed going forward. But the window in which we that occurred that was the required accounting treatment. So number two, Jeff and I will cover number two, sort of a high level look and then Jeff, maybe can give more specificity around that. If you look at Duodopa I mean this is a -- this is a therapy that has absolutely phenomenal efficacy and you can see these patients who cannot move early and you turn on the pump and you start giving them the drug and within a very short period of time, they will gain their motion. The challenge is a very difficult treatment to the patient to basically deal with and the caregiver to deal with on a long term sustainable basis; you have to do surgery, insert a G-Tube, you got to maintain that G-Tube opened, so that does somewhat limit the population is able to use it. And so we view this as a way to significantly expand the market. Jeff is obviously far more familiar with it. So I'll let him, give you a little more specific, but that's the general concept. I think this could be a significant -- wanting to be a significant treatment for these patients who need this kind of therapy. And two, I think we could expand the market pretty significantly. So, this is Mike. I'll take the question on the heme-onc portfolio mid stage and newer technologies, but I would say is there is a lot going on in our heme-onc portfolio. Obviously with our late-stage molecules in the mid-stage. I think you'll see a focus on T-cell redirection, which is of course a newer technology. And I think a very attractive approach to harness the immune system to control these cancers and you see good progress with our CD3 by CD20 and our BCMA T cell redirecting therapies. And so, that is clearly an area of focus for us now and I think we'll continue to be in the future. With respect to gene therapy, gene therapy is not a single thing it can be used in different ways. Gene replacement is not an area that we've been focused on. Gene delivery is an enabling technology for other therapeutic approaches like cell-based therapies and we have early programs and cell-based therapies in heme-onc and in other areas. Solid tumor oncology and potentially other areas in the future. And so that's something that we are keeping a close eye on and making sure that we have access to the enabling technologies we need to prosecute those targets. I think that for those sorts of approaches we're probably one generation away from things that are broadly applicable. But we are exploring possibilities that we think can fulfill that next generation need. And so we are keeping up a broad eye and are essentially therapeutically agnostic. What I mean by that is we look for the best tool to do the job. We don't find it tool and then figure out how to use it. And so in each of these cases we're going after strong biology. We're going after things that we think will raise the bar on the standard of care. And I think a number of the newer technologies that I mentioned fit that bill."

            "name": "Richard Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 performance as well as our expectations for 2021. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our pipeline, and Rob will discuss the quarter and our 2021 guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08. Fourth quarter total net revenues were up nearly 7% on a comparable operational basis. This performance was driven by robust double-digit sales growth from our immunology, hem/onc and neuroscience franchises, as well as 9% comparable operational sales growth of Botox Cosmetic, which is demonstrating a rapid recovery. Our fourth quarter performance topped off another excellent and truly transformational year for AbbVie, which included the successful acquisition and integration of Allergan, creating a stronger and much more diverse AbbVie with leadership across numerous attractive high-growth markets. Significant contributions from our two new best in category immunology medicines, RINVOQ and SKYRIZI , which combined for more than $2.3 billion in 2020 sales, their first full year on the market. We expect the combined contribution from RINVOQ and SKYRIZI to nearly double in 2021 to approximately $4.6 billion based on their continued strong uptake in RA and psoriasis as well as RINVOQ\u2019s anticipated approvals in PSA, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis later this year. We delivered continued robust growth from our leading hem/onc portfolio, with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA contributing more than $6.6 billion in combined 2020 sales. We expect our hem/onc franchise to grow double digits again in 2021. We also added two compelling oncology pipeline assets, Epcoritamab, a potential best-in-class CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody in development for B-cell malignancies and lemzoparlimab, an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody being studied in multiple cancers. These two assets will further support the growth of our hem/onc franchise across our long-range plan. The acquisition of Allergan brought us a substantial neuroscience portfolio with compelling therapies for migraine and psychiatric conditions augmenting our already existing neuro franchise. The newly combined neuroscience franchise delivered nearly $4.9 billion in comparable 2020 revenue and is expected to grow double digits in 2021. We also added the leading global Aesthetics franchise, a largely cash pay portfolio with roughly $3.5 billion in comparable 2020 revenues. As I previously noted, this portfolio has demonstrated a rapid V-shape recovery and we view Aesthetics as an extremely attractive long-term growth opportunity. And importantly, we made excellent progress in 2020 with our pipeline. We expect our R&D pipeline advancements to lead to the approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including a total of six additional indications for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which will cover all of Humira's major indications plus new significant disease areas, including atopic dermatitis, expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and Vraylar and several new product approvals, including Atogepant for episodic migraine, Navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. These new opportunities will collectively add meaningful revenue growth in advance of the U.S. Humira LOE. We've entered 2021 in a strong position, which is reflected in our revenue and earnings per share guidance. Based on the recent outperformance of our business, we expect full-year 2021 comparable operational sales growth of approximately 9.4% with total AbbVie sales expected to be approximately $1.7 billion above current consensus, and we anticipate 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.32 to $12.52, representing growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. This level of guidance represents impressive performance with nearly all aspects of our business expected to perform at or above current consensus for 2021. The Allergan integration continues to go very well. The transition has been seamless despite the size of the transaction and the timing of the COVID pandemic. While we're making excellent progress against our expense synergies, which Rob will cover in more detail here momentarily, it remains increasingly clear to us that there are significant opportunities for long-term revenue contributions across numerous Allergan growth platforms. As we recently disclosed, we believe UBRELVY , the first-to-market in leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. Atogepant, a potential once-daily oral treatment for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine also represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. We expect Vraylar's peak sales to approach $4 billion within its currently approved indications of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression with major depressive disorder or MDD, representing a potentially significant incremental growth opportunity. Aesthetics, which is poised to regain its growth trajectory this year is expected to generate high single-digit revenue growth over the next decade. We continue to closely monitor the COVID dynamics, which will have an impact on our business again in 2021, predominantly in the first half of the year, but significantly moderated from the 2020 impact. And despite the recent COVID resurgence within select geographies, we feel the global healthcare system is much better equipped with COVID treatment protocols in PPE to safely see and treat patients throughout the current year. That said, some therapeutic areas continue to be more impacted than others, like CLL, HCV, certain hospital-based procedures, among others, which we have contemplated in our 2021 guidance. Overall, we've been pleased with the rate of recovery across our business, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and our commercial execution. So in summary, we've assembled an impressive set of growth assets and the outlook for AbbVie's business remains strong. With RINVOQ and SKYRIZI expected to contribute more than $15 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2025 and our expectations for continued robust growth across hem/onc, neuroscience, and aesthetics, we have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to successfully absorb the Humira LOE impact in 2023, support an immediate return to total sales growth in 2024 and produce compelling high single-digit compounded annual total sales growth in 2025 through the remainder of the decade with the diversified portfolio and pipeline that we have today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike? So this is Rick. So I think the bottom line is, we've contemplated that. It's a good question, Geoff, but I think we have a strategy that will allow us to deal with that and impact the market in an appropriate way. Yes, Vamil, this is Rick. Mike and I'll cover the second question on Vraylar. It's important to recognize that what we've communicated in long-term guidance on Vraylar is based on the three currently approved indications. So it doesn't count on the fact that MDD would be successful. Now having said that, I think we do have -- I'd say, we're cautiously optimistic about the MDD indication and I'll let Mike kind of walk through how we look at it and what gives us that level of confidence. But in the event, it weren't to play out, that doesn't impact the guidance that we gave. The only thing I would add to Jeff's comments, I mean if you look at RINVOQ did $731 million last year. Obviously, if you look at the running rate out of the fourth quarter had [ph] strong running rate coming out of the fourth quarter but that's a $1 billion worth of growth from '20 to '21. The majority of that growth is going to come from continued performance in RA. I think where you will see the most significant impact from atopic dermatitis will be as we flow into '22, much like as you saw what happened in the RA market, it takes time for physicians to start to get adapted. Once they do, their momentum picks up. So, I don't remember the specific number. I'm not sure we gave that guidance anyway, but I would be thinking about it more than its continued penetration and growth in RA which drive in the bulk of that growth. Rob, anything you want to add? And then, Randall, on your second question; I would say we absolutely agree with your point of view. I think eye care is a very attractive market. The kinds of markets that I think we look for and that we are the very best at is where there are specialized physicians who really drive the use of medications based on the clinical data and being able to restate markets and improve standard-of-care in those markets, and certainly, eye-care, I think it fits that description. And so we would have a strong appetite to look for opportunities and we are looking for opportunities now that we could add to that eye care business to be able to drive growth. Obviously, RESTASIS, as Rob indicated in his formal remarks, we've built in a half a year that's still an unknown of when that product will go generic or if it will go generic. But I think even aside from that regardless of what happens with RESTASIS longer-term, this is an area that we would have interest in and if we could find the right kind of assets to add to it, we would enthusiastically do that. Yes, Chris, this is Rick. So I'll cover the Aesthetics question for you. I'd say as we've studied the Aesthetics market and had an opportunity to be able to operate the business now for some time, I think we're even more enthusiastic about the long-term ability to be able to grow this market. I would say some of the areas that were a bit of a surprise to us is the responsiveness of this market to patient activation, and I would say that the strategy that we've put in place is one where we are funding the business on a very -- on a continuous basis at a high level to achieve the level of activation that we're looking for and we think that will, certainly, you can see, the response I guess an example in Botox already, we are seeing a very aggressive response in being able to grow the market, you saw the Botox grew -- Botox Cosmetic grew in the fourth quarter to 9%. I would expect that we can continue to drive that level of growth. And as part of legacy Allergan, I think it was much more episodic in the way this was funded quarter-to-quarter where we basically built a funding plan that will allow them to continue to drive activation over a longer term [ph]. I'd say the second thing that's it's of interest to us is, I think this is a market where you can drive significant innovation. If you fund that innovation in a way, again on a more continuous basis and advance those programs more aggressively, and have a well thought out strategic roadmap as to where you're trying to drive some of these markets. As Mike mentioned in his comments, our goal is to basically try to advance the level of performance of the toxin market significantly over time. And the same with the filler market. There are certainly things that we can do to expand the areas that you could use fillers, both within the US and globally and that's a significant opportunity. But long term, we think there is an opportunity to take some of the biologic expertise that we have here at AbbVie and create more biologically active fillers, and not only do physical filling but also improve collagen, improve elastin, and other kinds of characteristics that will improve skin quality. And we think that will be -- if we're successful, we think that will be a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth. And then, the last thing I'd say is the geographic footprint that AbbVie has. We obviously have a very broad geographic footprint and the structure that we've set up is this totally integrated global unit that we're operating the Aesthetics business really gives them the freedom to go out and expand or more aggressively fund areas around the globe that they think there is a significant opportunity. A good case in point is I believe it was in the fourth quarter, we funded a significant expansion in China to be able to increase the sales force there to be able to drive it more deeply into a broader set of the cities in China to the next level down and we are already seeing the benefits of that, China is already back to growing much like it did pre-COVID. So I think there's a lot of attractive attributes about that. On IMBRUVICA maybe Jeff and I will tag team on that one. What we're clearly seeing is the COVID is having an impact on patient starts in CLL. We're not only seeing it IMBRUVICA, but we're seeing in VENCLEXTA as well. And then somewhat logical when you think about these oncology practices of trying to reduce density and CLL is a disease where you can, in many patients' cases, you can delay therapy for some period of time. I would say that's the vast majority of it. When we look at -- when I look at the overall share. And the reason why I'm talking about the overall share is VENCLEXTA is now gaining a significant level of momentum in this market as well. When I look at our overall shares in first line, second line or third line, we continue to have the dominant share position. And I'd say probably, partially due to your question, if I look at Calico [ph] I'd say it's performing at the expectation we have. I think the first line share is about 12%, slightly higher in second line maybe 14%, and I don't recall the third line share... So I'd say that's within the range or we saw with MCL, it's within the range of what we had modeled. So it's not really a competitive issue that we're dealing with. It's more a function of getting those patients starts back up to the level they were before. Anything, you want to add, Jeff? Hey, Nicole. This is Rick. I think this is something we've got experience with, if you think about the economic crisis, I thought we saw a similar kind of uptick in price erosion outside the United States and in particular, I'd say in the European Union, we have factored in a reasonable assumption into our guidance for 2021, I feel good about that. I think it is reflective of what we're likely to see. So I think we're covered from that perspective. Anything you want to add Rob? Okay. Steve, this is Rick, I'll cover the first one, and Mike can cover the second one. I would say, first and foremost, we are a very disciplined organization in how we approach execution in the marketplace. We tend to probably, in [ph] some extent, obsessively plan and then go out and try to execute against that plan and I think in times of difficulties that kind of discipline tends to demonstrate itself and that's when you see the biggest differences. So that's not say [ph] other people don't do it like that. I'm not that familiar with how others operate, but I know how we operate and I know how we contingency plan and we look at. Okay, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do and we do that ahead of time, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do. And I think that kind of contingency planning and focus on execution is helpful. I'd say the second thing is, if I look at our business, we put a strategy in place and I feel very good about how the business is performing overall. I mean I would say the business is firing on all cylinders. And you can look at our fourth quarter performance, to your point, and I think it demonstrates that and you can look at our guidance and it demonstrates that almost every single product area is performing at or above, most of them above what consensus was and then I think it's another indicator for you and we have a much more diverse business now. We have four major growth platforms that are helping us drive that level of growth. Our new product launches are doing extremely well. Obviously, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are, but I'd also say UBRELVY and Vraylar are performing extremely well and the pipeline, I would say one of the things gives me the most confidence is when I look at the pipeline behind that. It's designed to be able to drive our long-term growth because one of the things that we focus on is how we're going to make sure that we continue to drive this business to perform at the level its performing over the long term. And so if I look at the SKYRIZI and RINVOQ R&D execution around the follow-on indications, it's been nothing less than spectacular both from a timing standpoint and the kind of data that we have been able to produce. When I look at our hem/onc strategy, we've had a very disciplined strategy there ensuring that we have enough assets to continue to grow. What has become a very large franchise for us. Our franchise is $6.6 billion as we said, we're going to grow in double digits. Over the long term, what's going to allow us to do that? Well obviously IMBRUVICA is going to continue to drive share, VENCLEXTA is going to continue to drive share in CLL but VENCLEXTA has indication expansions in the area of potential, in the areas of T1114 and a broader AML population and several other areas. Then I look at Navitoclax. We should get that product approved and give us an opportunity in myelofibrosis and then you look at Genmab and you look at our CD47, those will all allow us to ensure that we can sustain that growth profile over the long term. In neuroscience, same thing, atogepant will allow us to expand into the broader migraine population. So I feel very good about what we put in place and our ability to execute against that. So I think there is not one silver bullet that I can point to. I think it's all of those things, certainly, our ability in market access has helped a lot in the US. I think we're very good at that, but you have to have the right kinds of assets in order to execute that. You have to have assets that are differentiative like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. So it's the combination of all of that gives you this performance and gives you the long-term sustainable ability to deliver that kind of performance and I feel awfully good about where we are. Well, I'd say, on the neuroscience investment, I mean we obviously have a very broad neuroscience investment. I mean we have a significant investment from an R&D standpoint. And in disease-modifying approaches for a number of different neurological diseases that Mike has talked about and mentioned in his comments earlier. So I'd say we have a significant R&D investment. We obviously are investing in Vraylar to continue to expand that asset. Again, our goal will be to invest in these areas where you can get maximum capture -- market share capture. I think if you look at Vraylar and you look at the projections that we made over time, if you look at the sequential year-over-year dollar growth of that business, that's how you get to that number. And basically, we're going to be able to sustain that, we expect to continue to sustain it as relatively low market share, but that's not unusual. And in this market, because there's a lot of generic products that psychiatrists, cycle patients through and sometimes in combination with patients. So we're going to invest in the business to be able to drive the maximum level of profitable share as we do in any other segment that we're in. Same thing on Botox Therapeutics, obviously, we have R&D programs in there to continue to expand the opportunities in therapeutics. Anything you want to add from an investment standpoint, Rob? This is, Rick. The only thing I'd add on that is when you look at that SKYRIZI 33% in-play share, it's almost double what the next closest competitor is, I mean it's impressive. The gap between SKYRIZI and the number two player and the other thing is, as these brands get more experience in the market, we'll also start to talk about the total TRx share and I think SKYRIZI is at that point now. I think it's total TRx share now is 14% [indiscernible] or something like that. That's right. And that's pretty impressive for this short period of time and it is close to number two in the market in TRx share. So they are both doing very, very well. Yes, Chris, I'll take your question on Contingent considerations and yes, we did account for this as a business combination. So that means each quarter we do a mark-to-market, the fair value of the future milestone royalty payments and you did see us take a fair value write up this quarter. Based on the higher sales outlook as we communicated during the Immunology Day event in December and you see in the guidance provided today, obviously the outlook for SKYRIZI continue to increase. And so we're recognizing that liability going forward. We also take into a consideration because it's a fair value measure what the market is assuming. So it's not just our own forecast. It's also what street expectations are and those have also increased as we've seen a very nice ramp. We are starting to see obviously the confidence from the street increase that's translated into a higher outlook for SKYRIZI which then translates in a higher future potential royalties. One of the reasons I wanted to stress, also on the free cash flow in my remarks today is because there is some confusion over that's how we account for, but it's important to keep in mind that when I talk about free cash flow of $21 billion this year, that accounts for the royalty payments of - to BI. And so you can look at a few different ways, you can look at it from a \u2013 if you can track the consideration accretion that we're recording and the liability on the balance sheet as an indicator of the future outlook, but also as we monitor our cash flow pretty carefully what does that contribute to overall cash flow. So we would not be going back, we made a determination as a business combination. We don't -- should not anticipate that we would reverse that but we'll provide obviously more clarity on what those royalties look like going forward given the size of the asset. Yes, so I don't know that we're going to specifically comment on what we've assumed as it relates to [indiscernible]. I just don't think it's probably appropriate. First of all, it's not that large of a product to begin with. So wouldn't have a material impact on Botox Cosmetics. I'd say on the -- on the -- on your second question, I will tell you emphatically we have no interest in spinning off the Aesthetics business. We have a program in place where we manage the differences between the reimbursement associated with Botox Therapeutics and the cash pay portion of the Cosmetics business, it's been in place for quite some time. We're quite comfortable that we can manage it quite effectively. So It's an important thing that you -- that you track carefully, but we have a good system in place to be able to do that, but we have no interest in getting off the Aesthetics business or any aspects of the of the Aesthetics business."

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nLiz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AbbVie\u2019s operations, results and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today\u2019s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable operational basis, which includes full current year and historical results for Allergan and excludes the impact of exchange. For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast to conform to AbbVie\u2019s revenue recognition accounting policies and excludes the divestitures of Zenpep and Viokace. Following our prepared remarks, we will take your questions. So, with that, I will now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will discuss our third quarter performance and highlights, as well as our full year guidance, which we are raising again this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D programs and Rob will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, we will take your questions. AbbVie delivered another excellent quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.83, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08. When I look at our business and the actions we have taken to position AbbVie for sustainable performance, including the acquisition of Allergan, I feel very good about our long-term outlook. The fundamentals are strong and there is considerable momentum across our legacy and new portfolios, which are both demonstrating robust growth, despite the COVID pandemic and together have the potential for significant long-term value creation. I\u2019d like to specifically highlight our recent progress across several aspects of our business, including the launches of RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which are performing well ahead of all comparable launch analogs in their initial indications and continue to exceed our expectations. Our hem/onc franchise continues to deliver robust performance and is expected to generate more than $6.5 billion in revenue this year, representing strong double-digit growth. New indications and novel combinations, including our recently announced collaboration with Genmab and I-Mab provide opportunities for further revenue expansion. While it is still relatively early in the integration of Allergan, the strategic merits of the combination have never been more evident. We are already demonstrating that we have created a stronger, more diverse company, with robust cash flows and multiple new growth vehicles for the long-term. We now have the leading aesthetics franchise, which is demonstrating a strong V-shaped recovery, as well as a highly attractive neuroscience portfolio which delivered double-digit growth on a comparable operational basis this quarter and has significant momentum with VRAYLAR and our expanding migraine franchise. And our pipeline is advancing nicely, with numerous attractive late-stage programs that we believe will allow us to maintain a growing and vibrant business. We are on track for the approval of more than a dozen new products for major indications over the next two years, which will collectively add meaningful revenue growth. This includes a total of six additional indications for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and several other near-term product -- new product approvals, including atogepant, Navitoclax and 951. Clearly, this is a very exciting time for AbbVie and I am pleased with the progress that we are making towards our long-term strategy for sustainable growth. I remain confident that we will continue to execute as we have in the past and deliver outstanding shareholder value going forward. I\u2019d like to look further at our business performance. I am pleased with the recent trends across our key growth areas. I will start with immunology, where we established strong trajectories for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. As I previously noted, both continue to perform well-above expectations. In their initial indications, these two brands have clearly demonstrated superior efficacy to HUMIRA, as well as other novel agents on the market or in development, resulting in significant in-play market shares, a leading indicator for long-term commercial performance. The in-play share for RINVOQ in RA, which includes both new and switching patients remains strong at approximately 16% and has now reached parity with our market leading HUMIRA. In psoriasis, SKYRIZI has already achieved the leading in-play market share at 33%. This level of share capture at this stage of the launch is unprecedented, and if sustained, will ultimately lead to total market share well in excess of what was contemplated when we communicated our expectations for 2025 sales. This strong performance and trajectory, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to our differentiated product profile and our commercial execution. Our focus since the pandemic has been on driving accelerated patient activation and we remain encouraged by our current prescription trends. Our recent performance continues to give us confidence in the near- and long-term potential for both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which we now expect will deliver $2.2 billion in combined revenue for full year 2020, well exceeding our original projections for this year. In addition to outstanding commercial momentum, we are also making excellent progress with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI in new indications, which we expect will further strengthen our leadership position. We have already started planning and preparing for the forthcoming approval of three additional RINVOQ indications next year, including psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, giving us complete coverage across the more than $40 billion rheumatology segment. We also expect approval in atopic dermatitis, another large and growing market that has the potential to be multi-billion dollar peak revenues for RINVOQ. In the coming year, we also intend to submit regulatory applications for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis and both agents in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, a more than $20 billion market today with high unmet need. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the progress we are making on both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. I\u2019d also like to take this opportunity to announce that we will be hosting an immunology focused Investor Day in December, where we intend to further discuss our strategy, progress, and expectations for this important growth area. Additional details will be forthcoming. Turning now to hem/onc, which delivered robust double-digit growth again this quarter and remains an important therapeutic area for AbbVie\u2019s long-term performance. IMBRUVICA has a strong position across multiple indications including CLL, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. IMBRUVICA sales increased 9% on an operational basis this quarter, despite lower new patient starts within CLL, where the market remains below pre-COVID levels. VENCLEXTA sales increased nearly 60% on an operational basis this quarter. The penetration across our approved indications remains strong, especially in AML, given the potential aggressive disease progression of that cancer. In the quarter, we also announced a strategic collaboration with I-Mab, further expanding our oncology portfolio with anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, which has potential across a wide range of blood cancers. The I-Mab opportunity adds to our already-attractive oncology pipeline, which includes Navitoclax, Genmab CD3xCD20, expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and several promising early-stage programs. We also now have another high performing franchise in neuroscience, which further diversifies AbbVie\u2019s sources of long-term growth. VRAYLAR sales increased strong double-digits again this quarter on a comparable operational basis, with annualized revenues of more than $1.4 billion. Given VRAYLAR\u2019s benefit/risk profile relative to other atypical anti-psychotics, we remain confident in its long-term growth potential, which we believe is multi-billion dollars across the currently approved indications of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. BOTOX Therapeutics, which has nearly a dozen medical treatment indications, including chronic migraine, is also performing very well. Revenues were up nearly $100 million sequentially on a comparable operational basis, demonstrating a rapid COVID recovery. The launch of UBRELVY, our leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, is exceeding our expectations. Commercial access is ramping strongly and increasing DTC investments have resulted in encouraging new patient starts and market expansion. When you consider our overall scale with BOTOX Therapeutics, UBRELVY\u2019s acute treatment profile and the promising development of atogepant for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine, we see substantial room for long-term revenue growth with this best-in-class migraine portfolio. Within aesthetics, our fourth major growth platform, we are seeing robust demand trends and a rapid V-shaped recovery. Total global aesthetics revenues of more than $950 million were up 70% sequentially on a comparable operational basis, illustrating the significant underlying demand for both BOTOX cosmetics and JUV\u00c9DERM. We remain focused on supporting clinics through the COVID pandemic and expect consistent investment in consumer promotion to expand the aesthetics market, which remains under penetrated globally. Our dedicated R&D and business development are expected to sustain new innovation and rapidly expand our aesthetics portfolio for long-term growth, including the recently announced acquisition of Luminera, which provides us with a complementary dermal filler portfolio and pipeline. Overall, we are very pleased with the momentum that we are seeing with our aesthetics franchise. AbbVie\u2019s business continues to remain resilient and demonstrates strong underlying growth throughout the pandemic. Based on the performance this quarter and our progress year-to-date, we are raising our full year 2020 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $10.47 to $10.49, reflecting growth of more than 17% at the midpoint.  In addition to the excellent progress we are making across the portfolio, the integration of Allergan continues to go very well. Despite the size of this transaction and the timing of the COVID pandemic, the transition has been seamless. We are performing very well against both our synergy and accretion targets, and it is becoming increasingly clear to us that there are also opportunities for revenue synergies across various aspects of the business. We are now six months post-close and the strategic merits of the transaction are extremely evident. Allergan is providing additional growth platforms, robust financial benefits and greater diversity of our business. We remain confident that the newly combined business will generate significant earnings and cash flow to support continued investment in our innovative R&D platform, as well as a strong and growing dividend, while also allowing us to rapidly pay down debt.  To that end, as noted in our news release, today we are announcing a 10.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.18 per share to $1.30 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2021. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 225%.  So, in summary, we continue to demonstrate strong execution across our portfolio and remain encouraged by the overall recovery trends. We have assembled an impressive set of diversified growth assets with significant growth potential giving us a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Severino: Thank you, Rick. We continue to make great progress across all stages of our pipeline and this morning I will highlight key events since our last earnings call. Starting with immunology, where we achieved several major milestones, including submission of our U.S. and European regulatory applications for RINVOQ in ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis. We expect regulatory decisions in the first half of 2021 for both indications, as well as for psoriatic arthritis which was submitted for regulatory review earlier this year. Within the rheumatology segment, both psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are large and important markets and represent a significant growth opportunity for RINVOQ. We will highlight the growing body of data from our rheumatology portfolio and the -- at the upcoming virtual ACR Congress, where we will present 35 abstracts from multiple assets across our portfolio, including six selected for oral presentation. Atopic dermatitis is a new disease area for AbbVie and also represents an important area of growth for our immunology franchise going forward. Based on the data generated in our registrational program, we remain very confident in the benefit/risk profile for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis and believe it will offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. Beyond the Phase 3 studies that support our regulatory submission, we are also evaluating RINVOQ in a head-to-head Phase 3 trial against dupilumab, which if successful, will help further support RINVOQ as a highly differentiated therapeutic option for patients with atopic dermatitis. We look forward to seeing data from this head-to-head study later this quarter. In the area of inflammatory bowel diseases, we remain on track to see induction data later this quarter from our Phase 3 program for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis. We will see data from a second induction study in ulcerative colitis, as well as results from the maintenance portion of these studies next year. We expect to file our regulatory applications in 2021 as well. We are also making great progress with the development programs for SKYRIZI and later this quarter we expect data from several new indications across rheumatology and gastroenterology. We will see data from two Phase 3 studies in psoriatic arthritis and results from the first Phase 3 induction study in Crohn\u2019s disease, supporting regulatory applications for both indications in 2021. Outside of immunology, SKYRIZI will also be evaluated as a potential treatment for COVID-19 as part of the NIH ACTIV program, which is a public private partnership aimed at accelerating potential therapies and vaccines for COVID-19. SKYRIZI was selected through a prioritization process that evaluated immunomodulators with acceptable safety profiles as potential treatments for COVID-19 complications caused by the cytokine storm observed in some patients. SKYRIZI will be included in the ACTIV-5 Big Effect trial, which is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate a number of drugs that are either approved or in late-stage development as potential treatments for COVID-19. In our early-stage immunology pipeline, earlier this year, we toplined positive results from a proof-of-concept study evaluating our novel TNF steroid conjugate, ABBV-3373 in RA. We recently completed the Phase 1 PK and safety study for our second TNF steroid conjugate, ABBV-154. Based on these data, we have selected 154 to move forward into larger scale trials. We expect to begin a Phase 2b definitive dose ranging study for 154 in RA for the first half of 2021. As Rick mentioned, we will be hosting an Immunology Day for investors in December, where we will provide an update on our immunology strategy and long-term outlook for the franchise. We look forward to providing additional updates on our immunology pipeline at that time. In oncology, we continue to advance our portfolio with several important Phase 3 studies beginning in the quarter, including VENCLEXTA in high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and navitoclax in myelofibrosis. We also recently received full FDA approval of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, decitabine or low-dose cytarabine in newly diagnosed AML patients, who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. This approval is supported by the Phase 3 VIALE-A and VIALE-C studies. Updated efficacy and safety results from VIALE-A were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine and showed that the combination of VENCLEXTA and azacitidine extended overall survival compared to azacitidine plus placebo. Additionally, following the publication of the VIALE-A results, the NCCN guidelines were updated to recommend the VENCLEXTA and azacitidine combination as the Category 1 preferred treatment for AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Importantly, the VENCLEXTA combination has the Category 1 designation irrespective of mutational status. Also in the quarter, we announced a collaboration with I-Mab to develop and commercialize the anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, lemzoparlimab. The emerging data for lemzoparlimab is very encouraging and provides AbbVie access to another potentially differentiated asset in the immuno-oncology space. The data generated to date show that lemzoparlimab effectively blocks tumor-specific CD47 interactions, but with much lower binding to red blood cells, potentially leading to a better safety profile. Lemzoparlimab is being studied in multiple cancers with a focus on hematological malignancies. In neuroscience, we recently presented new data from several clinical programs at the virtual Migraine Trust International Symposium, showcasing the breadth and strength of our migraine portfolio and demonstrating AbbVie\u2019s commitment to providing multiple treatment options for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. In total, 15 abstracts were presented for BOTOX, UBRELVY and atogepant.  Included in the MTIS presentation were the detailed results for atogepant in the Phase 3 advanced study, which demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement over placebo, with all atogepant doses for the primary endpoint of reduction in mean monthly migraine days. Significant improvements were also observed for all secondary endpoints in the 30-milligram and 60-milligram dose groups. Treatment with atogepant resulted in 56% to 61% of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in monthly migraine days, compared to 29% for the placebo group. We are very encouraged by the strong benefit/risk profile that has been demonstrated for atogepant in migraine prevention and believe that once approved, this new oral treatment option will be competitively positioned in the prevention market. Together with BOTOX for chronic migraine prevention and UBRELVY for acute migraine treatment, the addition of atogepant creates a market leading portfolio in migraine that represents significant long-term value for AbbVie. In aesthetics, we continue to make good progress with our portfolio of facial toxins and dermal fillers. We have several ongoing programs for new indications for BOTOX and for the JUV\u00c9DERM collection, as well as a pipeline of innovative toxins and dermal fillers, which we expect to reach the market over the course of the next five years. BOTOX has been the leading neurotoxin for over two decades, with R&D efforts in aesthetics primarily focused on the upper face. To support expansion to the lower face region, we have several programs ongoing, including studies in masseter and platysma prominence. We recently had a positive data readout for our Phase 2 study for the reduction of masseter prominence in the lower face. This study met all primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating that the severity of prominence was reduced following a single treatment of BOTOX. Based on these results, we plan to begin Phase 3 development next year, which will support registration in the U.S. and Europe.  We also recently announced the acquisition of Luminera\u2019s dermal filler portfolio led by HArmonyCa, which is an innovative dermal filler developed for facial soft tissue augmentation. Luminera\u2019s assets are highly complementary to our JUV\u00c9DERM filler franchise and we look forward to expanding their development to markets around the world. And in eye care, we recently announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies, which evaluated our topical eye drop, AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. In both studies, 584 met the primary endpoint and the majority of secondary endpoints, with data from both studies demonstrating that treatment with 584 resulted in significant near-vision gains in low lighting conditions without a loss of distance vision. Based on these results, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of next year. So, in summary, we have continued to make significant progress advancing and accelerating our programs this quarter, and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the coming months and through 2021.  With that, I will turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you, Mike. Starting with third quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottomline performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.83, above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total adjusted net revenues were approximately $12.9 billion, up 4.1% on a comparable operational basis and ahead of our expectations. Immunology global sales were approximately $5.8 billion, up 15% on an operational basis, despite the impact of COVID on new patient starts across the immunology market. U.S. HUMIRA sales were approximately $4.2 billion, up 7.7% compared to prior year, reflecting continued demand growth plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels remain below half a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were $951 million, down 8% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets. SKYRIZI sales were $435 million with leading in-play share in the U.S. psoriasis market and robust sequential growth internationally. RINVOQ sales were $215 million with continued strong in-play share in the U.S. RA market. Hematologic oncology delivered another strong quarter, with sales of $1.7 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. IMBRUVICA net revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 9% driven by our leading share in CLL. VENCLEXTA revenues were $352 million, with strong demand across all approved indications. MAVYRET sales were $414 million, down 41.1% on an operational basis, as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID levels. Aesthetic sales were $967 million with BOTOX cosmetic and JUV\u00c9DERM both experiencing a faster than expected recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience revenues were more than $1.2 billion led by VRAYLAR and our migraine portfolio. VRAYLAR once again delivered strong growth with revenues of $358 million. BOTOX Therapeutic continues to experience a rapid recovery from the COVID pandemic, with sales of $523 million in the quarter. The launch of UBRELVY is also going very well with recent direct-to-consumer promotion driving new prescription growth. Sales of UBRELVY were $38 million. We also saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had sales of $840 million. Turning now to the P&L profile for the third quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 11.7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 21.1% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 48.8% of sales, an improvement of 40 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $620 million and the adjusted tax rate was 11.7%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.47 and $10.49, including accretion from the Allergan transaction of 12% on an annualized basis. Excluded from this guidance is $6.58 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates 2020 adjusted net revenue of approximately $45.7 billion, representing an increase of $200 million from our previous estimate. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on fully reported sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated 2020 assumptions. We now expect international HUMIRA sales approaching $3.7 billion. For SKYRIZI, we now expect revenues of approximately $1.5 billion. For RINVOQ, we now expect sales of approximately $700 million. For IMBRIVICA, we now expect revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, as new patient starts in the CLL market remain below pre-COVID levels. For Aesthetics, we now expect post-close sales of approximately $2.5 billion with BOTOX cosmetic and JUV\u00c9DERM both demonstrating a fast recovery. For MAVYRET, we now expect sales of approximately $1.9 billion, as treatments remain below pre-COVID levels. We now expect LUPRON revenues of approximately $750 million, as we work to resolve a near-term supply issue, which has impacted availability of certain formulations. Moving to the P&L, we continue to forecast full year adjusted gross margin just above 82% of sales and adjusted operating margin of approximately 48% of sales. This guidance includes approximately $600 million in expense synergies for the partial year in 2020. We remain on track to deliver greater than $2 billion in expense synergies by 2022. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate adjusted net revenue approaching $13.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest favorable impact on reported sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. We model a non-GAAP tax rate of 11.6% and we expect the average share count to be similar to Q3. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.83 and $2.85, excluding approximately $1.73 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie\u2019s strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $12.7 billion of operating cash flow in the first nine months of the year, and our cash and investments balance at the end of September was $8 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie\u2019s long-term outlook, today we announced a 10.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2021. We also remain on track to pay down $15 billion to $18 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021 and expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of next year, with further deleveraging through 2023. With that, I will turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions and congrats on the results. I guess just two for me. First, 2021, I know you are not giving guidance yet, but can you just talk through some of the pushes and pulls we should keep in mind as we think about next year\u2019s numbers and it seems like the core business obviously has a lot of traction here. I am just trying to get a sense of from your perspective what are the uncertainties as you think about that guidance number for next year? And my second question was on RINVOQ in atopic derm. Can you just elaborate a bit more on how you are thinking about the size of that opportunity? I know one of your peers has a single indication JAK in AD they think is a $3 billion peak sales opportunity. I know that\u2019s well above your risk adjusted numbers you had a few years ago. It sounds like now you are talking about potential multi-billion dollar opportunity. But just help us flesh out a little bit about how big of an opportunity could this be for the product? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. So, Chris, this is Rick. I will talk a little bit about 2021 and then Mike maybe can talk a little bit about how we view RINVOQ in AD and Rob. So when we look at 2021, I think, you have to step back and say, how are we performing this year? And obviously we are performing very well. There\u2019s still some COVID impact built in. It varies a bit by therapeutic areas, some areas are impacted more than others. So as an example, CLL has been impacted more than other areas, HCV has been impacted more than other areas. It\u2019s usually places where the therapy can be delayed without significant consequence for the patient is where we are seeing most significant delays. So as we move through the fourth quarter, we will see whether or not that recovers more and that\u2019s certainly one aspect of it. I would say, even without much recovery, the underlying performance of the business looks good. I think you can look at the dividend increase that we put through and that should give you some flavor for the level of confidence that we have, because obviously, we would want to tie that to what we assumed that we could deliver from an overall performance standpoint. I\u2019d also say that, as we look to consensus, we are comfortable with what we see in consensus in 2021. So we want to see a few other things just play out primarily around COVID, how much improvement we get. We have launched a number of programs over the course of the last couple of months to try to activate patients more, to go to their physicians and seek treatment out. I think those programs, some of those programs will be successful and we will see some of those increase, particularly in immunology, because dermatology is another one of those areas that the new patient starts are still off a little bit. Now, obviously, SKYRIZI is performing extremely well and HUMIRA continues to perform well. So, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the single biggest issue. Rob, Mike, do you want to talk about RINVOQ?\nMichael Severino: Certainly. I will start and then pass it over to Rob, if he wants to add a little bit more detail. We view atopic dermatitis as a very attractive and a very substantial opportunity overall. It\u2019s an indication that I think for many years was underappreciated by the industry. Now that\u2019s changed recently and you have seen a lot of focus in drug development in atopic dermatitis. We feel very good about the profile that we have demonstrated, coming out of Phase 2, when we made those statements about the risk-adjusted potential in atopic dermatitis, we felt good about our data and those data were sufficient to get a breakthrough therapy designation. We are in the fortunate and not always that common situation where our Phase 3 results have actually outperformed our expectations based on Phase 2. And if you look at the Phase 3 results, they are really strong across the board. They are strong in total response. They are strong in repeated response and they are strong on components like itch, which is the most troublesome symptom to patients in the majority of cases. And so, when you couple that with the safety profile that we have demonstrated, which we think is very favorable. We see this as something that has very real potential and when we look across studies, we feel very good about our results. And of course, we have a head-to-head study with dupilumab, which is coming up later on this quarter and so that will be important additional information, and we are very optimistic about those results. Rob, I don\u2019t know if you would like to add anything further?\nRob Michael: Chris, this is Rob. So if you think about atopic dermatitis, it\u2019s a $3 billion global market with very strong growth potential. In our 2025 risk adjusted guidance of greater than $10 billion for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, we included $1 billion of revenue for RINVOQ AD, but we feel pretty good that we can achieve that expectation.\nRick Gonzalez: And the only other thing I\u2019d add is, I think atopic derm is a market very similar to several others, in fact, psoriasis, I would say, is a similar type of market. But as you get more competitors in the market driving promotion, it has a very large population of patients. So the question is, activating those patients and getting them to go into the physician\u2019s offices to seek treatment. And so, obviously, when you have one company doing that, they have the capacity to drive a certain amount. When you have more than one company, you are doubling or tripling the amount of promotion activity, particularly here in the U.S. and that tends to activate more patients to seek treatment. I think if you looked at the total available market of patients who would qualify, it\u2019s a huge market, it\u2019s north of $5 billion easily. So the question is, how fast can you activate them and how broadly can you activate those patients? From a profile standpoint of our drug, I think we will compete quite effectively, and I think, in particular, the performance around itch is going to give us an advantage. So it\u2019s a very attractive market and it\u2019s certainly one that we will focus a lot of attention on to drive.\nRob Michael: And Chris, this is Rob again. Just to clarify, I said exceed or achieve, but we expect to exceed that $1 billion risk-adjusted number for RINVOQ AD in 2025.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thanks. Rick a question to you. With the dividend going up, it looks like you have got about a 6.5% dividend yield. The core business is performing well. And my question is, what are the -- and you are now a $50 billion to $55 billion topline company. What are the pipeline assets that can really move the needle, I know all the new indications for the existing NMEs, but what new NMEs can be really substantial to move the needle on a $55 billion topline, because I think, that\u2019s part of why you have got an industry high dividend yield?\nRick Gonzalez: So, Geoff, this is Rick. I think if you look at the business, you have to look at it in phases, right? So I\u2019d say the phase between now and call it 2025, 2026. That growth is going to be driven by expansion of RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, continued strong growth in the neuroscience pipeline, continued strong growth in the aesthetics pipeline and continued strong growth in the hem/onc. Starting in that 2025 timeframe and beyond, that\u2019s where the earlier to mid-stage pipeline will drive a significant amount of growth. Now there will be assets like Navitoclax, like 951, atogepant, that will come in prior to that and help boost growth right around \u201823 and \u201824. But I can tell you, we are very confident that we have now built a portfolio that can sustain growth and drive growth on the other side of the LOE. In fact, I would tell you that, when I look at RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, and I look at the in-play market shares that we see with those assets today, when we gave guidance of 2025, we assumed that on average, we would achieve high single-digit market share across the indications. So as an example, if you look at SKYRIZI right now, SKYRIZI\u2019s in-play share is 33%, the market leader by a wide margin. The next closest product is at 16% in-play share. And its TRX share is now at 11% and climbing rapidly. So it\u2019s already above what we had assumed the peak would have been out in 2025 from a market share standpoint. And if we maintain that 33% by then, it will have an overall share of about 33%, so it will be three times what we had assumed for psoriasis. So when you look at the speed at which we are bringing the new indications, when you look at the breadth of those indications across the revenue base that HUMIRA has today, we have covered all of the major indications for HUMIRA plus one more that HUMIRA doesn\u2019t have, which is atopic derm. And if we can achieve that kind of market share in each of these indications, then we will obviously double what we assumed that 2025 number was and that gets you pretty close to covering all of HUMIRA in the U.S. So I am very encouraged about that. And I think that, along with the other assets and the four major growth platforms, gives us a tremendous amount of confidence that we can drive growth on a sustainable basis at a very high level.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho.\nVamil Divan: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So maybe just sort of following up on what has been asked. For 2021 on Chris\u2019 question, can you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about drug pricing pressure, either U.S. or globally just to think about our modeling for next year, I think, that would be helpful? And then maybe building on Geoff\u2019s question, I think one of the other concerns that investors have is around potential tax reform that may come out of D.C. depending on how the election plays out. I know it\u2019s tough to ask just a few days before the election. But I guess based on what you are seeing especially from the Biden side, I guess the Biden plan right now. Is there anything you can share with investors at this point in terms of how your tax rate may change going forward and I appreciate there\u2019s probably not much that you can give, but any insights I think would be helpful, because I think it is investors seem very concerned about at this point? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Yeah. Well, Vamil, obviously, it\u2019s still unclear as to what the landscape will be on the other side of the election, so we obviously have to let that play out. Having said that, I think, we assume that there will be continued pressure on the industry as it relates to drug pricing. As far as what our expectations would be in 2021, I think our expectations in 2021 from a price standpoint will be similar to what they were in \u201819 and \u201820, and is we weren\u2019t reliant on price. I mean, fortunately our business is primarily a volume-driven business. It\u2019s typically in areas that are very serious diseases and have strong value propositions. And so that gives me confidence that we will be able to fare reasonably well even if there are changes. I\u2019d say the second thing is, it\u2019s unlikely that you will get changes that have a significant impact early on in \u201821, because there\u2019s going to be a lot of debate here about what those changes are. What I would hope the debate ultimately transitions to is co-pays and out-of-pocket costs for patients, because that is the fundamental issue and it\u2019s particularly the issue when you look at Part D patients. They have to pay far too much of the burden of the cost from an out-of-pocket cost standpoint. And they are really the only group of patients in the U.S. that have that kind of burden associated with them. If you look at the overall performance from a cost standpoint of Medicare Part D. It\u2019s performed very well. In fact, if you go back to the original CBO estimates over the last 10 years, it\u2019s come in 45% below the original estimates for what it would grow. And if you look at Part D, it\u2019s grown at about the rate of other healthcare services inflation, not significantly higher. And so the affordability problem is really around those co-pays. We have to drive those co-pays.  And then I think the other thing that has to be played in here is, I would hope as this debate goes on, they are going to look very carefully at our industry and the value of our industry both from a societal standpoint, as well as an economic standpoint and this is tremendously value industry. Just look at what we have done as an industry as it relates to this pandemic, whether you are talking about vaccines or you are talking about therapeutics, look at what we have done in advancements with cancer. And then from an economic standpoint, this industry supports directly or indirectly 4 million jobs in the United States, typically high paying jobs. It produces a tremendous amount of economic output for the U.S. And so it\u2019s an industry that you don\u2019t want to damage in the process and I think that has to be part of the debate. But the short answer to your question is, I think, you should -- we should -- we are not assuming we will get a lot of benefit from price in \u201821. We are also not assuming that across that year we would see a significant change that would have a dramatic impact on that calendar year. Tax reform was your next question.\nRob Michael: Vamil, It\u2019s Rob. So based on a very high level of information on the Biden proposal, we would see an increase in our tax rate like most U,S, companies, but it\u2019s really difficult to provide a rate impact without the details. That said, AbbVie would still have a favorable profile versus our peers and we wouldn\u2019t have raised our dividend if we were overly concerned about the implications.\nRick Gonzalez: And the only thing I\u2019d add, Vamil, on that one is, we obviously did flex what we thought the tax rate could be and we just don\u2019t know that much about it, we know what has been said. But we flexed it against this dividend increase and made sure we were absolutely comfortable with payout ratios based on that and we are or we wouldn\u2019t have moved forward with the 10.2% increase.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you so much, and congratulations on another impressive quarter. I have several questions, but three of them are short. Can you be more specific on where SKYRIZI patients are coming from? I think it\u2019s notable that COSENTYX was a bit light this quarter and Novartis cited competition? Secondly, what was the non-GAAP interest expense number in the quarter? Third, you provided guidance for HUMIRA OUS, but I don\u2019t think U.S. So can you tell us what you think the U.S. guidance would look like? And then, lastly, we have tracked clinical trial activity during the pandemic and it shows AbbVie recruiting trials were up 14% year-to-date. That is industry-leading two times greater than the next closest competitor and much better than the average, which is down, and I am just curious, what accounts for this? Is it a deliberate strategy to capture patients when other companies are taking a wait-and-see approach or is it something else? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Yeah. So, Steve, I will handle your first question. Rob will handle two and three, and Mike can handle number four. So if you look at the in-play share, about 25% of that in-play share is coming -- on SKYRIZI is coming from HUMIRA. The other 75% is coming from competitors. I\u2019d say it\u2019s primarily the 17s but some coming from the other 12, 23s or 23s, but I\u2019d say the bulk of it is coming from the 17s. So that might answer your question about COSENTYX. If you look at the capture of the type of patient that we are getting with SKYRIZI, it\u2019s very balanced. It\u2019s about 50/50 between first-line and then second-line. So that\u2019s a nice balance between IE patients and patients who have failed other therapies. So I think the asset is performing the way you would expect a high-performing, high-efficacy asset to be able to perform, is -- it has quickly become the preferred product by prescribing physicians. It has a great profile. It\u2019s quarterly dosing. It\u2019s got great efficacy. The efficacy improves over time. There aren\u2019t any assets that have that kind of a profile on the market. So I would expect that SKYRIZI will continue to increase its in-play share. It\u2019s jumped about 3 points over the last maybe two months and I would expect it will continue to increase.\nRob Michael: Hey. Steve, this is Rob. On your question on interest expense, for non-GAAP and GAAP, it\u2019s the same number. It\u2019s $620 million in the third quarter. We are no longer specifying any interest expense, because we have now closed the transaction, so that negative carry on the bond is no longer is applicable for the specified. So $620 million is the number for both non-GAAP and GAAP. On the U.S. HUMIRA question, so we did not change our guidance, it continues to be 8 -- for the U.S. HUMIRA 8% growth with a low single-digit price contribution.\nMichael Severino: This is Mike. I will take your last question on clinical trial activity. The first thing that, I would say is, the increase in clinical trial activity reflects what\u2019s going on in our pipeline and there\u2019s a lot of activity in our pipeline, and a large number of molecules that we are advancing, and so that\u2019s a big part of it. Another part is that, we made the conscious decision to leave decisions around enrollment in the hands of investigators rather than making them centrally, because they understand the situation in their hospital in their community better than we do. And there was a small group of studies that we paused at the time of the initial COVID impact, but the majority we allowed to continue. That doesn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t disruptions from COVID. But it does mean that investigators decided when it was time to pause enrollment and when it was time to resume enrollment.  And I think the evidence shows that they made those decisions better than they could have been made centrally. And that has allowed us to advance our portfolio, to advance our clinical trials with minimal disruption and with safe conduct for patients and the staff at the site, which are also critically important considerations. And so, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a combination of those factors.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.\nRick Gonzalez: Hi. How are you?\nJon Lim: This is Jon Lim on for Navin Jacob.\nRick Gonzalez: Hi, Jon. Yeah. Sorry\u2026\nJon Lim: We just had a few questions.\nRick Gonzalez: You guys pass along [ph].\nJon Lim: We just had a few questions. First, regarding the HUMIRA question in the U.S., within the markets in which a biosimilar is out there, what percent of the molecule is now brand versus biosimilars? With now almost two years of biosimilar experience, how does that affect things? And next for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, can achieve the type of uptake that you have been seeing in the U.S. and in the international markets? We would appreciate any commentary around in-play market share achieved in markets you have been approved in. And lastly, if we could talk about VRAYLAR MDD timing? Thank you.\nRob Michael: Okay. This is Rob. Just to clarify, the first question was on international HUMIRA, how much of that is now a biosimilar?\nJon Lim: Right. Within the markets where there\u2019s a biosimilar, how much is\u2026\nRob Michael: Yeah.\nJon Lim: \u2026 brand versus biosimilar, help us visualize that question\u2026\nRick Gonzalez: I think he wants what\u2019s the molecule\u2026\nRob Michael: [Inaudible]\nRick Gonzalez: Yeah.\nRob Michael: Yeah. We are at about 60% molecule share across the Board. So that\u2019s of all of the international markets, on average, it\u2019s about 60% molecule share.\nRick Gonzalez: And then on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, I don\u2019t have the numbers right in front of me on each of the markets. I would say typically in the international market, it is a slightly slower uptake than it is in the U.S., but still doing very well. So maybe the best thing would be to get back to you with some more specifics around that. But I think you can assume that the in-play share there probably averages between 20% and 30%. But it depends obviously on the country that you are talking about. And then on VRAYLAR MDD timing, Mike?\nMichael Severino: Yes. On VRAYLAR MDD, we would expect to have the study\u2019s readout in the second half of next year and be prepared for regulatory submissions shortly thereafter. So it\u2019s possible we would have an approval in \u201822.\nRick Gonzalez: And I think that\u2019s an important point to make here. If we look at VRAYLAR, VRAYLAR is growing very rapidly. And as you know, the atypical anti-psychotic market is very, very large. I think VRAYLAR\u2019s share is something like 3% and it\u2019s tracking at $1.4 billion at 3%. So if we look at the current indications, as we indicated in the comments, of bipolar and schizophrenia, we think we can drive VRAYLAR alone in those indications to a multi-billion dollar product and that\u2019s just driving that market share penetration up to like 5% or so. And I think that\u2019s very doable based on the profile of VRAYLAR. VRAYLAR has a very unique profile in that market. So MDD, if we are successful, obviously, will open up a whole other channel and allow you to increase that market share even more significantly. And so typically, many of the drugs that achieved MDD were drugs that had $5 billion, $6 billion of annual revenues. So this is a nice opportunity. Without MDD, VRAYLAR is still going to be a very important product and a very significant product. With MDD, it becomes a major product. And so we will see how those next two studies play out. The first study was positive and I think we are hopeful that we will be able to get it.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Sriker [ph]. I think that was you. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.\nRandall Stanicky: Great. Thanks. Rick, early in the pandemic, you were one of the few to identify or build an impact for potential headwinds from higher unemployment associated with loss of health coverage. What are you currently seeing right now and anything on the patient assistance program numbers that help you inform on that? And then secondly, I just wanted to ask on BOTOX migraine. This has been historically a roughly $600 million high margin product for Allergan. We have been watching CGRP inhibitors now been in the market a couple of years. Do you see this as a growth product or opportunity for you and what are you seeing overall with respect to BOTOX in migraine? Thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: So on the unemployment, we did identify back, I guess, it was in the first quarter call, that we were going to build in a level of risk associated with patients who would have to move to some type of an assistance program, because they lost their jobs. We have not seen that impact play out to any significant level. We have not seen it in our patient assistance program and right around the pandemic we made a decision to proactively go out and advertise our patient assistance program just to make sure that patients knew that if they couldn\u2019t afford their AbbVie drugs that they could get them from us. So I think we proactively tried to drive it in an effort to make sure that patients were not exposed, but we haven\u2019t seen very much at all. We still have some coverage left in the fourth quarter for it. But I\u2019d say at this point, I think, we are questioning whether or not we are going to see it. Now, I can\u2019t tell you exactly why. But I can tell you we are monitoring it carefully and it\u2019s definitely not happening, at least in our business, because we would see it in the patient assistance program. On BOTOX migraine, if you actually look at what is happening with patients on BOTOX migraine, when the injectable CGRPs came into the market, you did see a tick down in patients, but then BOTOX recovered. And it has roughly the same number of patients that it had back then. It\u2019s slightly lower than it had back then. So what the CGRPs ended up doing was expanding the market to some extent. And we are seeing a very similar phenomenon on the acute therapies as well. If you look at the scripts, the NBRxs for the acute CGRPs, you can see that it\u2019s actually almost doubling every quarter the number of patients. In the last quarter, it was about 90,000 to 100,000 NBRxs. So I think these assets can significantly expand the market. I think two-thirds of our patients are patients that have switched on the acute, have switched from triptans to our agent and one-third of them are naive patients that we are bringing into the category. And again, that\u2019s all about making it visible to patients who have this condition so that they go to their physician and ask for the therapy. It\u2019s all about building markets essentially. And so I think one of the things these assets will do is they will expand the market. Now, I think as you expand the market, obviously BOTOX therapeutics, some of those patients will ultimately if they don\u2019t get the kind of relief that they are looking for on an injectable CGRP or the acute therapy, they would eventually probably try injectable BOTOX. So we could see a little bit of growth there, but the biggest part of the growth that we are going to see in this market is from UBRELVY and ultimately atogepant. It\u2019s a big market and I think these agents will allow us to be able to significantly expand the market and I think this is clearly a multi-billion dollar market.\nLiz Shea: Thank, Randall. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Risinger: Thanks very much. Excuse me, so I want to start with a high-level question, Rick. Could you please discuss long-term immunology net pricing and formulary positioning prospects in the face of increasing competition in coming years? And then second, just had a high level question about cash flow, I was hoping that you could discuss prospects for operating cash flow, CapEx and free cash flow? Thank you very much.\nRick Gonzalez: Yeah. Thanks, David. I will take the first one. Rob will answer the second one for you. So if I look at long-term immunology, what\u2019s critically important is that you have the kinds of assets that allow that managed care organization or PBM to be able to cover the greatest number of patients. This is a category where not every drug works on every patient. So you have to have multiple options that are available in the formulary and that\u2019s just -- that is the appropriate thing to do to make sure that patients have the drugs that they need to be able to be treated. I would say, we typically do very well with formulary access. That\u2019s driven primarily by the fact that our assets tend to be very attractive assets from a clinical profile. They establish significant market share positions and that\u2019s important for the managed care organization or the PBM. So I don\u2019t see anything significantly impacting that going forward. I would assume we will maintain very high levels of formulary access. Net pricing, there\u2019s always some level of impact on pricing when you renegotiate the contracts. I don\u2019t anticipate that you will see a significant change going forward. So I think it\u2019s more of the normal kinds of competitive activities that we see in the marketplace.\nRob Michael: And David, this is Rob. I will answer your question on cash flow, so if you look at AbbVie and Allergan in 2019 on a combined basis, generated about $19 billion almost $20 billion of operating cash flow. CapEx runs close to $1 billion, and so if you look at this year, again, we have a partial year of Allergan, we are probably trending towards the $16 billion operating cash flow number with a little bit less than $1 billion of CapEx. So you need to annualize that and also consider the fact that we are going to generate earnings growth going forward, but that should give you a good number to work with.\nDavid Risinger: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering first, maybe on the IBD front, I know you have a number of readouts coming up for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI here. Maybe you could just outline what current usage of targeted drugs in IBD is on a percentage basis and how that compares to rheumatology and dermatology? And what you see is a potential here to boost that uptake in IBD further? And then to your TNF steroid conjugate program, what were the criteria that were key that led to your choice of 154 as a go-forward asset? And then lastly, on the Allergan integration, I know you said everything is on track there. It\u2019s going really well. You talked about some revenue synergy opportunity, Rick, and I know you have laid out your expense synergy target of $2 billion in 2022. Maybe you could just talk about some of the puts and takes for 2021 as we think about the Allergan synergies on both sides? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Great. On IBD usage, if you look at the penetration, I\u2019d say, IBD is an area where you have reasonable levels of biologic penetration, because the disease particularly Crohn\u2019s is the disease is a pretty severe. I think the challenge in IBD is that, with the current therapies that are available, you still get sub-optimal clinical efficacy for these patients and durability of that efficacy. And so what physicians tend to do is they rotate patients through various treatments to try to maintain them in control for a longer period of time. So it is a market that is right for higher efficacy agents and a market that is right for more agents to be available to allow for better treatment of those patients and that\u2019s the key driver in that segment of what gives significant uptake. So when we see the data around IBD that will be important for us, obviously the early data looks good. And ultimately I think these assets, along with HUMIRA, will be able to provide the market with a significant new alternative and I think that uptake will be good based on that.\nMichael Severino: This is Mike. I will take the question about 154. So, 3373 and 154 represent our TNF steroid conjugate molecules that are in the clinic. They are very similar, similar to the extent that we view the biology as being translatable between the two. But 154 includes some improvements in linker technology that relate to manufacturability and ability to formulate at high concentration, ease of formulation. And so those can be very important advantages for a successful molecule. We previously toplined the positive results from 3373. We wanted to see that 154 gave us the PK performance and the exposure to achieve the pharmacodynamic coverage we think we need in the next stage of development. And as I said, we viewed the biology as translatable between the two. So once we saw that PK performance and it matched our expectations and showed that 154 would give us the coverage that we were seeking at acceptable doses in the clinic, we made the decision to advance that molecule into larger scale trials.\nRob Michael: Hey. Terence, this is Rob. I will take your question on synergies. So while we are not providing guidance for 2021 today. I think a good way to think about the expense synergies is to run rate the $600 million in partial year synergies, which gets to about $1 billion. And then, as you think about that ramp to greater than $2 billion by 2022, I think it\u2019s reasonable to straight line that. So if you think about what\u2019s going to drive the ramp? It\u2019s things like systems integration, leveraging procurement spend, will result in more synergies over time, as well as network optimization. In the near-term, it\u2019s really driven more from immediate redundancies like corporate infrastructure and R&D portfolio optimization. As it relates to the revenue synergies, look, as we have now had a few months with the combined company, we see opportunities as we think about investment in aesthetics, where we have really amped up our DTC investment for JUV\u00c9DERM and BOTOX cosmetic, it give o the ability to invest more in aesthetics. Similarly, invest more in neuroscience, whether that\u2019s VRAYLAR, BOTOX therapeutic. And then we look internationally given the infrastructure we have, the integrated brand team approach, we think there\u2019s opportunity to really leverage our market access capability, our international affiliate structure to really drive that international growth for the company going forward for those Allergan brands as well.\nRick Gonzalez: Terence, the only thing I would add, maybe to give you some perspective on the investment side. Allergan tended to what I would describe as pulse invest in particularly DTC, but even in social media. So they didn\u2019t -- and typically what we do with brands when we want to drive maximum speed of market penetration is we invest at a steady state and continue to do that for an extended period of time. So they might have invested heavily in one quarter and then gone dark in the next quarter and then invested again and gone dark again. We don\u2019t use that kind of a strategy. We tend to invest for the full year. And in our experience, what that does is it gives you, the fact that you have constant coverage, gives you maximum speed of penetration. So we clearly think that\u2019s going to be an advantage, particularly in areas like aesthetics and neuroscience.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Truist.\nGregg Gilbert: Thank you for getting me in. Good morning. Rick, it sounds like you think the neuroscience franchise might be one of the sleepers of the Allergan deal and you have already framed the potential for VRAYLAR particularly if depression hits. But I was curious if this development in neuroscience has taken on sort of a new sense of urgency given the heft that you have now in that franchise or whether you think you have enough going on there already? And for Mike, I was hoping you could let us know when we will see Phase 3 data for 951 in Parkinson\u2019s and give us a sneak preview of what you are looking for there profile wise? And lastly, can you frame for BOTOX therapeutics, Mike, what you have decided to pursue in terms of indications versus ones that you have taken off the table now that you have had some time to work with that? Thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: I\u2019d say on neuroscience, the way to think about it is or at least the way we are thinking about it is, there\u2019s a significant opportunity to drive VRAYLAR to be a very large product, I mean, doubling or more depending upon the ability to get MDD. And I\u2019d also say in migraine, when we get the full portfolio of migraine assets. The migraine market is a big market. If you look at the acute market today, it\u2019s probably about $1.5 billion. We believe it can grow to $4 billion or $5 billion by 2025 with the right kinds of assets and the right kind of promotion. And then if you look at the preventative market, it\u2019s about $3 billion, so we believe that one in real high-single to low-double digits with the right kinds of assets and the right kinds of promotion. So the first phase of neuroscience is nothing more than taking the assets we have now, getting atogepant to the marketplace and then we have a full portfolio of migraine products, and then maximizing the market share position of those assets in the market, that\u2019s sort of Phase 1. But I would say now that we have infrastructure in place, Mike\u2019s BD team has been now been starting to look at assets that would be complementary to that. And we didn\u2019t in the past because for a single anti-psychotic, we wouldn\u2019t have wanted to build-out the infrastructure, it just wouldn\u2019t have made sense for us. But now we can basically add those kinds of assets to the infrastructure we have. So it does give us another opportunity from a BD standpoint to be able to build the business longer term.\nMichael Severino: I will take the second question and agree with everything Rick said, the only thing I\u2019d add on BD in neuroscience is neuropsychiatry is now clearly an area of strength for us and can be an area of interest and that can go beyond the anti-psychotics as well. There\u2019s tremendous potential and unmet need in areas like generalized anxiety disorder, still in depression despite there are many agents on the market, many, many patients remain inadequately treated, so we would look broadly across that space. With respect to 951 and data timing, we would expect to see results from our Phase 3 study in the second half of next year. And what we are looking for is really DUOPA like efficacy, because DUOPA is a transformational product but it\u2019s also a product that is challenging to administer, and the nature of that product, the fact that it requires the placement of a gastric tube that\u2019s then threaded into the small bowel and has to be maintained limits the size of what\u2019s effectively an addressable market. Not the market by the labeled indication, but the proportion of patients within that population that would consider a therapy like that. And 951 has the potential to substantially expand that. It has an insulin pump-like device, subcutaneous delivery device. We think it will broaden the number of patients within that labeled population, who would consider such a therapy and this is really a very substantial market. So for example, if you look at DUOPA, despite all of its challenges, it does about $0.5 billion in sales. If you look across similar therapies for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, the market is probably $1.5 billion or more and that probably represents only a small part of the potential because much of it remains untapped. So we think that 951 can address that and we think the profile that it will take to address that is DUOPA like efficacy with a more patient-friendly subcutaneous delivery device. With respect to BOTOX indications, there are a number of indications, both for BOTOX and for other toxins, for novel toxins that we are considering in the therapeutic space. I think there\u2019s more work that we can do in the migraine space. Although, that has been an area of strength, episodic migraine has patients that may benefit from a therapy like BOTOX and there\u2019s still much more to do on the neurology side with respect to specificity disorders that might be secondary to stroke or other conditions where there is still room to expand those indications. When we look more broadly, there are a number of potential interesting indications for neurotoxins. They might not be BOTOX. They may be novel toxins. Those could be things like prevention of afib, for example, and we are continuing to explore indications beyond that.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Gregg. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. A high level question for Rick, despite Allergan being a very reasonable solution to upcoming U.S. HUMIRA LOE in 2023, the multiple on AbbVie is lower than it\u2019s ever been. The entire drug group is out of favor, but your multiple is about half of the peer group average. To me what that multiple says is that investors remain worried about what AbbVie looks like past 2023. So two questions related to this, the first is why not give updated granular extended guidance that goes beyond 2023? You have given long-term guidance in the past sometimes and that\u2019s resonated well with the market. So can we expect you might do this at some point soon? And second question, why not go do more M&A in the near-term, we just saw Bristol do a $13 billion deal not far after closing Celgene and layering more product into your pipeline would help give investors assurances that there\u2019s life beyond 2023. And by virtue of how you answered an earlier question, you yourself basically said there\u2019s not much new NME flow until 2025 and beyond? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Yeah. I think if you look -- Tim, this is Rick. If you look at the PE of the whole sector, obviously, the sector is under pressure from the political environment and concerns about the political environment. And you are correct, we are at the lower end of that PE and I think that is driven by uncertainty about what the growth rate will be on the other side of the LOE. What I would tell you is obviously, we have a 10-year LLP, so we know what we think that growth rate is on the other side of the LOE. And I can tell you that when I look at that growth rate, it\u2019s robust.  Now, the market has to come around to that point of view. I\u2019d say, we haven\u2019t always been right, but in total revenue, we have always been right. In fact, we have always beat for the most part what our expectations were. And so we obviously challenge it pretty hard and we have knowledge of what we believe the erosion curve will look like. We have knowledge of what we think our pipeline will deliver and what the additional indications will deliver. And look, I remember there was a tremendous amount of skepticism about when we gave it was either $10 billion or $11 billion of risk adjusted revenues for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI back a year or two ago, something like that. There was a tremendous amount of skepticism, that\u2019s impossible. I don\u2019t hear very much of that now that these two assets are $2 billion and growing like rockets. So I\u2019d say our ability to assess what we can do with our assets is pretty high.  Now, that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t go out and get more things and we constantly look and where we find opportunity, we will clearly go pursue those. They have to be opportunities that make sense and fit into our portfolio. You have seen us do transactions to continue to build the long-term future of our hem/onc business with Genmab and I-Mab. And those two assets combined with what VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA can continue to do, I think it is going to give us a very robust long-term performance in that franchise. I think in immunology, we are in pretty good shape between our internal pipeline both the additional indications on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ and then what we have earlier on that we think will play out in a positive way. When we look at neuroscience, we just talked about that we have the ability to be able to grow that. Certainly, we are going to invest heavily in aesthetics. We have a tremendous amount of assets, new toxins that we are working on and we are going to accelerate many of those, new fillers and other kinds of opportunities that will build that aesthetics business to be able to grow rapidly. And so I feel pretty good about where we are. In fact, I\u2019d tell you I feel very good about where we are six months into the Allergan transaction. Certainly Allergan has given us more growth as we mentioned a moment ago. When we look at neuroscience, neuroscience has clearly been I think a nice positive upside for us and one that I think we can execute very well. As far as guidance is concerned, I am not saying, we will never give guidance, but we want to give guidance when we are able to do it with a high degree of certainty. Because the last thing we want to do is provide a level of guidance that you don\u2019t have a high degree of certainty and you know it\u2019s going to, it has some variability to it. You probably remember, we did that on the international biosimilars and we were off by not that much, but we were off by some and the market didn\u2019t like the fact that we were off. So you need to be awfully careful about how you provide that guidance in a way to make sure that you meet or exceed the guidance, and at the point which we have that level of confidence, we may go out with longer term guidance.\nTim Anderson: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next -- we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore.\nJosh Schimmer: Last question. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of quick ones, can you provide any color on the SKYRIZI royalty and can you comment on what you see as the incremental markets for the lower face toxins, the new dermal filler and presbyopia, if you view any of those as material? Thank you.\nRob Michael: Yeah. Josh, so on the SKYRIZI royalty, well, keep in mind that we account for this as a business combination, so it comes through consideration so you don\u2019t see it on a non-GAAP P&L. We don\u2019t disclose our royalty rates but a good way to think about it is reasonable royalty you would pay for a late-stage asset is probably a good way to think about what the royalty burn would be on -- the cash royalty burn will be on SKYRIZI.\nRick Gonzalez: And I\u2019d say the lower face toxins and the lower face fillers that we are working on, probably the best way, rather than trying to characterize individual indications for toxins or fillers is, we are trying to build a portfolio and a market activation strategy that will allow us to grow the aesthetics business at a consistent double-digit rate. And it is both that internal pipeline and activating more patients, and some BD effort that will give us that. So, certainly those lower face toxins and fillers are designed to be able to support that growth going forward. The eye care product, I would call that product sort of a modest product. I don\u2019t remember the specifics. Do you, Rob?\nRob Michael: Yeah.\nRick Gonzalez: I\u2019d call it sort of a modest size product.\nRob Michael: Yeah.\nJosh Schimmer: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Josh. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. If you\u2019d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Rob Michael",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Starting with third quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottomline performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.83, above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total adjusted net revenues were approximately $12.9 billion, up 4.1% on a comparable operational basis and ahead of our expectations. Immunology global sales were approximately $5.8 billion, up 15% on an operational basis, despite the impact of COVID on new patient starts across the immunology market. U.S. HUMIRA sales were approximately $4.2 billion, up 7.7% compared to prior year, reflecting continued demand growth plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels remain below half a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were $951 million, down 8% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets. SKYRIZI sales were $435 million with leading in-play share in the U.S. psoriasis market and robust sequential growth internationally. RINVOQ sales were $215 million with continued strong in-play share in the U.S. RA market. Hematologic oncology delivered another strong quarter, with sales of $1.7 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. IMBRUVICA net revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 9% driven by our leading share in CLL. VENCLEXTA revenues were $352 million, with strong demand across all approved indications. MAVYRET sales were $414 million, down 41.1% on an operational basis, as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID levels. Aesthetic sales were $967 million with BOTOX cosmetic and JUV\u00c9DERM both experiencing a faster than expected recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience revenues were more than $1.2 billion led by VRAYLAR and our migraine portfolio. VRAYLAR once again delivered strong growth with revenues of $358 million. BOTOX Therapeutic continues to experience a rapid recovery from the COVID pandemic, with sales of $523 million in the quarter. The launch of UBRELVY is also going very well with recent direct-to-consumer promotion driving new prescription growth. Sales of UBRELVY were $38 million. We also saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had sales of $840 million. Turning now to the P&L profile for the third quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 11.7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 21.1% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 48.8% of sales, an improvement of 40 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $620 million and the adjusted tax rate was 11.7%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.47 and $10.49, including accretion from the Allergan transaction of 12% on an annualized basis. Excluded from this guidance is $6.58 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates 2020 adjusted net revenue of approximately $45.7 billion, representing an increase of $200 million from our previous estimate. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on fully reported sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated 2020 assumptions. We now expect international HUMIRA sales approaching $3.7 billion. For SKYRIZI, we now expect revenues of approximately $1.5 billion. For RINVOQ, we now expect sales of approximately $700 million. For IMBRIVICA, we now expect revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, as new patient starts in the CLL market remain below pre-COVID levels. For Aesthetics, we now expect post-close sales of approximately $2.5 billion with BOTOX cosmetic and JUV\u00c9DERM both demonstrating a fast recovery. For MAVYRET, we now expect sales of approximately $1.9 billion, as treatments remain below pre-COVID levels. We now expect LUPRON revenues of approximately $750 million, as we work to resolve a near-term supply issue, which has impacted availability of certain formulations. Moving to the P&L, we continue to forecast full year adjusted gross margin just above 82% of sales and adjusted operating margin of approximately 48% of sales. This guidance includes approximately $600 million in expense synergies for the partial year in 2020. We remain on track to deliver greater than $2 billion in expense synergies by 2022. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate adjusted net revenue approaching $13.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest favorable impact on reported sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. We model a non-GAAP tax rate of 11.6% and we expect the average share count to be similar to Q3. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.83 and $2.85, excluding approximately $1.73 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie\u2019s strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $12.7 billion of operating cash flow in the first nine months of the year, and our cash and investments balance at the end of September was $8 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie\u2019s long-term outlook, today we announced a 10.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2021. We also remain on track to pay down $15 billion to $18 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021 and expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of next year, with further deleveraging through 2023. With that, I will turn the call back over to Liz. Chris, this is Rob. So if you think about atopic dermatitis, it\u2019s a $3 billion global market with very strong growth potential. In our 2025 risk adjusted guidance of greater than $10 billion for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, we included $1 billion of revenue for RINVOQ AD, but we feel pretty good that we can achieve that expectation. And Chris, this is Rob again. Just to clarify, I said exceed or achieve, but we expect to exceed that $1 billion risk-adjusted number for RINVOQ AD in 2025. Vamil, It\u2019s Rob. So based on a very high level of information on the Biden proposal, we would see an increase in our tax rate like most U,S, companies, but it\u2019s really difficult to provide a rate impact without the details. That said, AbbVie would still have a favorable profile versus our peers and we wouldn\u2019t have raised our dividend if we were overly concerned about the implications. Hey. Steve, this is Rob. On your question on interest expense, for non-GAAP and GAAP, it\u2019s the same number. It\u2019s $620 million in the third quarter. We are no longer specifying any interest expense, because we have now closed the transaction, so that negative carry on the bond is no longer is applicable for the specified. So $620 million is the number for both non-GAAP and GAAP. On the U.S. HUMIRA question, so we did not change our guidance, it continues to be 8 -- for the U.S. HUMIRA 8% growth with a low single-digit price contribution. Okay. This is Rob. Just to clarify, the first question was on international HUMIRA, how much of that is now a biosimilar? Yeah. [Inaudible] Yeah. We are at about 60% molecule share across the Board. So that\u2019s of all of the international markets, on average, it\u2019s about 60% molecule share. And David, this is Rob. I will answer your question on cash flow, so if you look at AbbVie and Allergan in 2019 on a combined basis, generated about $19 billion almost $20 billion of operating cash flow. CapEx runs close to $1 billion, and so if you look at this year, again, we have a partial year of Allergan, we are probably trending towards the $16 billion operating cash flow number with a little bit less than $1 billion of CapEx. So you need to annualize that and also consider the fact that we are going to generate earnings growth going forward, but that should give you a good number to work with. Hey. Terence, this is Rob. I will take your question on synergies. So while we are not providing guidance for 2021 today. I think a good way to think about the expense synergies is to run rate the $600 million in partial year synergies, which gets to about $1 billion. And then, as you think about that ramp to greater than $2 billion by 2022, I think it\u2019s reasonable to straight line that. So if you think about what\u2019s going to drive the ramp? It\u2019s things like systems integration, leveraging procurement spend, will result in more synergies over time, as well as network optimization. In the near-term, it\u2019s really driven more from immediate redundancies like corporate infrastructure and R&D portfolio optimization. As it relates to the revenue synergies, look, as we have now had a few months with the combined company, we see opportunities as we think about investment in aesthetics, where we have really amped up our DTC investment for JUV\u00c9DERM and BOTOX cosmetic, it give o the ability to invest more in aesthetics. Similarly, invest more in neuroscience, whether that\u2019s VRAYLAR, BOTOX therapeutic. And then we look internationally given the infrastructure we have, the integrated brand team approach, we think there\u2019s opportunity to really leverage our market access capability, our international affiliate structure to really drive that international growth for the company going forward for those Allergan brands as well. Yeah. Josh, so on the SKYRIZI royalty, well, keep in mind that we account for this as a business combination, so it comes through consideration so you don\u2019t see it on a non-GAAP P&L. We don\u2019t disclose our royalty rates but a good way to think about it is reasonable royalty you would pay for a late-stage asset is probably a good way to think about what the royalty burn would be on -- the cash royalty burn will be on SKYRIZI. Yeah. Yeah."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will discuss our third quarter performance and highlights, as well as our full year guidance, which we are raising again this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D programs and Rob will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, we will take your questions. AbbVie delivered another excellent quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.83, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08. When I look at our business and the actions we have taken to position AbbVie for sustainable performance, including the acquisition of Allergan, I feel very good about our long-term outlook. The fundamentals are strong and there is considerable momentum across our legacy and new portfolios, which are both demonstrating robust growth, despite the COVID pandemic and together have the potential for significant long-term value creation. I\u2019d like to specifically highlight our recent progress across several aspects of our business, including the launches of RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which are performing well ahead of all comparable launch analogs in their initial indications and continue to exceed our expectations. Our hem/onc franchise continues to deliver robust performance and is expected to generate more than $6.5 billion in revenue this year, representing strong double-digit growth. New indications and novel combinations, including our recently announced collaboration with Genmab and I-Mab provide opportunities for further revenue expansion. While it is still relatively early in the integration of Allergan, the strategic merits of the combination have never been more evident. We are already demonstrating that we have created a stronger, more diverse company, with robust cash flows and multiple new growth vehicles for the long-term. We now have the leading aesthetics franchise, which is demonstrating a strong V-shaped recovery, as well as a highly attractive neuroscience portfolio which delivered double-digit growth on a comparable operational basis this quarter and has significant momentum with VRAYLAR and our expanding migraine franchise. And our pipeline is advancing nicely, with numerous attractive late-stage programs that we believe will allow us to maintain a growing and vibrant business. We are on track for the approval of more than a dozen new products for major indications over the next two years, which will collectively add meaningful revenue growth. This includes a total of six additional indications for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and several other near-term product -- new product approvals, including atogepant, Navitoclax and 951. Clearly, this is a very exciting time for AbbVie and I am pleased with the progress that we are making towards our long-term strategy for sustainable growth. I remain confident that we will continue to execute as we have in the past and deliver outstanding shareholder value going forward. I\u2019d like to look further at our business performance. I am pleased with the recent trends across our key growth areas. I will start with immunology, where we established strong trajectories for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. As I previously noted, both continue to perform well-above expectations. In their initial indications, these two brands have clearly demonstrated superior efficacy to HUMIRA, as well as other novel agents on the market or in development, resulting in significant in-play market shares, a leading indicator for long-term commercial performance. The in-play share for RINVOQ in RA, which includes both new and switching patients remains strong at approximately 16% and has now reached parity with our market leading HUMIRA. In psoriasis, SKYRIZI has already achieved the leading in-play market share at 33%. This level of share capture at this stage of the launch is unprecedented, and if sustained, will ultimately lead to total market share well in excess of what was contemplated when we communicated our expectations for 2025 sales. This strong performance and trajectory, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to our differentiated product profile and our commercial execution. Our focus since the pandemic has been on driving accelerated patient activation and we remain encouraged by our current prescription trends. Our recent performance continues to give us confidence in the near- and long-term potential for both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which we now expect will deliver $2.2 billion in combined revenue for full year 2020, well exceeding our original projections for this year. In addition to outstanding commercial momentum, we are also making excellent progress with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI in new indications, which we expect will further strengthen our leadership position. We have already started planning and preparing for the forthcoming approval of three additional RINVOQ indications next year, including psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, giving us complete coverage across the more than $40 billion rheumatology segment. We also expect approval in atopic dermatitis, another large and growing market that has the potential to be multi-billion dollar peak revenues for RINVOQ. In the coming year, we also intend to submit regulatory applications for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis and both agents in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, a more than $20 billion market today with high unmet need. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the progress we are making on both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. I\u2019d also like to take this opportunity to announce that we will be hosting an immunology focused Investor Day in December, where we intend to further discuss our strategy, progress, and expectations for this important growth area. Additional details will be forthcoming. Turning now to hem/onc, which delivered robust double-digit growth again this quarter and remains an important therapeutic area for AbbVie\u2019s long-term performance. IMBRUVICA has a strong position across multiple indications including CLL, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. IMBRUVICA sales increased 9% on an operational basis this quarter, despite lower new patient starts within CLL, where the market remains below pre-COVID levels. VENCLEXTA sales increased nearly 60% on an operational basis this quarter. The penetration across our approved indications remains strong, especially in AML, given the potential aggressive disease progression of that cancer. In the quarter, we also announced a strategic collaboration with I-Mab, further expanding our oncology portfolio with anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, which has potential across a wide range of blood cancers. The I-Mab opportunity adds to our already-attractive oncology pipeline, which includes Navitoclax, Genmab CD3xCD20, expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and several promising early-stage programs. We also now have another high performing franchise in neuroscience, which further diversifies AbbVie\u2019s sources of long-term growth. VRAYLAR sales increased strong double-digits again this quarter on a comparable operational basis, with annualized revenues of more than $1.4 billion. Given VRAYLAR\u2019s benefit/risk profile relative to other atypical anti-psychotics, we remain confident in its long-term growth potential, which we believe is multi-billion dollars across the currently approved indications of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. BOTOX Therapeutics, which has nearly a dozen medical treatment indications, including chronic migraine, is also performing very well. Revenues were up nearly $100 million sequentially on a comparable operational basis, demonstrating a rapid COVID recovery. The launch of UBRELVY, our leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, is exceeding our expectations. Commercial access is ramping strongly and increasing DTC investments have resulted in encouraging new patient starts and market expansion. When you consider our overall scale with BOTOX Therapeutics, UBRELVY\u2019s acute treatment profile and the promising development of atogepant for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine, we see substantial room for long-term revenue growth with this best-in-class migraine portfolio. Within aesthetics, our fourth major growth platform, we are seeing robust demand trends and a rapid V-shaped recovery. Total global aesthetics revenues of more than $950 million were up 70% sequentially on a comparable operational basis, illustrating the significant underlying demand for both BOTOX cosmetics and JUV\u00c9DERM. We remain focused on supporting clinics through the COVID pandemic and expect consistent investment in consumer promotion to expand the aesthetics market, which remains under penetrated globally. Our dedicated R&D and business development are expected to sustain new innovation and rapidly expand our aesthetics portfolio for long-term growth, including the recently announced acquisition of Luminera, which provides us with a complementary dermal filler portfolio and pipeline. Overall, we are very pleased with the momentum that we are seeing with our aesthetics franchise. AbbVie\u2019s business continues to remain resilient and demonstrates strong underlying growth throughout the pandemic. Based on the performance this quarter and our progress year-to-date, we are raising our full year 2020 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $10.47 to $10.49, reflecting growth of more than 17% at the midpoint.  In addition to the excellent progress we are making across the portfolio, the integration of Allergan continues to go very well. Despite the size of this transaction and the timing of the COVID pandemic, the transition has been seamless. We are performing very well against both our synergy and accretion targets, and it is becoming increasingly clear to us that there are also opportunities for revenue synergies across various aspects of the business. We are now six months post-close and the strategic merits of the transaction are extremely evident. Allergan is providing additional growth platforms, robust financial benefits and greater diversity of our business. We remain confident that the newly combined business will generate significant earnings and cash flow to support continued investment in our innovative R&D platform, as well as a strong and growing dividend, while also allowing us to rapidly pay down debt.  To that end, as noted in our news release, today we are announcing a 10.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.18 per share to $1.30 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2021. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 225%.  So, in summary, we continue to demonstrate strong execution across our portfolio and remain encouraged by the overall recovery trends. We have assembled an impressive set of diversified growth assets with significant growth potential giving us a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Okay. So, Chris, this is Rick. I will talk a little bit about 2021 and then Mike maybe can talk a little bit about how we view RINVOQ in AD and Rob. So when we look at 2021, I think, you have to step back and say, how are we performing this year? And obviously we are performing very well. There\u2019s still some COVID impact built in. It varies a bit by therapeutic areas, some areas are impacted more than others. So as an example, CLL has been impacted more than other areas, HCV has been impacted more than other areas. It\u2019s usually places where the therapy can be delayed without significant consequence for the patient is where we are seeing most significant delays. So as we move through the fourth quarter, we will see whether or not that recovers more and that\u2019s certainly one aspect of it. I would say, even without much recovery, the underlying performance of the business looks good. I think you can look at the dividend increase that we put through and that should give you some flavor for the level of confidence that we have, because obviously, we would want to tie that to what we assumed that we could deliver from an overall performance standpoint. I\u2019d also say that, as we look to consensus, we are comfortable with what we see in consensus in 2021. So we want to see a few other things just play out primarily around COVID, how much improvement we get. We have launched a number of programs over the course of the last couple of months to try to activate patients more, to go to their physicians and seek treatment out. I think those programs, some of those programs will be successful and we will see some of those increase, particularly in immunology, because dermatology is another one of those areas that the new patient starts are still off a little bit. Now, obviously, SKYRIZI is performing extremely well and HUMIRA continues to perform well. So, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the single biggest issue. Rob, Mike, do you want to talk about RINVOQ? And the only other thing I\u2019d add is, I think atopic derm is a market very similar to several others, in fact, psoriasis, I would say, is a similar type of market. But as you get more competitors in the market driving promotion, it has a very large population of patients. So the question is, activating those patients and getting them to go into the physician\u2019s offices to seek treatment. And so, obviously, when you have one company doing that, they have the capacity to drive a certain amount. When you have more than one company, you are doubling or tripling the amount of promotion activity, particularly here in the U.S. and that tends to activate more patients to seek treatment. I think if you looked at the total available market of patients who would qualify, it\u2019s a huge market, it\u2019s north of $5 billion easily. So the question is, how fast can you activate them and how broadly can you activate those patients? From a profile standpoint of our drug, I think we will compete quite effectively, and I think, in particular, the performance around itch is going to give us an advantage. So it\u2019s a very attractive market and it\u2019s certainly one that we will focus a lot of attention on to drive. So, Geoff, this is Rick. I think if you look at the business, you have to look at it in phases, right? So I\u2019d say the phase between now and call it 2025, 2026. That growth is going to be driven by expansion of RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, continued strong growth in the neuroscience pipeline, continued strong growth in the aesthetics pipeline and continued strong growth in the hem/onc. Starting in that 2025 timeframe and beyond, that\u2019s where the earlier to mid-stage pipeline will drive a significant amount of growth. Now there will be assets like Navitoclax, like 951, atogepant, that will come in prior to that and help boost growth right around \u201823 and \u201824. But I can tell you, we are very confident that we have now built a portfolio that can sustain growth and drive growth on the other side of the LOE. In fact, I would tell you that, when I look at RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, and I look at the in-play market shares that we see with those assets today, when we gave guidance of 2025, we assumed that on average, we would achieve high single-digit market share across the indications. So as an example, if you look at SKYRIZI right now, SKYRIZI\u2019s in-play share is 33%, the market leader by a wide margin. The next closest product is at 16% in-play share. And its TRX share is now at 11% and climbing rapidly. So it\u2019s already above what we had assumed the peak would have been out in 2025 from a market share standpoint. And if we maintain that 33% by then, it will have an overall share of about 33%, so it will be three times what we had assumed for psoriasis. So when you look at the speed at which we are bringing the new indications, when you look at the breadth of those indications across the revenue base that HUMIRA has today, we have covered all of the major indications for HUMIRA plus one more that HUMIRA doesn\u2019t have, which is atopic derm. And if we can achieve that kind of market share in each of these indications, then we will obviously double what we assumed that 2025 number was and that gets you pretty close to covering all of HUMIRA in the U.S. So I am very encouraged about that. And I think that, along with the other assets and the four major growth platforms, gives us a tremendous amount of confidence that we can drive growth on a sustainable basis at a very high level. Yeah. Well, Vamil, obviously, it\u2019s still unclear as to what the landscape will be on the other side of the election, so we obviously have to let that play out. Having said that, I think, we assume that there will be continued pressure on the industry as it relates to drug pricing. As far as what our expectations would be in 2021, I think our expectations in 2021 from a price standpoint will be similar to what they were in \u201819 and \u201820, and is we weren\u2019t reliant on price. I mean, fortunately our business is primarily a volume-driven business. It\u2019s typically in areas that are very serious diseases and have strong value propositions. And so that gives me confidence that we will be able to fare reasonably well even if there are changes. I\u2019d say the second thing is, it\u2019s unlikely that you will get changes that have a significant impact early on in \u201821, because there\u2019s going to be a lot of debate here about what those changes are. What I would hope the debate ultimately transitions to is co-pays and out-of-pocket costs for patients, because that is the fundamental issue and it\u2019s particularly the issue when you look at Part D patients. They have to pay far too much of the burden of the cost from an out-of-pocket cost standpoint. And they are really the only group of patients in the U.S. that have that kind of burden associated with them. If you look at the overall performance from a cost standpoint of Medicare Part D. It\u2019s performed very well. In fact, if you go back to the original CBO estimates over the last 10 years, it\u2019s come in 45% below the original estimates for what it would grow. And if you look at Part D, it\u2019s grown at about the rate of other healthcare services inflation, not significantly higher. And so the affordability problem is really around those co-pays. We have to drive those co-pays.  And then I think the other thing that has to be played in here is, I would hope as this debate goes on, they are going to look very carefully at our industry and the value of our industry both from a societal standpoint, as well as an economic standpoint and this is tremendously value industry. Just look at what we have done as an industry as it relates to this pandemic, whether you are talking about vaccines or you are talking about therapeutics, look at what we have done in advancements with cancer. And then from an economic standpoint, this industry supports directly or indirectly 4 million jobs in the United States, typically high paying jobs. It produces a tremendous amount of economic output for the U.S. And so it\u2019s an industry that you don\u2019t want to damage in the process and I think that has to be part of the debate. But the short answer to your question is, I think, you should -- we should -- we are not assuming we will get a lot of benefit from price in \u201821. We are also not assuming that across that year we would see a significant change that would have a dramatic impact on that calendar year. Tax reform was your next question. And the only thing I\u2019d add, Vamil, on that one is, we obviously did flex what we thought the tax rate could be and we just don\u2019t know that much about it, we know what has been said. But we flexed it against this dividend increase and made sure we were absolutely comfortable with payout ratios based on that and we are or we wouldn\u2019t have moved forward with the 10.2% increase. Yeah. So, Steve, I will handle your first question. Rob will handle two and three, and Mike can handle number four. So if you look at the in-play share, about 25% of that in-play share is coming -- on SKYRIZI is coming from HUMIRA. The other 75% is coming from competitors. I\u2019d say it\u2019s primarily the 17s but some coming from the other 12, 23s or 23s, but I\u2019d say the bulk of it is coming from the 17s. So that might answer your question about COSENTYX. If you look at the capture of the type of patient that we are getting with SKYRIZI, it\u2019s very balanced. It\u2019s about 50/50 between first-line and then second-line. So that\u2019s a nice balance between IE patients and patients who have failed other therapies. So I think the asset is performing the way you would expect a high-performing, high-efficacy asset to be able to perform, is -- it has quickly become the preferred product by prescribing physicians. It has a great profile. It\u2019s quarterly dosing. It\u2019s got great efficacy. The efficacy improves over time. There aren\u2019t any assets that have that kind of a profile on the market. So I would expect that SKYRIZI will continue to increase its in-play share. It\u2019s jumped about 3 points over the last maybe two months and I would expect it will continue to increase. Hi. How are you? Hi, Jon. Yeah. Sorry\u2026 You guys pass along [ph]. I think he wants what\u2019s the molecule\u2026 Yeah. And then on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, I don\u2019t have the numbers right in front of me on each of the markets. I would say typically in the international market, it is a slightly slower uptake than it is in the U.S., but still doing very well. So maybe the best thing would be to get back to you with some more specifics around that. But I think you can assume that the in-play share there probably averages between 20% and 30%. But it depends obviously on the country that you are talking about. And then on VRAYLAR MDD timing, Mike? And I think that\u2019s an important point to make here. If we look at VRAYLAR, VRAYLAR is growing very rapidly. And as you know, the atypical anti-psychotic market is very, very large. I think VRAYLAR\u2019s share is something like 3% and it\u2019s tracking at $1.4 billion at 3%. So if we look at the current indications, as we indicated in the comments, of bipolar and schizophrenia, we think we can drive VRAYLAR alone in those indications to a multi-billion dollar product and that\u2019s just driving that market share penetration up to like 5% or so. And I think that\u2019s very doable based on the profile of VRAYLAR. VRAYLAR has a very unique profile in that market. So MDD, if we are successful, obviously, will open up a whole other channel and allow you to increase that market share even more significantly. And so typically, many of the drugs that achieved MDD were drugs that had $5 billion, $6 billion of annual revenues. So this is a nice opportunity. Without MDD, VRAYLAR is still going to be a very important product and a very significant product. With MDD, it becomes a major product. And so we will see how those next two studies play out. The first study was positive and I think we are hopeful that we will be able to get it. So on the unemployment, we did identify back, I guess, it was in the first quarter call, that we were going to build in a level of risk associated with patients who would have to move to some type of an assistance program, because they lost their jobs. We have not seen that impact play out to any significant level. We have not seen it in our patient assistance program and right around the pandemic we made a decision to proactively go out and advertise our patient assistance program just to make sure that patients knew that if they couldn\u2019t afford their AbbVie drugs that they could get them from us. So I think we proactively tried to drive it in an effort to make sure that patients were not exposed, but we haven\u2019t seen very much at all. We still have some coverage left in the fourth quarter for it. But I\u2019d say at this point, I think, we are questioning whether or not we are going to see it. Now, I can\u2019t tell you exactly why. But I can tell you we are monitoring it carefully and it\u2019s definitely not happening, at least in our business, because we would see it in the patient assistance program. On BOTOX migraine, if you actually look at what is happening with patients on BOTOX migraine, when the injectable CGRPs came into the market, you did see a tick down in patients, but then BOTOX recovered. And it has roughly the same number of patients that it had back then. It\u2019s slightly lower than it had back then. So what the CGRPs ended up doing was expanding the market to some extent. And we are seeing a very similar phenomenon on the acute therapies as well. If you look at the scripts, the NBRxs for the acute CGRPs, you can see that it\u2019s actually almost doubling every quarter the number of patients. In the last quarter, it was about 90,000 to 100,000 NBRxs. So I think these assets can significantly expand the market. I think two-thirds of our patients are patients that have switched on the acute, have switched from triptans to our agent and one-third of them are naive patients that we are bringing into the category. And again, that\u2019s all about making it visible to patients who have this condition so that they go to their physician and ask for the therapy. It\u2019s all about building markets essentially. And so I think one of the things these assets will do is they will expand the market. Now, I think as you expand the market, obviously BOTOX therapeutics, some of those patients will ultimately if they don\u2019t get the kind of relief that they are looking for on an injectable CGRP or the acute therapy, they would eventually probably try injectable BOTOX. So we could see a little bit of growth there, but the biggest part of the growth that we are going to see in this market is from UBRELVY and ultimately atogepant. It\u2019s a big market and I think these agents will allow us to be able to significantly expand the market and I think this is clearly a multi-billion dollar market. Yeah. Thanks, David. I will take the first one. Rob will answer the second one for you. So if I look at long-term immunology, what\u2019s critically important is that you have the kinds of assets that allow that managed care organization or PBM to be able to cover the greatest number of patients. This is a category where not every drug works on every patient. So you have to have multiple options that are available in the formulary and that\u2019s just -- that is the appropriate thing to do to make sure that patients have the drugs that they need to be able to be treated. I would say, we typically do very well with formulary access. That\u2019s driven primarily by the fact that our assets tend to be very attractive assets from a clinical profile. They establish significant market share positions and that\u2019s important for the managed care organization or the PBM. So I don\u2019t see anything significantly impacting that going forward. I would assume we will maintain very high levels of formulary access. Net pricing, there\u2019s always some level of impact on pricing when you renegotiate the contracts. I don\u2019t anticipate that you will see a significant change going forward. So I think it\u2019s more of the normal kinds of competitive activities that we see in the marketplace. Okay. Great. On IBD usage, if you look at the penetration, I\u2019d say, IBD is an area where you have reasonable levels of biologic penetration, because the disease particularly Crohn\u2019s is the disease is a pretty severe. I think the challenge in IBD is that, with the current therapies that are available, you still get sub-optimal clinical efficacy for these patients and durability of that efficacy. And so what physicians tend to do is they rotate patients through various treatments to try to maintain them in control for a longer period of time. So it is a market that is right for higher efficacy agents and a market that is right for more agents to be available to allow for better treatment of those patients and that\u2019s the key driver in that segment of what gives significant uptake. So when we see the data around IBD that will be important for us, obviously the early data looks good. And ultimately I think these assets, along with HUMIRA, will be able to provide the market with a significant new alternative and I think that uptake will be good based on that. Terence, the only thing I would add, maybe to give you some perspective on the investment side. Allergan tended to what I would describe as pulse invest in particularly DTC, but even in social media. So they didn\u2019t -- and typically what we do with brands when we want to drive maximum speed of market penetration is we invest at a steady state and continue to do that for an extended period of time. So they might have invested heavily in one quarter and then gone dark in the next quarter and then invested again and gone dark again. We don\u2019t use that kind of a strategy. We tend to invest for the full year. And in our experience, what that does is it gives you, the fact that you have constant coverage, gives you maximum speed of penetration. So we clearly think that\u2019s going to be an advantage, particularly in areas like aesthetics and neuroscience. I\u2019d say on neuroscience, the way to think about it is or at least the way we are thinking about it is, there\u2019s a significant opportunity to drive VRAYLAR to be a very large product, I mean, doubling or more depending upon the ability to get MDD. And I\u2019d also say in migraine, when we get the full portfolio of migraine assets. The migraine market is a big market. If you look at the acute market today, it\u2019s probably about $1.5 billion. We believe it can grow to $4 billion or $5 billion by 2025 with the right kinds of assets and the right kind of promotion. And then if you look at the preventative market, it\u2019s about $3 billion, so we believe that one in real high-single to low-double digits with the right kinds of assets and the right kinds of promotion. So the first phase of neuroscience is nothing more than taking the assets we have now, getting atogepant to the marketplace and then we have a full portfolio of migraine products, and then maximizing the market share position of those assets in the market, that\u2019s sort of Phase 1. But I would say now that we have infrastructure in place, Mike\u2019s BD team has been now been starting to look at assets that would be complementary to that. And we didn\u2019t in the past because for a single anti-psychotic, we wouldn\u2019t have wanted to build-out the infrastructure, it just wouldn\u2019t have made sense for us. But now we can basically add those kinds of assets to the infrastructure we have. So it does give us another opportunity from a BD standpoint to be able to build the business longer term. Yeah. I think if you look -- Tim, this is Rick. If you look at the PE of the whole sector, obviously, the sector is under pressure from the political environment and concerns about the political environment. And you are correct, we are at the lower end of that PE and I think that is driven by uncertainty about what the growth rate will be on the other side of the LOE. What I would tell you is obviously, we have a 10-year LLP, so we know what we think that growth rate is on the other side of the LOE. And I can tell you that when I look at that growth rate, it\u2019s robust.  Now, the market has to come around to that point of view. I\u2019d say, we haven\u2019t always been right, but in total revenue, we have always been right. In fact, we have always beat for the most part what our expectations were. And so we obviously challenge it pretty hard and we have knowledge of what we believe the erosion curve will look like. We have knowledge of what we think our pipeline will deliver and what the additional indications will deliver. And look, I remember there was a tremendous amount of skepticism about when we gave it was either $10 billion or $11 billion of risk adjusted revenues for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI back a year or two ago, something like that. There was a tremendous amount of skepticism, that\u2019s impossible. I don\u2019t hear very much of that now that these two assets are $2 billion and growing like rockets. So I\u2019d say our ability to assess what we can do with our assets is pretty high.  Now, that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t go out and get more things and we constantly look and where we find opportunity, we will clearly go pursue those. They have to be opportunities that make sense and fit into our portfolio. You have seen us do transactions to continue to build the long-term future of our hem/onc business with Genmab and I-Mab. And those two assets combined with what VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA can continue to do, I think it is going to give us a very robust long-term performance in that franchise. I think in immunology, we are in pretty good shape between our internal pipeline both the additional indications on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ and then what we have earlier on that we think will play out in a positive way. When we look at neuroscience, we just talked about that we have the ability to be able to grow that. Certainly, we are going to invest heavily in aesthetics. We have a tremendous amount of assets, new toxins that we are working on and we are going to accelerate many of those, new fillers and other kinds of opportunities that will build that aesthetics business to be able to grow rapidly. And so I feel pretty good about where we are. In fact, I\u2019d tell you I feel very good about where we are six months into the Allergan transaction. Certainly Allergan has given us more growth as we mentioned a moment ago. When we look at neuroscience, neuroscience has clearly been I think a nice positive upside for us and one that I think we can execute very well. As far as guidance is concerned, I am not saying, we will never give guidance, but we want to give guidance when we are able to do it with a high degree of certainty. Because the last thing we want to do is provide a level of guidance that you don\u2019t have a high degree of certainty and you know it\u2019s going to, it has some variability to it. You probably remember, we did that on the international biosimilars and we were off by not that much, but we were off by some and the market didn\u2019t like the fact that we were off. So you need to be awfully careful about how you provide that guidance in a way to make sure that you meet or exceed the guidance, and at the point which we have that level of confidence, we may go out with longer term guidance. And I\u2019d say the lower face toxins and the lower face fillers that we are working on, probably the best way, rather than trying to characterize individual indications for toxins or fillers is, we are trying to build a portfolio and a market activation strategy that will allow us to grow the aesthetics business at a consistent double-digit rate. And it is both that internal pipeline and activating more patients, and some BD effort that will give us that. So, certainly those lower face toxins and fillers are designed to be able to support that growth going forward. The eye care product, I would call that product sort of a modest product. I don\u2019t remember the specifics. Do you, Rob? I\u2019d call it sort of a modest size product."

            "name": "Michael Severino",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. We continue to make great progress across all stages of our pipeline and this morning I will highlight key events since our last earnings call. Starting with immunology, where we achieved several major milestones, including submission of our U.S. and European regulatory applications for RINVOQ in ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis. We expect regulatory decisions in the first half of 2021 for both indications, as well as for psoriatic arthritis which was submitted for regulatory review earlier this year. Within the rheumatology segment, both psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are large and important markets and represent a significant growth opportunity for RINVOQ. We will highlight the growing body of data from our rheumatology portfolio and the -- at the upcoming virtual ACR Congress, where we will present 35 abstracts from multiple assets across our portfolio, including six selected for oral presentation. Atopic dermatitis is a new disease area for AbbVie and also represents an important area of growth for our immunology franchise going forward. Based on the data generated in our registrational program, we remain very confident in the benefit/risk profile for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis and believe it will offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. Beyond the Phase 3 studies that support our regulatory submission, we are also evaluating RINVOQ in a head-to-head Phase 3 trial against dupilumab, which if successful, will help further support RINVOQ as a highly differentiated therapeutic option for patients with atopic dermatitis. We look forward to seeing data from this head-to-head study later this quarter. In the area of inflammatory bowel diseases, we remain on track to see induction data later this quarter from our Phase 3 program for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis. We will see data from a second induction study in ulcerative colitis, as well as results from the maintenance portion of these studies next year. We expect to file our regulatory applications in 2021 as well. We are also making great progress with the development programs for SKYRIZI and later this quarter we expect data from several new indications across rheumatology and gastroenterology. We will see data from two Phase 3 studies in psoriatic arthritis and results from the first Phase 3 induction study in Crohn\u2019s disease, supporting regulatory applications for both indications in 2021. Outside of immunology, SKYRIZI will also be evaluated as a potential treatment for COVID-19 as part of the NIH ACTIV program, which is a public private partnership aimed at accelerating potential therapies and vaccines for COVID-19. SKYRIZI was selected through a prioritization process that evaluated immunomodulators with acceptable safety profiles as potential treatments for COVID-19 complications caused by the cytokine storm observed in some patients. SKYRIZI will be included in the ACTIV-5 Big Effect trial, which is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate a number of drugs that are either approved or in late-stage development as potential treatments for COVID-19. In our early-stage immunology pipeline, earlier this year, we toplined positive results from a proof-of-concept study evaluating our novel TNF steroid conjugate, ABBV-3373 in RA. We recently completed the Phase 1 PK and safety study for our second TNF steroid conjugate, ABBV-154. Based on these data, we have selected 154 to move forward into larger scale trials. We expect to begin a Phase 2b definitive dose ranging study for 154 in RA for the first half of 2021. As Rick mentioned, we will be hosting an Immunology Day for investors in December, where we will provide an update on our immunology strategy and long-term outlook for the franchise. We look forward to providing additional updates on our immunology pipeline at that time. In oncology, we continue to advance our portfolio with several important Phase 3 studies beginning in the quarter, including VENCLEXTA in high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and navitoclax in myelofibrosis. We also recently received full FDA approval of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, decitabine or low-dose cytarabine in newly diagnosed AML patients, who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. This approval is supported by the Phase 3 VIALE-A and VIALE-C studies. Updated efficacy and safety results from VIALE-A were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine and showed that the combination of VENCLEXTA and azacitidine extended overall survival compared to azacitidine plus placebo. Additionally, following the publication of the VIALE-A results, the NCCN guidelines were updated to recommend the VENCLEXTA and azacitidine combination as the Category 1 preferred treatment for AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Importantly, the VENCLEXTA combination has the Category 1 designation irrespective of mutational status. Also in the quarter, we announced a collaboration with I-Mab to develop and commercialize the anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, lemzoparlimab. The emerging data for lemzoparlimab is very encouraging and provides AbbVie access to another potentially differentiated asset in the immuno-oncology space. The data generated to date show that lemzoparlimab effectively blocks tumor-specific CD47 interactions, but with much lower binding to red blood cells, potentially leading to a better safety profile. Lemzoparlimab is being studied in multiple cancers with a focus on hematological malignancies. In neuroscience, we recently presented new data from several clinical programs at the virtual Migraine Trust International Symposium, showcasing the breadth and strength of our migraine portfolio and demonstrating AbbVie\u2019s commitment to providing multiple treatment options for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. In total, 15 abstracts were presented for BOTOX, UBRELVY and atogepant.  Included in the MTIS presentation were the detailed results for atogepant in the Phase 3 advanced study, which demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement over placebo, with all atogepant doses for the primary endpoint of reduction in mean monthly migraine days. Significant improvements were also observed for all secondary endpoints in the 30-milligram and 60-milligram dose groups. Treatment with atogepant resulted in 56% to 61% of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in monthly migraine days, compared to 29% for the placebo group. We are very encouraged by the strong benefit/risk profile that has been demonstrated for atogepant in migraine prevention and believe that once approved, this new oral treatment option will be competitively positioned in the prevention market. Together with BOTOX for chronic migraine prevention and UBRELVY for acute migraine treatment, the addition of atogepant creates a market leading portfolio in migraine that represents significant long-term value for AbbVie. In aesthetics, we continue to make good progress with our portfolio of facial toxins and dermal fillers. We have several ongoing programs for new indications for BOTOX and for the JUV\u00c9DERM collection, as well as a pipeline of innovative toxins and dermal fillers, which we expect to reach the market over the course of the next five years. BOTOX has been the leading neurotoxin for over two decades, with R&D efforts in aesthetics primarily focused on the upper face. To support expansion to the lower face region, we have several programs ongoing, including studies in masseter and platysma prominence. We recently had a positive data readout for our Phase 2 study for the reduction of masseter prominence in the lower face. This study met all primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating that the severity of prominence was reduced following a single treatment of BOTOX. Based on these results, we plan to begin Phase 3 development next year, which will support registration in the U.S. and Europe.  We also recently announced the acquisition of Luminera\u2019s dermal filler portfolio led by HArmonyCa, which is an innovative dermal filler developed for facial soft tissue augmentation. Luminera\u2019s assets are highly complementary to our JUV\u00c9DERM filler franchise and we look forward to expanding their development to markets around the world. And in eye care, we recently announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies, which evaluated our topical eye drop, AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. In both studies, 584 met the primary endpoint and the majority of secondary endpoints, with data from both studies demonstrating that treatment with 584 resulted in significant near-vision gains in low lighting conditions without a loss of distance vision. Based on these results, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of next year. So, in summary, we have continued to make significant progress advancing and accelerating our programs this quarter, and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the coming months and through 2021.  With that, I will turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? Certainly. I will start and then pass it over to Rob, if he wants to add a little bit more detail. We view atopic dermatitis as a very attractive and a very substantial opportunity overall. It\u2019s an indication that I think for many years was underappreciated by the industry. Now that\u2019s changed recently and you have seen a lot of focus in drug development in atopic dermatitis. We feel very good about the profile that we have demonstrated, coming out of Phase 2, when we made those statements about the risk-adjusted potential in atopic dermatitis, we felt good about our data and those data were sufficient to get a breakthrough therapy designation. We are in the fortunate and not always that common situation where our Phase 3 results have actually outperformed our expectations based on Phase 2. And if you look at the Phase 3 results, they are really strong across the board. They are strong in total response. They are strong in repeated response and they are strong on components like itch, which is the most troublesome symptom to patients in the majority of cases. And so, when you couple that with the safety profile that we have demonstrated, which we think is very favorable. We see this as something that has very real potential and when we look across studies, we feel very good about our results. And of course, we have a head-to-head study with dupilumab, which is coming up later on this quarter and so that will be important additional information, and we are very optimistic about those results. Rob, I don\u2019t know if you would like to add anything further? This is Mike. I will take your last question on clinical trial activity. The first thing that, I would say is, the increase in clinical trial activity reflects what\u2019s going on in our pipeline and there\u2019s a lot of activity in our pipeline, and a large number of molecules that we are advancing, and so that\u2019s a big part of it. Another part is that, we made the conscious decision to leave decisions around enrollment in the hands of investigators rather than making them centrally, because they understand the situation in their hospital in their community better than we do. And there was a small group of studies that we paused at the time of the initial COVID impact, but the majority we allowed to continue. That doesn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t disruptions from COVID. But it does mean that investigators decided when it was time to pause enrollment and when it was time to resume enrollment.  And I think the evidence shows that they made those decisions better than they could have been made centrally. And that has allowed us to advance our portfolio, to advance our clinical trials with minimal disruption and with safe conduct for patients and the staff at the site, which are also critically important considerations. And so, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a combination of those factors. Yes. On VRAYLAR MDD, we would expect to have the study\u2019s readout in the second half of next year and be prepared for regulatory submissions shortly thereafter. So it\u2019s possible we would have an approval in \u201822. This is Mike. I will take the question about 154. So, 3373 and 154 represent our TNF steroid conjugate molecules that are in the clinic. They are very similar, similar to the extent that we view the biology as being translatable between the two. But 154 includes some improvements in linker technology that relate to manufacturability and ability to formulate at high concentration, ease of formulation. And so those can be very important advantages for a successful molecule. We previously toplined the positive results from 3373. We wanted to see that 154 gave us the PK performance and the exposure to achieve the pharmacodynamic coverage we think we need in the next stage of development. And as I said, we viewed the biology as translatable between the two. So once we saw that PK performance and it matched our expectations and showed that 154 would give us the coverage that we were seeking at acceptable doses in the clinic, we made the decision to advance that molecule into larger scale trials. I will take the second question and agree with everything Rick said, the only thing I\u2019d add on BD in neuroscience is neuropsychiatry is now clearly an area of strength for us and can be an area of interest and that can go beyond the anti-psychotics as well. There\u2019s tremendous potential and unmet need in areas like generalized anxiety disorder, still in depression despite there are many agents on the market, many, many patients remain inadequately treated, so we would look broadly across that space. With respect to 951 and data timing, we would expect to see results from our Phase 3 study in the second half of next year. And what we are looking for is really DUOPA like efficacy, because DUOPA is a transformational product but it\u2019s also a product that is challenging to administer, and the nature of that product, the fact that it requires the placement of a gastric tube that\u2019s then threaded into the small bowel and has to be maintained limits the size of what\u2019s effectively an addressable market. Not the market by the labeled indication, but the proportion of patients within that population that would consider a therapy like that. And 951 has the potential to substantially expand that. It has an insulin pump-like device, subcutaneous delivery device. We think it will broaden the number of patients within that labeled population, who would consider such a therapy and this is really a very substantial market. So for example, if you look at DUOPA, despite all of its challenges, it does about $0.5 billion in sales. If you look across similar therapies for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, the market is probably $1.5 billion or more and that probably represents only a small part of the potential because much of it remains untapped. So we think that 951 can address that and we think the profile that it will take to address that is DUOPA like efficacy with a more patient-friendly subcutaneous delivery device. With respect to BOTOX indications, there are a number of indications, both for BOTOX and for other toxins, for novel toxins that we are considering in the therapeutic space. I think there\u2019s more work that we can do in the migraine space. Although, that has been an area of strength, episodic migraine has patients that may benefit from a therapy like BOTOX and there\u2019s still much more to do on the neurology side with respect to specificity disorders that might be secondary to stroke or other conditions where there is still room to expand those indications. When we look more broadly, there are a number of potential interesting indications for neurotoxins. They might not be BOTOX. They may be novel toxins. Those could be things like prevention of afib, for example, and we are continuing to explore indications beyond that."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. And thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nLiz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also, on the call with me today are, Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; and Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AbbVie's operations, results and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Please note that, the second quarter financial results and guidance provided on today's call for sales EPS and line items of the P&L reflect a full period of legacy AbbVie operations and a partial year of contribution from the Allergan portfolio since the transaction closed in early May of this year. In addition, we have provided a quarterly comparable historical trend analysis for key product revenues of the newly combined company, as a supplemental table in our earnings release this quarter. This table supports the comparison of sales growth on a comparable operational basis, including full quarter current year and historical results for Allergan on a pro forma basis. Comparable operational percent changes are presented at a constant \u2013 at constant currency rate. For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast informed to conform to AbbVie's revenue recognition accounting policies, and exclude the recent divestitures of ZENPEP and VIOKACE. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I will now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter performance and highlights. And for the first time, I'll provide our 2020 outlook for the newly combined company. Mike will then discuss recent advancements across R&D programs. And Rob, will review the quarter and our updated guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions. I'd like to start off by recognizing all of our employees, including those joining AbbVie from Allergan for all of their hard work and dedication during this pandemic. The AbbVie team has been working diligently and carefully, within our facilities and remotely, to ensure that our business continues to operate properly and our patients continue to receive their medicines. Before I speak to the strong financial performance this quarter, I'd like to characterize the state of the recovery of the business from the COVID crisis. Let me start with the legacy AbbVie side of the business, which has demonstrated robust performance leading into the pandemic and has remained resilient. The impact on continuing patients for HUMIRA and new patients for RINVOQ, SKYRIZI and VENCLEXTA, were not as pronounced as we had previously anticipated. While patient flow has not recovered, in most therapeutic segments we're encouraged by the level of stabilization, and the recent positive demand trends. Overall, the legacy AbbVie business continues to perform very well, with stand-alone revenue growth in the second quarter of approximately 8.5% on an operational basis, excluding the negative impact from COVID. On the legacy Allergan side of the business, we saw significant COVID-related impacts on BOTOX Therapeutic and our aesthetics business in the second quarter. Both businesses are seeing a rapid recovery and are now performing near pre-COVID levels. Other key brands, such as, VRAYLAR and UBRELVY were impacted in a manner similar to the AbbVie-based business. And we're pleased with the recent trends and progress. Overall, COVID had a substantial impact on second quarter reported revenues with an estimated net unfavorable impact of more than $900 million. However, by the end of June the total business had recovered to more than 90% of pre-COVID levels. So I'm pleased with the resilience and the rapid recovery across our portfolio. And I'm confident in the continued strong underlying demand and performance of the combined new company. Despite the impact from COVID, we delivered a strong second quarter performance. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 were well above our expectations. The $0.21 beat included $0.11 of net accretion from Allergan, as well as $0.10 of favorable performance versus the midpoint of our stand-alone guidance. Total revenues were $10.4 billion, including approximately $8.4 billion of legacy AbbVie sales significantly above our expectations for the standalone portfolio with continued robust performance in both hem/onc and immunology, despite the impact from COVID. Hem/onc revenues of approximately $1.6 billion were up strong double digits again this quarter. IMBRUVICA sales grew approximately 17% on an operational basis, reflecting continued strong performance in CLL, where we remain the clear market leader. VENCLEXTA sales were up more than 80% on an operational basis with strong growth in CLL and AML. During the quarter, we also announced a strategic collaboration with Genmab to further build our oncology portfolio with a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody. It has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy across B-cell malignancies. Our leading immunology business delivered revenues of more than $5.3 billion, reflecting growth of more than 8.5% on an operational basis. U.S. HUMIRA revenue growth remained strong, up 5% with continued demand from the large installed patient base, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19. International HUMIRA biosimilar dynamics in the quarter were better than our expectations. SKYRIZI continues to perform well and has maintained its leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at more than 30%. As expected, we saw modest delays to new patient starts during the quarter, as a result of the COVID-19 dynamics. However, recent prescription trends and increasing enrollment in our ambassador program two leading indicators demonstrate a strong growth trajectory and support our full year guidance of $1.4 billion. We're also seeing very encouraging trends for RINVOQ, where rheumatology office visits are approaching pre-COVID levels. RINVOQ revenues were up more than 70% on a sequential basis and currently reflect 15% in-play RA patient share, which is now nearly at parity to HUMIRA, the market leader in in-play share and above all other agents in the segment. We're also making excellent progress with our immunology pipeline, which Mike will discuss further momentarily. As I noted during the quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of Allergan creating a stronger and a more diverse AbbVie. The transaction significantly expands and diversifies AbbVie's revenue base and complements our existing leadership positions in immunology and hematological oncology with additional growth franchises in aesthetics and neuroscience. We have growth opportunities in neuroscience with BOTOX Therapeutics, VRAYLAR and UBRELVY. And we have the leading global aesthetics business with flagship brands including BOTOX Cosmetics and JUV\u00c9DERM. I'll start with neuroscience, which had sales of roughly $735 million to AbbVie in the second quarter. VRAYLAR continues to demonstrate rapid growth and is well on its way to surpassing $1 billion in annual revenues. Underlying demand has remained resilient despite the COVID-19 pandemic with strong double-digit growth again this quarter. We see significant room for continued expansion within VRAYLAR's existing indications bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Major depressive disorder or MDD represents another potential large indication with two Phase 3 trials well underway. Also within neuroscience, we now have a portfolio of migraine therapies that have the potential to support long-term growth in a highly attractive and underserved market. Our migraine portfolio is anchored with BOTOX Therapeutic, which had revenues of roughly $300 million to AbbVie in the second quarter. Despite multiple new competitive entrants, BOTOX Therapeutic has largely retained its total treated patient base, a testament to its efficacy, safety and brand recognition. Like many physician-administered products, BOTOX Therapeutics saw a significant impact from COVID-19 in the second quarter with global sales down approximately 20% on a comparable operational basis. However, we're pleased by the recent data trends, which demonstrate a fast recovery and performance is now close to pre-COVID levels. The launch of UBRELVY, the first-to-market in leading oral CGRP for acute migraine is off to an excellent start. Feedback from physicians has been very positive given UBRELVY's efficacy, safety and convenient dosing profile relative to current standards of care. Commercial access for UBRELVY is now at 70%, which along with increased consumer promotion will further support the product's launch trajectory. We're also developing atogepant for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine. We recently disclosed positive top line results from a Phase 3 study in episodic migraine, which will support regulatory submission early next year. As a fourth pillar of growth we now have the world's leading global aesthetics franchise, which generated sales of roughly $480 million to AbbVie in second quarter. As anticipated, we saw a decline in year-over-year comparable operational growth with aesthetics health care providers closed during the initial phase of COVID. It's now been roughly two months since most major geographies have begun to reopen. And we're pleased with the strong recovery trends we're seeing. As of the end of June, the vast majority of our aesthetics accounts have reopened in the U.S. and we're seeing considerable pent-up demand. Current U.S. aesthetic revenues have recovered and are approaching 95% of pre-COVID levels. Outside the U.S., we're also seeing steady recovery trends in China and Western Europe. Current international aesthetics revenues have recovered to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels. Overall, we're very pleased with the momentum we're seeing on our aesthetics franchise. More broadly, we see aesthetics as a durable cash pay business with an opportunity for significant market growth, as well as continued new innovation driving long-term performance. While strategically important, the acquisition of Allergan will also drive strong financial benefits. Integration has been relatively seamless and we're impressed by the caliber of talent that we've welcomed into AbbVie. We remain on track with our synergy target of more than $2 billion in expense rationalization by the third year from transaction closing, which Rob will discuss further in his prepared remarks here momentarily. When you take these synergies into consideration along with the continued P&L leverage from our expected sales growth, we expect further operating margin expansion over the next couple of years. While the COVID crisis remains a fluid situation, our business continues to remain resilient and demonstrate strong underlying growth. Although we continue to carefully watch COVID-related events in the U.S., we're pleased with our recent business trends and the progress we're making towards recovery. And we expect performance will continue to ramp to normalized levels over the course of the second half of 2020. With these current assumptions and based on our recent outperformance of our base business, today we're issuing full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance for our new combined company of $10.35 to $10.45, reflecting growth of 16.3% at the midpoint. This guidance assumes $0.70 of net accretion from the Allergan transaction in 2020, which represents 11% accretion on an annualized basis ahead of our initial projections for the transaction despite the COVID impact that I outlined earlier. Overall, we continue to see good momentum across our total portfolio and across our pipeline. We reported a very strong second quarter performance and remain encouraged by the recent recovery trends, which are faster than we expected. We continue to expect the COVID pandemic will have a transient impact on our business with further recovery continuing through the second half of 2020. With the closing of the Allergan transaction, AbbVie is well-positioned for enhanced long-term growth potential, a growing dividend, rapid debt repayment and strong investment in innovation across our therapeutic categories. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?\nMichael Severino: Thank you Rick. We had a very productive quarter with continued progress across all stages of our pipeline. Additionally with the recent closing of the Allergan acquisition, we added promising pipeline assets in the areas of aesthetics and neuroscience. We look forward to sharing updates as those programs progress through development. In immunology, we continue to advance our programs for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI in several new disease areas. This year, we intend to submit regulatory applications for three additional indications for RINVOQ. In June, we submitted applications for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis. And we expect to file applications for atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis later this year. We also recently reported topline results from our three registrational trials for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis. Two of these Phase III studies Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 evaluated RINVOQ as a monotherapy for the treatment of adolescent and adult subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for candidates for systemic therapy. In the Measure Up one and Measure Up two studies, both doses of RINVOQ met all primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating significant improvement in skin clearance and itch compared to placebo. In Measure Up 1, roughly 70% of patients receiving the 15-milligram dose and 80% of patients on the 30-milligram dose achieved a 75% or greater improvement in skin lesions by week 16. We saw a similar rates of skin clearance in the Measure Up two study, with roughly 60% of patients receiving the low dose and 73% of patients on the high dose, achieving a 75% or greater improvement by week 16. We also saw very rapid responses in these studies with clinically meaningful reductions in itch observed as early as one day after the first dose in patients receiving 30 milligrams and two days after the first dose in patients receiving 15 milligrams in both studies. We also saw very strong results in our third registrational trial, the AD Up study which evaluated RINVOQ in combination with topical corticosteroids. Similar to the results from the two Measure Up trials, RINVOQ met all primary and secondary endpoints in the AD Up study with patients who received RINVOQ showing significant improvements in skin clearance and reduction in itch compared to patients receiving placebo plus topical steroids following 16 weeks of treatment. Treatment with RINVOQ also led to a significant increase in the number of steroid-free days. And more patients receiving RINVOQ were able to stop topical corticosteroids altogether. We're very encouraged by both the level of efficacy and the safety profile we've seen across all three Phase III atopic dermatitis studies. And we remain very confident that RINVOQ has the potential to provide a strong benefit-risk profile in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In addition to these three registrational studies, we are also evaluating RINVOQ in a head-to-head Phase III trial against dupilumab and expect to see data from this study later this year. In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, our Phase III program for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis is progressing ahead of schedule. And we now expect to see topline data from the first Phase III induction study later this year. We also recently reported topline results from a proof-of-concept study, evaluating our novel TNF steroid conjugate ABBV-3373 in RA. In this study, our goal is to drive a greater reduction in disease activity beyond the levels that can be achieved with HUMIRA or other high-efficacy agents such as RINVOQ. To achieve adequate statistical power, we used preplanned historical HUMIRA data in combination with in-trial data when comparing ABBV-3373 to HUMIRA. The study used two analyses for the primary endpoint which evaluated improvement from baseline in DAS28 score. The first analysis used a propensity matching strategy to compare 3373 with historical HUMIRA data. This analysis showed a greater change in DAS28 from baseline to week 12 for 3373 compared to the prespecified HUMIRA data. The second analysis used the Bayesian approach to compare 3373 to a combined in-trial and historical HUMIRA data set. And this analysis predicted with a 90% probability that 3373 was associated with a greater improvement in DAS28. Based on these encouraging results, we plan to advance the TNF steroid conjugate program in RA with a Phase IIb dose-ranging study expected to begin in the first half of 2021. We also plan to begin clinical studies next year in other immune-mediated diseases. Also, in the area of immunology we're making good progress advancing the programs for SKYRIZI in new disease areas. We expect to see data from Phase III studies in psoriatic arthritis later this year and in Crohn's disease at the end of this year or early next year, with regulatory submissions for both indications expected in 2021. In oncology, we continue to advance our hem/onc strategy with several important data readouts and study starts occurring this year. We've established a leading hem/onc portfolio with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA in areas such as CLL and AML. And we will continue to generate data to demonstrate the utility of both drugs across a wide range of patient populations and cancer types. At the recent EHA Congress, detailed results from the Phase III VIALE-A study were reported which showed the treatment with a combination of VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine resulted in a 34% reduction in the risk of death compared to azacitidine plus placebo in AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The median overall survival for patients in the VENCLEXTA arm was 14.7 months versus 9.6 months in the placebo arm. Patients in the VENCLEXTA arm also showed more than double the rate of composite complete remission compared to those treated with azacitidine alone. This filing is currently being reviewed by the FDA under the real-time oncology review program in Project Orbis. To-date, the AML program has focused on VENCLEXTA's use as a frontline treatment in transplant-ineligible patients. This year, we are expanding the program into other patient segments with the goal of establishing VENCLEXTA as a gold standard across the AML patient spectrum. Earlier this year, we initiated two Phase III studies, evaluating VENCLEXTA as a maintenance therapy in AML. One trial in fit patients with AML who have received stem cell transplant, but remain at high-risk for relapse; and a second trial, in patients with AML who are in first remission after receiving conventional induction and consolidation chemotherapies. In addition, building upon the survival advantage observed in the transplant-ineligible population, we are planning to initiate a new randomized study later this year testing VENCLEXTA in combination with intensive chemotherapy in patients who are eligible for more intensive induction regimens. Our comprehensive development program will position VENCLEXTA as a foundation for combination therapies in AML across all patient segments We also recently announced a broad oncology collaboration with Genmab to jointly develop and commercialize three next-generation bispecific antibody products and establish a discovery collaboration to create additional differentiated antibody-based therapeutics for cancer. The lead asset in this partnership epcoritamab a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody has demonstrated a strong efficacy profile, favorable safety and a more convenient dosing regimen in early phase trials. We believe epcoritamab has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy across a number of B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. And we are rapidly advancing it to Phase III trials. And lastly a few updates from other areas of our pipeline. We previously presented positive progression-free survival data from two Phase III studies for veliparib in frontline ovarian cancer and BRCA breast cancer. Based on developments in the field and additional discussions with the FDA, we will not be submitting regulatory applications without mature overall survival data. We will continue to follow patients in the ongoing trials as overall survival data mature. In Eye care, we recently announced receipt of a complete response letter from the FDA for the abicipar BLA. The CRL indicated that the rate of intraocular inflammation observed in the Phase III program, resulted in an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio. We are currently reviewing the abicipar program to determine next steps and will provide updates as they become available. In women's health, in the quarter we received FDA approval of ORIAHNN as the first nonsurgical oral treatment for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women. This new nonsurgical treatment represents an important therapeutic option for women suffering from uterine fibroids. And in neuroscience, we recently reported top line results from a Phase III study evaluating atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine. In this study all three doses of atogepant met the primary endpoint evaluating the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period. The two higher doses, 30 milligrams and 60 milligrams also met all secondary endpoints, while the 10-milligram dose met four out of six of the secondaries. Allergan had previously reported positive results from one registration-enabling study. And following this second positive study, we plan to submit our regulatory applications in episodic migraine prevention in the first quarter of 2021. In summary, we've seen tremendous progress across all stages of our pipeline in the first half of the year and we remain on-track for further advancements in the remainder of 2020. With that I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? \nRob Michael: Thank you, Mike. Starting with second quarter results, we delivered top and bottom line performance ahead of expectations. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 above our guidance midpoint by $0.21. This includes $0.10 of stronger performance from legacy AbbVie and $0.11 of accretion from Allergan. Total net revenues were $10.4 billion, including $2 billion in sales contribution from the Allergan portfolio. Legacy AbbVie was approximately $300 million ahead of our stand-alone sales guidance driven by RINVOQ, SKYRIZI and HUMIRA. COVID-related inventory stocking for the first quarter largely reversed as expected. U.S. HUMIRA sales were approximately $4 billion ahead of expectations due to the lower impact from COVID on continuing patient prescriptions. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below 0.5 month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were $863 million, down 17.4% operationally reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and ahead of our expectations. SKYRIZI global sales were $330 million with continued strong U.S. in-play market share. We also continue to see robust demand for RINVOQ with sales of $149 million in the quarter and a rapid increase in U.S. in-play market share. Hematologic oncology global sales were nearly $1.6 billion, up 25.8% on an operational basis with continued strong performance of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were approximately $1.3 billion, up 17.2% driven by continued strong performance in CLL. VENCLEXTA revenues were $303 million with strong demand across all approved indications. Global MAVYRET sales were $376 million down 51.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have declined during the COVID pandemic. Allergan Aesthetics contributed sales of $481 million in the quarter. BOTOX Cosmetic with sales of $226 million and JUV\u00c9DERM with sales of $113 million are both seeing a faster-than-expected recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience global revenues were $734 million. These results were led by BOTOX Therapeutic VRAYLAR and UBRELVY with combined sales of more than $500 million. We also saw a significant contribution from our eye care business which had global sales of $417 million. Turning now to the P&L profile for the second quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 82.8% of sales adjusted, R&D investment was 12.8% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 47% of sales including a negative impact of 70 basis points due to the reversal of COVID-related inventory stocking from the first quarter. Adjusted net interest expense was $484 million and the adjusted tax rate was 11.4%. Today we are issuing combined company guidance for the first time. As Rick previously discussed, we are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID pandemic and have factored the latest trends into our updated forecast. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $10.35 and $10.45 including $0.70 of accretion from the Allergan transaction. which represents an annualized contribution of 11%. Excluded from this guidance is $6.23 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue of approximately $45.5 billion. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 30 basis point unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth. Included in this revenue guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect U.S. HUMIRA sales growth of approximately 8%. We now expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $3.5 billion. For RINVOQ we now expect global revenues of approximately $600 million. For global HCV, we now expect sales of approximately $2.1 billion as treatments remain below pre-COVID levels. For aesthetics, we expect global sales of approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately $1 billion from BOTOX Cosmetic and approximately $650 million from JUV\u00c9DERM. For neuroscience, we expect global sales of approximately $3.5 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion from BOTOX Therapeutic and approximately $950 million from VRAYLAR. For eye care, we expect global revenues of approximately $2.1 billion, including approximately $700 million from RESTASIS, which assumes no generic competition in 2020. And for women's health, we expect global revenues of approximately $700 million. All other full year product guidance assumptions remain unchanged. Moving to the P&L. We now forecast adjusted gross margin just above 82% of sales, adjusted R&D investment to be approximately $5.8 billion, adjusted SG&A expense to be approximately $9.9 billion, and adjusted operating margin of approximately 48% of sales. This P&L guidance includes approximately $600 million in expense synergies for the partial year in 2020. We remain on track to deliver greater than $2 billion in expense synergies by 2022. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2 billion, which includes the cost of financing the Allergan transaction. We now model a non-GAAP tax rate of just above 11% for the newly combined company. Finally, we now expect our full year average share count to approach 1.7 billion shares, including the equity issue to finance the Allergan acquisition. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate adjusted revenue of approximately $12.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on reported sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of just above 48% of sales. We model a non-GAAP tax rate of 11.6%, and we expect the average share count to approach 1.8 billion shares. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.73 and $2.77, excluding approximately $1.59 of known intangible amortization and specified items. AbbVie remains well positioned to execute on our capital allocation priorities, including rapidly paying down debt, supporting a strong and growing dividend, and pursuing additional innovative mid to late-stage pipeline assets. We generated $6.9 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of the year. And our cash balance at the end of June was $6 billion. We are on track to pay down $15 billion to $18 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021, of which nearly $7 billion has already been repaid. We expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. In closing, AbbVie's performance and financial condition remain strong. We are very pleased with the momentum of the business heading into the second half of 2020. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Rob. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.\nRandall Stanicky: Great. Thanks guys. I just have two one for Rick and one for Rob. Rick, a bigger-picture question a huge part of the AbbVie story is\u2026\nLiz Shea: Randall, sorry to interrupt. We can't hear you very well. Is there any way you can turn up your mic or speak up?\nRandall Stanicky: Great. Is that better?\nLiz Shea: Quiet clear. Yes.\nRick Gonzalez: It's okay.\nRandall Stanicky: Great. Rick I wanted to ask a big part of the AbbVie story is growth on the other side of HUMIRA in 2023. There's still some trepidation with -- from investors in getting comfortable with the step-down. What would you say to those investors to get people comfortable that there's a growth story on the other side of HUMIRA? And what do you need to do specifically between now and then strategically to position the business for that?\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Randall, did you have a second question? Or is that\u2026\nRandall Stanicky: Yes. The second question I'll ask it upfront for Rob. Just if you could help us understand the steady state the run rate for R&D. I think you said $5.8 billion for this year that will go higher on an annualized basis. But you're also pulling $1 billion of R&D synergies out of that as well.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. I'll cover your first question, Randall, and then Rob can jump in and talk through the R&D funding question that you had. So, look, I think it's a great question. It is one that obviously the vast majority of investors are interested in. We have described I think to investors the rationale of why we were excited about doing the Allergan transaction. It obviously gives us a tremendous amount of ability to be able to manage our way through the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. of HUMIRA. It provides us with two more major growth franchises for the company to help drive growth. And it allows us to continue to invest aggressively both in internal R&D as well as external. And so I think it provides the framework to allow us to continue to perform, as we have performed over the last number of years. I mean, clearly, we have -- we certainly have a track record of showing that we can grow this business and we can build on this business. We've demonstrated that since 2013 when we spun out. So what makes me excited and what makes me comfortable that I can ultimately grow the business through the LOE? I think it starts with, look, we have six, yes, six major growth assets in our business today, if you step back and you look at them, six medicines that have tremendous opportunity to be able to grow: SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA, VRAYLAR, UBRELVY. We'll probably have atogepant here in the not-too-distant future. So we'll have a seventh asset all in markets that have a significant opportunity to be able to grow. When I look at our R&D productivity both in the indication expansion area as well as new assets, and I'll talk about that here in a second, I'm very comfortable with our ability to be able to continue to drive the pipeline. When you look at the projections that we made for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI as an example, when we made those projections a year or two ago, those peak projections for 2025, we based those projections on the fact that those assets had to achieve roughly high single-digit market share positions. As we mentioned right now if you look at SKYRIZI, it's achieving in-play share of 30%. RINVOQ has really stood up and rapidly started to capture share. It's at 15% and growing at a very aggressive clip. I would predict that it will quickly become the in-play market leader above HUMIRA here in the not-too-distant future. But they're already significantly above what those estimates were. The longer you stay at in-play shares that look like that obviously the greater you're going to exceed that. If you get to 20% instead of high single-digits, obviously, the revenue will be approximately two times what we had originally projected. So that gives me a high level of comfort. When I look at VENCLEXTA as an example there's still a significant opportunity to grow there. If we get an indication expansion both broadening AML as well as the t(11;14) in multiple myeloma those are two significant opportunities that we'll continue to be able to drive growth. IMBRUVICA still has significant opportunity to be able to drive growth. When I look at VRAYLAR as an example, that's a very interesting asset, has a great profile in that market, the drug does. It's obviously growing significantly. I mean it's been growing now at the rate of about 80% to 90% year-over-year. There's still plenty of room to grow in bipolar and schizophrenia. And if one of those two Phase III studies plays out effectively, MDD will be a very large additional indication which will allow us to be able to drive significant growth there. And then there's the migraine franchise. I think migraine is something that's underappreciated. If you look at the penetration right now of oral agents in the acute area, it's running about 12% to 14% of total scripts. So, obviously, there's a significant opportunity to be able to continue to expand that market. We think we have the asset to be able to do that. And obviously, we think we have the promotional ability to do it. So, I think we have the tools right now to be able to drive significant growth through the LOE. On the other side of the LOE, obviously, our pipeline will continue to play out with the additional indications. You're starting to see assets like our TNF steroid. Of all I think the Genmab collaboration is an important collaboration to continue to build out. Our hem/onc can potentially sell two more platforms. And so there's a lot of exciting opportunities. So, I feel very confident in one how the business is running now despite all of the disruption associated with COVID. But I look at the part of the business that we control directly I feel very good about how the business is running. And so I believe we will navigate our way through it. And I think as we get a little closer investors will gain an even greater appreciation of that. \nRob Michael: So, Randall this is Rob. On your question on R&D, so if you think through the partial year synergies the $600 million, about $400 million of that comes from R&D. And by 2022, about 50% of the greater than $2 billion in synergies will come from R&D. So, while I would expect the expenses to annualize obviously with the partial year close we'll also see those synergies ramp up. So, the best way to think about it is a steady-state R&D level in the $6 billion range.\nRandall Stanicky: Great. Thanks.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Randall. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.\nNavin Jacob: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to expand on some of the opportunities that Rick had just mentioned.\nLiz Shea:   Again Navin, can you speak up a little bit? \nRick Gonzalez: Well, let's see if we can turn our end up.\nNavin Jacob: Sure. So, is this okay? Can you hear me okay? \nRick Gonzalez: That's better.\nLiz Shea: Better. Thank you. \nNavin Jacob: Okay. I will yell. So, with regard to--\nRick Gonzalez: We turned our end up. So, you don't need to yell.\nNavin Jacob: All right. Fair enough. With regards to the VENCLEXTA opportunity in multiple myeloma the CANOVA trial wondering if you could give us an update there and how large could that potential opportunity be. Obviously, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma is pretty competitive. So, just wondering what sort of -- how we should be thinking about that where that excitement is coming from. And then if you could remind us also about your subcutaneous version -- pump version of DUOPA that's supposed to read out in the first half of 2021. How should we be thinking about that opportunity? Could that be a blockbuster opportunity? \nMichael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take those. With respect to VENCLEXTA we see very real potential in the t(11;14) multiple myeloma population. If we look across our trials early phase trials and then some set analyses of later phase trials where we have data from t(11;14), we see very consistent responses. We see high response rates and we see long progression-free survival in the t(11;14) population. And that makes sense because that t(11;14) population has a transformed cell that has a B-cell-like phenotype and it's BCL-2 high. So, it would be expected to be uniquely sensitive to VENCLEXTA and to BCL-2 inhibition. So, we have the Phase III study well underway now. It's an event-driven trial. But we would hope to have data in the near future in 2021. And that study is designed to confirm those earlier observations. In terms of how large an opportunity it can be, the t(11;14) population is about 20% of multiple myeloma. And multiple myeloma is a big indication. So, 20% of that is a lot. Now, as you mentioned it's becoming a competitive space. But one of the advantages of having a biomarker-driven therapy is that we can identify and physicians can identify in practice what patients are likely to respond to VENCLEXTA. So, we'll know what a VENCLEXTA patient looks like. And we think that will be a real opportunity and a real advantage. So, we're very optimistic about that aspect of the program and we think it represents an important additional role for VENCLEXTA. With respect to 951, that is a program that's designed to deliver DUOPA-like efficacy through a subcutaneous insulin pump-like device. And so to do that we had to develop two novel prodrugs. These are NMEs that are rapidly converted to the active agents in circulation. And they allow delivery of levodopa and carbidopa ultimately through this insulin pump-like device that you just can't do with the parent compounds because of their physical properties and chemical limitations and local tolerability limitations. So, it really does represent a real breakthrough. What we know about the efficacy of DUOPA is that it is very, very strong. It really is transformational. But it takes a lot to get that efficacy. Patients have to have a gastric tube placed to then thread it down into the small bowel. They have to maintain that. So, this is a much more patient-accessible patient-friendly if you will way to deliver the same sort of efficacy. And so we think that has a potential to really expand the number of patients who would be willing to consider a therapy such as 951 and it's a big market. If you look at DUOPA despite all the limitations, it's doing about $0.5 billion in sales. If you look at deep brain stimulation, there's also considerable use. In aggregate, this market today is well over $1 billion, probably $1.5 billion. And not all patients who would qualify by their patient profile are willing to undergo these therapies. So, we think that 951 can be a very real opportunity and can be quite substantial.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Navin. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. \nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. So, just two for me. The first can you just elaborate a little bit more about how you're thinking about the size of the opportunity for RINVOQ in atopic derm now that we have the Phase III? I guess just a little bit more just how you see this fitting into the treatment paradigm. And then my second question was on the 2020 guidance. If I back out the $0.70 of Allergan accretion, it seems like the base AbbVie numbers are unchanged despite what looked like very, very strong results in the first half of the year. So, just help me understand a little bit the dynamics that are happening with that kind of underlying AbbVie set of assumptions. Thanks so much.\nMichael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take the first one and then I'll hand it over to Rick for the second one. With respect to atopic dermatitis, we're very pleased with the results that we demonstrated across the Phase 3 trials. They actually exceeded our expectations based on the Phase 2b results. And those 2b results were very strong and had earned us a breakthrough therapy designation. And we're pleased not only with the efficacy, but also with the safety profile. We've said for quite some time that one needs to look at the safety of a drug in the intended population. Because things like background therapies, risk factors in the population can have a substantial influence on what that profile looks like not only for the active agent, but for the comparator or for placebo. And if you look at the profile in the AD studies, it looks very favorable to our eye. And these were substantial studies and a substantial program overall. This wasn't a quick study to get an indication expansion. We ran a Phase 3 program for atopic dermatitis that could standalone for an additional submission. So we think that very strong data package will be a real advantage when we bring this indication to market. If you look at the size of the market overall, I think, it's been underappreciated for years. Now that's changing now. There are a large number of patients who would be eligible for systemic therapy. Obviously, dupilumab is off to a good start over the past several years in that indication. But if you look at their efficacy only about half of patients achieve an adequate response if you consider that adequate response in EASI 75. And so in our study we drove very good numbers there higher than that roughly 50% albeit there through cross-trial comparisons. So we think that there is a real opportunity for a high-efficacy agent in this space. And so it really can play on both ends of the spectrum. Patients who don't achieve an adequate response with earlier therapies this is an obvious choice. But with the efficacy and the safety profile that we've observed, we see no reason why it wouldn't be used upfront as well. And of course, we'll have head-to-head data against dupilumab later on this year as we said in our prepared remarks. \nRob Michael: So Chris, this is Rob. I'll take your question on guidance. So if you take that $0.70 of accretion and you back-off the midpoint of $10.40 it gives you a standalone of $9.70 EPS, which is $0.04 higher than our previous guidance. And it's really driven by the sales changes that we've made today. So for U.S. HUMIRA we took that up 1%, which equals about $150 million because we're seeing less impact of COVID on continuing patients. HUMIRA OUS we've taken up $100 million. We're seeing less erosion than we initially had planned. On RINVOQ that's up $100 million as well really driven by the rapid in-play share that we're seeing. And that's partially offset by MAVYRET as we've seen the market really decline during COVID. But net-net revenue is up about $150 million EPS up $0.04 versus our previous guidance for stand-alone AbbVie. \nRick Gonzalez: And the only thing I'd add on that is obviously we were more favorable on base AbbVie in the quarter than the $0.04. But there's still uncertainty as it relates to COVID. And so we're keeping some coverage there to see how things play out in the third quarter. \nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. \nSteve Scala: Thank you. First congratulations on delivering ahead of expectations in the midst of a major integration, new launches and a global pandemic. It's really impressive. Rick you stated that the impact of the pandemic was less than expected. That certainly hasn't been the case at other companies. You also said that you're seeing recovery in the aesthetics portfolio, which sounds as though it snapped back faster than the legacy AbbVie. So I'm just curious to what do you attribute these dynamics? And do you expect the second half of the year to look more like the first half or more like May and June relative to patient volumes, clinic traffic and so forth? And then secondly, you stated that you expect margin improvement over the next few years. Could you provide some parameters around that expectation? Thank you. \nRick Gonzalez: Okay. So this is Rick. I'll take the first one. Your observation is correct. So I think the way to think about it is that both in the second quarter many of the assets didn't drop as far as we expected. That was part of the favorability. I'd say that was particularly, the case in a number of areas in the legacy AbbVie portfolio associated with the business. On the aesthetics it is pretty much the way you're describing it. What we saw happening in the aesthetics business and to a very similar extent to BOTOX Therapeutic is that we saw a rapid drop in the case of aesthetics as those practices virtually closed. I'd say almost all if not all of the practices had closed. So aesthetic revenues dropped significantly for a period of time in that mid-April time frame. As we started to see geographies remove the shelter-in-place orders around the U.S., we saw the aesthetics practices quickly put in place safety measures to be able to allow patients to come back into their offices. And I'd say the vast majority of those practices ramped back up and went back into doing procedures fairly quickly. As we approached that mid-May time frame we actually saw -- let's take BOTOX as an example. And BOTOX would be the leading indicator because it's the procedure -- BOTOX Cosmetic it is the procedure that people would go to first. It ramped back up went well over 100% of pre-COVID levels to around 120% 125%. And then it and that was obviously pent-up demand that was coming back into the channel so patients returned quickly. And then as that pent-up demand started to burn off as we got through June, you started to see it drop back down. And now it's settled in sort of in the mid-90s right now. We think it will reach -- it will stabilize back up over the course of third quarter back close to pre-COVID levels and then start growing again. And so I can tell you I'm extremely pleased with how both aesthetics and BOTOX Therapeutics had returned. I think it's a testament of those brands and those patients. As far as the assumptions we made in the second half obviously, we're assuming the second half performs a lot better than the first half. We're not assuming any kind of a broad-based shelter in-place activity. And we'll continue to see more and more patients come back into physicians offices. On the AbbVie side of the business, we are monitoring those patients by individual practice. It's appropriate for our particular businesses. And I'd say for the most part they are returning close to pre-COVID levels. They do vary a little bit by specialty. As an example, rheum and GI have come back faster than medical derm has. But medical derm has returned as well to some extent and we're continuing to see it return. Oncology practices in certain conditions we've seen -- we saw some tailing off of CLL treatment in the second quarter. That's now returning back to normalized levels. So I think the second half will, obviously, be much better than the first half. And I think we should return to normalized levels as we proceed through the second half of the year. Rob anything you want to add on that?\nRob Michael: I can answer the question on margin. Steve this is Rob. On operating margin, I think when you think about we have a partial year of synergies and a top-line that's been pressured by COVID we have a 48% operating margin profile. As you think about 2021 and 2022, we're going to obviously run -- we're going to ramp those synergies as well as we'll see top-line growth and where you'd see the P&L leverage that we've demonstrated in past year. So, I would expect to see our operating margin expand in 2021 and 2022. With 2023 with the U.S. HUMIRA event, obviously, we would see operating margin pulled back. But I would expect it to be in the 45% range, which still puts us top tier in the industry.\nSteve Scala: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. Hi, Rick congratulations. Very helpful to get the guidance. Could you talk a little bit about atogepant? Particularly what's the size of the addressable opportunity for the full portfolio of oral migraine medicines? And perhaps how much of an issue is the constipation data that you've seen? And then Rick look there's a massive economic disruption going on. And I'd be interested in your commentary about how consumers and payers are reacting to that disruption and how that's factored into your guidance. Are we seeing switches from IV to oral from generic to brand? How is that playing out in your experience and observation? Thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: All right. Great. So maybe we'll have Mike talk a little bit about the profile of the drug. And what I'd say is I think we probably want to come back at a later date once we've had a little better opportunity to analyze the chronic migraine market. And it's going to depend to a great extent on the profile of the drug obviously. But it's a very large market a very significant market. And -- but Mike maybe if you want to talk a little bit about constipation and then I'll come back and talk about the payer dynamics.\nMichael Severino: Sure. I'll talk about atogepant. We're very pleased with the data we've seen. And of course this fits into an important part of our migraine portfolio with UBRELVY for acute migraine now with atogepant with two data readouts in episodic migraine and an ongoing program in chronic migraine. And, of course, there's BOTOX Therapeutic in chronic migraine, so it really rounds out our portfolio. The efficacy that we saw was very strong. As we said in our prepared remarks, we hit the primary and all secondary\u2019s across the two upper doses and the primary and four out of six secondary\u2019s for the lowest dose studied. So that is an efficacy profile that I think exceeded our expectations going into the study. With respect to the safety, our view of the safety profile looks very favorable. The constipation that was observed in the overwhelming majority of cases was mild or moderate. It didn't limit treatment. So patients stayed on treatment. They could be managed easily with interventions like stool softeners or fiber supplementation. So we don't see it as something that is limiting particularly in light of the very strong efficacy that we have demonstrated. And the only other point I'd add is that we have a good understanding of it and it's on target. So it comes with the efficacy you get a very strong efficacy and you have this manageable tolerability profile that I described.\nRick Gonzalez: Geoff on the -- on your second question, you probably recall back on our first quarter guidance when we outlined that we had built in to our forecast for the remainder of the year some impact for some channels shifting that we thought could occur due to the high unemployment. And essentially we haven't seen much of that at all. In fact I would tell you, we haven't seen any of it to any material effect right now. And one of the things that we do to watch that carefully is our PAP program. We've been advertising extensively to consumers to make sure that they know if they lost their insurance or they lost their jobs and they don't have insurance coverage and they can't afford their AbbVie medicines to come to us. We have a very extensive patient assistance program. And we're not seeing any significant increase in those requests. It could be because of the furloughs. We're not 100% sure yet. And potentially we could see some increase as we go further here depending upon what happens with stimulus programs going forward. We have still maintained some level of coverage in our forecast that we're providing now. So we believe we have sufficient coverage to deal with it and we'll just have to see how it sorts itself out.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Geoffrey. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho.\nVamil Divan: Hi, great. Thank you so much for taking my question. Maybe just to continue on the migraine question. You mentioned UBRELVY and the potential there. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about the net pricing that you're thinking about in that space? I guess, maybe relative to the injectable antibodies that are helpful for prevention already there's only the two players it sounds like here between you and Biohaven -- or on the injectable side. So just trying to get a sense how you see this pricing dynamic play out? We're getting a lot of questions on that front. And then maybe for Rick I'm just curious around some of the executive orders we've seen on the drug pricing side for the administration. I don't know if I may have missed your comments earlier but just curious if you have any additional thoughts about what you heard from some of your peers on this issue this week on their calls. But every company, obviously, has a different product mix and maybe some different perspectives. So curious what your views are especially as it relates to the rebate rule order? Thanks so much.\nRick Gonzalez: Right. Okay. I'll cover both of those questions. So on migraine, I mean obviously we don't publicly talk about our net price. We have fairly significant managed care coverage on the asset already. I think it's about 70%. And obviously it had to be priced in a way that was appropriate to be able to get that level of coverage. This is a market where market expansion is important. As I said, I think if you look at the penetration right now of acute migraine products against the -- or at least the oral CGRPs against the total migraine acute market, it's about 12% penetrated right now. So there's a significant opportunity to be able to grow that market. And it gives you some idea of the magnitude of this market. So you certainly want it to be in a position where it can have access to be able to allow patients, to be able to use the products. These products certainly have demonstrated that they have strong demand from patients to be able to provide them appropriate levels of relief. And so I would just tell you that that's an important aspect of the overall strategy here is to be able to grow this market over the long term. On the executive orders as you have probably seen they're pretty high level at this point and they provide some high-level direction. So I think, until we see them, sort of, start to sort out I think it's a little difficult to give you a lot of specificity around what they look like. Now I will say, if I look at them in the backdrop of AbbVie's business, I would say, I don't think they will have a significant impact on our business. If you look at Part B as an example, we have a very small Part B business. I think it's around 2% to 3%. 3%, I guess, is the right number now. So it's a very insignificant part. If you look at the importation bill or executive order, it's very similar to what's already been given out to the states. And it excludes biologics, which obviously is an important part of our business. If you look at the third one, it's insulin and EpiPen. We're not in that business. And then the rebate rule. Certainly, as we look at rebates, we're absolutely supportive of patients being able to get the benefit of the discount associated with the rebate or discount. As we've said many times before for us whether it's a rebate or a discount is not very material to us. What I would say is when I look at that executive order it does say that you have to be able to implement it without increasing premiums. And everything I know about how rebates are redistributed, I would say that I think that that will be difficult to do. So I don't know how that will ultimately play out. So -- I mean at a high-level look at what we think about them right now. But I think right now, I wouldn't anticipate that they have a significant risk associated with AbbVie. \nLiz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Risinger: Great. Thanks so much. And congrats on all of the encouraging updates. So first Rick, could you please discuss maybe in a little bit more detail the most significant revenue synergy opportunities you see as a result of the combination with Allergan? I know that the combined company can do more with certain franchise, but if you could put some finer points on that that would be very helpful. Then second with respect to next year's readouts, AbbVie has a very large pipeline of Phase 2 candidates with proof-of-concept readouts in 2021. But could you point us to the ones that have the biggest commercial potential? So if there is validation in 2021 what are the biggest product opportunities that we should be paying attention to? And then one little tidbit. The UBRELVY number was $22 million in the quarter. That was strong. How much stocking was in there? Thank you. \nRick Gonzalez: Okay. So I'll cover the first one and then I'll have Mike cover the second and Rob can cover the third. So if I look at the business overall I said that the integration has gone very seamlessly. And I think that's a tribute to all the planning that we did. We had some extra time to be able to do it and I think that benefited us. And so I think the two organizations have come together in a way that's been quite good. Now I would say, I think, the places where we have an opportunity to be able to provide some synergy and benefit certainly when you look at our therapeutic businesses, when you look at our -- many of the tactical kinds of execution techniques that we use in the marketplace I think many of those are applicable to the Allergan therapeutic portfolio. Certainly when you look at managed care that's an area that we have demonstrated that we're quite skilled at being able to effectively manage our way through that. And then the third area, I'd say is if I look at aesthetics, aesthetics is a very attractive market. It has a significant opportunity to be able to grow that market, which I mean by bringing in more people into the market more quickly. You can do that several different ways. Obviously, some of it is driven by promotional activity. I'd say Allergan is very skilled from a social media standpoint. And I think that's an area that's probably been underfunded. Historically, it's an area that we have a high level of interest in funding to a greater extent. And we obviously have the financial wherewithal to be able to do that. The second thing is being able to bring more new innovation more rapidly into that market. And I think that's an area that we'll also be able to provide a benefit both in the way we operate R&D and the ability to be able to rapidly innovate. I think that will be a benefit to the overall business. And I think we have an opportunity to be able to accelerate the growth of that business in a meaningful way over time. And it's a market I like a lot. I think both based on demographics the cash pay aspects of it and how it responds to appropriate innovation in that market. So that's an area that I think over time you can expect us to continue to make sure that we're doing what we know how to do to be able to ultimately grow that market over the long term. Those would be some of the things I'd tell you at a high level. Mike? \nMichael Severino: I'll take the second question. So we do as you point out have a number of data readouts from Phase 2 studies or other proof-of-concept studies in 2021 and also in the following years in 2022 and beyond. And a number of these are very large opportunities. I'd point to our oncology programs. We have a number of immuno-oncology programs that would be large opportunities, if they hit. Our GARP program I think is a very good example of that. Our bispecifics I think are a very good example of that. We just brought in through the Genmab collaboration epcoritamab, which is a large opportunity. Obviously, that's post proof of concept. But there are two additional molecules there that are just a little bit earlier in development that could be large opportunities. We have bispecifics in BCMA more than one program that could be very large opportunities, if they were in fact best-in-class. And we think they have the potential to be best-in-class. The last thing, I would point to in oncology is our novel so targeted ADC technology with ABBV-155 being in the lead in non-small cell lung cancer. That is a BCL-XL warhead targeted by a B7-H3 antibody. If that were to hit and we'd see those data next year that would be a large opportunity. Obviously in immunology we're advancing our TNF steroid program. But I think those are data that we've already reported out. And then the last thing that, I would mention is in our neuroscience portfolio. Obviously, Alzheimer's disease if those programs were to hit they would be a very large opportunity given the enormous unmet medical need. Now obviously, in Alzheimer's disease it's higher risk higher reward. But if we got favorable data it would be a very, very meaningful opportunity. \nRob Michael: And David, this is Rob. On UBRELVY, if you look at just the full quarter revenue of $27 million it really follows the prescription growth on a sequential basis. So there's really a negligible stocking impact. And we'd expect to see continued sequential growth for that product.\nLiz Shea: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler.\nChris Raymond: Thanks. Just back to atogepant in sort of a competitive setup. So Rick I heard your comments on how this is underappreciated. We've done some checks to see, if it indicated that that's the case. And I know this \u2013 it's not approved yet. So pardon if you don't mind the commercial question here. But there's been some chatter out there especially from some Biohaven bulls that placebo-adjusted migraine days maybe don't matter as much as absolute days. And so just maybe you're in the field with UBRELVY from a rep-to-doc dialogue perspective, what do you guys see as the most important attribute especially as you'll be positioning this in the prevention setting versus subcus and the other oral therapies \u2013 or the other oral therapy that happens to be a dissolving tablet?\nMichael Severino: Well, this is Mike. I'll take the first part of that and then Rick may want to add. With respect to efficacy, the most important attribute is the placebo-adjusted migraine days. If one were solely to look at the total days one could conclude that placebo is in fact a good therapy for these patients, because we see reductions. And so you have to account for that. And there are differences from study-to-study based on design, population enrolled and what that placebo difference is. So it absolutely has to be taken into account. And when you look at our placebo-adjusted results, they're very strong. They range between 1.2 and 1.7 days, which in this disease area is a very meaningful response rate. And it's higher than what has been reported with other oral agents obviously with the caveat of a cross-trial comparison. So we think that on the most important efficacy parameter we performed very, very well. And of course we've hit all the secondaries across two of those three doses as I've described. And as we get the data out into the public domain you'll get more color on that.\nRick Gonzalez: Yeah. I would just reiterate what Mike says. I mean, physicians are well skilled in understanding what placebo rates are. And I just don't even think, it's appropriate not to represent a product's efficacy without looking at the placebo rate. So, I mean, I think that will be the way doctors look at it. And I think that is the way the products will be marketed. And certainly, if I had a lower rate, I may have an interest in that. But at the end of the day I think that is the appropriate way to look at it.\nChris Raymond: Thank you.\nLiz Shea : Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. \nTim Anderson: Hi. Thank you. A few pipeline questions please. On the TNF steroid conjugate some KOLs have a mixed view of that approach. For those that are skeptical what's the most common reason that you hear? Second question on VRAYLAR, what are your odds of regulatory success in depression? Even just qualitatively is this a high-risk, medium-risk or low-risk endeavor? And then can you clarify why your Genmab CD3xCD20 would be best-in-class?\nMichael Severino: Okay. I'll take those questions. With respect to the TNF steroid conjugate what I would say is, it's important to keep in mind that this is an early phase trial and this was intended to be a proof-of-concept trial. One can't do a fully powered head-to-head against an active competitor like HUMIRA in Phase I or Phase II because that typically requires or always requires essentially a large Phase III study. Head-to-head studies are often amongst the largest studies in a Phase III program. So what we were looking for was evidence to support the profile that I described which is that we had a high probability of success in those trials downstream. If folks have a mixed view then what we hear is they'd like to see those later data. And what I would say is, we're well on the path to generating them. We're pleased with the results that we've seen and we think it's a very promising platform and we're going to be advancing into larger-scale trials and people will get the data that they're looking for. With respect to VRAYLAR in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, I think the question was how would I characterize the risk there? There already is one positive study in hand. And so of the two studies that are underway, we would need one additional study to read out positive to support the indication. I think that historically this has been a challenging indication. But I think the -- both the rationale and the data from earlier studies in the VRAYLAR program are strong. So I would probably put it in the moderate probability range. We didn't build it into our model. Our success with VRAYLAR was not dependent on it. But we think it represents a very attractive upside opportunity if in fact it hits. And with respect to why Genmab CD3xCD20 has the potential to be best-in-class? I would point to two things. One is the efficacy data reported from the early phase trials, particularly in DLBCL, which is a very difficult-to-treat tumor type, puts it at the higher end of efficacy. And the safety profile has been very favorable in terms of what's been observed to date both with respect to cytokine release syndrome and the lack of occurrence in the early phase trials of higher-grade CRS and also with respect to the neurological symptoms that can accompany this class of therapy. So it seems to have threaded that sweet spot between achieving very strong efficacy with a good safety profile. It also has subcu administration with its existing formulation. Others are working towards that. But Genmab already has the data in hand. And the dosing schedule fits very well into the regimens that will be used in the diseases that we'd study particularly DLBCL and follicular lymphoma. So we see aggregate of that that we think gives it a very, very strong profile. \nTim Anderson: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, we have time for one final question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the Allergan integration. You mentioned in your comments that RINVOQ uptakes accelerating here was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on that. Is that being driven by COVID and maybe teleprescribing having an advantage over some of the injectables? And if so, do you see that as being a durable change here as we come out of the pandemic? And then the second one I had was just on VENCLEXTA. I noticed you're running some trials for solid tumors. Maybe just remind us of the rationale here behind that approach. And how optimistic are you there as you move into later stages? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Thanks. I'll take the first question. Mike can cover the second one. So RINVOQ clearly has started to ramp in a fairly significant way. I think it's associated with two things. One is any time you see a pro -- it's about eight months into its launch, you typically start to see that inflection point on successful products. As you go out and you present the data to physicians and start to educate physicians and they start to get some use, you tend to see that inflection point start to happen around six months. So I think it's the natural inflection point that we would have expected if the product was being successfully accepted into the marketplace the way we hoped as a high-efficacy agent. I think there is some benefit that we're seeing during the COVID crisis that it is an oral, so it's a little easier to prescribe than an injectable might be. So we're probably getting some collateral benefit associated with that. But I don't think that's the fundamental benefit that we're seeing. Mike?\nMichael Severino: Right. So I'll take the question with respect to VENCLEXTA in solid tumors. I think there's two different lines of evidence. In breast cancer, there are -- there is an investigator-sponsored study that showed promise in breast cancer. And so there's a follow-up study there to confirm that. And if that were confirmed, it would be obviously a substantial opportunity given the unmet need there. And then there are other solid tumors such as both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer where there's preclinical rationale that warrants exploration. And so I would characterize the solid tumor program as higher risk but high reward worthy of exploration. The solid tumor program in VENCLEXTA has not been baked into our thinking and isn't necessary for any of the success that we have talked about with the molecule. But if something were to hit there represents very nice upside. And I think there's enough rationale to warrant the exploration. \nLiz Shea: Okay. Thank you. So that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Rob Michael",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Starting with second quarter results, we delivered top and bottom line performance ahead of expectations. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 above our guidance midpoint by $0.21. This includes $0.10 of stronger performance from legacy AbbVie and $0.11 of accretion from Allergan. Total net revenues were $10.4 billion, including $2 billion in sales contribution from the Allergan portfolio. Legacy AbbVie was approximately $300 million ahead of our stand-alone sales guidance driven by RINVOQ, SKYRIZI and HUMIRA. COVID-related inventory stocking for the first quarter largely reversed as expected. U.S. HUMIRA sales were approximately $4 billion ahead of expectations due to the lower impact from COVID on continuing patient prescriptions. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below 0.5 month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were $863 million, down 17.4% operationally reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and ahead of our expectations. SKYRIZI global sales were $330 million with continued strong U.S. in-play market share. We also continue to see robust demand for RINVOQ with sales of $149 million in the quarter and a rapid increase in U.S. in-play market share. Hematologic oncology global sales were nearly $1.6 billion, up 25.8% on an operational basis with continued strong performance of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were approximately $1.3 billion, up 17.2% driven by continued strong performance in CLL. VENCLEXTA revenues were $303 million with strong demand across all approved indications. Global MAVYRET sales were $376 million down 51.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have declined during the COVID pandemic. Allergan Aesthetics contributed sales of $481 million in the quarter. BOTOX Cosmetic with sales of $226 million and JUV\u00c9DERM with sales of $113 million are both seeing a faster-than-expected recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience global revenues were $734 million. These results were led by BOTOX Therapeutic VRAYLAR and UBRELVY with combined sales of more than $500 million. We also saw a significant contribution from our eye care business which had global sales of $417 million. Turning now to the P&L profile for the second quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 82.8% of sales adjusted, R&D investment was 12.8% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 47% of sales including a negative impact of 70 basis points due to the reversal of COVID-related inventory stocking from the first quarter. Adjusted net interest expense was $484 million and the adjusted tax rate was 11.4%. Today we are issuing combined company guidance for the first time. As Rick previously discussed, we are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID pandemic and have factored the latest trends into our updated forecast. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $10.35 and $10.45 including $0.70 of accretion from the Allergan transaction. which represents an annualized contribution of 11%. Excluded from this guidance is $6.23 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue of approximately $45.5 billion. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 30 basis point unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth. Included in this revenue guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect U.S. HUMIRA sales growth of approximately 8%. We now expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $3.5 billion. For RINVOQ we now expect global revenues of approximately $600 million. For global HCV, we now expect sales of approximately $2.1 billion as treatments remain below pre-COVID levels. For aesthetics, we expect global sales of approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately $1 billion from BOTOX Cosmetic and approximately $650 million from JUV\u00c9DERM. For neuroscience, we expect global sales of approximately $3.5 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion from BOTOX Therapeutic and approximately $950 million from VRAYLAR. For eye care, we expect global revenues of approximately $2.1 billion, including approximately $700 million from RESTASIS, which assumes no generic competition in 2020. And for women's health, we expect global revenues of approximately $700 million. All other full year product guidance assumptions remain unchanged. Moving to the P&L. We now forecast adjusted gross margin just above 82% of sales, adjusted R&D investment to be approximately $5.8 billion, adjusted SG&A expense to be approximately $9.9 billion, and adjusted operating margin of approximately 48% of sales. This P&L guidance includes approximately $600 million in expense synergies for the partial year in 2020. We remain on track to deliver greater than $2 billion in expense synergies by 2022. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2 billion, which includes the cost of financing the Allergan transaction. We now model a non-GAAP tax rate of just above 11% for the newly combined company. Finally, we now expect our full year average share count to approach 1.7 billion shares, including the equity issue to finance the Allergan acquisition. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate adjusted revenue of approximately $12.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on reported sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of just above 48% of sales. We model a non-GAAP tax rate of 11.6%, and we expect the average share count to approach 1.8 billion shares. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.73 and $2.77, excluding approximately $1.59 of known intangible amortization and specified items. AbbVie remains well positioned to execute on our capital allocation priorities, including rapidly paying down debt, supporting a strong and growing dividend, and pursuing additional innovative mid to late-stage pipeline assets. We generated $6.9 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of the year. And our cash balance at the end of June was $6 billion. We are on track to pay down $15 billion to $18 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021, of which nearly $7 billion has already been repaid. We expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. In closing, AbbVie's performance and financial condition remain strong. We are very pleased with the momentum of the business heading into the second half of 2020. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. So, Randall this is Rob. On your question on R&D, so if you think through the partial year synergies the $600 million, about $400 million of that comes from R&D. And by 2022, about 50% of the greater than $2 billion in synergies will come from R&D. So, while I would expect the expenses to annualize obviously with the partial year close we'll also see those synergies ramp up. So, the best way to think about it is a steady-state R&D level in the $6 billion range. So Chris, this is Rob. I'll take your question on guidance. So if you take that $0.70 of accretion and you back-off the midpoint of $10.40 it gives you a standalone of $9.70 EPS, which is $0.04 higher than our previous guidance. And it's really driven by the sales changes that we've made today. So for U.S. HUMIRA we took that up 1%, which equals about $150 million because we're seeing less impact of COVID on continuing patients. HUMIRA OUS we've taken up $100 million. We're seeing less erosion than we initially had planned. On RINVOQ that's up $100 million as well really driven by the rapid in-play share that we're seeing. And that's partially offset by MAVYRET as we've seen the market really decline during COVID. But net-net revenue is up about $150 million EPS up $0.04 versus our previous guidance for stand-alone AbbVie. I can answer the question on margin. Steve this is Rob. On operating margin, I think when you think about we have a partial year of synergies and a top-line that's been pressured by COVID we have a 48% operating margin profile. As you think about 2021 and 2022, we're going to obviously run -- we're going to ramp those synergies as well as we'll see top-line growth and where you'd see the P&L leverage that we've demonstrated in past year. So, I would expect to see our operating margin expand in 2021 and 2022. With 2023 with the U.S. HUMIRA event, obviously, we would see operating margin pulled back. But I would expect it to be in the 45% range, which still puts us top tier in the industry. And David, this is Rob. On UBRELVY, if you look at just the full quarter revenue of $27 million it really follows the prescription growth on a sequential basis. So there's really a negligible stocking impact. And we'd expect to see continued sequential growth for that product."

            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter performance and highlights. And for the first time, I'll provide our 2020 outlook for the newly combined company. Mike will then discuss recent advancements across R&D programs. And Rob, will review the quarter and our updated guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions. I'd like to start off by recognizing all of our employees, including those joining AbbVie from Allergan for all of their hard work and dedication during this pandemic. The AbbVie team has been working diligently and carefully, within our facilities and remotely, to ensure that our business continues to operate properly and our patients continue to receive their medicines. Before I speak to the strong financial performance this quarter, I'd like to characterize the state of the recovery of the business from the COVID crisis. Let me start with the legacy AbbVie side of the business, which has demonstrated robust performance leading into the pandemic and has remained resilient. The impact on continuing patients for HUMIRA and new patients for RINVOQ, SKYRIZI and VENCLEXTA, were not as pronounced as we had previously anticipated. While patient flow has not recovered, in most therapeutic segments we're encouraged by the level of stabilization, and the recent positive demand trends. Overall, the legacy AbbVie business continues to perform very well, with stand-alone revenue growth in the second quarter of approximately 8.5% on an operational basis, excluding the negative impact from COVID. On the legacy Allergan side of the business, we saw significant COVID-related impacts on BOTOX Therapeutic and our aesthetics business in the second quarter. Both businesses are seeing a rapid recovery and are now performing near pre-COVID levels. Other key brands, such as, VRAYLAR and UBRELVY were impacted in a manner similar to the AbbVie-based business. And we're pleased with the recent trends and progress. Overall, COVID had a substantial impact on second quarter reported revenues with an estimated net unfavorable impact of more than $900 million. However, by the end of June the total business had recovered to more than 90% of pre-COVID levels. So I'm pleased with the resilience and the rapid recovery across our portfolio. And I'm confident in the continued strong underlying demand and performance of the combined new company. Despite the impact from COVID, we delivered a strong second quarter performance. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 were well above our expectations. The $0.21 beat included $0.11 of net accretion from Allergan, as well as $0.10 of favorable performance versus the midpoint of our stand-alone guidance. Total revenues were $10.4 billion, including approximately $8.4 billion of legacy AbbVie sales significantly above our expectations for the standalone portfolio with continued robust performance in both hem/onc and immunology, despite the impact from COVID. Hem/onc revenues of approximately $1.6 billion were up strong double digits again this quarter. IMBRUVICA sales grew approximately 17% on an operational basis, reflecting continued strong performance in CLL, where we remain the clear market leader. VENCLEXTA sales were up more than 80% on an operational basis with strong growth in CLL and AML. During the quarter, we also announced a strategic collaboration with Genmab to further build our oncology portfolio with a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody. It has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy across B-cell malignancies. Our leading immunology business delivered revenues of more than $5.3 billion, reflecting growth of more than 8.5% on an operational basis. U.S. HUMIRA revenue growth remained strong, up 5% with continued demand from the large installed patient base, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19. International HUMIRA biosimilar dynamics in the quarter were better than our expectations. SKYRIZI continues to perform well and has maintained its leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at more than 30%. As expected, we saw modest delays to new patient starts during the quarter, as a result of the COVID-19 dynamics. However, recent prescription trends and increasing enrollment in our ambassador program two leading indicators demonstrate a strong growth trajectory and support our full year guidance of $1.4 billion. We're also seeing very encouraging trends for RINVOQ, where rheumatology office visits are approaching pre-COVID levels. RINVOQ revenues were up more than 70% on a sequential basis and currently reflect 15% in-play RA patient share, which is now nearly at parity to HUMIRA, the market leader in in-play share and above all other agents in the segment. We're also making excellent progress with our immunology pipeline, which Mike will discuss further momentarily. As I noted during the quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of Allergan creating a stronger and a more diverse AbbVie. The transaction significantly expands and diversifies AbbVie's revenue base and complements our existing leadership positions in immunology and hematological oncology with additional growth franchises in aesthetics and neuroscience. We have growth opportunities in neuroscience with BOTOX Therapeutics, VRAYLAR and UBRELVY. And we have the leading global aesthetics business with flagship brands including BOTOX Cosmetics and JUV\u00c9DERM. I'll start with neuroscience, which had sales of roughly $735 million to AbbVie in the second quarter. VRAYLAR continues to demonstrate rapid growth and is well on its way to surpassing $1 billion in annual revenues. Underlying demand has remained resilient despite the COVID-19 pandemic with strong double-digit growth again this quarter. We see significant room for continued expansion within VRAYLAR's existing indications bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Major depressive disorder or MDD represents another potential large indication with two Phase 3 trials well underway. Also within neuroscience, we now have a portfolio of migraine therapies that have the potential to support long-term growth in a highly attractive and underserved market. Our migraine portfolio is anchored with BOTOX Therapeutic, which had revenues of roughly $300 million to AbbVie in the second quarter. Despite multiple new competitive entrants, BOTOX Therapeutic has largely retained its total treated patient base, a testament to its efficacy, safety and brand recognition. Like many physician-administered products, BOTOX Therapeutics saw a significant impact from COVID-19 in the second quarter with global sales down approximately 20% on a comparable operational basis. However, we're pleased by the recent data trends, which demonstrate a fast recovery and performance is now close to pre-COVID levels. The launch of UBRELVY, the first-to-market in leading oral CGRP for acute migraine is off to an excellent start. Feedback from physicians has been very positive given UBRELVY's efficacy, safety and convenient dosing profile relative to current standards of care. Commercial access for UBRELVY is now at 70%, which along with increased consumer promotion will further support the product's launch trajectory. We're also developing atogepant for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine. We recently disclosed positive top line results from a Phase 3 study in episodic migraine, which will support regulatory submission early next year. As a fourth pillar of growth we now have the world's leading global aesthetics franchise, which generated sales of roughly $480 million to AbbVie in second quarter. As anticipated, we saw a decline in year-over-year comparable operational growth with aesthetics health care providers closed during the initial phase of COVID. It's now been roughly two months since most major geographies have begun to reopen. And we're pleased with the strong recovery trends we're seeing. As of the end of June, the vast majority of our aesthetics accounts have reopened in the U.S. and we're seeing considerable pent-up demand. Current U.S. aesthetic revenues have recovered and are approaching 95% of pre-COVID levels. Outside the U.S., we're also seeing steady recovery trends in China and Western Europe. Current international aesthetics revenues have recovered to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels. Overall, we're very pleased with the momentum we're seeing on our aesthetics franchise. More broadly, we see aesthetics as a durable cash pay business with an opportunity for significant market growth, as well as continued new innovation driving long-term performance. While strategically important, the acquisition of Allergan will also drive strong financial benefits. Integration has been relatively seamless and we're impressed by the caliber of talent that we've welcomed into AbbVie. We remain on track with our synergy target of more than $2 billion in expense rationalization by the third year from transaction closing, which Rob will discuss further in his prepared remarks here momentarily. When you take these synergies into consideration along with the continued P&L leverage from our expected sales growth, we expect further operating margin expansion over the next couple of years. While the COVID crisis remains a fluid situation, our business continues to remain resilient and demonstrate strong underlying growth. Although we continue to carefully watch COVID-related events in the U.S., we're pleased with our recent business trends and the progress we're making towards recovery. And we expect performance will continue to ramp to normalized levels over the course of the second half of 2020. With these current assumptions and based on our recent outperformance of our base business, today we're issuing full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance for our new combined company of $10.35 to $10.45, reflecting growth of 16.3% at the midpoint. This guidance assumes $0.70 of net accretion from the Allergan transaction in 2020, which represents 11% accretion on an annualized basis ahead of our initial projections for the transaction despite the COVID impact that I outlined earlier. Overall, we continue to see good momentum across our total portfolio and across our pipeline. We reported a very strong second quarter performance and remain encouraged by the recent recovery trends, which are faster than we expected. We continue to expect the COVID pandemic will have a transient impact on our business with further recovery continuing through the second half of 2020. With the closing of the Allergan transaction, AbbVie is well-positioned for enhanced long-term growth potential, a growing dividend, rapid debt repayment and strong investment in innovation across our therapeutic categories. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? It's okay. Okay. Randall, did you have a second question? Or is that\u2026 Okay. I'll cover your first question, Randall, and then Rob can jump in and talk through the R&D funding question that you had. So, look, I think it's a great question. It is one that obviously the vast majority of investors are interested in. We have described I think to investors the rationale of why we were excited about doing the Allergan transaction. It obviously gives us a tremendous amount of ability to be able to manage our way through the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. of HUMIRA. It provides us with two more major growth franchises for the company to help drive growth. And it allows us to continue to invest aggressively both in internal R&D as well as external. And so I think it provides the framework to allow us to continue to perform, as we have performed over the last number of years. I mean, clearly, we have -- we certainly have a track record of showing that we can grow this business and we can build on this business. We've demonstrated that since 2013 when we spun out. So what makes me excited and what makes me comfortable that I can ultimately grow the business through the LOE? I think it starts with, look, we have six, yes, six major growth assets in our business today, if you step back and you look at them, six medicines that have tremendous opportunity to be able to grow: SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA, VRAYLAR, UBRELVY. We'll probably have atogepant here in the not-too-distant future. So we'll have a seventh asset all in markets that have a significant opportunity to be able to grow. When I look at our R&D productivity both in the indication expansion area as well as new assets, and I'll talk about that here in a second, I'm very comfortable with our ability to be able to continue to drive the pipeline. When you look at the projections that we made for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI as an example, when we made those projections a year or two ago, those peak projections for 2025, we based those projections on the fact that those assets had to achieve roughly high single-digit market share positions. As we mentioned right now if you look at SKYRIZI, it's achieving in-play share of 30%. RINVOQ has really stood up and rapidly started to capture share. It's at 15% and growing at a very aggressive clip. I would predict that it will quickly become the in-play market leader above HUMIRA here in the not-too-distant future. But they're already significantly above what those estimates were. The longer you stay at in-play shares that look like that obviously the greater you're going to exceed that. If you get to 20% instead of high single-digits, obviously, the revenue will be approximately two times what we had originally projected. So that gives me a high level of comfort. When I look at VENCLEXTA as an example there's still a significant opportunity to grow there. If we get an indication expansion both broadening AML as well as the t(11;14) in multiple myeloma those are two significant opportunities that we'll continue to be able to drive growth. IMBRUVICA still has significant opportunity to be able to drive growth. When I look at VRAYLAR as an example, that's a very interesting asset, has a great profile in that market, the drug does. It's obviously growing significantly. I mean it's been growing now at the rate of about 80% to 90% year-over-year. There's still plenty of room to grow in bipolar and schizophrenia. And if one of those two Phase III studies plays out effectively, MDD will be a very large additional indication which will allow us to be able to drive significant growth there. And then there's the migraine franchise. I think migraine is something that's underappreciated. If you look at the penetration right now of oral agents in the acute area, it's running about 12% to 14% of total scripts. So, obviously, there's a significant opportunity to be able to continue to expand that market. We think we have the asset to be able to do that. And obviously, we think we have the promotional ability to do it. So, I think we have the tools right now to be able to drive significant growth through the LOE. On the other side of the LOE, obviously, our pipeline will continue to play out with the additional indications. You're starting to see assets like our TNF steroid. Of all I think the Genmab collaboration is an important collaboration to continue to build out. Our hem/onc can potentially sell two more platforms. And so there's a lot of exciting opportunities. So, I feel very confident in one how the business is running now despite all of the disruption associated with COVID. But I look at the part of the business that we control directly I feel very good about how the business is running. And so I believe we will navigate our way through it. And I think as we get a little closer investors will gain an even greater appreciation of that. Well, let's see if we can turn our end up. That's better. We turned our end up. So, you don't need to yell. And the only thing I'd add on that is obviously we were more favorable on base AbbVie in the quarter than the $0.04. But there's still uncertainty as it relates to COVID. And so we're keeping some coverage there to see how things play out in the third quarter. Okay. So this is Rick. I'll take the first one. Your observation is correct. So I think the way to think about it is that both in the second quarter many of the assets didn't drop as far as we expected. That was part of the favorability. I'd say that was particularly, the case in a number of areas in the legacy AbbVie portfolio associated with the business. On the aesthetics it is pretty much the way you're describing it. What we saw happening in the aesthetics business and to a very similar extent to BOTOX Therapeutic is that we saw a rapid drop in the case of aesthetics as those practices virtually closed. I'd say almost all if not all of the practices had closed. So aesthetic revenues dropped significantly for a period of time in that mid-April time frame. As we started to see geographies remove the shelter-in-place orders around the U.S., we saw the aesthetics practices quickly put in place safety measures to be able to allow patients to come back into their offices. And I'd say the vast majority of those practices ramped back up and went back into doing procedures fairly quickly. As we approached that mid-May time frame we actually saw -- let's take BOTOX as an example. And BOTOX would be the leading indicator because it's the procedure -- BOTOX Cosmetic it is the procedure that people would go to first. It ramped back up went well over 100% of pre-COVID levels to around 120% 125%. And then it and that was obviously pent-up demand that was coming back into the channel so patients returned quickly. And then as that pent-up demand started to burn off as we got through June, you started to see it drop back down. And now it's settled in sort of in the mid-90s right now. We think it will reach -- it will stabilize back up over the course of third quarter back close to pre-COVID levels and then start growing again. And so I can tell you I'm extremely pleased with how both aesthetics and BOTOX Therapeutics had returned. I think it's a testament of those brands and those patients. As far as the assumptions we made in the second half obviously, we're assuming the second half performs a lot better than the first half. We're not assuming any kind of a broad-based shelter in-place activity. And we'll continue to see more and more patients come back into physicians offices. On the AbbVie side of the business, we are monitoring those patients by individual practice. It's appropriate for our particular businesses. And I'd say for the most part they are returning close to pre-COVID levels. They do vary a little bit by specialty. As an example, rheum and GI have come back faster than medical derm has. But medical derm has returned as well to some extent and we're continuing to see it return. Oncology practices in certain conditions we've seen -- we saw some tailing off of CLL treatment in the second quarter. That's now returning back to normalized levels. So I think the second half will, obviously, be much better than the first half. And I think we should return to normalized levels as we proceed through the second half of the year. Rob anything you want to add on that? All right. Great. So maybe we'll have Mike talk a little bit about the profile of the drug. And what I'd say is I think we probably want to come back at a later date once we've had a little better opportunity to analyze the chronic migraine market. And it's going to depend to a great extent on the profile of the drug obviously. But it's a very large market a very significant market. And -- but Mike maybe if you want to talk a little bit about constipation and then I'll come back and talk about the payer dynamics. Geoff on the -- on your second question, you probably recall back on our first quarter guidance when we outlined that we had built in to our forecast for the remainder of the year some impact for some channels shifting that we thought could occur due to the high unemployment. And essentially we haven't seen much of that at all. In fact I would tell you, we haven't seen any of it to any material effect right now. And one of the things that we do to watch that carefully is our PAP program. We've been advertising extensively to consumers to make sure that they know if they lost their insurance or they lost their jobs and they don't have insurance coverage and they can't afford their AbbVie medicines to come to us. We have a very extensive patient assistance program. And we're not seeing any significant increase in those requests. It could be because of the furloughs. We're not 100% sure yet. And potentially we could see some increase as we go further here depending upon what happens with stimulus programs going forward. We have still maintained some level of coverage in our forecast that we're providing now. So we believe we have sufficient coverage to deal with it and we'll just have to see how it sorts itself out. Right. Okay. I'll cover both of those questions. So on migraine, I mean obviously we don't publicly talk about our net price. We have fairly significant managed care coverage on the asset already. I think it's about 70%. And obviously it had to be priced in a way that was appropriate to be able to get that level of coverage. This is a market where market expansion is important. As I said, I think if you look at the penetration right now of acute migraine products against the -- or at least the oral CGRPs against the total migraine acute market, it's about 12% penetrated right now. So there's a significant opportunity to be able to grow that market. And it gives you some idea of the magnitude of this market. So you certainly want it to be in a position where it can have access to be able to allow patients, to be able to use the products. These products certainly have demonstrated that they have strong demand from patients to be able to provide them appropriate levels of relief. And so I would just tell you that that's an important aspect of the overall strategy here is to be able to grow this market over the long term. On the executive orders as you have probably seen they're pretty high level at this point and they provide some high-level direction. So I think, until we see them, sort of, start to sort out I think it's a little difficult to give you a lot of specificity around what they look like. Now I will say, if I look at them in the backdrop of AbbVie's business, I would say, I don't think they will have a significant impact on our business. If you look at Part B as an example, we have a very small Part B business. I think it's around 2% to 3%. 3%, I guess, is the right number now. So it's a very insignificant part. If you look at the importation bill or executive order, it's very similar to what's already been given out to the states. And it excludes biologics, which obviously is an important part of our business. If you look at the third one, it's insulin and EpiPen. We're not in that business. And then the rebate rule. Certainly, as we look at rebates, we're absolutely supportive of patients being able to get the benefit of the discount associated with the rebate or discount. As we've said many times before for us whether it's a rebate or a discount is not very material to us. What I would say is when I look at that executive order it does say that you have to be able to implement it without increasing premiums. And everything I know about how rebates are redistributed, I would say that I think that that will be difficult to do. So I don't know how that will ultimately play out. So -- I mean at a high-level look at what we think about them right now. But I think right now, I wouldn't anticipate that they have a significant risk associated with AbbVie. Okay. So I'll cover the first one and then I'll have Mike cover the second and Rob can cover the third. So if I look at the business overall I said that the integration has gone very seamlessly. And I think that's a tribute to all the planning that we did. We had some extra time to be able to do it and I think that benefited us. And so I think the two organizations have come together in a way that's been quite good. Now I would say, I think, the places where we have an opportunity to be able to provide some synergy and benefit certainly when you look at our therapeutic businesses, when you look at our -- many of the tactical kinds of execution techniques that we use in the marketplace I think many of those are applicable to the Allergan therapeutic portfolio. Certainly when you look at managed care that's an area that we have demonstrated that we're quite skilled at being able to effectively manage our way through that. And then the third area, I'd say is if I look at aesthetics, aesthetics is a very attractive market. It has a significant opportunity to be able to grow that market, which I mean by bringing in more people into the market more quickly. You can do that several different ways. Obviously, some of it is driven by promotional activity. I'd say Allergan is very skilled from a social media standpoint. And I think that's an area that's probably been underfunded. Historically, it's an area that we have a high level of interest in funding to a greater extent. And we obviously have the financial wherewithal to be able to do that. The second thing is being able to bring more new innovation more rapidly into that market. And I think that's an area that we'll also be able to provide a benefit both in the way we operate R&D and the ability to be able to rapidly innovate. I think that will be a benefit to the overall business. And I think we have an opportunity to be able to accelerate the growth of that business in a meaningful way over time. And it's a market I like a lot. I think both based on demographics the cash pay aspects of it and how it responds to appropriate innovation in that market. So that's an area that I think over time you can expect us to continue to make sure that we're doing what we know how to do to be able to ultimately grow that market over the long term. Those would be some of the things I'd tell you at a high level. Mike? Yeah. I would just reiterate what Mike says. I mean, physicians are well skilled in understanding what placebo rates are. And I just don't even think, it's appropriate not to represent a product's efficacy without looking at the placebo rate. So, I mean, I think that will be the way doctors look at it. And I think that is the way the products will be marketed. And certainly, if I had a lower rate, I may have an interest in that. But at the end of the day I think that is the appropriate way to look at it. Okay. Thanks. I'll take the first question. Mike can cover the second one. So RINVOQ clearly has started to ramp in a fairly significant way. I think it's associated with two things. One is any time you see a pro -- it's about eight months into its launch, you typically start to see that inflection point on successful products. As you go out and you present the data to physicians and start to educate physicians and they start to get some use, you tend to see that inflection point start to happen around six months. So I think it's the natural inflection point that we would have expected if the product was being successfully accepted into the marketplace the way we hoped as a high-efficacy agent. I think there is some benefit that we're seeing during the COVID crisis that it is an oral, so it's a little easier to prescribe than an injectable might be. So we're probably getting some collateral benefit associated with that. But I don't think that's the fundamental benefit that we're seeing. Mike?"

            "name": "Michael Severino",
            "content": "Thank you Rick. We had a very productive quarter with continued progress across all stages of our pipeline. Additionally with the recent closing of the Allergan acquisition, we added promising pipeline assets in the areas of aesthetics and neuroscience. We look forward to sharing updates as those programs progress through development. In immunology, we continue to advance our programs for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI in several new disease areas. This year, we intend to submit regulatory applications for three additional indications for RINVOQ. In June, we submitted applications for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis. And we expect to file applications for atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis later this year. We also recently reported topline results from our three registrational trials for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis. Two of these Phase III studies Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 evaluated RINVOQ as a monotherapy for the treatment of adolescent and adult subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for candidates for systemic therapy. In the Measure Up one and Measure Up two studies, both doses of RINVOQ met all primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating significant improvement in skin clearance and itch compared to placebo. In Measure Up 1, roughly 70% of patients receiving the 15-milligram dose and 80% of patients on the 30-milligram dose achieved a 75% or greater improvement in skin lesions by week 16. We saw a similar rates of skin clearance in the Measure Up two study, with roughly 60% of patients receiving the low dose and 73% of patients on the high dose, achieving a 75% or greater improvement by week 16. We also saw very rapid responses in these studies with clinically meaningful reductions in itch observed as early as one day after the first dose in patients receiving 30 milligrams and two days after the first dose in patients receiving 15 milligrams in both studies. We also saw very strong results in our third registrational trial, the AD Up study which evaluated RINVOQ in combination with topical corticosteroids. Similar to the results from the two Measure Up trials, RINVOQ met all primary and secondary endpoints in the AD Up study with patients who received RINVOQ showing significant improvements in skin clearance and reduction in itch compared to patients receiving placebo plus topical steroids following 16 weeks of treatment. Treatment with RINVOQ also led to a significant increase in the number of steroid-free days. And more patients receiving RINVOQ were able to stop topical corticosteroids altogether. We're very encouraged by both the level of efficacy and the safety profile we've seen across all three Phase III atopic dermatitis studies. And we remain very confident that RINVOQ has the potential to provide a strong benefit-risk profile in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In addition to these three registrational studies, we are also evaluating RINVOQ in a head-to-head Phase III trial against dupilumab and expect to see data from this study later this year. In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, our Phase III program for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis is progressing ahead of schedule. And we now expect to see topline data from the first Phase III induction study later this year. We also recently reported topline results from a proof-of-concept study, evaluating our novel TNF steroid conjugate ABBV-3373 in RA. In this study, our goal is to drive a greater reduction in disease activity beyond the levels that can be achieved with HUMIRA or other high-efficacy agents such as RINVOQ. To achieve adequate statistical power, we used preplanned historical HUMIRA data in combination with in-trial data when comparing ABBV-3373 to HUMIRA. The study used two analyses for the primary endpoint which evaluated improvement from baseline in DAS28 score. The first analysis used a propensity matching strategy to compare 3373 with historical HUMIRA data. This analysis showed a greater change in DAS28 from baseline to week 12 for 3373 compared to the prespecified HUMIRA data. The second analysis used the Bayesian approach to compare 3373 to a combined in-trial and historical HUMIRA data set. And this analysis predicted with a 90% probability that 3373 was associated with a greater improvement in DAS28. Based on these encouraging results, we plan to advance the TNF steroid conjugate program in RA with a Phase IIb dose-ranging study expected to begin in the first half of 2021. We also plan to begin clinical studies next year in other immune-mediated diseases. Also, in the area of immunology we're making good progress advancing the programs for SKYRIZI in new disease areas. We expect to see data from Phase III studies in psoriatic arthritis later this year and in Crohn's disease at the end of this year or early next year, with regulatory submissions for both indications expected in 2021. In oncology, we continue to advance our hem/onc strategy with several important data readouts and study starts occurring this year. We've established a leading hem/onc portfolio with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA in areas such as CLL and AML. And we will continue to generate data to demonstrate the utility of both drugs across a wide range of patient populations and cancer types. At the recent EHA Congress, detailed results from the Phase III VIALE-A study were reported which showed the treatment with a combination of VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine resulted in a 34% reduction in the risk of death compared to azacitidine plus placebo in AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The median overall survival for patients in the VENCLEXTA arm was 14.7 months versus 9.6 months in the placebo arm. Patients in the VENCLEXTA arm also showed more than double the rate of composite complete remission compared to those treated with azacitidine alone. This filing is currently being reviewed by the FDA under the real-time oncology review program in Project Orbis. To-date, the AML program has focused on VENCLEXTA's use as a frontline treatment in transplant-ineligible patients. This year, we are expanding the program into other patient segments with the goal of establishing VENCLEXTA as a gold standard across the AML patient spectrum. Earlier this year, we initiated two Phase III studies, evaluating VENCLEXTA as a maintenance therapy in AML. One trial in fit patients with AML who have received stem cell transplant, but remain at high-risk for relapse; and a second trial, in patients with AML who are in first remission after receiving conventional induction and consolidation chemotherapies. In addition, building upon the survival advantage observed in the transplant-ineligible population, we are planning to initiate a new randomized study later this year testing VENCLEXTA in combination with intensive chemotherapy in patients who are eligible for more intensive induction regimens. Our comprehensive development program will position VENCLEXTA as a foundation for combination therapies in AML across all patient segments We also recently announced a broad oncology collaboration with Genmab to jointly develop and commercialize three next-generation bispecific antibody products and establish a discovery collaboration to create additional differentiated antibody-based therapeutics for cancer. The lead asset in this partnership epcoritamab a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody has demonstrated a strong efficacy profile, favorable safety and a more convenient dosing regimen in early phase trials. We believe epcoritamab has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy across a number of B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. And we are rapidly advancing it to Phase III trials. And lastly a few updates from other areas of our pipeline. We previously presented positive progression-free survival data from two Phase III studies for veliparib in frontline ovarian cancer and BRCA breast cancer. Based on developments in the field and additional discussions with the FDA, we will not be submitting regulatory applications without mature overall survival data. We will continue to follow patients in the ongoing trials as overall survival data mature. In Eye care, we recently announced receipt of a complete response letter from the FDA for the abicipar BLA. The CRL indicated that the rate of intraocular inflammation observed in the Phase III program, resulted in an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio. We are currently reviewing the abicipar program to determine next steps and will provide updates as they become available. In women's health, in the quarter we received FDA approval of ORIAHNN as the first nonsurgical oral treatment for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women. This new nonsurgical treatment represents an important therapeutic option for women suffering from uterine fibroids. And in neuroscience, we recently reported top line results from a Phase III study evaluating atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine. In this study all three doses of atogepant met the primary endpoint evaluating the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period. The two higher doses, 30 milligrams and 60 milligrams also met all secondary endpoints, while the 10-milligram dose met four out of six of the secondaries. Allergan had previously reported positive results from one registration-enabling study. And following this second positive study, we plan to submit our regulatory applications in episodic migraine prevention in the first quarter of 2021. In summary, we've seen tremendous progress across all stages of our pipeline in the first half of the year and we remain on-track for further advancements in the remainder of 2020. With that I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? This is Mike. I'll take those. With respect to VENCLEXTA we see very real potential in the t(11;14) multiple myeloma population. If we look across our trials early phase trials and then some set analyses of later phase trials where we have data from t(11;14), we see very consistent responses. We see high response rates and we see long progression-free survival in the t(11;14) population. And that makes sense because that t(11;14) population has a transformed cell that has a B-cell-like phenotype and it's BCL-2 high. So, it would be expected to be uniquely sensitive to VENCLEXTA and to BCL-2 inhibition. So, we have the Phase III study well underway now. It's an event-driven trial. But we would hope to have data in the near future in 2021. And that study is designed to confirm those earlier observations. In terms of how large an opportunity it can be, the t(11;14) population is about 20% of multiple myeloma. And multiple myeloma is a big indication. So, 20% of that is a lot. Now, as you mentioned it's becoming a competitive space. But one of the advantages of having a biomarker-driven therapy is that we can identify and physicians can identify in practice what patients are likely to respond to VENCLEXTA. So, we'll know what a VENCLEXTA patient looks like. And we think that will be a real opportunity and a real advantage. So, we're very optimistic about that aspect of the program and we think it represents an important additional role for VENCLEXTA. With respect to 951, that is a program that's designed to deliver DUOPA-like efficacy through a subcutaneous insulin pump-like device. And so to do that we had to develop two novel prodrugs. These are NMEs that are rapidly converted to the active agents in circulation. And they allow delivery of levodopa and carbidopa ultimately through this insulin pump-like device that you just can't do with the parent compounds because of their physical properties and chemical limitations and local tolerability limitations. So, it really does represent a real breakthrough. What we know about the efficacy of DUOPA is that it is very, very strong. It really is transformational. But it takes a lot to get that efficacy. Patients have to have a gastric tube placed to then thread it down into the small bowel. They have to maintain that. So, this is a much more patient-accessible patient-friendly if you will way to deliver the same sort of efficacy. And so we think that has a potential to really expand the number of patients who would be willing to consider a therapy such as 951 and it's a big market. If you look at DUOPA despite all the limitations, it's doing about $0.5 billion in sales. If you look at deep brain stimulation, there's also considerable use. In aggregate, this market today is well over $1 billion, probably $1.5 billion. And not all patients who would qualify by their patient profile are willing to undergo these therapies. So, we think that 951 can be a very real opportunity and can be quite substantial. This is Mike. I'll take the first one and then I'll hand it over to Rick for the second one. With respect to atopic dermatitis, we're very pleased with the results that we demonstrated across the Phase 3 trials. They actually exceeded our expectations based on the Phase 2b results. And those 2b results were very strong and had earned us a breakthrough therapy designation. And we're pleased not only with the efficacy, but also with the safety profile. We've said for quite some time that one needs to look at the safety of a drug in the intended population. Because things like background therapies, risk factors in the population can have a substantial influence on what that profile looks like not only for the active agent, but for the comparator or for placebo. And if you look at the profile in the AD studies, it looks very favorable to our eye. And these were substantial studies and a substantial program overall. This wasn't a quick study to get an indication expansion. We ran a Phase 3 program for atopic dermatitis that could standalone for an additional submission. So we think that very strong data package will be a real advantage when we bring this indication to market. If you look at the size of the market overall, I think, it's been underappreciated for years. Now that's changing now. There are a large number of patients who would be eligible for systemic therapy. Obviously, dupilumab is off to a good start over the past several years in that indication. But if you look at their efficacy only about half of patients achieve an adequate response if you consider that adequate response in EASI 75. And so in our study we drove very good numbers there higher than that roughly 50% albeit there through cross-trial comparisons. So we think that there is a real opportunity for a high-efficacy agent in this space. And so it really can play on both ends of the spectrum. Patients who don't achieve an adequate response with earlier therapies this is an obvious choice. But with the efficacy and the safety profile that we've observed, we see no reason why it wouldn't be used upfront as well. And of course, we'll have head-to-head data against dupilumab later on this year as we said in our prepared remarks. Sure. I'll talk about atogepant. We're very pleased with the data we've seen. And of course this fits into an important part of our migraine portfolio with UBRELVY for acute migraine now with atogepant with two data readouts in episodic migraine and an ongoing program in chronic migraine. And, of course, there's BOTOX Therapeutic in chronic migraine, so it really rounds out our portfolio. The efficacy that we saw was very strong. As we said in our prepared remarks, we hit the primary and all secondary\u2019s across the two upper doses and the primary and four out of six secondary\u2019s for the lowest dose studied. So that is an efficacy profile that I think exceeded our expectations going into the study. With respect to the safety, our view of the safety profile looks very favorable. The constipation that was observed in the overwhelming majority of cases was mild or moderate. It didn't limit treatment. So patients stayed on treatment. They could be managed easily with interventions like stool softeners or fiber supplementation. So we don't see it as something that is limiting particularly in light of the very strong efficacy that we have demonstrated. And the only other point I'd add is that we have a good understanding of it and it's on target. So it comes with the efficacy you get a very strong efficacy and you have this manageable tolerability profile that I described. I'll take the second question. So we do as you point out have a number of data readouts from Phase 2 studies or other proof-of-concept studies in 2021 and also in the following years in 2022 and beyond. And a number of these are very large opportunities. I'd point to our oncology programs. We have a number of immuno-oncology programs that would be large opportunities, if they hit. Our GARP program I think is a very good example of that. Our bispecifics I think are a very good example of that. We just brought in through the Genmab collaboration epcoritamab, which is a large opportunity. Obviously, that's post proof of concept. But there are two additional molecules there that are just a little bit earlier in development that could be large opportunities. We have bispecifics in BCMA more than one program that could be very large opportunities, if they were in fact best-in-class. And we think they have the potential to be best-in-class. The last thing, I would point to in oncology is our novel so targeted ADC technology with ABBV-155 being in the lead in non-small cell lung cancer. That is a BCL-XL warhead targeted by a B7-H3 antibody. If that were to hit and we'd see those data next year that would be a large opportunity. Obviously in immunology we're advancing our TNF steroid program. But I think those are data that we've already reported out. And then the last thing that, I would mention is in our neuroscience portfolio. Obviously, Alzheimer's disease if those programs were to hit they would be a very large opportunity given the enormous unmet medical need. Now obviously, in Alzheimer's disease it's higher risk higher reward. But if we got favorable data it would be a very, very meaningful opportunity. Well, this is Mike. I'll take the first part of that and then Rick may want to add. With respect to efficacy, the most important attribute is the placebo-adjusted migraine days. If one were solely to look at the total days one could conclude that placebo is in fact a good therapy for these patients, because we see reductions. And so you have to account for that. And there are differences from study-to-study based on design, population enrolled and what that placebo difference is. So it absolutely has to be taken into account. And when you look at our placebo-adjusted results, they're very strong. They range between 1.2 and 1.7 days, which in this disease area is a very meaningful response rate. And it's higher than what has been reported with other oral agents obviously with the caveat of a cross-trial comparison. So we think that on the most important efficacy parameter we performed very, very well. And of course we've hit all the secondaries across two of those three doses as I've described. And as we get the data out into the public domain you'll get more color on that. Okay. I'll take those questions. With respect to the TNF steroid conjugate what I would say is, it's important to keep in mind that this is an early phase trial and this was intended to be a proof-of-concept trial. One can't do a fully powered head-to-head against an active competitor like HUMIRA in Phase I or Phase II because that typically requires or always requires essentially a large Phase III study. Head-to-head studies are often amongst the largest studies in a Phase III program. So what we were looking for was evidence to support the profile that I described which is that we had a high probability of success in those trials downstream. If folks have a mixed view then what we hear is they'd like to see those later data. And what I would say is, we're well on the path to generating them. We're pleased with the results that we've seen and we think it's a very promising platform and we're going to be advancing into larger-scale trials and people will get the data that they're looking for. With respect to VRAYLAR in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, I think the question was how would I characterize the risk there? There already is one positive study in hand. And so of the two studies that are underway, we would need one additional study to read out positive to support the indication. I think that historically this has been a challenging indication. But I think the -- both the rationale and the data from earlier studies in the VRAYLAR program are strong. So I would probably put it in the moderate probability range. We didn't build it into our model. Our success with VRAYLAR was not dependent on it. But we think it represents a very attractive upside opportunity if in fact it hits. And with respect to why Genmab CD3xCD20 has the potential to be best-in-class? I would point to two things. One is the efficacy data reported from the early phase trials, particularly in DLBCL, which is a very difficult-to-treat tumor type, puts it at the higher end of efficacy. And the safety profile has been very favorable in terms of what's been observed to date both with respect to cytokine release syndrome and the lack of occurrence in the early phase trials of higher-grade CRS and also with respect to the neurological symptoms that can accompany this class of therapy. So it seems to have threaded that sweet spot between achieving very strong efficacy with a good safety profile. It also has subcu administration with its existing formulation. Others are working towards that. But Genmab already has the data in hand. And the dosing schedule fits very well into the regimens that will be used in the diseases that we'd study particularly DLBCL and follicular lymphoma. So we see aggregate of that that we think gives it a very, very strong profile. Right. So I'll take the question with respect to VENCLEXTA in solid tumors. I think there's two different lines of evidence. In breast cancer, there are -- there is an investigator-sponsored study that showed promise in breast cancer. And so there's a follow-up study there to confirm that. And if that were confirmed, it would be obviously a substantial opportunity given the unmet need there. And then there are other solid tumors such as both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer where there's preclinical rationale that warrants exploration. And so I would characterize the solid tumor program as higher risk but high reward worthy of exploration. The solid tumor program in VENCLEXTA has not been baked into our thinking and isn't necessary for any of the success that we have talked about with the molecule. But if something were to hit there represents very nice upside. And I think there's enough rationale to warrant the exploration."

Following our prepared remarks we'll take your questions. So with that I'll now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'd like to start my remarks by acknowledging the tragic nature of the COVID-19 crisis, which has touched all elements of our -- in our lives in ways we never thought possible. The human toll that this pandemic has inflicted is unprecedented and the suffering unimaginable. During this very challenging time, I want to assure you that across AbbVie we are working carefully to ensure that our business continues to operate properly, our employees remain safe, our patients continue to receive their medicines and we are providing aid including product donations and financial assistance to address some of the critical needs of health care systems and underserved communities across the globe. As a matter of priority, we continue to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to ensure that our patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Our manufacturing sites remain operational. And we have implemented additional measures at these facilities to ensure the safety of our employees and to protect our supply of API and finish medicines. We have adequate supplies in inventory to meet the expected demand for all AbbVie key medicines including KALETRA and NIMBEX, two therapies that have experienced a significant increase in demand directly related to COVID patient treatment. And we currently do not anticipate any product supply issues. AbbVie is also committed to supporting clinical research efforts for COVID-19. We have provided product donations to many health authorities and institutions globally so that AbbVie products may be further evaluated externally as potential treatments for this difficult disease. In times of crisis, it is our nature as individuals and our culture as a company to give back in any way we can. We recently announced that AbbVie has donated $35 million to help meet some of the critical needs around the world. We've partnered with several non-for-profit organizations who are on the front lines of the battle against COVID-19. And our donations have helped to support several important initiatives including the creation and operation of 20 mobile field hospitals in U.S. cities most impacted by the pandemic; the procurement and delivery of oxygen concentrators ventilators and personal protective equipment to health care systems in Europe; and various other essential programs including a donation to Feeding America to provide food and household supplies for those most in need including the elderly. We have donated a significant portion of AbbVie's own personal protective equipment supplies including N95 and surgical masks to hospitals near our facilities throughout the U.S. and Europe. We have also converted some of our own facilities including a pilot plant and several research laboratories to manufacture culture media and provide COVID-19 patient testing to supplement several public health departments. We are honored and committed to do what is in our power to help with this devastating pandemic and we will continue to look for ways where we are able to help. Now turning back to our business. I want to further discuss how the crisis is impacting our performance and expectations for the full year 2020. Today, I'm pleased to report strong results. For the first quarter, AbbVie's total revenues were up more than 10.5% on an operational basis and adjusted earnings per share of $2.42 was up more than 13% versus the prior year. These metrics were significantly above consensus and our initial expectations. Fortunately, we had very robust demand across our product portfolio heading into the COVID crisis. As the U.S. and other major countries around the world started implementing stay-at-home orders and social distancing strategies in late February, AbbVie as well as most of our customers started restricting face-to-face interactions resulting in reduced physician and patient contacts. These limitations which are still in effect for most major countries created two fundamental impacts on our business in the quarter. First, patients and pharmacies built up some additional inventory of our medicines to ensure they had adequate supply. And second, we saw fewer new patients visiting physician's offices, which had a modest impact on the number of new patient starts. Adjusting for COVID inventory dynamics, AbbVie's first quarter underlying operational sales growth was roughly 8.3%, significantly above expectations with double-digit underlying performance in both hem/onc and immunology, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our business. Within hem/onc IMBRUVICA the market-leading treatment for CLL grew strong double-digits, driven by increased demand in the frontline setting where we recently received another important label update which Mike will discuss momentarily. VENCLEXTA also performed very well in the quarter with global revenues of $300 million, roughly double the first quarter of last year, following share expansion in both CLL and AML. Turning to our immunology business. HUMIRA continues to generate significant revenue. HUMIRA benefits from a substantial installed patient base, representing more than 80% of current demand. Globally, HUMIRA revenues were up nearly 6.5% on an operational basis in the quarter including strong double-digit growth in the U.S. The international biosimilar trends and dynamics remain largely consistent with our expectations. SKYRIZI Global revenues of $300 million were also significantly above expectations. Since the launch late last April, we have quickly established and expanded our leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients and now exceeds 30%. This launch trend is truly remarkable and a testament to SKYRIZI's strong efficacy compared to other novel agents in the psoriasis category including HUMIRA and COSENTYX. RINVOQ is also performing at a very high level in the RA segment with global revenues of $86 million in the quarter. We estimate more than 17,500 prescriptions were filled including both paid and bridge, which is more than double the activity we saw in the prior quarter and now reflects approximately 11% in-play RA patient share. As demonstrated by our first quarter results, the underlying performance of our business remains very strong. We've now also begun to return to ordinary operations in select geographies around the world, where health authorities have deemed it safe to do so. And although early, we are seeing those countries ramp towards a normal operation and expected performance. This is obviously a challenging time to forecast, given the unique nature of the COVID pandemic including its global scope and unknown duration, and it is difficult to predict precisely when major countries around the world will return to normalcy. Despite this uncertainty, we believe it's important to provide a clear set of updated assumptions that reflect the latest view of our full year performance. We based our forecast on the best estimates we have at this time. And we will make updates if necessary on our next quarterly call. As I indicated earlier, our business was performing robustly, above expectations and above our guidance prior to the COVID-related impacts. We have spent considerable time, carefully evaluating the COVID dynamics from late March and April. Based on this analysis, COVID appears to be having two fundamental impacts on our business. First, there has been a variable impact on new patient starts due to physician's offices restricting patients' visits and patients adhering to stay-at-home orders. As an example, many dermatology offices are currently closed. AbbVie has a strong frontline position in dermatology with HUMIRA and SKYRIZI. And here we see new patient starts for these two brands were lower by approximately 30% to 40% over this time frame. Once these offices reopen, patient volume should return back to normalized levels. Second, we've also seen lower new patient utilization of hospital-based treatments, such as VENCLEXTA and HCV internationally, due to many hospitals limiting access to non-emergency, non-COVID patients. We have carefully modeled these COVID-related dynamics and incorporated the expected impact on our full year results. Our current forecast now assumes the following: Stay-at-home orders will be gradually lifted starting in May across Europe and the United States. 60 days after geography lifts stay-at-home orders, we expect physician offices and hospitals will reopen for more routine patient diagnosis and care and we expect patients will start returning to physicians' offices for routine treatment in that time frame. We have also factored in a modest increase to our patient assistance programs as well as a shift in our U.S. payer mix due to increased unemployment. Based on these specific assumptions, we are confident we can maintain our current full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance. We will learn more as the second quarter progresses and we will continuously evaluate our current assumptions relative to how the environment evolves and the updates will be provided on our next quarterly call. On a related note, while we have not yet completed the Allergan transaction we have also been actively working to assess the impact of the COVID crisis on the Allergan business. It's important to highlight that Allergan has both a therapeutic business which is similar to the AbbVie business and represents approximately two-thirds of their revenues and profits; and an aesthetics business which represents roughly one-third of their revenues and profits. Based on the differences in the nature of these two portfolios, we expect them to be impacted differently as a result of the COVID pandemic. We expect Allergan's therapeutic business except for BOTOX Therapeutics to be impacted and recover from the COVID crisis in a manner very similar to the AbbVie business I outlined earlier. We expect BOTOX Therapeutics, which has a substantial hospital base to experience a more significant impact given that patients are being discouraged from going into the hospital for non-emergency procedures during the pandemic as I mentioned earlier. We also expect to see a more pronounced impact on Allergan's aesthetics business as many of their customers including plastic surgeons med spas and dermatology offices are closed and therefore not performing procedures. However, after carefully analyzing the aesthetics business performance during the 2008-2009 recession, which experienced a rapid V-shape recovery, the recent trends we are observing in China as clinics have reopened locally and procedures have started to ramp significantly and taking into account the household income and employment status of the aesthetics patient base, we remain confident that the expected near-term impact while likely substantial will be transient with the aesthetics business quickly ramping back to normalized trends following the relaxation of quarantine restrictions in the U.S. and major European markets. As it relates to the closing of the Allergan transaction, we have completed all requirements with the FTC and they are in the final stages of their review process. Following the FTC process, the last step is the Irish High Court approval. Based on everything we know today, we continue to expect the transaction should close in May. We remain confident that the AbbVie-Allergan combination will generate significant cash flows which will support our strong and growing dividend and rapid debt repayment and we remain highly committed to both of those priorities. So, in summary, we reported a very strong first quarter performance. The COVID crisis is truly unprecedented and we expect it will have a transient impact on our business, primarily affecting our second quarter performance. However, based on our analysis of the situation as well as reasonable timing assumptions for the return to a more normalized environment, we are confident in maintaining our full year adjusted earnings guidance which speaks volumes about the strength of AbbVie's business momentum entering the COVID crisis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for some additional comments. Mike?\nMichael Severino: Thank you, Rick. Let me begin by echoing Rick's sentiment about how proud I am of our colleagues as our teams work to ensure our business continues with minimal disruption and our patients receive their essential medicines. The entire organization including our colleagues deemed on-site essential who continue to come into work every day and the individuals who have effectively adapted to working remotely have demonstrated resiliency, dedication, and compassion throughout this time of crisis. It's a testament to the culture we've built at AbbVie. Today, I'll focus my commentary on the ongoing efforts within AbbVie's R&D organization, to address COVID-19, and provide updates regarding our key development programs. As a leading global biopharmaceutical company, AbbVie is committed to supporting relief efforts for the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to the efforts highlighted by Rick, we have deployed our scientific and medical resources to help fight COVID-19 on several fronts. There is an urgent need to increase testing capacity within the United States. Public health authorities are actively working to address the issues that have limited capacity to-date including instrument availability, availability of diagnostic kits and reagents, and CLIA-certified lab capacity. Given the unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the need to significantly increase access to testing, AbbVie is working with health authorities here in Illinois, where we are headquartered and in Ludwigshafen in Germany, where we operate a major site, to create a clinical COVID testing capability. This will allow us to use our laboratory expertise to expand the COVID-19 testing capacity in both jurisdictions. We have also used our GMP capabilities to manufacture viral transport medium, which is necessary to preserve swabs prior to lab testing for the Illinois Department of Health and a number of academic medical centers. Like many companies in our industry, we recognize the extreme burden being placed on our hospitals, public health systems and medical professionals by this crisis. And in response, we have created programs to allow our employees, who have relevant medical, scientific or public health expertise to volunteer to support the fight against this pandemic. AbbVie has tremendous resources and we are doing everything we can to make these resources available in the fight against COVID-19. In addition to the efforts, I just described, our R&D team is looking at our existing medicines and pipeline assets to assess their potential for the treatment of COVID-19. AbbVie is collaborating with health authorities and academic institutions globally to support clinical trials of KALETRA, a protease inhibitor approved for the treatment of HIV infection to determine whether it has potential use in COVID-19. Two notable ongoing trials are the solidarity study being run by the World Health Organization and the discovery study being led by a consortium in France. We expect to see data from these studies very soon and we'll continue to monitor and update as information becomes available. We have also initiated a Phase II study of IMBRUVICA in patients with COVID-19 infection. The goal of this study is to determine whether IMBRUVICA is able to improve outcomes by blunting the overly exuberant immune response often referred to as the cytokine storm that contributes to the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Lastly, we are also collaborating with a number of groups to screen our internal libraries for compounds with activity against COVID-19. Clearly, this is a rapidly evolving situation and we will provide updates as additional information becomes available. Turning now to an update on the status of our clinical development programs. Our top priorities in the R&D organization are ensuring the safety of patients, investigators and our employees around the world maintaining the integrity of our clinical studies and continuing to advance our pipeline. We are carefully monitoring the situation and taking appropriate precautions to protect the safety of our study participants, clinical site staff and our employees. We understand that health care systems are under extreme pressure because of the need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In many instances, hospital-based research staff have been redeployed to other duties and aren't available to address clinical trial-related matters. AbbVie is doing everything possible to avoid creating an additional burden to our clinical trial sites. Given the current environment, we have delayed on-site start-up activities for new clinical studies. Start-up activities that can be performed remotely will continue and we will resume on-site activities and new study initiations on a case-by-case basis as local conditions allow. We also paused screening of new patient recruitment for a small minority of non-critical ongoing studies representing approximately 15% of our clinical trials, but are already in the process of reactivating screening in some of these studies again as local conditions allow. The remainder of our studies continue to enroll, although we have seen decreased screening rates in the short term as would be expected in the current environment. At this time, we expect limited impact to clinical trials that are already fully enrolled. Across our portfolio, we've implemented measures to ensure study continuity and minimize delays. These include actions such as shipping study drug directly to patients to avoid unnecessary study visits; conducting virtual study visits and remote data collection wherever possible; and shifting enrollment to geographies and clinical centers that are either less impacted or are already entering recovery. Based on these efforts, we currently expect minimal impact to the overall timing of our critical programs and to our key regulatory submissions. In immunology, we expect limited impact to the programs for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI in new disease areas. We are on track to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis in the second quarter and our filings for atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis are planned for the second half of this year. The data from our Phase 3 studies evaluating RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis are also expected in the middle of the year. The programs for SKYRIZI in new disease areas are also advancing very well. We continue to expect to see data from Phase 3 studies in both psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease in the second half of the year, with regulatory submissions for both indications expected in 2021. We continue to make good progress with our early-stage immunology pipeline as well and we expect to be able to share results from the proof-of-concept study, evaluating our novel TNF steroid conjugate in RA patients very soon. We recently completed the Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating ABBV-599 in RA patients, where our JAK-BTK inhibitor combination demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo, but the efficacy results did not prove differentiated from monotherapy with RINVOQ. Based on these results, we are discontinuing development of ABBV-599 in rheumatoid arthritis. We plan to continue development in other autoimmune diseases where there is a greater B-cell contribution, such as lupus and systemic sclerosis in which dual JAK-BTK inhibition could provide superior benefit over current standard of care. In the area of oncology, we continue to make good progress with our hem/onc programs where we achieved several important milestones in the first part of the year. We recently received a label update for IMBRUVICA based on results from the E1912 study, which demonstrated the superiority of IMBRUVICA to FCR in frontline fit patients with CLL. For patients who could tolerate it the FCR regimen had been considered the gold standard for efficacy in frontline treatment for more than a decade. Demonstrating a strong progression-free survival benefit over FCR and incorporating these data into the label is another important addition to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA use in frontline CLL. Continuing with our hem/onc programs, we recently announced positive top line results for VENCLEXTA in the Phase 3 VIALE-A study in AML. In this study, VENCLEXTA, in combination with azacitidine, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival and in composite complete remission rate versus azacitidine alone in patients with previously untreated AML, who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The VIALE-A study was stopped early due to positive efficacy results at the first interim analysis of overall survival, demonstrating VENCLEXTA's clinical benefit to these patients, for whom there are a few treatment options. We also announced the results from a second smaller Phase 3 study in frontline ineligible AML patients, the VIALE-C trial, which evaluated VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine. While the study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival, treatment with the VENCLEXTA combination showed an observed 25% reduction in the risk of death compared to low-dose cytarabine alone. We believe that the failure to hit statistical significance on the survival endpoint in this trial was due to limitations on the sample size of the study. With an additional six months of follow-up in the VIALE-C study, the VENCLEXTA combination demonstrated a median overall survival of 8.4 months, compared to 4.1 months for low-dose cytarabine alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.7 and a nominal p-value of 0.04. All secondary endpoints were in favor of the VENCLEXTA combination as well, including higher rates of response, earlier remissions increased transfusion independence and longer event-free survival. The data from both Phase 3 studies in AML will be submitted to the FDA and global health authorities in the coming months with regulatory approvals beginning later this year or early next year. We also remain on track to start several additional Phase 3 studies in Bcl-2 driven diseases later this year, including VENCLEXTA in fit patients with AML and in high-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome, as well as navitoclax in frontline and second-line myelofibrosis. So in summary, we've continued to make good progress with our development programs, despite the challenges associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Once the situation is stabilized, we will work to restart paused clinical studies and evaluate the impact to our portfolio. But at this point, we do not expect the global pandemic to have long-term or significant impacts on our R&D programs. Our pipeline remains very robust and we expect many important milestones over the course of the next several years, which will support AbbVie's strong growth over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you, Mike. Starting with our first quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottom line performance. Total net revenues were $8.6 billion, up 10.7% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. These results include approximately $190 million of inventory stocking related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.42, reflecting growth of 13.1% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint by $0.13, including $0.04 from underlying business strength and $0.09 related to COVID-19 inventory stocking. Several key products contributed to growth in the first quarter. U.S. HUMIRA sales were $3.7 billion, up 13.7% compared to prior year, reflecting double-digit volume growth plus price. These results include approximately $65 million of COVID-19 inventory stocking. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were $1 billion, down 12.8% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and ahead of our expectations. These results include approximately $35 million of COVID-19 inventory stocking. SKYRIZI is performing extremely well and above our expectations. Global sales were $300 million with U.S. in-market -- in-play market share now exceeding 30%. We also continue to see robust demand for RINVOQ with sales of $86 million in the quarter. Hematologic oncology global sales were more than $1.5 billion, up 32.3% on an operational basis, driven by continued strong performance of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were $1.2 billion, up 20.6% driven by strong share in all lines of therapy in CLL. These results include approximately $45 million of COVID-19 inventory stocking. VENCLEXTA revenues were $317 million, driven by continued share gains across all approved indications. Global HCV sales were $564 million, down 30.2% on an operational basis, driven by lower treated patient volumes in select international markets and increased competition within the U.S. Managed Medicaid segment. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for Creon and Duodopa. Turning now to the P&L profile for the first quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 82.7% of sales ahead of our full year guidance due to sales mix and currency hedges in place. Adjusted R&D investment was 14.3% of sales, supporting our pipeline programs in oncology immunology and other areas. Adjusted SG&A expense was 18.6% of sales, reflecting continued investment in our on-market products and newly launched assets. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.8% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points versus prior year, including a 70 basis point benefit from inventory stocking. Adjusted net interest expense was $284 million and the adjusted tax rate was 9.7%. As Rick previously discussed, we are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the momentum of the business heading into the pandemic and our current assumptions regarding timing of the recovery, we remain confident in our previously communicated full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of between $9.61 to $9.71 for stand-alone AbbVie. Excluded from this guidance is $2.01 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of approximately 7% on an operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 70 basis point unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect U.S. HUMIRA sales growth of approximately 7%. For SKYRIZI, we now expect global revenues of approximately $1.4 billion. And for global HCV, we now expect sales of approximately $2.3 billion. Moving to the P&L. We now forecast adjusted gross margin approaching 82% of sales SG&A expense to be approximately 19% of sales and adjusted operating margin approaching 49% of sales, an improvement of 140 basis points versus 2019. All other full year 2020 guidance assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate adjusted revenue of approximately $8.1 billion for stand-alone AbbVie. This guidance assumes reversal of inventory stocking from the first quarter as well as slower new patient starts due to COVID-19. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have an 80 basis point unfavorable impact on reported sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 47.5% of sales, including a reversal of the 70 basis point benefit from inventory stocking in the first quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.10 and $2.16 excluding approximately $0.53 of known intangible amortization and specified items. AbbVie remains well positioned to execute on our capital allocation priorities. We generated $3.8 billion of operating cash flow in the first quarter. Our cash balance at the end of March was $41 billion, including funding designated for the Allergan acquisition. The robust cash flow generation of the combined company will be used to rapidly pay down debt, support a strong and growing dividend and pursue additional innovative mid to late-stage pipeline assets. We have committed to paying down $15 billion to $18 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021 of which nearly $7 billion will be repaid by the end of May 2020. We expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. In closing, AbbVie's performance and financial condition remains strong. Given the nature of the important therapies in our portfolio and the ongoing efforts of the people within our organization, our business is well positioned to navigate the current COVID-19 related challenges. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Rob. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions and all the color that you've provided in your comments. And maybe just a couple if I could. One, you talked about the Allergan deal and obviously some of the assumptions there. I'm just thinking big picture -- and I guess this is for Rick just in terms of your -- kind of where you see the value of that deal. I know you -- obviously some of the assumptions in the near-term have changed and you mentioned the esthetics impact is probably more transient. But just to confirm for investors, do you see any changes over the longer term value of this transaction? We're obviously getting a lot of questions just given the nature of the esthetics business right now. And then second one on the dividend. You mentioned, obviously, your support for a strong and growing dividend. Is there also just any change as to how you think about dividend growth going forward given the current environment? Obviously you've still been growing but is there maybe growing at a lower rate, or any change at all there just \u2013 it would be great to clarify. Thanks again.\nRick Gonzalez: Vamil this is Rick. I mean, I'll take those two questions. Let me do the second one, because it will be shorter first. So we don't see any changes in the assumptions we're making from the standpoint of the growth of the dividend based on everything that we have analyzed and I would say the robust performance of our business going into the COVID crisis and how we view the COVID crisis being a transient situation that, although difficult to predict exactly when all the geographies will reach some level of normalcy, we know that will occur at some point. And so we don't view any significant change there. On the value of the Allergan transaction, I would tell you that we don't see any change, fundamental change in the long-term value of the transaction. The benefits that we were trying to derive by acquiring the Allergan business are the same. And the long-term valuation I believe is the same. Now I think what some of the investors are probably concerned about is, obviously, the esthetics business is an important franchise as I indicated before represents about one-third of the revenues and about one-third of the profits. And it's an attractive franchise. And so I think the question that investors have, is how is it going to recover? And how long will it take to recover? And I think look those are reasonable questions. And as you can probably imagine, we have been doing a tremendous amount of work to try to evaluate not only the impact of COVID on our business, but also the impact of COVID on the Allergan business. And specifically I'd say, we've spent a considerable amount of time looking at the esthetics business. So I'm going to take a couple of minutes here and walk you through what that data looks like, so that you have a good perspective of at least the data that we're operating against to make the assumptions that we're making. Now what I am going to say is because of the Irish takeover code, we can't talk about the specific financials of Allergan until they are public and they're not public right now. So I'm not going to talk about their financial performance in any way. But I think, I can give you a pretty good characterization as to the work that we've done here and the conclusions that we've drawn. So I think if you step back and you look at the situation, it is clearly a situation, one, it's a complex situation. And two it's not a situation that any of us have ever experienced before meaning that this has both an economic disruption factor built in and it has a supply and demand disruption factor that's built in. We've certainly seen economic impacts on this business before and we know how it behaved in those circumstances. So as we try to approach understanding what the recovery will likely look like, we've essentially looked at four fundamental issues. Number one is, are there any analogs that would tell us what that recovery curve's going to look like? Number two, what is it going to be -- what is it going to take in order for the supply side? And when I say supply side what I mean is plastic surgeons, med spas, dermatology offices, which are the primary providers of those procedures. What is it going to take for the supply side to get back to where it was? And then number two -- or number three rather, what is going to be necessary on the demand side? And demand, I mean, consumer\u2019s users of these procedures. And then finally, will there be a change in the situation from a competitive standpoint? Those are the four fundamentals that we looked at. We've looked at this both in conjunction with Allergan and we also have done an independent analysis with the same consulting firm that we used when we were considering acquiring the Allergan business. So we did two independent work streams to come to our conclusions. So let me start with the analogs. There are two right? There is the 2008, 2009 recession. And as I've said in my comments, there we saw a very sharp D-shaped recovery. And in fact the business recovered and actually grew faster on the other side of that The second analog is China. China has reopened most of its geographies not all, but most and they've been open for approximately seven or eight weeks now. If we look at the data from China what it says is 86% of the clinics have reopened. Patient traffic is back to about 55%. Volume is just under 50%, like 45% to 48%, slightly lower because those clinics are also burning off some of their inventory. So it doesn't outdate. So, I'd say the two analogs that we came up with looked pretty encouraging. Now let's look at the supply side. So, on the supply side, what we're trying to understand here is, what is the intent? And what is the preparation for these offices to reopen? And I think there's a couple of important facts here that help support and guide us to what that might look like. First the major medical societies like the plastic surgery society, the aesthetic society and others have now issued guidelines to these practices on the procedures that they should use to restart. And they include things like temperature checks, masks, gloves, face shields, lower densities in their offices. So why is that important? Well, why that's important is, this gives those offices a guideline as to how they should reopen. And probably more importantly, it gives them confidence on how they should reopen. Allergan has worked with their customers. A number of their customers, a large percentage of their customers requested the U.S. government stimulus funds. And so what we do know is that a significant portion of those practices should be in a position where financially they can reopen fairly quickly. And finally, Allergan has done a number of surveys with a large group of customers that show that the demand to reopen upon lifting of the stay-at-home orders and implementation of these patient safety guidelines is very high. And we anticipate that they will start reopening in May, and that's what our data told us, and the survey data told us. I'd say if anything, it seems to be moving faster than what we originally anticipated, because some states in the U.S. have opened up more quickly. So, then the next question is the demand side, what's that going to look like? And here I'd say, again, Allergan did some very good work. If you look at the brilliant distinctions database, which has about two million active members, represents about 70% of Allergan's users, it shows that 70% of the growing distinction consumers have household incomes of greater than $100,000, and 50% have incomes -- household incomes of greater than $150,000 a year, and it shows that 60% of those consumers work for corporations not small businesses. Allergan also conducted a recent user survey that had just under 450 consumers that they interviewed. And it showed that 80% of the consumers said that the COVID crisis would have no or little impact on their household incomes. 94% of those consumers said, they would reschedule an appointment for procedures in the next 90 days, and two-thirds of them said upon restrictions being lifted they with schedule an appointment in 30 days. So now you turn to the competitive environment. Allergan competes mostly against smaller less financially strong companies. I'd also say that, Allergan has done an excellent job. I give a tremendous amount of credit to Carrie Strom and Bill Meury. They responded quickly and aggressively to this crisis with their customers. They extended payment terms. They converted credits to checks to help with cash flow at these offices. They protected the customers' volume discounts. They facilitated online sales of Allergan skin medical products, again to get those offices some cash flow. And they changed the product return policy so the customers are protected from any product outdating. I'd also say from a competitive standpoint, Allergan didn't have any layoffs. They maintained or accelerated their R&D programs. And you have to remember Allergan has the largest commercial footprint by a significant margin compared to anyone else in this business. So what the data tells me is this, the analog show the business bounces back and it's resilient. The supply side should ramp quickly when the environment allows. Consumers have a strong desire to restart treatments, and they have the financial capacity to do so. And I think Allergan did a nice job of creating loyalty with these practices, and should come out of this in a very strong competitive position, maybe even stronger than they were before. The independent analysis that we did also surveyed customers and providers. And I would say, it looks very similar to what the Allergan analysis looks like. So, look, we can't predict is exactly how long it will take in every state and in every country around the world, but I think we can predict with a pretty high degree of certainty that the business will bounce back. So, those are some of the keys that I think make us feel confident in the valuation.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Vamil. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much for taking the question. First, there are a number of things that are obviously affecting the environment right now Rick and I just want to ask about SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. You've previously given some longer-term aspirational revenue targets. I'm just wondering how you'd feel about those targets. Now we've seen a few quarters for each product. And also I understand you're going to have a little bit of COVID disruption. And then could you just talk a little bit more -- I think that's very helpful coverage of the plastic surgeon context. Can you just talk a little bit more about the other specialties and products where you're expecting impairment in Q2 and how quickly they could bounce back? Thank you. \nRick Gonzalez: Yes. So fundamentally I would tell you we don't have any change in the long-term forecast for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. I think one of the things that's impressive when we look at both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ is both the speed and acceleration of the ramp that we're seeing in the share capture of these assets. So let me give you a perspective on it. If you look at SKYRIZI as an example SKYRIZI within about three months achieved the number one position in psoriasis in-play psoriasis share. And then the rate of capture has actually accelerated from there. It achieved it at about 20%. If you look at the January data which is the most recent independent data that we have we have internal data that we also use to project. But the January data showed that it's at 31% and the slope of that line is accelerating and accelerating at a pretty good clip. And it is widening the range between it and the number 2 player in a significant way. And so this thing has tremendous momentum. Yes obviously the COVID crisis has created a disruption. As I mentioned in my comments if a dermatology office is closed obviously they're not prescribing anything including SKYRIZI. But that's a temporary phenomenon and we'll see these offices start to open back up. And I have no reason to believe that that momentum won't come back as patients feel comfortable to go back into their offices. RINVOQ obviously launched -- SKYRIZI launched in April and RINVOQ launched in August. So it launched later. But I'd say we've also seen on RINVOQ now a similar acceleration of its capture rate of share in -- in-play share in RA. And it too is accelerating going into this. It's about 11.3% on the last data point. And I'd say based on once things settle back out from COVID, it would take it probably three months to pass. There's a whole group of players at number two. HUMIRA is number one, but it would take probably three months for it to pass that group that's in number two. And I would expect it moves into the number two -- position shortly after that, after the disruption has subsided and we have a chance to continue to drive it. And so I feel very good about both of those assets and what the long-term performance of those look like, I think as I look at the R&D programs for both of them and the ability to expand the indications much like we did with HUMIRA, these assets have tremendous opportunities. So I feel good about it. Other -- by other specialties I believe what you're asking is what's going to happen to the other aspects of the business? Because what I was referencing on aesthetics really covered the range of supply side. So it was plastic surgeries derms and med spas. So again, we can't talk about the numbers, but as I indicated in my comments, I would expect the therapeutic side of Allergan to recover very similar to RSI a temporary disruption. There is likely to be a more significant impact on BOTOX therapeutic because about half of its volume comes from hospitals. And -- but we would expect that to bounce back once those hospitals start accepting non-emergency non-COVID patients. So we don't see anything in the data as we analyze it that would suggest that there's anything that's happening to any of their products that would impair the original assumptions we made about those products.\nLiz Shea: Thank you. Next question please, operator.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. I have a couple of questions. But first congratulations on a very strong quarter under very difficult conditions. So the first question is even pre-pandemic AbbVie seem to have embraced digital marketing. I think the company previously said that pre-pandemic 40% of commercial activities were already virtual. What does AbbVie do differently than peers? And does this expertise explain in part the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in the first quarter? And then the second question is just a housekeeping question. Just curious do you expect that Allergan will publicly report its first quarter? Thank you. \nRick Gonzalez: I mean on the digital marketing, I mean obviously we have a significant expertise in that area. And I honestly can't tell you how differentiated that is versus other competitors because I think many companies like our have gone to a significant portion of their commercial messagings through digital marketing. I mean, I think we're very effective at it. I don't think that is what's driving the RINVOQ SKYRIZI performance. I think what's driving it is really, two fundamental things. One is obviously these assets have very strong clinical profiles. They fit a need in the market an unmet need that's in the market that was consistent with what we originally assumed when we were trying to develop replacements for HUMIRA. And I think we're all extremely pleased that these assets are doing a very good job of demonstrating superiority to the gold standard HUMIRA. The second thing is I think obviously, this is a market we know how to execute in at a very high level. We have a tremendous level of experience in this market, a tremendous reputation in this market. And I think our commercial organization executes at a very high level in this market. I think that's what's driving the performance and it makes me feel good about what the future looks like for these assets. As far as Allergan is concerned, I don't know if they're going to -- well think of it with this way. I don't think I should comment on when they're going to publicly report their first quarter results. I think that's something they should probably respond to not us.\nSteve Scala: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.\nNavin Jacob: Hi. Navin from UBS. Thanks for taking the question. So I heard the $1.4 billion for SKYRIZI an upgrade versus the $1.2 billion. Just wondering if you had an update on RINVOQ as well. I think you had said $500 million for the full year. Maybe I missed it, but just wondering if you could provide an update on that guidance as well. And then with regards to the slight lowering of the full year HUMIRA guidance, wondering if there's any color on what's driving that, obviously COVID-19 impacting things. But is it because of -- any color as to whether it's COVID-19 specifically or if it's increased in gross to net or if it's an increase in the switching to SKYRIZI and RINVOQ? Any of that would be helpful. Thank you so much.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Thank you. So let me talk about it at a little higher level and I'm going to hand it over to Rob to give you more specifics. I think the way to think about this is we came into this first quarter. If you look at our first quarter performance had COVID not happen, we would have been sitting here contemplating how we raised guidance. But because of the uncertainty of what's going to happen in the second quarter, we obviously had to make an assessment of what we thought that impact would be. And that's why I outlined what those assumptions are. So you can think about it this way. We're essentially assuming the business is overperforming and the data clearly supports the business is overperforming. We're going to have somewhat of a negative impact in the second quarter that we're basically saying, we can overcome. And we had to estimate where that would occur. We're raising SKYRIZI, because the momentum is such that even with some caution about second quarter, we know we're going to beat that number. RINVOQ, we feel good about RINVOQ as well, but we don't need to raise that at this point. We need to give it probably another three four months and then we'll make a decision what that looks like. HUMIRA has a very large installed base. And so, I indicated that we are making some adjustments to what we think will happen with channel mix specifically Medicaid. We've worked diligently to try to understand what that looks like. And as you probably know during the 2008, 2009 recession, which is probably the best thing that we had to be able to compare it to, Medicaid went up about two points from 2007 to 2009, two percentage points. So we have factored in some potential shift in HUMIRA and that's primarily what we're reflecting. Rob can give you a little bit more color, but I'd say that's a significant part of what we're trying to reflect there. We also took down MAVYRET. And MAVYRET is two things. One it is COVID-related. Probably about half of it's COVID related there, where HCV internationally is administered through hospitals and they've clearly been disrupted. And we need that disruption to play through before we can get back to the same momentum. In the U.S. though I would say, it's primarily driven by price. That month is still under price pressure and some share pressure. So those are the two most significant ones. Rob?\nRob Michael: Yes. Navin, so if you look at the guidance we gave of approximately 7% growth, so that translates in about a $300 million change for U.S. HUMIRA. I'd split it really in the three buckets evenly. So as we think about unemployment, higher PAP volume, Medicaid channel mix each of those say one-third and one-third from those two. And then the remaining one-third would be just lower new patient starts during the stay-at-home period. So that will be most acute in the second quarter. As it relates to SKYRIZI -- and look the momentum from SKYRIZI is very, very strong. And we would have raised it even higher had it not been for the disruption in Q2 on new patient starts. So despite having that disruption on new patient starts, we're still taking the guidance up. We would have taken up higher without that. And I think Rick characterized the HCV change very well.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Navin. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.\nRandall Stanicky: Great. Thanks guys. Rick focus is going to shift pretty quickly here to pro forma 2021 earnings. You've had more time to prepare for the integration given COVID-19, but can you just talk about does COVID-19 impact those integration plans at all? And then, how are you thinking about the synergies and specifically, how quickly you can realize those $2 billion plus in cost synergies? I know they're third-party verified under Irish law, but at the same time it's -- 90% of that is operating expenses. So the question is why couldn't we see more of that realized early on? Thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: Yeah. I think as it relates to pro forma earnings, I mean, once we close the transaction at that point we will evaluate the business again and make a decision at which point we're going to provide pro forma earnings. As far as integration is, concerned I would tell you that, we're not \u2013 we have done all the integration work. We're well prepared and have been prepared now for several months to do the final integration. And I don't believe -- we're operating AbbVie at a very high level of effectiveness as we're operating today where a significant number of people are working remotely. I wouldn't say it's the ideal scenario. I'd much prefer we can all get back to operating the way, we did before. But look it's not practical right now. And I don't believe that anything will change the performance of the integration as it relates to COVID. So I'm not overly concerned about that. Synergies, obviously, we have built a synergy plan that we are very comfortable with. And we haven't \u2013 I don't believe we've given the gating of that yet right? We have not. Okay. That was Rob shaking his head no because you can't see Rob. So we've obviously gated that. I wouldn't say, we have changed the gating because of COVID one way or another, but we feel good about achieving those synergies. And obviously, everyone that does transactions like ours tries to overachieve their synergies. And we won't be any different than that, but we'll give you an update on what that gating looks like once we've gated the pro forma guidance.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Randall. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for all the color today. I really appreciate it. Just wondering if \u2013 first question is if COVID has impacted the rate of uptake of biosimilars in Europe at all either on the positive side or the negative side. And then for ABBV-3373, I know you mentioned the data is coming out in the near term. Maybe just can you remind us what you're hoping to see here on the efficacy side to advance this into further studies? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Yeah. So this is Rick. I'll cover the first one. I may hand it over to Rob to give you a little more specifics, and then Mike will cover the second question. So I probably saw in the quarter, we did better internationally than we had projected initially. And so that is related to a great extent that we have seen less biosimilar conversion than we originally anticipated. It's a little difficult to tell at this point whether or not that is COVID-related. In other words one hypothesis could be and it is nothing, but a hypothesis is that because people are staying at home they can't get converted to biosimilars as rapidly. I think it's not the one that, our area organizations think is happening. It just appears that we're performing better than we had expected. But I think to know that for sure, we'll have to see a little more time play out. But overall, we feel pretty good. And so I'm not giving you a very good answer, because I don't know the answer totally. So I'm giving you the best information that I have available to me. Rob anything you'd add on?\nRob Michael: I think if you look at our beat versus guidance it's about approximately $140 million. Keep in mind that, we have about $35 million of COVID-related inventory stocking. We did have some tender timing in Brazil. It's about $30 million. So the balance of that you'd call $75 million of favorability. Could there be some COVID-related impact there? Possibly. If you look, we didn't change our full year guidance even though we have the U.S. dollar strengthening. So that's inherently about a $70 million $75 million operational upside that we've baked in that's offsetting that foreign exchange headwind. So it is going better so far than we expected, which is great but it's hard to pinpoint whether it's COVID-related or not.\nMichael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take the question on 3373, which is our TNF steroid conjugate. It's in a proof-of-concept study in rheumatoid arthritis. And what we'd like to see there is efficacy that is greater than what can be achieved with currently available agents really across the board, but also with a particular focus on higher levels of response. Obviously, we're going to want to see that with an appropriate safety profile recognizing that a proof-of-concept study is a relatively limited safety database. And importantly, we're going to want to confirm that we can deliver that without impacting the pituitary access as a measure for systemic steroid effects. We have stated in other settings that from the 1b portion of this trial in healthy volunteers, we've shown we can deliver this construct without those steroid effects without impacting the pituitary axis. So we would expect to be able to do the same thing in RA patients in treatment, but we'd want to confirm that obviously.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. A question on the long-term impacts of COVID-19. I'm interested in what's the prescription rate for both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ among private practice versus salaried dermatologists or rheumatologists? I guess, what I'm thoughtful about is the extent to which the economic pressures that COVID-19 may force many private practice physicians to become salaried with perhaps more constraints on their prescribing or switch frequency? Many thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: Andrew, I would say I don't know the answer to your question to be honest. I can tell you that we don't see a -- today we don't see a significant difference across practices from a behavior standpoint. But future behavior I think that will be a little more difficult to predict. I think most physicians prescribe a medicine that they believe -- in the United States, that they believe is fundamentally the right medicine for that patient. And I would say that the profile of the drug is what tends to drive their prescribing habits more than anything else. So I would say, I would be surprised if there's any difference in the behavior. We'll go back to our commercial group and see if they have any data on it. And if so, we'll provide something back to you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Andrew. Operator next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. A couple of questions please. The first is on business development. And Allergan certainly helps fill the long-term hole from HUMIRA going off patent, but I still view it as M&A is going to be a likely continued part of the story. So my question here is the time frame for AbbVie being actively back in the marketplace to do additional acquisitions, and I'm defining those acquisitions as smaller bolt-ons single-digit billion-dollar types of deals, could that start to happen as soon as the current year in 2020? Second question is on RINVOQ. In atopic derm, you are running a head-to-head study versus DUPIXENT called heads up similar to what Pfizer has done with its JADE COMPARE trial. And I think your results come out in early 2021. The Pfizer results were perceived as being a bit underwhelming. I'm wondering, if you expect RINVOQ results would be any different from Pfizer's? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: On the BD front, we haven't changed from what we have talked about historically. Our capital allocation strategy is -- support a strong and growing dividend, pay down debt aggressively. And we've allocated approximately $2 billion per year that we can do more bolt-on kinds of transactions. I can tell you that Mike and the BD team have been very actively pursuing what we think fits strategically and doing the work that's necessary to determine, is it an asset that we want to add to our portfolio and where we find those opportunities? And we believe they're a good return for the company. We're aggressively pursuing those. And so I think you will see over the course of time here, you will see us do deals that are consistent with that strategy. And clearly there's a lot of focus on oncology that we have interest, but other areas as well. Mike?\nMichael Severino: So this is Mike. I'll cover the question on atopic dermatitis. Obviously, we're well aware of the Pfizer data from their program in atopic dermatitis at least at the top-line level that are currently available. And what I would say is we're going to have to look at each of these programs individually, although there are some mechanistic similarities factors such as dose selection ability to cover the relevant pathways are important when you are trying to predict the results that you're likely to see. We feel good about the pharmacodynamic coverage we've been able to drive with RINVOQ really across the board, but particularly in AD. We had very strong Phase 2b results. So we feel that our program will stand on its own merits and we look forward to those head-to-head data as we look forward to all the data from the Phase 3 program in atopic dermatitis.\nTim Anderson: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carter Gould from Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. A few questions. Rick, I appreciate the color on the Allergan aesthetic business. Maybe just a follow-up. Just trying to understand the sensitivity around your deleveraging forecast to the return of the aesthetics business in line with your assumptions? And I guess also based on your survey work, maybe you read on the rate -- not so much the rate, but like the ultimate return of the med spas and any view on I guess what percentage of those may not return given, I guess there's a view that that's somewhat of a more economically sensitive population relative to the broader BOTOX community. And then apologies if you already commented on this. On the pro forma guide that's going to come is the expectation that will come upon deal closing, or we'll have to wait to 2Q? And then maybe just given all the uncertainty around COVID, your latest thoughts about also providing longer-term guide at that point? Thank you.\nRob Michael: Carter this is Rob. I'll take your question on deleveraging. Look, if you think about the amount of cash flow that the combined business generates, it's a tremendous amount of cash flow that we feel very confident in our ability to deliver on our deleveraging commitments. As I mentioned in my remarks, we still expect to pay down $15 billion, $18 billion of debt. We're going to have $7 billion paid down by the end of this month, and we still will be able to support a strong growing dividend. So even as we flex various scenarios, we feel very confident we've reaffirmed those commitments on deleveraging.\nRick Gonzalez: As it relates to the med spa question, I would say, across the board, we looked at what kind of assumptions should we make about any consolidation in the industry. And the one thing I would say is, it does appear that these businesses fairly aggressively participated in the U.S. government stimulus programs, the Payroll Protection Programs and the other programs that were available. And so, I think, the data would suggest to us now that that won't be a massive impact. And if there were any consolidation across any of the channels and I don't know that any one channel really stands out in a significant way, we believe that there -- all we'll see is a shift of that capacity to other players, meaning they get bigger. And so, we're not assuming any significant reduction in the supply side of the channel that can't be absorbed through consolidation if necessary. On the pro forma guide, obviously, we're going to wait for the business to close. We're going to do some work on the business and then we'll provide the pro forma guidance after that. So depending upon the timing of when it closes and how close we are in the second quarter it could come on the second quarter call. So we're not really in a position right now where we can give you total clarity on that.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Cater. Operator, we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today is from Damien Conover from Morningstar.\nDamien Conover: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask a question on the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. We're seeing great growth there. And both these drugs have shown excellent data. But I also want to ask, is there any ability to leverage the competitive positioning of HUMIRA here? And I guess I asked that, because I think about the recent launch of the IL-17s, which those competitors used to complain about the strong entrenchment of the TNF class and some of the rebating that was going on there. So I was just wondering, the two growth of, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, is that really coming from the medicines themselves? So that's question one. And then the second question is, when thinking about the shift back towards normal and sort of the transient impact that we're likely to see from COVID, I wanted to ask about the thoughts around the potential second wave of coronavirus patients as some of the stay-at-home orders lessen up and doctor's office reopen? Is it the view of AbbVie that the second wave won't be that large, or that when the second wave comes we'll have strong treatment options and triaging that we'll be able to get to more business-as-normal operations? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Yes. I think, as we look at the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, it's driven by a couple of factors, right? Particularly, I'd say in the U.S., it's driven by a couple of factors. As I said a few minutes ago, certainly the clinical profile of the drug is first and foremost. The second is, you have to have broad-based managed care access in the United States to be successful. It doesn't matter how you much you convince the physician to use the product based on its clinical profile. If they can't get it reimbursed, they obviously can't prescribe it to their patients. And so that takes a company that has strong expertise in being able to deliver high levels of managed care access, which obviously we can. And then the third is just the effectiveness of your commercial and medical affairs organization. And I think in this area we have one of the best, if not the best. So I think those are the things that really drive it. In our business, you can't really leverage one product against the other specifically. So I don't believe it's a leverage issue. As far as the second wave, I'm going to let Mike cover most of that. The only thing I would say is we have not assumed another major shelter in place order in the fall in our assumptions. So we have assumed that we'll be able to manage through any increase in infections in the way we've built this forecast.\nMichael Severino: That's correct, Rick. And so, I think it's very hard to make exact predictions about the longer-term nature of the coronavirus infection rates. But what we are assuming, as Rick said is that, there will not be a major second wave in lockdown. And I think the factors that would play into that would be a much greater understanding of surveillance, broader access to testing, the ability to respond much more quickly based on experience. And based on those factors that I just mentioned, if small pockets of new infection do pop up, as well as hopefully the availability of some treatment options, although, I think, treatment options will continue to evolve over some period of time and renewed capacity or relief from the overcapacity status that the healthcare systems are currently operating under. So, I think, it's all of those features together that lead us to the view that supported the assumptions that Rick outlined in our thinking on this.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Damien. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Starting with our first quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottom line performance. Total net revenues were $8.6 billion, up 10.7% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. These results include approximately $190 million of inventory stocking related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.42, reflecting growth of 13.1% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint by $0.13, including $0.04 from underlying business strength and $0.09 related to COVID-19 inventory stocking. Several key products contributed to growth in the first quarter. U.S. HUMIRA sales were $3.7 billion, up 13.7% compared to prior year, reflecting double-digit volume growth plus price. These results include approximately $65 million of COVID-19 inventory stocking. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were $1 billion, down 12.8% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and ahead of our expectations. These results include approximately $35 million of COVID-19 inventory stocking. SKYRIZI is performing extremely well and above our expectations. Global sales were $300 million with U.S. in-market -- in-play market share now exceeding 30%. We also continue to see robust demand for RINVOQ with sales of $86 million in the quarter. Hematologic oncology global sales were more than $1.5 billion, up 32.3% on an operational basis, driven by continued strong performance of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were $1.2 billion, up 20.6% driven by strong share in all lines of therapy in CLL. These results include approximately $45 million of COVID-19 inventory stocking. VENCLEXTA revenues were $317 million, driven by continued share gains across all approved indications. Global HCV sales were $564 million, down 30.2% on an operational basis, driven by lower treated patient volumes in select international markets and increased competition within the U.S. Managed Medicaid segment. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for Creon and Duodopa. Turning now to the P&L profile for the first quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 82.7% of sales ahead of our full year guidance due to sales mix and currency hedges in place. Adjusted R&D investment was 14.3% of sales, supporting our pipeline programs in oncology immunology and other areas. Adjusted SG&A expense was 18.6% of sales, reflecting continued investment in our on-market products and newly launched assets. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.8% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points versus prior year, including a 70 basis point benefit from inventory stocking. Adjusted net interest expense was $284 million and the adjusted tax rate was 9.7%. As Rick previously discussed, we are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the momentum of the business heading into the pandemic and our current assumptions regarding timing of the recovery, we remain confident in our previously communicated full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of between $9.61 to $9.71 for stand-alone AbbVie. Excluded from this guidance is $2.01 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of approximately 7% on an operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 70 basis point unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect U.S. HUMIRA sales growth of approximately 7%. For SKYRIZI, we now expect global revenues of approximately $1.4 billion. And for global HCV, we now expect sales of approximately $2.3 billion. Moving to the P&L. We now forecast adjusted gross margin approaching 82% of sales SG&A expense to be approximately 19% of sales and adjusted operating margin approaching 49% of sales, an improvement of 140 basis points versus 2019. All other full year 2020 guidance assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate adjusted revenue of approximately $8.1 billion for stand-alone AbbVie. This guidance assumes reversal of inventory stocking from the first quarter as well as slower new patient starts due to COVID-19. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have an 80 basis point unfavorable impact on reported sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 47.5% of sales, including a reversal of the 70 basis point benefit from inventory stocking in the first quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.10 and $2.16 excluding approximately $0.53 of known intangible amortization and specified items. AbbVie remains well positioned to execute on our capital allocation priorities. We generated $3.8 billion of operating cash flow in the first quarter. Our cash balance at the end of March was $41 billion, including funding designated for the Allergan acquisition. The robust cash flow generation of the combined company will be used to rapidly pay down debt, support a strong and growing dividend and pursue additional innovative mid to late-stage pipeline assets. We have committed to paying down $15 billion to $18 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021 of which nearly $7 billion will be repaid by the end of May 2020. We expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. In closing, AbbVie's performance and financial condition remains strong. Given the nature of the important therapies in our portfolio and the ongoing efforts of the people within our organization, our business is well positioned to navigate the current COVID-19 related challenges. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. Yes. Navin, so if you look at the guidance we gave of approximately 7% growth, so that translates in about a $300 million change for U.S. HUMIRA. I'd split it really in the three buckets evenly. So as we think about unemployment, higher PAP volume, Medicaid channel mix each of those say one-third and one-third from those two. And then the remaining one-third would be just lower new patient starts during the stay-at-home period. So that will be most acute in the second quarter. As it relates to SKYRIZI -- and look the momentum from SKYRIZI is very, very strong. And we would have raised it even higher had it not been for the disruption in Q2 on new patient starts. So despite having that disruption on new patient starts, we're still taking the guidance up. We would have taken up higher without that. And I think Rick characterized the HCV change very well. I think if you look at our beat versus guidance it's about approximately $140 million. Keep in mind that, we have about $35 million of COVID-related inventory stocking. We did have some tender timing in Brazil. It's about $30 million. So the balance of that you'd call $75 million of favorability. Could there be some COVID-related impact there? Possibly. If you look, we didn't change our full year guidance even though we have the U.S. dollar strengthening. So that's inherently about a $70 million $75 million operational upside that we've baked in that's offsetting that foreign exchange headwind. So it is going better so far than we expected, which is great but it's hard to pinpoint whether it's COVID-related or not. Carter this is Rob. I'll take your question on deleveraging. Look, if you think about the amount of cash flow that the combined business generates, it's a tremendous amount of cash flow that we feel very confident in our ability to deliver on our deleveraging commitments. As I mentioned in my remarks, we still expect to pay down $15 billion, $18 billion of debt. We're going to have $7 billion paid down by the end of this month, and we still will be able to support a strong growing dividend. So even as we flex various scenarios, we feel very confident we've reaffirmed those commitments on deleveraging."

            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'd like to start my remarks by acknowledging the tragic nature of the COVID-19 crisis, which has touched all elements of our -- in our lives in ways we never thought possible. The human toll that this pandemic has inflicted is unprecedented and the suffering unimaginable. During this very challenging time, I want to assure you that across AbbVie we are working carefully to ensure that our business continues to operate properly, our employees remain safe, our patients continue to receive their medicines and we are providing aid including product donations and financial assistance to address some of the critical needs of health care systems and underserved communities across the globe. As a matter of priority, we continue to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to ensure that our patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Our manufacturing sites remain operational. And we have implemented additional measures at these facilities to ensure the safety of our employees and to protect our supply of API and finish medicines. We have adequate supplies in inventory to meet the expected demand for all AbbVie key medicines including KALETRA and NIMBEX, two therapies that have experienced a significant increase in demand directly related to COVID patient treatment. And we currently do not anticipate any product supply issues. AbbVie is also committed to supporting clinical research efforts for COVID-19. We have provided product donations to many health authorities and institutions globally so that AbbVie products may be further evaluated externally as potential treatments for this difficult disease. In times of crisis, it is our nature as individuals and our culture as a company to give back in any way we can. We recently announced that AbbVie has donated $35 million to help meet some of the critical needs around the world. We've partnered with several non-for-profit organizations who are on the front lines of the battle against COVID-19. And our donations have helped to support several important initiatives including the creation and operation of 20 mobile field hospitals in U.S. cities most impacted by the pandemic; the procurement and delivery of oxygen concentrators ventilators and personal protective equipment to health care systems in Europe; and various other essential programs including a donation to Feeding America to provide food and household supplies for those most in need including the elderly. We have donated a significant portion of AbbVie's own personal protective equipment supplies including N95 and surgical masks to hospitals near our facilities throughout the U.S. and Europe. We have also converted some of our own facilities including a pilot plant and several research laboratories to manufacture culture media and provide COVID-19 patient testing to supplement several public health departments. We are honored and committed to do what is in our power to help with this devastating pandemic and we will continue to look for ways where we are able to help. Now turning back to our business. I want to further discuss how the crisis is impacting our performance and expectations for the full year 2020. Today, I'm pleased to report strong results. For the first quarter, AbbVie's total revenues were up more than 10.5% on an operational basis and adjusted earnings per share of $2.42 was up more than 13% versus the prior year. These metrics were significantly above consensus and our initial expectations. Fortunately, we had very robust demand across our product portfolio heading into the COVID crisis. As the U.S. and other major countries around the world started implementing stay-at-home orders and social distancing strategies in late February, AbbVie as well as most of our customers started restricting face-to-face interactions resulting in reduced physician and patient contacts. These limitations which are still in effect for most major countries created two fundamental impacts on our business in the quarter. First, patients and pharmacies built up some additional inventory of our medicines to ensure they had adequate supply. And second, we saw fewer new patients visiting physician's offices, which had a modest impact on the number of new patient starts. Adjusting for COVID inventory dynamics, AbbVie's first quarter underlying operational sales growth was roughly 8.3%, significantly above expectations with double-digit underlying performance in both hem/onc and immunology, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our business. Within hem/onc IMBRUVICA the market-leading treatment for CLL grew strong double-digits, driven by increased demand in the frontline setting where we recently received another important label update which Mike will discuss momentarily. VENCLEXTA also performed very well in the quarter with global revenues of $300 million, roughly double the first quarter of last year, following share expansion in both CLL and AML. Turning to our immunology business. HUMIRA continues to generate significant revenue. HUMIRA benefits from a substantial installed patient base, representing more than 80% of current demand. Globally, HUMIRA revenues were up nearly 6.5% on an operational basis in the quarter including strong double-digit growth in the U.S. The international biosimilar trends and dynamics remain largely consistent with our expectations. SKYRIZI Global revenues of $300 million were also significantly above expectations. Since the launch late last April, we have quickly established and expanded our leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients and now exceeds 30%. This launch trend is truly remarkable and a testament to SKYRIZI's strong efficacy compared to other novel agents in the psoriasis category including HUMIRA and COSENTYX. RINVOQ is also performing at a very high level in the RA segment with global revenues of $86 million in the quarter. We estimate more than 17,500 prescriptions were filled including both paid and bridge, which is more than double the activity we saw in the prior quarter and now reflects approximately 11% in-play RA patient share. As demonstrated by our first quarter results, the underlying performance of our business remains very strong. We've now also begun to return to ordinary operations in select geographies around the world, where health authorities have deemed it safe to do so. And although early, we are seeing those countries ramp towards a normal operation and expected performance. This is obviously a challenging time to forecast, given the unique nature of the COVID pandemic including its global scope and unknown duration, and it is difficult to predict precisely when major countries around the world will return to normalcy. Despite this uncertainty, we believe it's important to provide a clear set of updated assumptions that reflect the latest view of our full year performance. We based our forecast on the best estimates we have at this time. And we will make updates if necessary on our next quarterly call. As I indicated earlier, our business was performing robustly, above expectations and above our guidance prior to the COVID-related impacts. We have spent considerable time, carefully evaluating the COVID dynamics from late March and April. Based on this analysis, COVID appears to be having two fundamental impacts on our business. First, there has been a variable impact on new patient starts due to physician's offices restricting patients' visits and patients adhering to stay-at-home orders. As an example, many dermatology offices are currently closed. AbbVie has a strong frontline position in dermatology with HUMIRA and SKYRIZI. And here we see new patient starts for these two brands were lower by approximately 30% to 40% over this time frame. Once these offices reopen, patient volume should return back to normalized levels. Second, we've also seen lower new patient utilization of hospital-based treatments, such as VENCLEXTA and HCV internationally, due to many hospitals limiting access to non-emergency, non-COVID patients. We have carefully modeled these COVID-related dynamics and incorporated the expected impact on our full year results. Our current forecast now assumes the following: Stay-at-home orders will be gradually lifted starting in May across Europe and the United States. 60 days after geography lifts stay-at-home orders, we expect physician offices and hospitals will reopen for more routine patient diagnosis and care and we expect patients will start returning to physicians' offices for routine treatment in that time frame. We have also factored in a modest increase to our patient assistance programs as well as a shift in our U.S. payer mix due to increased unemployment. Based on these specific assumptions, we are confident we can maintain our current full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance. We will learn more as the second quarter progresses and we will continuously evaluate our current assumptions relative to how the environment evolves and the updates will be provided on our next quarterly call. On a related note, while we have not yet completed the Allergan transaction we have also been actively working to assess the impact of the COVID crisis on the Allergan business. It's important to highlight that Allergan has both a therapeutic business which is similar to the AbbVie business and represents approximately two-thirds of their revenues and profits; and an aesthetics business which represents roughly one-third of their revenues and profits. Based on the differences in the nature of these two portfolios, we expect them to be impacted differently as a result of the COVID pandemic. We expect Allergan's therapeutic business except for BOTOX Therapeutics to be impacted and recover from the COVID crisis in a manner very similar to the AbbVie business I outlined earlier. We expect BOTOX Therapeutics, which has a substantial hospital base to experience a more significant impact given that patients are being discouraged from going into the hospital for non-emergency procedures during the pandemic as I mentioned earlier. We also expect to see a more pronounced impact on Allergan's aesthetics business as many of their customers including plastic surgeons med spas and dermatology offices are closed and therefore not performing procedures. However, after carefully analyzing the aesthetics business performance during the 2008-2009 recession, which experienced a rapid V-shape recovery, the recent trends we are observing in China as clinics have reopened locally and procedures have started to ramp significantly and taking into account the household income and employment status of the aesthetics patient base, we remain confident that the expected near-term impact while likely substantial will be transient with the aesthetics business quickly ramping back to normalized trends following the relaxation of quarantine restrictions in the U.S. and major European markets. As it relates to the closing of the Allergan transaction, we have completed all requirements with the FTC and they are in the final stages of their review process. Following the FTC process, the last step is the Irish High Court approval. Based on everything we know today, we continue to expect the transaction should close in May. We remain confident that the AbbVie-Allergan combination will generate significant cash flows which will support our strong and growing dividend and rapid debt repayment and we remain highly committed to both of those priorities. So, in summary, we reported a very strong first quarter performance. The COVID crisis is truly unprecedented and we expect it will have a transient impact on our business, primarily affecting our second quarter performance. However, based on our analysis of the situation as well as reasonable timing assumptions for the return to a more normalized environment, we are confident in maintaining our full year adjusted earnings guidance which speaks volumes about the strength of AbbVie's business momentum entering the COVID crisis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for some additional comments. Mike? Vamil this is Rick. I mean, I'll take those two questions. Let me do the second one, because it will be shorter first. So we don't see any changes in the assumptions we're making from the standpoint of the growth of the dividend based on everything that we have analyzed and I would say the robust performance of our business going into the COVID crisis and how we view the COVID crisis being a transient situation that, although difficult to predict exactly when all the geographies will reach some level of normalcy, we know that will occur at some point. And so we don't view any significant change there. On the value of the Allergan transaction, I would tell you that we don't see any change, fundamental change in the long-term value of the transaction. The benefits that we were trying to derive by acquiring the Allergan business are the same. And the long-term valuation I believe is the same. Now I think what some of the investors are probably concerned about is, obviously, the esthetics business is an important franchise as I indicated before represents about one-third of the revenues and about one-third of the profits. And it's an attractive franchise. And so I think the question that investors have, is how is it going to recover? And how long will it take to recover? And I think look those are reasonable questions. And as you can probably imagine, we have been doing a tremendous amount of work to try to evaluate not only the impact of COVID on our business, but also the impact of COVID on the Allergan business. And specifically I'd say, we've spent a considerable amount of time looking at the esthetics business. So I'm going to take a couple of minutes here and walk you through what that data looks like, so that you have a good perspective of at least the data that we're operating against to make the assumptions that we're making. Now what I am going to say is because of the Irish takeover code, we can't talk about the specific financials of Allergan until they are public and they're not public right now. So I'm not going to talk about their financial performance in any way. But I think, I can give you a pretty good characterization as to the work that we've done here and the conclusions that we've drawn. So I think if you step back and you look at the situation, it is clearly a situation, one, it's a complex situation. And two it's not a situation that any of us have ever experienced before meaning that this has both an economic disruption factor built in and it has a supply and demand disruption factor that's built in. We've certainly seen economic impacts on this business before and we know how it behaved in those circumstances. So as we try to approach understanding what the recovery will likely look like, we've essentially looked at four fundamental issues. Number one is, are there any analogs that would tell us what that recovery curve's going to look like? Number two, what is it going to be -- what is it going to take in order for the supply side? And when I say supply side what I mean is plastic surgeons, med spas, dermatology offices, which are the primary providers of those procedures. What is it going to take for the supply side to get back to where it was? And then number two -- or number three rather, what is going to be necessary on the demand side? And demand, I mean, consumer\u2019s users of these procedures. And then finally, will there be a change in the situation from a competitive standpoint? Those are the four fundamentals that we looked at. We've looked at this both in conjunction with Allergan and we also have done an independent analysis with the same consulting firm that we used when we were considering acquiring the Allergan business. So we did two independent work streams to come to our conclusions. So let me start with the analogs. There are two right? There is the 2008, 2009 recession. And as I've said in my comments, there we saw a very sharp D-shaped recovery. And in fact the business recovered and actually grew faster on the other side of that The second analog is China. China has reopened most of its geographies not all, but most and they've been open for approximately seven or eight weeks now. If we look at the data from China what it says is 86% of the clinics have reopened. Patient traffic is back to about 55%. Volume is just under 50%, like 45% to 48%, slightly lower because those clinics are also burning off some of their inventory. So it doesn't outdate. So, I'd say the two analogs that we came up with looked pretty encouraging. Now let's look at the supply side. So, on the supply side, what we're trying to understand here is, what is the intent? And what is the preparation for these offices to reopen? And I think there's a couple of important facts here that help support and guide us to what that might look like. First the major medical societies like the plastic surgery society, the aesthetic society and others have now issued guidelines to these practices on the procedures that they should use to restart. And they include things like temperature checks, masks, gloves, face shields, lower densities in their offices. So why is that important? Well, why that's important is, this gives those offices a guideline as to how they should reopen. And probably more importantly, it gives them confidence on how they should reopen. Allergan has worked with their customers. A number of their customers, a large percentage of their customers requested the U.S. government stimulus funds. And so what we do know is that a significant portion of those practices should be in a position where financially they can reopen fairly quickly. And finally, Allergan has done a number of surveys with a large group of customers that show that the demand to reopen upon lifting of the stay-at-home orders and implementation of these patient safety guidelines is very high. And we anticipate that they will start reopening in May, and that's what our data told us, and the survey data told us. I'd say if anything, it seems to be moving faster than what we originally anticipated, because some states in the U.S. have opened up more quickly. So, then the next question is the demand side, what's that going to look like? And here I'd say, again, Allergan did some very good work. If you look at the brilliant distinctions database, which has about two million active members, represents about 70% of Allergan's users, it shows that 70% of the growing distinction consumers have household incomes of greater than $100,000, and 50% have incomes -- household incomes of greater than $150,000 a year, and it shows that 60% of those consumers work for corporations not small businesses. Allergan also conducted a recent user survey that had just under 450 consumers that they interviewed. And it showed that 80% of the consumers said that the COVID crisis would have no or little impact on their household incomes. 94% of those consumers said, they would reschedule an appointment for procedures in the next 90 days, and two-thirds of them said upon restrictions being lifted they with schedule an appointment in 30 days. So now you turn to the competitive environment. Allergan competes mostly against smaller less financially strong companies. I'd also say that, Allergan has done an excellent job. I give a tremendous amount of credit to Carrie Strom and Bill Meury. They responded quickly and aggressively to this crisis with their customers. They extended payment terms. They converted credits to checks to help with cash flow at these offices. They protected the customers' volume discounts. They facilitated online sales of Allergan skin medical products, again to get those offices some cash flow. And they changed the product return policy so the customers are protected from any product outdating. I'd also say from a competitive standpoint, Allergan didn't have any layoffs. They maintained or accelerated their R&D programs. And you have to remember Allergan has the largest commercial footprint by a significant margin compared to anyone else in this business. So what the data tells me is this, the analog show the business bounces back and it's resilient. The supply side should ramp quickly when the environment allows. Consumers have a strong desire to restart treatments, and they have the financial capacity to do so. And I think Allergan did a nice job of creating loyalty with these practices, and should come out of this in a very strong competitive position, maybe even stronger than they were before. The independent analysis that we did also surveyed customers and providers. And I would say, it looks very similar to what the Allergan analysis looks like. So, look, we can't predict is exactly how long it will take in every state and in every country around the world, but I think we can predict with a pretty high degree of certainty that the business will bounce back. So, those are some of the keys that I think make us feel confident in the valuation. Yes. So fundamentally I would tell you we don't have any change in the long-term forecast for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. I think one of the things that's impressive when we look at both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ is both the speed and acceleration of the ramp that we're seeing in the share capture of these assets. So let me give you a perspective on it. If you look at SKYRIZI as an example SKYRIZI within about three months achieved the number one position in psoriasis in-play psoriasis share. And then the rate of capture has actually accelerated from there. It achieved it at about 20%. If you look at the January data which is the most recent independent data that we have we have internal data that we also use to project. But the January data showed that it's at 31% and the slope of that line is accelerating and accelerating at a pretty good clip. And it is widening the range between it and the number 2 player in a significant way. And so this thing has tremendous momentum. Yes obviously the COVID crisis has created a disruption. As I mentioned in my comments if a dermatology office is closed obviously they're not prescribing anything including SKYRIZI. But that's a temporary phenomenon and we'll see these offices start to open back up. And I have no reason to believe that that momentum won't come back as patients feel comfortable to go back into their offices. RINVOQ obviously launched -- SKYRIZI launched in April and RINVOQ launched in August. So it launched later. But I'd say we've also seen on RINVOQ now a similar acceleration of its capture rate of share in -- in-play share in RA. And it too is accelerating going into this. It's about 11.3% on the last data point. And I'd say based on once things settle back out from COVID, it would take it probably three months to pass. There's a whole group of players at number two. HUMIRA is number one, but it would take probably three months for it to pass that group that's in number two. And I would expect it moves into the number two -- position shortly after that, after the disruption has subsided and we have a chance to continue to drive it. And so I feel very good about both of those assets and what the long-term performance of those look like, I think as I look at the R&D programs for both of them and the ability to expand the indications much like we did with HUMIRA, these assets have tremendous opportunities. So I feel good about it. Other -- by other specialties I believe what you're asking is what's going to happen to the other aspects of the business? Because what I was referencing on aesthetics really covered the range of supply side. So it was plastic surgeries derms and med spas. So again, we can't talk about the numbers, but as I indicated in my comments, I would expect the therapeutic side of Allergan to recover very similar to RSI a temporary disruption. There is likely to be a more significant impact on BOTOX therapeutic because about half of its volume comes from hospitals. And -- but we would expect that to bounce back once those hospitals start accepting non-emergency non-COVID patients. So we don't see anything in the data as we analyze it that would suggest that there's anything that's happening to any of their products that would impair the original assumptions we made about those products. I mean on the digital marketing, I mean obviously we have a significant expertise in that area. And I honestly can't tell you how differentiated that is versus other competitors because I think many companies like our have gone to a significant portion of their commercial messagings through digital marketing. I mean, I think we're very effective at it. I don't think that is what's driving the RINVOQ SKYRIZI performance. I think what's driving it is really, two fundamental things. One is obviously these assets have very strong clinical profiles. They fit a need in the market an unmet need that's in the market that was consistent with what we originally assumed when we were trying to develop replacements for HUMIRA. And I think we're all extremely pleased that these assets are doing a very good job of demonstrating superiority to the gold standard HUMIRA. The second thing is I think obviously, this is a market we know how to execute in at a very high level. We have a tremendous level of experience in this market, a tremendous reputation in this market. And I think our commercial organization executes at a very high level in this market. I think that's what's driving the performance and it makes me feel good about what the future looks like for these assets. As far as Allergan is concerned, I don't know if they're going to -- well think of it with this way. I don't think I should comment on when they're going to publicly report their first quarter results. I think that's something they should probably respond to not us. Okay. Thank you. So let me talk about it at a little higher level and I'm going to hand it over to Rob to give you more specifics. I think the way to think about this is we came into this first quarter. If you look at our first quarter performance had COVID not happen, we would have been sitting here contemplating how we raised guidance. But because of the uncertainty of what's going to happen in the second quarter, we obviously had to make an assessment of what we thought that impact would be. And that's why I outlined what those assumptions are. So you can think about it this way. We're essentially assuming the business is overperforming and the data clearly supports the business is overperforming. We're going to have somewhat of a negative impact in the second quarter that we're basically saying, we can overcome. And we had to estimate where that would occur. We're raising SKYRIZI, because the momentum is such that even with some caution about second quarter, we know we're going to beat that number. RINVOQ, we feel good about RINVOQ as well, but we don't need to raise that at this point. We need to give it probably another three four months and then we'll make a decision what that looks like. HUMIRA has a very large installed base. And so, I indicated that we are making some adjustments to what we think will happen with channel mix specifically Medicaid. We've worked diligently to try to understand what that looks like. And as you probably know during the 2008, 2009 recession, which is probably the best thing that we had to be able to compare it to, Medicaid went up about two points from 2007 to 2009, two percentage points. So we have factored in some potential shift in HUMIRA and that's primarily what we're reflecting. Rob can give you a little bit more color, but I'd say that's a significant part of what we're trying to reflect there. We also took down MAVYRET. And MAVYRET is two things. One it is COVID-related. Probably about half of it's COVID related there, where HCV internationally is administered through hospitals and they've clearly been disrupted. And we need that disruption to play through before we can get back to the same momentum. In the U.S. though I would say, it's primarily driven by price. That month is still under price pressure and some share pressure. So those are the two most significant ones. Rob? Yeah. I think as it relates to pro forma earnings, I mean, once we close the transaction at that point we will evaluate the business again and make a decision at which point we're going to provide pro forma earnings. As far as integration is, concerned I would tell you that, we're not \u2013 we have done all the integration work. We're well prepared and have been prepared now for several months to do the final integration. And I don't believe -- we're operating AbbVie at a very high level of effectiveness as we're operating today where a significant number of people are working remotely. I wouldn't say it's the ideal scenario. I'd much prefer we can all get back to operating the way, we did before. But look it's not practical right now. And I don't believe that anything will change the performance of the integration as it relates to COVID. So I'm not overly concerned about that. Synergies, obviously, we have built a synergy plan that we are very comfortable with. And we haven't \u2013 I don't believe we've given the gating of that yet right? We have not. Okay. That was Rob shaking his head no because you can't see Rob. So we've obviously gated that. I wouldn't say, we have changed the gating because of COVID one way or another, but we feel good about achieving those synergies. And obviously, everyone that does transactions like ours tries to overachieve their synergies. And we won't be any different than that, but we'll give you an update on what that gating looks like once we've gated the pro forma guidance. Yeah. So this is Rick. I'll cover the first one. I may hand it over to Rob to give you a little more specifics, and then Mike will cover the second question. So I probably saw in the quarter, we did better internationally than we had projected initially. And so that is related to a great extent that we have seen less biosimilar conversion than we originally anticipated. It's a little difficult to tell at this point whether or not that is COVID-related. In other words one hypothesis could be and it is nothing, but a hypothesis is that because people are staying at home they can't get converted to biosimilars as rapidly. I think it's not the one that, our area organizations think is happening. It just appears that we're performing better than we had expected. But I think to know that for sure, we'll have to see a little more time play out. But overall, we feel pretty good. And so I'm not giving you a very good answer, because I don't know the answer totally. So I'm giving you the best information that I have available to me. Rob anything you'd add on? Andrew, I would say I don't know the answer to your question to be honest. I can tell you that we don't see a -- today we don't see a significant difference across practices from a behavior standpoint. But future behavior I think that will be a little more difficult to predict. I think most physicians prescribe a medicine that they believe -- in the United States, that they believe is fundamentally the right medicine for that patient. And I would say that the profile of the drug is what tends to drive their prescribing habits more than anything else. So I would say, I would be surprised if there's any difference in the behavior. We'll go back to our commercial group and see if they have any data on it. And if so, we'll provide something back to you. On the BD front, we haven't changed from what we have talked about historically. Our capital allocation strategy is -- support a strong and growing dividend, pay down debt aggressively. And we've allocated approximately $2 billion per year that we can do more bolt-on kinds of transactions. I can tell you that Mike and the BD team have been very actively pursuing what we think fits strategically and doing the work that's necessary to determine, is it an asset that we want to add to our portfolio and where we find those opportunities? And we believe they're a good return for the company. We're aggressively pursuing those. And so I think you will see over the course of time here, you will see us do deals that are consistent with that strategy. And clearly there's a lot of focus on oncology that we have interest, but other areas as well. Mike? As it relates to the med spa question, I would say, across the board, we looked at what kind of assumptions should we make about any consolidation in the industry. And the one thing I would say is, it does appear that these businesses fairly aggressively participated in the U.S. government stimulus programs, the Payroll Protection Programs and the other programs that were available. And so, I think, the data would suggest to us now that that won't be a massive impact. And if there were any consolidation across any of the channels and I don't know that any one channel really stands out in a significant way, we believe that there -- all we'll see is a shift of that capacity to other players, meaning they get bigger. And so, we're not assuming any significant reduction in the supply side of the channel that can't be absorbed through consolidation if necessary. On the pro forma guide, obviously, we're going to wait for the business to close. We're going to do some work on the business and then we'll provide the pro forma guidance after that. So depending upon the timing of when it closes and how close we are in the second quarter it could come on the second quarter call. So we're not really in a position right now where we can give you total clarity on that. Yes. I think, as we look at the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, it's driven by a couple of factors, right? Particularly, I'd say in the U.S., it's driven by a couple of factors. As I said a few minutes ago, certainly the clinical profile of the drug is first and foremost. The second is, you have to have broad-based managed care access in the United States to be successful. It doesn't matter how you much you convince the physician to use the product based on its clinical profile. If they can't get it reimbursed, they obviously can't prescribe it to their patients. And so that takes a company that has strong expertise in being able to deliver high levels of managed care access, which obviously we can. And then the third is just the effectiveness of your commercial and medical affairs organization. And I think in this area we have one of the best, if not the best. So I think those are the things that really drive it. In our business, you can't really leverage one product against the other specifically. So I don't believe it's a leverage issue. As far as the second wave, I'm going to let Mike cover most of that. The only thing I would say is we have not assumed another major shelter in place order in the fall in our assumptions. So we have assumed that we'll be able to manage through any increase in infections in the way we've built this forecast."

            "name": "Michael Severino",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. Let me begin by echoing Rick's sentiment about how proud I am of our colleagues as our teams work to ensure our business continues with minimal disruption and our patients receive their essential medicines. The entire organization including our colleagues deemed on-site essential who continue to come into work every day and the individuals who have effectively adapted to working remotely have demonstrated resiliency, dedication, and compassion throughout this time of crisis. It's a testament to the culture we've built at AbbVie. Today, I'll focus my commentary on the ongoing efforts within AbbVie's R&D organization, to address COVID-19, and provide updates regarding our key development programs. As a leading global biopharmaceutical company, AbbVie is committed to supporting relief efforts for the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to the efforts highlighted by Rick, we have deployed our scientific and medical resources to help fight COVID-19 on several fronts. There is an urgent need to increase testing capacity within the United States. Public health authorities are actively working to address the issues that have limited capacity to-date including instrument availability, availability of diagnostic kits and reagents, and CLIA-certified lab capacity. Given the unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the need to significantly increase access to testing, AbbVie is working with health authorities here in Illinois, where we are headquartered and in Ludwigshafen in Germany, where we operate a major site, to create a clinical COVID testing capability. This will allow us to use our laboratory expertise to expand the COVID-19 testing capacity in both jurisdictions. We have also used our GMP capabilities to manufacture viral transport medium, which is necessary to preserve swabs prior to lab testing for the Illinois Department of Health and a number of academic medical centers. Like many companies in our industry, we recognize the extreme burden being placed on our hospitals, public health systems and medical professionals by this crisis. And in response, we have created programs to allow our employees, who have relevant medical, scientific or public health expertise to volunteer to support the fight against this pandemic. AbbVie has tremendous resources and we are doing everything we can to make these resources available in the fight against COVID-19. In addition to the efforts, I just described, our R&D team is looking at our existing medicines and pipeline assets to assess their potential for the treatment of COVID-19. AbbVie is collaborating with health authorities and academic institutions globally to support clinical trials of KALETRA, a protease inhibitor approved for the treatment of HIV infection to determine whether it has potential use in COVID-19. Two notable ongoing trials are the solidarity study being run by the World Health Organization and the discovery study being led by a consortium in France. We expect to see data from these studies very soon and we'll continue to monitor and update as information becomes available. We have also initiated a Phase II study of IMBRUVICA in patients with COVID-19 infection. The goal of this study is to determine whether IMBRUVICA is able to improve outcomes by blunting the overly exuberant immune response often referred to as the cytokine storm that contributes to the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Lastly, we are also collaborating with a number of groups to screen our internal libraries for compounds with activity against COVID-19. Clearly, this is a rapidly evolving situation and we will provide updates as additional information becomes available. Turning now to an update on the status of our clinical development programs. Our top priorities in the R&D organization are ensuring the safety of patients, investigators and our employees around the world maintaining the integrity of our clinical studies and continuing to advance our pipeline. We are carefully monitoring the situation and taking appropriate precautions to protect the safety of our study participants, clinical site staff and our employees. We understand that health care systems are under extreme pressure because of the need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In many instances, hospital-based research staff have been redeployed to other duties and aren't available to address clinical trial-related matters. AbbVie is doing everything possible to avoid creating an additional burden to our clinical trial sites. Given the current environment, we have delayed on-site start-up activities for new clinical studies. Start-up activities that can be performed remotely will continue and we will resume on-site activities and new study initiations on a case-by-case basis as local conditions allow. We also paused screening of new patient recruitment for a small minority of non-critical ongoing studies representing approximately 15% of our clinical trials, but are already in the process of reactivating screening in some of these studies again as local conditions allow. The remainder of our studies continue to enroll, although we have seen decreased screening rates in the short term as would be expected in the current environment. At this time, we expect limited impact to clinical trials that are already fully enrolled. Across our portfolio, we've implemented measures to ensure study continuity and minimize delays. These include actions such as shipping study drug directly to patients to avoid unnecessary study visits; conducting virtual study visits and remote data collection wherever possible; and shifting enrollment to geographies and clinical centers that are either less impacted or are already entering recovery. Based on these efforts, we currently expect minimal impact to the overall timing of our critical programs and to our key regulatory submissions. In immunology, we expect limited impact to the programs for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI in new disease areas. We are on track to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis in the second quarter and our filings for atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis are planned for the second half of this year. The data from our Phase 3 studies evaluating RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis are also expected in the middle of the year. The programs for SKYRIZI in new disease areas are also advancing very well. We continue to expect to see data from Phase 3 studies in both psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease in the second half of the year, with regulatory submissions for both indications expected in 2021. We continue to make good progress with our early-stage immunology pipeline as well and we expect to be able to share results from the proof-of-concept study, evaluating our novel TNF steroid conjugate in RA patients very soon. We recently completed the Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating ABBV-599 in RA patients, where our JAK-BTK inhibitor combination demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo, but the efficacy results did not prove differentiated from monotherapy with RINVOQ. Based on these results, we are discontinuing development of ABBV-599 in rheumatoid arthritis. We plan to continue development in other autoimmune diseases where there is a greater B-cell contribution, such as lupus and systemic sclerosis in which dual JAK-BTK inhibition could provide superior benefit over current standard of care. In the area of oncology, we continue to make good progress with our hem/onc programs where we achieved several important milestones in the first part of the year. We recently received a label update for IMBRUVICA based on results from the E1912 study, which demonstrated the superiority of IMBRUVICA to FCR in frontline fit patients with CLL. For patients who could tolerate it the FCR regimen had been considered the gold standard for efficacy in frontline treatment for more than a decade. Demonstrating a strong progression-free survival benefit over FCR and incorporating these data into the label is another important addition to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA use in frontline CLL. Continuing with our hem/onc programs, we recently announced positive top line results for VENCLEXTA in the Phase 3 VIALE-A study in AML. In this study, VENCLEXTA, in combination with azacitidine, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival and in composite complete remission rate versus azacitidine alone in patients with previously untreated AML, who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The VIALE-A study was stopped early due to positive efficacy results at the first interim analysis of overall survival, demonstrating VENCLEXTA's clinical benefit to these patients, for whom there are a few treatment options. We also announced the results from a second smaller Phase 3 study in frontline ineligible AML patients, the VIALE-C trial, which evaluated VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine. While the study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival, treatment with the VENCLEXTA combination showed an observed 25% reduction in the risk of death compared to low-dose cytarabine alone. We believe that the failure to hit statistical significance on the survival endpoint in this trial was due to limitations on the sample size of the study. With an additional six months of follow-up in the VIALE-C study, the VENCLEXTA combination demonstrated a median overall survival of 8.4 months, compared to 4.1 months for low-dose cytarabine alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.7 and a nominal p-value of 0.04. All secondary endpoints were in favor of the VENCLEXTA combination as well, including higher rates of response, earlier remissions increased transfusion independence and longer event-free survival. The data from both Phase 3 studies in AML will be submitted to the FDA and global health authorities in the coming months with regulatory approvals beginning later this year or early next year. We also remain on track to start several additional Phase 3 studies in Bcl-2 driven diseases later this year, including VENCLEXTA in fit patients with AML and in high-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome, as well as navitoclax in frontline and second-line myelofibrosis. So in summary, we've continued to make good progress with our development programs, despite the challenges associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Once the situation is stabilized, we will work to restart paused clinical studies and evaluate the impact to our portfolio. But at this point, we do not expect the global pandemic to have long-term or significant impacts on our R&D programs. Our pipeline remains very robust and we expect many important milestones over the course of the next several years, which will support AbbVie's strong growth over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Rob? This is Mike. I'll take the question on 3373, which is our TNF steroid conjugate. It's in a proof-of-concept study in rheumatoid arthritis. And what we'd like to see there is efficacy that is greater than what can be achieved with currently available agents really across the board, but also with a particular focus on higher levels of response. Obviously, we're going to want to see that with an appropriate safety profile recognizing that a proof-of-concept study is a relatively limited safety database. And importantly, we're going to want to confirm that we can deliver that without impacting the pituitary access as a measure for systemic steroid effects. We have stated in other settings that from the 1b portion of this trial in healthy volunteers, we've shown we can deliver this construct without those steroid effects without impacting the pituitary axis. So we would expect to be able to do the same thing in RA patients in treatment, but we'd want to confirm that obviously. So this is Mike. I'll cover the question on atopic dermatitis. Obviously, we're well aware of the Pfizer data from their program in atopic dermatitis at least at the top-line level that are currently available. And what I would say is we're going to have to look at each of these programs individually, although there are some mechanistic similarities factors such as dose selection ability to cover the relevant pathways are important when you are trying to predict the results that you're likely to see. We feel good about the pharmacodynamic coverage we've been able to drive with RINVOQ really across the board, but particularly in AD. We had very strong Phase 2b results. So we feel that our program will stand on its own merits and we look forward to those head-to-head data as we look forward to all the data from the Phase 3 program in atopic dermatitis. That's correct, Rick. And so, I think it's very hard to make exact predictions about the longer-term nature of the coronavirus infection rates. But what we are assuming, as Rick said is that, there will not be a major second wave in lockdown. And I think the factors that would play into that would be a much greater understanding of surveillance, broader access to testing, the ability to respond much more quickly based on experience. And based on those factors that I just mentioned, if small pockets of new infection do pop up, as well as hopefully the availability of some treatment options, although, I think, treatment options will continue to evolve over some period of time and renewed capacity or relief from the overcapacity status that the healthcare systems are currently operating under. So, I think, it's all of those features together that lead us to the view that supported the assumptions that Rick outlined in our thinking on this."

Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman, Finance and Commercial Operations and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary.  Before we get started, some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today\u2019s conference call non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for Allergan. For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast to conform to AbbVie\u2019s revenue recognition accounting policies, and exclude the divestitures of Zenpep and Viokace. References to operational growth further exclude the impact of exchange. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions. So with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook, and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our quarterly business highlights, pipeline progress, financial results and guidance for 2022 in more detail.  Our performances this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie with results well above our initial expectations. We delivered full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.70, representing growth of more than 20% versus the prior year. Full-year adjusted net revenues were more than $56 billion, up 10.5% on a comparable operational basis. These results demonstrate balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, aesthetics, and neuroscience. I\u2019m extremely pleased with our momentum, and we\u2019ve entered this year in a strong position, which is reflected in our guidance. We anticipate 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $14 to $14.20, representing growth of 11% at the midpoint. Longer-term, we remain well positioned with an impressive set of diversified growth assets. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are already contributing meaningful revenue, including $4.6 billion in combined sales last year with substantial growth anticipated in 2022 and beyond. Over the next few months, we expect to add several new indications to the list of approved uses for these two assets, at which point, Skyrizi and Rinvoq will be commercialized across all of Humira\u2019s major indications, plus atopic dermatitis. With the strong performance that we\u2019re seeing in their initial indications and the robust data we\u2019ve demonstrated across our broad development programs, we expect combined peak sales for Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira.  In hematological oncology, we\u2019ve established a leading position with Imbruvica and Venclexta, which were both expected to remain important revenue contributors through the decade. To support our next wave of growth, we also have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both blood cancers and solid tumors. Notable opportunities from our mid to late stage oncology pipeline include Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, which has the potential to provide disease modification in a market where current treatments only address symptoms. At Epcoritamab, a potentially best-in-class CD3XCD20 for B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL and follicular lymphoma; ABBV-383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific, which has the potential to become a best-in-class treatment in multiple myeloma; and Teliso-V, our promising c-Met ADC being studied for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, which was recently granted breakthrough therapy designation. In neuroscience, we have a portfolio of compelling and differentiated therapies to support robust long-term growth in migraine, Parkinson\u2019s disease and psychiatric conditions. Ubrelvy and Qulipta are both demonstrating strong launch trajectories in migraine, with each treatment expected to contribute more than $1 billion in peak sales. Vraylar continues to have a significant opportunity with currently approved indications with peak sales expected to approach $4 billion. An approval in major depressive disorder represents upside to our current projections. And 951, a potentially transformative improvement to our current treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease with peak sales also anticipated to be more than $1 billion. Our leading aesthetics portfolio represents another extremely attractive growth opportunity. This business is performing well above expectations, delivering full year 2021 sales of more than $5.2 billion, $700 million higher than our initial guidance. AbbVie\u2019s increased promotional investments are driving accelerated category growth, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration globally. Dedicated resources are also of focused on delivering new product innovation within aesthetics, with several exciting R&D programs internally, including both short-acting and long-acting toxins, as well as novel fillers with biostimulatory or regenerative features. And we remain active with business development to pursue promising external technologies and complementary opportunities, including the recently closed Soliton acquisition, which further expands our body contouring portfolio. Given this focus and investment, we expect our aesthetics franchise to deliver high single digit revenue growth, through the end of the decade, including sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. Lastly, we\u2019ve developed a robust pipeline, including numerous attractive late-stage programs, novel early stage therapies in a growing range of potential platform technologies, which we expect will collectively contribute to our growth through the decade. With the actions that we\u2019ve taken to diversify our sources of growth, we remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Following the U.S. Humira LOE event in 2023, we expect to quickly return to growth in 2024 and deliver high-single-digit growth from 2025 to the end of the decade. This is a testament to the strength of AbbVie\u2019s broad and balanced portfolio. In summary, this is an exciting time for our Company. We\u2019re demonstrating excellent execution across our portfolio, and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. Looking at our quarterly results, we continue to demonstrate excellent commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I\u2019ll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.7 billion, reflecting growth of 13.3% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were $5.3 billion, up 3.5%, with 6% revenue growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 8.8% on an operational basis. Skyrizi is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $900 million were up 12.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. Skyrizi has now surpassed Humira as the leader for total prescriptions in the U.S. psoriasis biological market, with share of approximately 20%. We are also now leading the market in several international geographies, including Japan. Total in-place share, which includes both new and switching patients, remains very and now, reflects roughly 37% patient share in the U.S. as well as leadership in nearly 20 key countries around the world. Skyrizi is also now approved for its second major indication, to treat adults with active psoriatic arthritis, further enhancing its compelling profile in dermatology. Field promotion is now active globally and early feedback from physicians has been very positive. Given Skyrizi\u2019s demonstrated skin clearance and joint efficacy in our PSA clinical program, with nearly 30% of patients visiting dermatologists, having both, skin and joint involvement, this new approval will sustain Skyrizi\u2019s strong momentum. In addition, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi\u2019s in Crohn\u2019s disease, an indication with very meaningful long-term revenue potential, with regulatory approvals in both, the U.S. and Europe anticipated this year. Rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $500 million were up 14% on a sequential basis. Prescriptions in RA remain strong with a total market share of more than 5.5% in the U.S. and nearly 5% across key international markets. We\u2019re very pleased with the competitive labels for both PSA and atopic dermatitis, where we are making excellent progress with their launches globally. In atopic dermatitis, dermatologists appreciate key elements of Rinvoq\u2019s new label, including the incorporation of stringent skin and itch endpoints, reflective of the performance in our registrational trials, as well as an adolescent indication and dosing flexibility. Managed care access is expected to ramp fairly quickly for both atopic dermatitis and PSA in the U.S. We are also preparing for the launches of Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis and axial SpA with regulatory approvals for both indications anticipated this year as well. Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and progress we\u2019re making with both, Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which are expected to contribute more than $15 billion in combined risk adjusted global sales in 2025. In hematologic oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 4.7% on an operational basis. Venclexta once again, delivered robust growth. Sales were up 34% on an operational basis with strong share performance across all approved indications. Imbruvica global revenues were down 2.7%, reflecting a slower than anticipated market recovery in CLL and increased share pressure from newer therapies. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 19% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth for both, Vraylar and Botox Therapeutic. I\u2019m also very pleased with our performance in migraine, where we have a portfolio of multiple distinct therapies to address the full spectrum of this disease. This includes our two leading oral CGRP therapies. Ubrelvy for acute migraine, which delivered total sales of $183 million, up 13% on a sequential basis, we anticipate robust sales growth again this year based on Ubrelvy\u2019s competitive profile, continued strong new patient starts and a rapidly expanding CGRP segment. And we also have Qulipta, the only oral CGRP treatment specifically developed for the prevention of episodic migraine. The launch is going extremely well. When considering both paid and bridge volume Qulipta is already capturing nearly 20% of the new-to-brand share in the preventative CGRP class. Roughly three months post-launch, this is an incredible accomplishment and it\u2019s a testament to Qulipta\u2019s demonstrated efficacy, including rapid and meaningful reduction in migraine days. We expect commercial access for Qulipta to ramp quickly in the first half of this year. In eye care, revenues of $960 million were up 3.9% on an operational basis, including $364 million in sales from Restasis. Lastly, Mavyret were $427 million, down 10.1% on an operational basis, as treated patient volumes remained suppressed compared to pre-COVID levels. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?\nMichael Severino: Thank you, Jeff. We made significant advancement across all stages of our pipeline in 2021, and we expect continued progress again this year. In immunology, we had several recent important regulatory updates. We implemented safety and indication updates to our RA label for Rinvoq, and also received FDA approval in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis to curing strong labels that highlight Rinvoq\u2019s favorable benefit risk profile in both new indications. In atopic dermatitis, we received approval for both the 15 milligram and 30 milligram doses, and based on the impressive levels of skin clearance and itch reduction demonstrated in our development program, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new treatment option for adult and adolescent patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, who have not responded well to other systemic agents, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or biologics. We also have regulatory applications under review for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision next month for ulcerative colitis, in the second quarter for ankylosing spondylitis, and in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. In Europe, we anticipate approval decisions for ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial SpA in the second half of the year. We\u2019re nearing completion of Rinvoq\u2019s registrational program in Crohn\u2019s disease, which is the last major indication expansion program for Rinvoq. We recently announced positive top-line results from the first Phase 3 Crohn\u2019s induction study, where Rinvoq demonstrated a very impact on clinical remission and endoscopic response in a difficult-to-treat refractory patient population. We expect to see results from the second Phase 3 Crohn\u2019s induction study and from the maintenance study in the first half of this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2022. Also in immunology, we recently received FDA approval for Skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, an important indication expansion for this asset. Based on the strong joint efficacy and the high level of skin clearance that Skyrizi provided in our registrational trials, we believe Skyrizi will be very competitively positioned as an effective new treatment option for psoriatic arthritis patients. We also have regulatory applications under review for Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s disease with approval decisions expected in the U.S. next month and in Europe, later this year. We\u2019ve seen impressive results in our Crohn\u2019s disease program, and we believe Skyrizi has the potential to become an important new therapy in this market, where there continues to be considerable unmet need. We\u2019re making very good progress with our early-stage immunology pipeline as well, where we are developing novel agents with the goal of significantly advancing the standard-of-care across our core areas, by providing deeper and more durable responses. Our anti-TNF steroid ADC ABBV-154 is a novel approach for delivering a potent steroid that has the potential to provide durable remission in diseases such as RA, PMR and Crohn\u2019s disease. We expect to see preliminary data from our Phase 2 dose ranging study in RA in the fourth quarter of this year. We also expect to see Phase 2 proof-of-concept data in PMR and Crohn\u2019s disease in 2023. In dermatology, our early-stage efforts are focused on developing oral agents that can provide clear skin with durable responses. Our RoR\u03b3T inverse agonist, ABBV-157 is designed to more effectively inhibit IL-17 production compared to pure antagonists, which has the potential to result in a greater impact on skin inflammation. We\u2019ve recently been again a Phase 2 dose ranging study for 157 in psoriasis. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. We recently received an FDA breakthrough therapy designation for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced or metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer, based on the encouraging results we\u2019ve seen to-date in our clinical program. Treatment options for patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are limited to single agent chemo, which typically provides response rates of only 15% to 20%, with a median overall survival of less than one year. Prognosis for these patients is very poor. While targeted therapies have been approved by the FDA for the 3% to 4% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, there are currently no therapies approved, specifically for the much larger group of patients, who exhibit c-Met protein overexpression. Patients with overexpressed c-Met represents about 25% to 30% of the advanced or metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer population with wild-type EGFR, which corresponds to an incidence of approximately 35,000 patients each year in the U.S. In stage 1 of our Phase 2 study, we saw promising efficacy in heavily pretreated patients who received Teliso-V, including a 54% objective response rate in those with highly expressed c-Met. The second stage of the Phase 2 study is ongoing and has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second-line plus advanced metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. We expect to see additional data from this study next year. We also recently began the clinical program for our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400, which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload to potentially drive deeper tumor responses in patients with both, intermediate and high levels of c-Met expression. We also expect to see data this year from several important indication expansion programs for Venclexta, including results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation as well as results from our program for Venclexta in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, where we received a breakthrough therapy designation. We plan to submit our regulatory applications to the FDA in the first half of this year for an accelerated approval in MDS, and late in \u201822 or early \u201823 for multiple myeloma. Both indications represent important expansion opportunities for Venclexta and will help drive long-term growth for our oncology portfolio. We are also making very good progress with epcoritamab, where we continue to generate strong data in early-stage studies to support our view that epcoritamab has the potential to become a differentiated and best-in-class CD3xCD20 bispecific across several B-cell malignancies including diffuse B cell and follicular lymphomas. We\u2019ll see monotherapy data in the third quarter from the Phase 2 expansion cohort in DLBCL, which has the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We also have a Phase 3 study ongoing in third-line relapsed/refractory DLBCL and we plan to initiate several additional Phase 3 trials this year, including studies in earlier lines of therapy for diffuse B-cell lymphoma in multiple combinations, as well as in follicular lymphoma in combination with rituximab and Revlimid. This year, we\u2019ll also see additional data maturing from our cohort expansion studies for ABBV-383, both as a monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care and novel agents in multiple myeloma. We believe our BCMA-CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and can be best-in-class across multiple lines of therapy. We plan to initiate Phase 3 studies later this year in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We also continue to make good progress with Navitoclax in myelofibrosis, where we\u2019ve seen strong mid-stage data supporting our view that Navitoclax has the potential to provide disease modification, which we believe will lead to improved and durable clinical outcomes for patients. We expect a Phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the first half of next year, with approval anticipated near the end of 2023. Moving to neuroscience, where we expect several important pipeline events in 2022 as well. We recently completed discussions with the FDA and are preparing to submit our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the totality of the data and the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar has the potential to be competitively positioned as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. We expect a submission in the first quarter and an approval decision by the end of the year. We\u2019ve also completed our registration-enabling program for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. In our Phase 3 studies, 951 proved superior to oral levodopa/carbidopa in reducing motor fluctuations in this advanced population, and we believe our innovative new delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the first half of this year in the U.S. and Europe, with both approval decisions anticipated in early 2023. And we expect to see Phase 3 data for Qulipta in chronic migraine prevention later in the first quarter and plan to submit our regulatory applications in both, the U.S. and Europe this summer, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2023. So, in summary, we remain focused on continuing to execute on our pipeline programs and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones across all stages of our pipeline in 2022. This includes important indication expansion for on-market drugs and data readouts and regulatory actions for key late-stage assets as well as proof-of-concept data from several early-stage NME programs. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2022 financial outlook. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you, Mike. AbbVie once again delivered outstanding performance while also advancing our strategic priorities. The strong results across our portfolio continue to support AbbVie\u2019s long-term growth outlook. Starting with fourth quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.31, up 13.4% compared to prior year and $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.9 billion, up 7.5% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.3% of sales, an improvement of 240 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 22.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $571 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.5%. Shifting to 2022, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $14 and $14.20, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $4.74 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $60 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.8% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect Immunology Global sales to grow double digits, including U.S. Humira growth of 8%, International Humira revenue of $2.6 billion at current exchange rates, Skyrizi Global sales of $4.4 billion and Rinvoq Global sales of $2.7 billion. In hematologic oncology, we expect Venclexta global sales of $2.3 billion and Imbruvica global revenue of $5.4 billion. The Imbruvica forecast assumes market recovery in CLL, offset by share erosion from increased competition. For aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.9 billion, including $2.6 billion for Botox Cosmetic and $1.7 billion from Juvederm. For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of $6.9 billion, including Botox Therapeutic sales of $2.7 billion, Vraylar sales of $2.2 billion, Ubrelvy sales of $800 million and Qulipta sales of $200 million with commercial access increasing rapidly in the first half of the year. For eye care, we expect global sales of $2.9 billion, including $700 million from Restasis, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2022. Lastly, we expect Mavyret global revenue of $1.7 billion. Looking at the P&L for 2022, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.8 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $12.7 billion. This guidance includes approximately $2.5 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting the adjusted operating margin ratio to expand by 120 basis points to approximately 51.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense approaching $2.2 billion, our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.7% and our share count to be roughly flat to 2021. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.5 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas: Immunology sales of $6.2 billion, HemOnc revenue of $1.7 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion and eye care sales of $900 million. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 51% of sales, and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.10 and $3.14, excluding approximately $1.22 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie\u2019s strong business performance and outlook continue to support our capital allocation priorities. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $24 billion in 2022, which is net of roughly $1 billion in Skyrizi royalty payments. This cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 250% since inception; continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down just above $12 billion of debt in 2022 and estimate a net leverage ratio of 1.8 times by the end of the year. Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development, with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative therapies. In closing, we are very pleased to AbbVie\u2019s strong results in 2021. And we expect to deliver robust performance in 2022 and over the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we\u2019ll take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I just have a couple here digging into Rinvoq in a little bit more detail. I guess, first in rheumatoid arthritis, can you just -- it looks like volumes have plateaued a little bit. It\u2019s probably not hugely surprising given label revision, but just elaborate a little bit more on the feedback you\u2019re getting from physicians there. And when you anticipate you\u2019ll start to see sequential growth again in that indication? The second question I had on Rinvoq was then on atopic derm. Just elaborate again a little bit more on the ramp you\u2019re expecting here. Is this something that\u2019s going to take some time, or do you view that there\u2019s some low-hanging fruit maybe with some of the DP failures? I\u2019m really just trying to get to with all of these is, I guess, the $2.7 billion guidance, how much of that\u2019s RA? How much of it is new indication? Just a little bit more color on that front. Thanks so much.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Thanks. Hi. It\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll give you some sense on what\u2019s happening with RA. So, the RA market after the drug safety and label is progressing as we anticipated. So, I\u2019ll give you some sense, and I\u2019ll refer to sort of in-play share because you have to be a little bit careful in the December, January time frame with overall volumes in the market. But right before the Drug Safety Communication, we had about a 16% in-place share in RA, which was just right behind Humira. So very, very strong. If we look at where that\u2019s trended over the fourth quarter, it\u2019s dropped about 20%. Okay? So, it\u2019s about 14 reported in October, just over 13 in November, very consistent with what we thought would happen. So, about a 20% shift in new-to-brand starts over that time period. And what we see from the market is it\u2019s exactly as we would expect, very, very stable, no change really in second-line plus and doctors start to suppress their starts in first-line consistent with the label. So, what we\u2019re going to see is that as basically the promotion kicks back in here after December in the first quarter, we\u2019re going to see that type of stability, which we can see is very, very clear from our overall share in our weeklies and start to progress as we shift and pivot towards that second-line plus. So, the market is responding very similar to our expectations that we\u2019ve been talking about in terms of overall RA. Obviously, PsA is going to help build upon that RA dynamic and then ultimately, later in the year, the big axial approvals as well. So, everything is progressing as we thought it would progress from a market perspective. In terms of atopic dermatitis, listen, I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re very pleased with the label. We have those stringent endpoints of the EASI 90, the high skin clearance, very powerful itch reduction are reflected in our label. We obviously have both doses approved. The market, I can tell you, has been very pleasantly surprised about the adolescent indication, which is -- it\u2019s very important. So, that\u2019s basically -- we\u2019re going to start to see that ramp. It won\u2019t -- we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be slow. And to your point, in terms of our ability to start to capture patients, it\u2019s happening already. We obviously haven\u2019t reported any of the TRxs yet, but we can see it in the market. And typically, it\u2019s falling into a couple of areas. First, dupi failures, not a surprise, and there\u2019s a reasonably significant number of people after 4 or 5 years that just have failed and exited the market. They\u2019re going to come back in. We have reports from our research and our teams over partial responders to dupi that just aren\u2019t doing well, in particular with the itch. We see some early starts there. And then, of course, challenging patients in general, we are seeing starts there as well with those higher levels of skin involvement. So the market seems to be progressing as we expected. It\u2019s not surprising that as we look at the development of the second-line market, we\u2019re going to see initially most of the starts in the dupi partial responders or the nonresponders, which is a fairly significant population. Also, as I mentioned, that we will start to see our access ramp fairly quickly here over the first part of the year. So, we\u2019re encouraged. Maybe I can turn it over to Rob to give a sense over the relative magnitude of the sales.\nRob Michael: Thanks, Jeff. Chris, this is Rob. So of the Rinvoq guidance of $2.7 billion, the AD and spine indications will each contribute a couple of hundred million dollars, while UC will contribute around $100 million. And to keep in mind in terms of sequential growth, keep in mind, in the U.S., you tend to see from Q4 to Q1, it\u2019s a sequential decline. So that\u2019s just a seasonal dynamic that we see across the business. So you would see sequential growth resume in Q2 and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: First question is around Humira. I was wondering if you guys will be in a position to give us some sort of a floor number in 2023 based on payer contracts. Sometimes this year, obviously, the market is looking for that. And then, when I talk to payers, it seems a lot of the decisions about what product they would use longer term will not happen in 2023. That will happen in 2024. You kind of talked about kind of like a decline and then a quick ramp-up. Do you see the floor here in 2023, or do you see it in 2024? And then, if I could sneak one more. You have one of the largest differences between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in the industry because of that Allergan acquisition. As you look at the amortization period and so forth, when do you think this thing will begin to narrow in a significant way just because that\u2019s a concern for some investors?\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Ronny, this is Rick Gonzalez. I\u2019ll take the Humira questions. I think if you look at the guidance we provided thus far, I mean, I think that\u2019s consistent with how we see the market playing out overall. We\u2019ve said basically you should be thinking about 45% erosion, plus or minus 10%, that\u2019s probably a reasonable range. Nothing has really given us any indication that it should be different than that at this point. I think we will be in a position as we move later on this year to potentially be able to provide some more specificity around that. We should be through all of the contracting at that point, in a better position to be able to understand the ramp and the change that will occur over that period of time, and we certainly want to provide guidance when we have confidence that we can give you a high degree of specificity of what that guidance looks like. As it relates to your question about floor for Humira, I think your question is, will the floor for Humira be in \u201823 or \u201824. And I believe you\u2019ll see further erosion from \u201823 to \u201824 on the Humira business alone. But what we have described is we returned to growth on the overall business. So, you have to think about it from the perspective of this underlying growth engine that gets suppressed in \u201823 by the significant erosion that you see around Humira, both price and some volume. And then, as that continues, it continues at a slower pace when we get into \u201824. So, the overall business has the ability to be able to drive growth for the total Company. But yes, Humira would continue to decline in \u201824. And then Rob, why don\u2019t you cover the third one?\nRob Michael: Sure, Ronny, this is Rob. So when you look at our adjustments to specified intangible amortization, I\u2019d say intangible amortization is like 70% of it and this is on the $4.74 guidance that we\u2019ve given this year. And that will continue. Obviously, those things fall off over a number of years. But I would say that\u2019s probably a level that I would assume would be present for the next several years. Another big component is kind of the contingent consideration given that we\u2019re -- that\u2019s purchase accounting, and we record that accretion as such, that will certainly fluctuate over time. But I\u2019d say those are the two biggest components of the guide this year. And certainly, integration costs are starting to wind down, so you would expect to see those come down. But it is going down from last year. And so you would expect it potentially trend down. But overall, I think you can model this level going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi.\nAndrew Baum: A couple of questions. Firstly, on Imbruvica. As we move into 2022 and the COVID dynamic shakes out, we\u2019ll be able to see the impact of competition versus COVID. Assuming that a significant chunk of the U.S. slowing growth rate or decline is due to competition, what can be done to recoup the momentum against the narrative, particularly of Calquence? And then second, in terms of your aesthetics business, you terminated your contract with Medytox liquid formulation. There are competitive products coming to market as well as increasing price competition. How much of that is concerned or as your franchise and the breadth of the portfolio enough to minimize any impact of novel formulations? Thank you.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, Andrew, it\u2019s Jeff. So, thanks. And you\u2019re right that we still have the continuing lingering effect with COVID, and Rob addressed that in his comments. So, we still see the market versus \u201819 levels down about 10% and even marginally down from 2020 in Q4. So we anticipate that that will moderate go forward. And then we\u2019re left to manage the competitive impact. So, we are seeing competitive BTKs have some impact on Imbruvica, but we\u2019re also seeing the competitive impact from our own Venclexta. So we have to start to think about looking at the combination of the AbbVie position, which is still very, very strong. To give you some sense in second-line, we have 45% share of the market, and it\u2019s even higher in third-line, and it\u2019s in the 30s for frontline. So, we have to continue, which is our strategy to highlight where we have a lot of distinction, which is the strength of our data across every comparator in CLL, the overall survival benefit, and then also bring the strength of our overall portfolio. So, that\u2019s how we plan to mitigate it. As Rob mentioned, we see market recovery offset by some share pressure on Imbruvica, mitigated by positive Ven impact. So, that\u2019s how we see the market develop as we go into 2022. We also are seeing some pricing pressure in some select segments that are also contributing to the share loss for Imbruvica. And obviously, we -- as much as we can, we keep the pricing discipline in the market moving forward. So, I hope that context helps.\nRick Gonzalez: Andrew, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the Aesthetics questions for you. And certainly, as you look at Botox, both here in the U.S. and internationally, it competes today against a significant number of competitive alternatives that are available. I think it\u2019s a pretty impressive position that Botox has in the market. When you look at the brand equity that it has, when you look at the confidence that injectors have in using the product, they tend to describe it as the most forgiving of all the toxins that they have experience with. And then there\u2019s obviously a fairly significant customer loyalty aspect to Botox with the loyalty programs and Allergan has a very significant loyalty program that offers patients incentives to be able to use the product and to go back and get repeat procedures. Having said all of that, we feel confident in the position that we have competitively against the competitive alternatives that we see out there and those that we see coming. We have a very active R&D effort in the aesthetics R&D group now that\u2019s looking at next-generation toxins. Two in particular that we highlighted in the comments earlier are we had a short-acting toxin that\u2019s in development that\u2019s progressing very nicely, and we have a true long-acting toxin that\u2019s in development as well. And we believe that those will help grow the market. But, if I look at the market now, obviously, we\u2019ve seen significant acceleration in the market since we\u2019ve activated many of the strategies that we put in place after acquiring Allergan. But if I look at our overall share, overall share has stayed very steady, in fact, might have ticked up one point in the latest set of data. So, that tells you that we\u2019re not only growing the market very rapidly but we\u2019re continuing to compete quite effectively against the alternatives that are out there. So, I\u2019m not overly concerned about what I see on the horizon. I think, we have the opportunity to build the market even larger with some of the next generation toxins that we\u2019re working on when we bring those to the marketplace. So, I feel good about our position in toxins and in fillers as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities.\nVamil Divan: So, a couple. I always appreciate all the guidance. You guys gave both near term and longer term. Just a couple of questions I have related to more of the longer-term guidance you\u2019ve given. In the past, you had talked about your HemOnc franchise sort of in peak sales or sales I guess in 2025 of around $13 billion. When you updated some of your numbers earlier last month, I don\u2019t think you updated that one. So, I\u2019m just curious if you still think that that\u2019s a reasonable sort of 2025 expectation? And then, the other one is around Ubrelvy, where you\u2019ve sort of stayed with this guidance of sort of more than $1 billion in peak sales. But you\u2019re already guiding to $800 million of sales just in this current year, pretty early in the launch. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you can maybe give a little better sense of how you\u2019re viewing sort of the longer-term opportunity for Ubrelvy and maybe if you want to mention Qulipta, I know that\u2019s early, but at least for Ubrelvy, do you think there\u2019s significant upside to that $1 billion number you\u2019ve mentioned before? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Vamil, this is Rick. So, I\u2019ll cover the first one, and then I\u2019m going to have Jeff cover the Ubrelvy question that you\u2019ve asked. So, it\u2019s a good question. Obviously, the HemOnc market in the areas that we participate in, in particular, I would say CLL has changed over the last several years. I think one of the -- certainly, one of the things that was not ever anticipated in that guidance was the impact that COVID would have on the market and the reduction that we saw in the number of new patients, which was quite sizable. And that obviously wasn\u2019t contemplated in it. And the second thing is we are seeing certainly more competitive pressure, both from price and some volume than we anticipated in that time frame. Having said all of that and -- well, I\u2019d say a third item is, certainly, Venclexta is performing well as well. And I\u2019d say, it\u2019s tended to exceed some of our expectations, at least at this point within the launch trajectory of the brand. So, all of those have factors in what we\u2019re describing here. I\u2019d also say we have done a nice job of building out our HemOnc portfolio from an R&D standpoint. When I look at some of those assets that I described in my opening comments, I think they\u2019re going to have a very significant opportunity. As an example, one that I didn\u2019t mention there would be Venclexta and the t(11;14) multiple myeloma population. That could be a very significant opportunity, we feel good about that. We should get a readout on that. And we think that could be a significant contributor to both improvement in in-patient therapy, but also a significant improvement in the overall revenue in the franchise. And then, you have things like Navitoclax and epcoritamab and 383, those are all significant opportunities to be able to drive growth. So, I still feel confident in the overall ability for us to grow our HemOnc franchise. Having said that, I would say, Imbruvica is under more pressure than we anticipated. When we put that guidance out, at that point, we didn\u2019t even contemplate a follow-on BTKs in any meaningful way. But we do see more competitive pressure there. But overall, I\u2019d say, I still feel very confident in our ability to be able to grow that, that will be a growth franchise for the Company over the long term.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Hi Vamil, it\u2019s Jeff. So, just to answer your question on Ubrelvy in the overall market. Certainly, we\u2019re very pleased, as I mentioned in my remarks, over the momentum on Ubrelvy. We continue to lead in that acute space. And the early results for Qulipta are also very strong. Now, a lot of it is going to depend on how that CGRP market develops. So, if you think about it in this way, and this is how we think about it is, is it\u2019s about in terms of new patient capture for the total Ubrelvy market, where we also compete with another player from Biohaven. It\u2019s about 18% to 19% of the market. And the market is also with the expanded triptan market, of course. So, if you look at that, the payers certainly like you to step through one or more triptans. When you look at the population that may not be eligible for a triptan or fails a triptan, the estimates are typically up to 30% to 35%. And so, the market has potential room to sort of double into that epidemiology. So, you can kind of run the numbers there. I mean, we often get the question, is it over $1 billion? Is it closer to $1 billion or is it closer to a higher number. But nonetheless, we\u2019re pleased. Certainly, it\u2019s exceeded our expectations so far, and Qulipta has as well. So, I think there\u2019s more room for the market to run, but we\u2019ll have to see. I mean, there are payer pressures in the market, as I mentioned, in terms of the step-through therapy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: I have a couple of questions. At a high level, I struggle to understand why 2022 won\u2019t be a stronger year than the guide on the earnings line. Skyrizi and Botox are doing phenomenally. Rinvoq is holding its own. Humira will still be exclusive in the U.S. for the whole year and should be at peak profitability and the pandemic less an obstacle. So, why won\u2019t 2022 look more like or even better than 2021 in terms of earnings power? And secondly, there was no mention of the CF program even in the upcoming milestones. Any thoughts on the timing of the triplet data? In the past, I would describe AbbVie confidence as being no more than moderate. Has it changed one way or the other?\nRick Gonzalez: Steve, this is Rick. Maybe Rob and I will tag team your first question, and then Michael will cover your second question. I think if I look at 2022 and I look at our overall performance coming off of a strong year in 2021, it\u2019s pretty impressive performance. When I look at the EPS growth, certainly, do we have an opportunity to drive it harder? I can tell you, every year, we endeavor to drive it as hard as we can drive it. And when I look at all of the businesses individually, and I look at their ability to be able to perform, I\u2019m extremely confident in the trajectory that we have going forward. Specifically, we\u2019re assuming as an example, in HCV that there\u2019s still a COVID impact in HCV. So, I wouldn\u2019t say the pandemic is completely gone in 2022. But, I\u2019d say, overall, the brands are performing well. We\u2019re investing in the business to ensure that we continue to be able to drive long-term performance. And so certainly, that obviously drives some expectations around what the EPS growth will be year-over-year. I don\u2019t know, Rob, anything you\u2019d like to add?\nRob Michael: I mean, I think it\u2019s a good point and that we are fully investing to support the long-term growth. If you think about we\u2019re launching AD, that\u2019s a new area for us. Qulipta and Vuity, we\u2019re also going to fully invest there. Aesthetics, we\u2019ve seen that the strength of the investment in aesthetics in the way we\u2019ve been able to grow the market. So that\u2019s really important. At the same time, we\u2019re expanding operating margin. We\u2019re exceeding our expectations for synergies. And so, you\u2019re seeing us deliver another year of operating margin expansion. So, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re top tier in operating margin, very healthy P&L profile. And then, the other thing that you probably have to factor in here is that we\u2019ve assumed half year Restasis as well. We don\u2019t really have visibility to the generic until we make an assumption every time we update guidance six months out. So that\u2019s something that if you look at year-over-year that you should figure into your comparisons. But overall, we\u2019re very pleased with delivering double-digit growth in earnings and seeing another year of very strong operating margin expansion while fully investing to support the growth of the business.\nMichael Severino: And this is Mike. I\u2019ll take the question on CF. I think, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that this is a pre proof-of-concept program that doesn\u2019t contribute in any meaningful way to our long-term outlook and doesn\u2019t factor into our thinking about the long-term potential in the pipeline. And the way we have discussed it is consistent with that view. We\u2019ve always said that it represents significant upside if it were to hit, but it\u2019s an early program. With respect to the timing of the data, we continue to track towards the timing that we\u2019ve described previously. We would expect to have data from the triple, sufficient to enable a go/no-go decision later on this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: A couple of questions. I\u2019m guessing that as we move through 2022, investors are going to start to have some concerns about 2023 earnings, what the impact from Humira could be, and you talked about having more visibility on Humira contracting later this year. My question is, is it possible you\u2019ll actually give us 2023 earnings guidance sometime this year, like at Q3 results as an example? And then, my second question, just going back to CF data. You said in mid-November that you would actually have that data in-house by the end of the year. So, here we are four weeks later, we haven\u2019t really seen anything. My question is, do you actually have that data in-house? Did you hit that timeline of end of year, if not, what\u2019s going on? And what changed in that short window?\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Tim, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover your first question. Mike can address the second one. We certainly are in a position now to be able to commit that we would give earnings guidance in the third quarter. I think clearly, we\u2019ll be able to give a better feel for what that erosion curve looks like. And could that ultimately end up being at least a pretty good perspective for us to be able to build off of what earnings guidance would look like. It might. I think if we\u2019re in a position where we can confidently provide that guidance, we would provide it. But I certainly think we\u2019ll be in a position where we have very good visibility as to what that erosion curve will look like. And at that point, we can tighten it a bit and be able to provide a higher level of specificity. We understand it\u2019s an important issue for investors. As far as EPS is concerned, in 2023, we have said that we expect EPS to decline in 2023. So, I don\u2019t think any investor is -- that would be a surprise to any investor. But obviously, it\u2019s important for us to be able to frame it as accurately as we can for the investment community and be able to provide direction around that. And at the point at which we think we can do that in a reliable way, we\u2019re committed to be able to do that. So, let\u2019s see how it plays out. And certainly, as we get to the third quarter call, that would be the position at -- the point at which I think we\u2019d be in a position to be able to provide more clarity. Mike?\nMichael Severino: So, on CF, what we said towards the end of last year is that data would begin to come in-house around the end of the year, and we would have sufficient data to make a go/no-go in the first quarter. And we\u2019re still tracking to that overall timeline. There were some challenges towards the end of the year, where a number of patients were expected from Australia, for example, and Australia shut down because of COVID and we had to shift that enrollment. So, we perhaps have slightly less data than we would have hoped to have had at this point in the year. But again, we\u2019re still tracking to be able to make that go/no-go decision by the end of the year, because it\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are short studies. And so once you get those patients in, you can turn the data around and make a decision pretty quickly. But the overall timing hasn\u2019t changed substantially from what we described at the end of last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Congrats on the quarter. Maybe a question on Rinvoq and other oral competition and competitors in IBD, where do you see Rinvoq fitting versus other orals such as SNP [ph] inhibitor? I mean, now they are more than -- there could be more than one. And KOL, I mean they kind of suggested some kind of induction with one drug in maintenance with other drugs, a kind of treatment paradigm in IBD. Do you think it is even a possibility in any of these diseases? Thank you.\nMichael Severino: I think -- this is Mike. I\u2019ll take that question. If you look at the performance of Rinvoq and inflammatory bowel diseases, both in UC where we have the full data set and in Crohn\u2019s disease, where we have an important component of the induction data set, the performance across the board is very, very strong. Not only in terms of just overall response rates that are measured, but particularly when one looks at deeper measures of response, clinical remission, mucosal healing, major clinical response, which is the combination of remission and endoscopic improvement. And across the board, we\u2019re driving very high levels of disease control. And we think that feature of the drug, combined with the overall benefit risk position us to compete very effectively against not only oral competitors but many competitors, all competitors in the field. When we look at those data to our eye, given the limitations of cross-study comparisons, we see response rates that just aren\u2019t paralleled in the field. And so we think that there is a very real opportunity for Rinvoq and our view of its role in IBD reflects that. With respect to mixed induction and maintenance regimens, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that there are no data to support those sorts of regimens. All of the programs look at induction, followed by maintenance, which is usually a step-down in dose from the induction dose. And that\u2019s the data set that physicians will have. Now, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that in the long term, patients often lose control and then they need to be reinduced with a new agent. And one of the very strong features of Rinvoq and quite frankly, Skyrizi also shares this characteristic, is it has very durable response. So, it does maintain response for a very long period of time in the studies that we have continued to follow, including our long-term extensions from Phase 2 and our Phase 3 program. So, we think those are also very strong attributes to the products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets.\nGary Nachman: Aesthetics has been a big source of upside in 2021. So, I\u2019m curious, did you see any real impact from Omicron in the fourth quarter? Do you see a tailwind maybe from that further recovery this year? Is that baked into the aesthetics guidance of $5.9 billion that you have for 2022? And you\u2019ve talked about high-single-digit long-term aesthetics guidance, but this year should be double digits. So, should we be thinking more along the lines of double-digit growth maybe for the next few years if you\u2019re still investing a lot in that space? And then, just one other quick one on Qulipta for the chronic migraine prevention indication. That data is coming soon sometime this quarter. So, just talk about how meaningful you think that indication will be and how that\u2019s factored into the peak targets that you talked about. Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Gary, it\u2019s a good question on Omicron in new studies because it is something we track very carefully in every major geography around the world as well as by state here in the United States. And I will tell you that at least as far as the U.S. is concerned, there has not been much of an impact on aesthetic volume, unlike what we saw when there was an actual shutdown. And obviously, you would think shutdown, you\u2019re going to see the volume go down. But I\u2019d say here, we\u2019re seeing very little impact on the volume. So, we have factored in that we don\u2019t expect a major disruption going forward. And I think the data would clearly support that that\u2019s a reasonable position to take. And as far as the business overall, I mean, I can tell you, we\u2019re very pleased with how the business is performing. I think that group is executing at a very high level. And certainly, the resourcing and the dedicated structure that we put in place, I think, are helping a lot in major geographies like the U.S. and China. We\u2019re obviously comfortable with the guide that we provided. It is an area that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in and continue to drive. And I think it\u2019s a market that I think is extremely attractive. And it\u2019s going to require both us to continue to execute and invest in it appropriately to grow the market, but also to build out more assets that meet patients\u2019 needs to be able to expand the market. And so, we\u2019ve almost doubled the R&D investment that we have in aesthetics since we took it over. And we have a number of programs that I think are very exciting programs. Some of the biostimulatory and regenerative fillers that we\u2019re working on now, I think, could be exciting opportunities like tropoelastin to be able to stimulate tropoelastin in patients using fillers is an exciting program that continues to advance. And so, it\u2019s going to require both. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re absolutely committed to continue to drive. And I think this can be, as we indicated in our comments, I think this can be a strong business for AbbVie over the long term. Jeff, do you want to cover Qulipta?\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Thanks Gary for you question on Qulipta. It\u2019s an important new indication if we see -- when we see the data and it were to be approved. And I\u2019ll give you some perspective. Obviously, we\u2019ve talked about how much we really like our portfolio of migraine. You got Botox on chronic with the injectors. Obviously, you have Qulipta right now in episodic and of course, Ubrelvy in acute. So, the Qulipta chronic gives us quite a bit of flexibility, and it\u2019s a nice catalyst. Even though episodic is a bigger market in terms of patients, obviously, chronic patients do consume a lot of medication. Largely, if you think about the market structure, you\u2019ve got injectors, meaning they inject Botox or you have non-injectors. So, to bring in the first oral that -- for people that don\u2019t choose to have a Botox-injectable practice, that\u2019s quite attractive. And we think it builds in our story over the strength of Qulipta first-in-class designed specifically for these indications. So, it\u2019s a very nice catalyst if it were to be approved. And so, we\u2019re anxiously looking forward to that. The other thing I would note, which is further off and it\u2019s obviously something that would have to play out through the studies in Mike\u2019s organization, was chronic migraine is so difficult that the potential for patients to have combination treatment. So, in other words, a Botox Therapeutic plus a simple oral drug like Qulipta could bring this concept to that segment of the market called migraine freedom where you\u2019re really trying to get the headaches down to as low as possible. And so, again, it\u2019s further off, but it shows you the flexibility that we have as we continue to build out Qulipta across our migraine portfolio. So, we\u2019re pretty excited about the potential for CM.\nOperator: Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: I just had a couple of quick ones for Rick -- or for Rob. The first one is when you look at your our modified 2025 guidance for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, were there any changes to your assumptions on duration of therapy or the pricing environment? I\u2019m just thinking about the payer landscape with many more biosimilars coming up and what impact that could have on switching or price increases. And then, the second question is on the BD front. We\u2019ve obviously seen valuations come down quite a bit in SMID cap biotech in the past six months. And I know you\u2019ve usually talked about $2 billion earmarked for BD, but does the current environment make things like bringing new TAs or newer technologies in-house more attractive? Thanks so much.\nRick Gonzalez: Rob?\nRob Michael: Yes, Geoff. So obviously, when we go through our long-range plan, we consider the various dynamics of the pricing environment. So, we factor that into our 2025 guidance. I would not say that there\u2019s really been an assumption change for duration of therapy. But we did -- we certainly took into account the impact of label on RA, AD and SpA, but then that was offset by the stronger performance at OUS as well as the stronger IBD data that we saw for Rinvoq and just the overall performance of Skyrizi in psoriasis. It was all factored into that updated guidance, but we did not make an assumption change for duration of therapy, and we certainly factor in various pricing assumptions as we go through our long-range plan.\nRick Gonzalez: Yes. And maybe Mike and I will tag team number two. I mean, certainly, as we -- you\u2019ve seen us pay down debt at a very significant pace. We\u2019re continuing to commit to pay down significant debt this year. And we\u2019ll certainly be in a position where we could do larger opportunities if that was something that we desired and we thought it was the right kind of opportunity as we move forward in \u201823 and \u201824. Certainly, the $2 billion that we\u2019ve allocated has been sufficient to be able to cover the things that we\u2019re looking for. Mike has responsibility for business development. So, I think it\u2019s probably a little closer to the valuation question. Mike?\nMichael Severino: Well, what I would say is that valuations have certainly come down, and that brings opportunities into the focus that might previously been outside of that range of $2 billion a year that we had contemplated. And as Rick said, as we pay down debt, we have some more flexibility. But we\u2019re going to continue to look at BD in the same way that we always have, which is that it is an important component of adding innovation to our pipeline and needs to be coupled with our internal innovation. So, we\u2019re going to match what\u2019s out there. The innovation we see, the therapeutic areas that are most promising with what\u2019s going on in our early pipeline and use that to make sure that, overall, we have a very strong and very innovative pipeline. And you can see that, for example, in the way that we have built our HemOnc franchise, where we have a nice blend of internally discovered and partnered programs from Venclexta and Imbruvica, obviously, our lead programs to the significant programs behind that, things like Navitoclax, epcoritamab, 383 and now Teliso-V demonstrating extremely strong data in non-small cell lung cancer. So, that\u2019s a blend of internal and external innovation. And we\u2019re going to continue to look at areas in that same way. And it\u2019s principally going to be the fit for our overall situation, the strength of the innovation and that balance between internal and external innovation that we look at.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore.\nJosh Schimmer: First, I\u2019m a little surprised the contingent consideration adjustment is not higher considering your recently revised Skyrizi forecast. Am I not understanding that line correctly, or should we be expecting a more meaningful revision in the first quarter? And then, you mentioned a couple of times the novel biostimulatory dermal fillers you have in the aesthetics pipeline. Can you elaborate on how you expect those to differentiate versus the current offering and whether you expect those to expand the market for fillers?\nRob Michael: Josh, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take your first question. So, we did actually record in Q2 of last year, additional accretion for higher sales forecast for Skyrizi, and that was really tied to both our long-range plan as well as because it\u2019s a fair value measure. You have to take external forecast into account. And obviously, Street numbers had moved up as well. We came out with publicly with the updated guidance in December, but we already contemplated that in our contingent consideration accretion in Q2 of last year. So, that\u2019s already accounted for.\nRick Gonzalez: So, on the biostimulatory fillers, I think the way to think about it, there are multiple programs, but I\u2019ll talk about two areas specifically. Certainly, one of the areas that you want to be able to look at is your ability to be able to stimulate collagen so that your own body can produce collagen to be able to provide support and filling in a specific area that you desire. And there are some products on the market today that provide that. One of the negatives of those products is you don\u2019t get the immediate filling effect that you normally get with a filler, where you get physical filling immediately upon the procedure. You get a little bit of swelling that occurs. So, for a very short period of time, you will get what looks to be filling, but then that swelling goes down. And then for a period of time, the patient has to wait in order for them to get the collagen impact, and that takes a significant period of time. So we have a technology in-house that we acquired, and we\u2019re further developing that combines both physical filling and collagen stimulation in one product. So, you get the immediate filling effect of a normal filler. And then, as that starts to resolve over time, you get the collagen impact that\u2019s building over that same period of time to provide long-term filling. So, I would say that most of these technologies that we\u2019re working on are market expansion opportunities, so that\u2019s one example. The second example would be one of the areas that is important for patients is what we describe as skin quality, the smoothness of your skin essentially. And one of the things that provides smoothness of your skin is the elasticity of the skin. So, tropoelastin is an example of a product that we have in development that will allow the body to be able to produce more elastin. So, you can inject this product and it will provide, we believe, we have to prove this in the clinical studies, that would provide not only some level, not a dramatic level of filling but an ability to be able to provide elastin information along those areas and be able to smooth the skin out. That would clearly be a market expansion opportunity, today there really aren\u2019t fillers that do that. They can stretch the skin with the physical filling, but they don\u2019t really provide smoothing of the skin. And so, those are two examples of what we\u2019re working on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.\nChris Raymond: Just two questions. First on the migraine franchise. I noticed that you have a Phase 3 trial looking at Qulipta in Botox in a combo therapy for migraine -- for chronic migraine prevention. Our doc checks indicate actually growing interest, docs sort of highlight that as proactively is something they\u2019re interested in. I guess, was this trial in response to that feedback or maybe just talk about the rationale and how you\u2019re looking at combo in the space? And then, just a question on a drug that doesn\u2019t come up that you just launched, Vuity. Presbyopia represents a huge TAM. Maybe just talk about initial uptake trends and what is it about this market, I guess, that you\u2019re seeing that you\u2019re not making a bigger deal out of this launch? Thanks.\nMichael Severino: So, this is Mike. I\u2019ll start with the question on Qulipta and Botox combo use and then Jeff may want to add and take the second question. With respect to that combination, it really goes back to what Jeff said before, this concept of migraine freedom. If you think about chronic migraine, these are patients who have 15 or more migraine days a month. That\u2019s a migraine every other day, and these are debilitating attacks. So a substantial reduction in that is great. But, what patients and physicians are really seeking is an elimination of the migraine so that they can be free to go across their daily lives, to go about their daily lives. And given the options that are out there today to really get to that level in those most severely affected patients. Combination therapy is an obvious place to go, particularly when it\u2019s complementary approaches that work through different mechanisms. And so you would expect their effects to be independent and additive. And where you have a treatment like Botox, it has a long track record, is infrequently administered and has a long duration. So, it\u2019s that thinking that led to that combination trial. And I do think we would also agree that there is significant interest in treating physicians around these approaches.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Just to add to that, that\u2019s exactly right, is the -- it\u2019s so logical and there\u2019s so much unmet need, to Mike\u2019s point, in chronic migraine with half a month, sometimes these migraines last for days. And so there\u2019s a lot of desperation. And when the thought leaders and the headache specialists see the impact of Botox and how simple Qulipta is and how strong that is, they go right there. So I think we are encouraged, as Mike mentioned, to sort of see the outcome of those studies for migraine freedom. It would -- if it works, it would be a real advance for patients.\nRick Gonzalez: And so on Vuity, you\u2019re right, we didn\u2019t comment on this meeting. You typically wouldn\u2019t comment on a product that\u2019s -- of this size. And I mean, it\u2019s a very interesting product. I think it clearly has a unique fit in the market. I\u2019ll have -- I\u2019ll let Jeff talk a little bit about the total available market, what we see as far as the size of that market going forward. But the reason we didn\u2019t highlight it is, like I said, if we look at what we think peak sales will be here, it\u2019s not a product of the magnitude that we would typically highlight.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. And what we see is that there is excitement about Vuity. I mean it\u2019s different than the -- obviously, the market is basically over-the-counter or prescription high glasses or readers, right? So, this is the first ever product that basically is a drop or a reading drop, right? So, when we start to break down the data and you take a really, really big market, tens and tens of millions of patients with presbyopia. But we also largely see from the clinical study, it really works the best for moderate to severe younger people, not older people. So, as we basically make the cuts, it\u2019s still a substantial market size, but it\u2019s not as large as you might think if you just look at all the presbyopes that are better in the United States. But nonetheless, it\u2019s early days where we have a sales force that\u2019s calling on our optometrist, also ophthalmologists. What we see from the early results is significant interest. We haven\u2019t started our big consumer push, which will come later, later in this quarter. It is an older glaucoma product that\u2019s been reformulated. So, there\u2019s a little bit of learning from the ophthalmologists who really understand glaucoma products. But overall, the early results are it works, it works as anticipated. It works quickly within 15 minutes. It lasts for 6 to 8 hours. And so, again, when we look at the price point, it\u2019s not a reimbursed product. It\u2019s a cash pay product. We have, to Rick\u2019s point, fairly modest expectations. And we\u2019ll continue to watch the trajectory here over the next quarter or so.\nRick Gonzalez: I think the big assumption that you have to look at here is, what is the utilization per month the patient would actually use it for. I mean, as an example, I keep bugging the guys that I have to go get a prescription for it. Now, what do I want it for? When I go to a restaurant, I have trouble reading in low light. So, I\u2019ll use it for that purpose. And so, it\u2019s very difficult to come up with what the frequency at which it will be used. If it\u2019s used in a high frequency, it will obviously be a bigger product. If it\u2019s used at a relatively low frequency, it will be smaller product. So, we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out.\nLiz Shea: Operator, we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, two for me, if I may. So first, on epco, could you just comment around your confidence around accelerated approval here in DLBCL and how you\u2019re thinking about that opportunity in the near term? And then, on Vraylar, maybe just comment on what FDA conversations are ongoing there and how you\u2019re thinking about the potential for an AdCom or not.\nMichael Severino: So, on epco, we have a high degree of confidence in epco overall. It continues to deliver very strong results, high overall response rates, very deep responses, good complete response rates across a number of indications, DLBCL and follicular lymphoma both. With respect to the confidence in accelerated approval for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, when we look at the data, we think it clearly exceeds the benchmarks of available therapies in highly pre-treated refractory patients. So, we would think that accelerated approval should be supported by those data, will allow the data to continue to mature from the expansion cohorts and have our final regulatory discussions later on this year to set up that accelerated approval submission. So, it certainly is in our planning, and we think it\u2019s very supportable based on the data. With respect to confidence in Vraylar and MDD, we\u2019re confident in that -- we\u2019ve been confident. We were confident when we saw the data and looked at the strength of those data and looked at the relevant precedents for molecules that have achieved indications, not only in depression, broadly speaking, but in adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. We\u2019ve completed all of the regulatory discussions that we need to have for the submission, and we\u2019re planning the submission shortly as we described in my prepared remarks. In terms of potential for an AdCom, it\u2019s really too early to comment on that. We typically start to have those conversations with the agency a few months into the review process. But, based on the data and based on the precedence, it\u2019s not something that we would anticipate. However, if the agency were to have one, it wouldn\u2019t concern us either. We think the data package is very strong and would hold its own.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Matthew. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. If you\u2019d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s conference call.

            "name": "Jeff Stewart",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. Looking at our quarterly results, we continue to demonstrate excellent commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I\u2019ll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.7 billion, reflecting growth of 13.3% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were $5.3 billion, up 3.5%, with 6% revenue growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 8.8% on an operational basis. Skyrizi is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $900 million were up 12.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. Skyrizi has now surpassed Humira as the leader for total prescriptions in the U.S. psoriasis biological market, with share of approximately 20%. We are also now leading the market in several international geographies, including Japan. Total in-place share, which includes both new and switching patients, remains very and now, reflects roughly 37% patient share in the U.S. as well as leadership in nearly 20 key countries around the world. Skyrizi is also now approved for its second major indication, to treat adults with active psoriatic arthritis, further enhancing its compelling profile in dermatology. Field promotion is now active globally and early feedback from physicians has been very positive. Given Skyrizi\u2019s demonstrated skin clearance and joint efficacy in our PSA clinical program, with nearly 30% of patients visiting dermatologists, having both, skin and joint involvement, this new approval will sustain Skyrizi\u2019s strong momentum. In addition, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi\u2019s in Crohn\u2019s disease, an indication with very meaningful long-term revenue potential, with regulatory approvals in both, the U.S. and Europe anticipated this year. Rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $500 million were up 14% on a sequential basis. Prescriptions in RA remain strong with a total market share of more than 5.5% in the U.S. and nearly 5% across key international markets. We\u2019re very pleased with the competitive labels for both PSA and atopic dermatitis, where we are making excellent progress with their launches globally. In atopic dermatitis, dermatologists appreciate key elements of Rinvoq\u2019s new label, including the incorporation of stringent skin and itch endpoints, reflective of the performance in our registrational trials, as well as an adolescent indication and dosing flexibility. Managed care access is expected to ramp fairly quickly for both atopic dermatitis and PSA in the U.S. We are also preparing for the launches of Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis and axial SpA with regulatory approvals for both indications anticipated this year as well. Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and progress we\u2019re making with both, Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which are expected to contribute more than $15 billion in combined risk adjusted global sales in 2025. In hematologic oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 4.7% on an operational basis. Venclexta once again, delivered robust growth. Sales were up 34% on an operational basis with strong share performance across all approved indications. Imbruvica global revenues were down 2.7%, reflecting a slower than anticipated market recovery in CLL and increased share pressure from newer therapies. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 19% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth for both, Vraylar and Botox Therapeutic. I\u2019m also very pleased with our performance in migraine, where we have a portfolio of multiple distinct therapies to address the full spectrum of this disease. This includes our two leading oral CGRP therapies. Ubrelvy for acute migraine, which delivered total sales of $183 million, up 13% on a sequential basis, we anticipate robust sales growth again this year based on Ubrelvy\u2019s competitive profile, continued strong new patient starts and a rapidly expanding CGRP segment. And we also have Qulipta, the only oral CGRP treatment specifically developed for the prevention of episodic migraine. The launch is going extremely well. When considering both paid and bridge volume Qulipta is already capturing nearly 20% of the new-to-brand share in the preventative CGRP class. Roughly three months post-launch, this is an incredible accomplishment and it\u2019s a testament to Qulipta\u2019s demonstrated efficacy, including rapid and meaningful reduction in migraine days. We expect commercial access for Qulipta to ramp quickly in the first half of this year. In eye care, revenues of $960 million were up 3.9% on an operational basis, including $364 million in sales from Restasis. Lastly, Mavyret were $427 million, down 10.1% on an operational basis, as treated patient volumes remained suppressed compared to pre-COVID levels. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike? Yes. Thanks. Hi. It\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll give you some sense on what\u2019s happening with RA. So, the RA market after the drug safety and label is progressing as we anticipated. So, I\u2019ll give you some sense, and I\u2019ll refer to sort of in-play share because you have to be a little bit careful in the December, January time frame with overall volumes in the market. But right before the Drug Safety Communication, we had about a 16% in-place share in RA, which was just right behind Humira. So very, very strong. If we look at where that\u2019s trended over the fourth quarter, it\u2019s dropped about 20%. Okay? So, it\u2019s about 14 reported in October, just over 13 in November, very consistent with what we thought would happen. So, about a 20% shift in new-to-brand starts over that time period. And what we see from the market is it\u2019s exactly as we would expect, very, very stable, no change really in second-line plus and doctors start to suppress their starts in first-line consistent with the label. So, what we\u2019re going to see is that as basically the promotion kicks back in here after December in the first quarter, we\u2019re going to see that type of stability, which we can see is very, very clear from our overall share in our weeklies and start to progress as we shift and pivot towards that second-line plus. So, the market is responding very similar to our expectations that we\u2019ve been talking about in terms of overall RA. Obviously, PsA is going to help build upon that RA dynamic and then ultimately, later in the year, the big axial approvals as well. So, everything is progressing as we thought it would progress from a market perspective. In terms of atopic dermatitis, listen, I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re very pleased with the label. We have those stringent endpoints of the EASI 90, the high skin clearance, very powerful itch reduction are reflected in our label. We obviously have both doses approved. The market, I can tell you, has been very pleasantly surprised about the adolescent indication, which is -- it\u2019s very important. So, that\u2019s basically -- we\u2019re going to start to see that ramp. It won\u2019t -- we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be slow. And to your point, in terms of our ability to start to capture patients, it\u2019s happening already. We obviously haven\u2019t reported any of the TRxs yet, but we can see it in the market. And typically, it\u2019s falling into a couple of areas. First, dupi failures, not a surprise, and there\u2019s a reasonably significant number of people after 4 or 5 years that just have failed and exited the market. They\u2019re going to come back in. We have reports from our research and our teams over partial responders to dupi that just aren\u2019t doing well, in particular with the itch. We see some early starts there. And then, of course, challenging patients in general, we are seeing starts there as well with those higher levels of skin involvement. So the market seems to be progressing as we expected. It\u2019s not surprising that as we look at the development of the second-line market, we\u2019re going to see initially most of the starts in the dupi partial responders or the nonresponders, which is a fairly significant population. Also, as I mentioned, that we will start to see our access ramp fairly quickly here over the first part of the year. So, we\u2019re encouraged. Maybe I can turn it over to Rob to give a sense over the relative magnitude of the sales. Yes. Hi, Andrew, it\u2019s Jeff. So, thanks. And you\u2019re right that we still have the continuing lingering effect with COVID, and Rob addressed that in his comments. So, we still see the market versus \u201819 levels down about 10% and even marginally down from 2020 in Q4. So we anticipate that that will moderate go forward. And then we\u2019re left to manage the competitive impact. So, we are seeing competitive BTKs have some impact on Imbruvica, but we\u2019re also seeing the competitive impact from our own Venclexta. So we have to start to think about looking at the combination of the AbbVie position, which is still very, very strong. To give you some sense in second-line, we have 45% share of the market, and it\u2019s even higher in third-line, and it\u2019s in the 30s for frontline. So, we have to continue, which is our strategy to highlight where we have a lot of distinction, which is the strength of our data across every comparator in CLL, the overall survival benefit, and then also bring the strength of our overall portfolio. So, that\u2019s how we plan to mitigate it. As Rob mentioned, we see market recovery offset by some share pressure on Imbruvica, mitigated by positive Ven impact. So, that\u2019s how we see the market develop as we go into 2022. We also are seeing some pricing pressure in some select segments that are also contributing to the share loss for Imbruvica. And obviously, we -- as much as we can, we keep the pricing discipline in the market moving forward. So, I hope that context helps. Yes. Hi Vamil, it\u2019s Jeff. So, just to answer your question on Ubrelvy in the overall market. Certainly, we\u2019re very pleased, as I mentioned in my remarks, over the momentum on Ubrelvy. We continue to lead in that acute space. And the early results for Qulipta are also very strong. Now, a lot of it is going to depend on how that CGRP market develops. So, if you think about it in this way, and this is how we think about it is, is it\u2019s about in terms of new patient capture for the total Ubrelvy market, where we also compete with another player from Biohaven. It\u2019s about 18% to 19% of the market. And the market is also with the expanded triptan market, of course. So, if you look at that, the payers certainly like you to step through one or more triptans. When you look at the population that may not be eligible for a triptan or fails a triptan, the estimates are typically up to 30% to 35%. And so, the market has potential room to sort of double into that epidemiology. So, you can kind of run the numbers there. I mean, we often get the question, is it over $1 billion? Is it closer to $1 billion or is it closer to a higher number. But nonetheless, we\u2019re pleased. Certainly, it\u2019s exceeded our expectations so far, and Qulipta has as well. So, I think there\u2019s more room for the market to run, but we\u2019ll have to see. I mean, there are payer pressures in the market, as I mentioned, in terms of the step-through therapy. Yes. Thanks Gary for you question on Qulipta. It\u2019s an important new indication if we see -- when we see the data and it were to be approved. And I\u2019ll give you some perspective. Obviously, we\u2019ve talked about how much we really like our portfolio of migraine. You got Botox on chronic with the injectors. Obviously, you have Qulipta right now in episodic and of course, Ubrelvy in acute. So, the Qulipta chronic gives us quite a bit of flexibility, and it\u2019s a nice catalyst. Even though episodic is a bigger market in terms of patients, obviously, chronic patients do consume a lot of medication. Largely, if you think about the market structure, you\u2019ve got injectors, meaning they inject Botox or you have non-injectors. So, to bring in the first oral that -- for people that don\u2019t choose to have a Botox-injectable practice, that\u2019s quite attractive. And we think it builds in our story over the strength of Qulipta first-in-class designed specifically for these indications. So, it\u2019s a very nice catalyst if it were to be approved. And so, we\u2019re anxiously looking forward to that. The other thing I would note, which is further off and it\u2019s obviously something that would have to play out through the studies in Mike\u2019s organization, was chronic migraine is so difficult that the potential for patients to have combination treatment. So, in other words, a Botox Therapeutic plus a simple oral drug like Qulipta could bring this concept to that segment of the market called migraine freedom where you\u2019re really trying to get the headaches down to as low as possible. And so, again, it\u2019s further off, but it shows you the flexibility that we have as we continue to build out Qulipta across our migraine portfolio. So, we\u2019re pretty excited about the potential for CM. Yes. Just to add to that, that\u2019s exactly right, is the -- it\u2019s so logical and there\u2019s so much unmet need, to Mike\u2019s point, in chronic migraine with half a month, sometimes these migraines last for days. And so there\u2019s a lot of desperation. And when the thought leaders and the headache specialists see the impact of Botox and how simple Qulipta is and how strong that is, they go right there. So I think we are encouraged, as Mike mentioned, to sort of see the outcome of those studies for migraine freedom. It would -- if it works, it would be a real advance for patients. Yes. And what we see is that there is excitement about Vuity. I mean it\u2019s different than the -- obviously, the market is basically over-the-counter or prescription high glasses or readers, right? So, this is the first ever product that basically is a drop or a reading drop, right? So, when we start to break down the data and you take a really, really big market, tens and tens of millions of patients with presbyopia. But we also largely see from the clinical study, it really works the best for moderate to severe younger people, not older people. So, as we basically make the cuts, it\u2019s still a substantial market size, but it\u2019s not as large as you might think if you just look at all the presbyopes that are better in the United States. But nonetheless, it\u2019s early days where we have a sales force that\u2019s calling on our optometrist, also ophthalmologists. What we see from the early results is significant interest. We haven\u2019t started our big consumer push, which will come later, later in this quarter. It is an older glaucoma product that\u2019s been reformulated. So, there\u2019s a little bit of learning from the ophthalmologists who really understand glaucoma products. But overall, the early results are it works, it works as anticipated. It works quickly within 15 minutes. It lasts for 6 to 8 hours. And so, again, when we look at the price point, it\u2019s not a reimbursed product. It\u2019s a cash pay product. We have, to Rick\u2019s point, fairly modest expectations. And we\u2019ll continue to watch the trajectory here over the next quarter or so."

            "name": "Rob Michael",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. AbbVie once again delivered outstanding performance while also advancing our strategic priorities. The strong results across our portfolio continue to support AbbVie\u2019s long-term growth outlook. Starting with fourth quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.31, up 13.4% compared to prior year and $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.9 billion, up 7.5% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.3% of sales, an improvement of 240 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 22.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $571 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.5%. Shifting to 2022, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $14 and $14.20, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $4.74 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $60 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.8% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect Immunology Global sales to grow double digits, including U.S. Humira growth of 8%, International Humira revenue of $2.6 billion at current exchange rates, Skyrizi Global sales of $4.4 billion and Rinvoq Global sales of $2.7 billion. In hematologic oncology, we expect Venclexta global sales of $2.3 billion and Imbruvica global revenue of $5.4 billion. The Imbruvica forecast assumes market recovery in CLL, offset by share erosion from increased competition. For aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.9 billion, including $2.6 billion for Botox Cosmetic and $1.7 billion from Juvederm. For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of $6.9 billion, including Botox Therapeutic sales of $2.7 billion, Vraylar sales of $2.2 billion, Ubrelvy sales of $800 million and Qulipta sales of $200 million with commercial access increasing rapidly in the first half of the year. For eye care, we expect global sales of $2.9 billion, including $700 million from Restasis, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2022. Lastly, we expect Mavyret global revenue of $1.7 billion. Looking at the P&L for 2022, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.8 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $12.7 billion. This guidance includes approximately $2.5 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting the adjusted operating margin ratio to expand by 120 basis points to approximately 51.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense approaching $2.2 billion, our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.7% and our share count to be roughly flat to 2021. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.5 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas: Immunology sales of $6.2 billion, HemOnc revenue of $1.7 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion and eye care sales of $900 million. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 51% of sales, and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.10 and $3.14, excluding approximately $1.22 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie\u2019s strong business performance and outlook continue to support our capital allocation priorities. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $24 billion in 2022, which is net of roughly $1 billion in Skyrizi royalty payments. This cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 250% since inception; continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down just above $12 billion of debt in 2022 and estimate a net leverage ratio of 1.8 times by the end of the year. Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development, with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative therapies. In closing, we are very pleased to AbbVie\u2019s strong results in 2021. And we expect to deliver robust performance in 2022 and over the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz. Thanks, Jeff. Chris, this is Rob. So of the Rinvoq guidance of $2.7 billion, the AD and spine indications will each contribute a couple of hundred million dollars, while UC will contribute around $100 million. And to keep in mind in terms of sequential growth, keep in mind, in the U.S., you tend to see from Q4 to Q1, it\u2019s a sequential decline. So that\u2019s just a seasonal dynamic that we see across the business. So you would see sequential growth resume in Q2 and beyond. Sure, Ronny, this is Rob. So when you look at our adjustments to specified intangible amortization, I\u2019d say intangible amortization is like 70% of it and this is on the $4.74 guidance that we\u2019ve given this year. And that will continue. Obviously, those things fall off over a number of years. But I would say that\u2019s probably a level that I would assume would be present for the next several years. Another big component is kind of the contingent consideration given that we\u2019re -- that\u2019s purchase accounting, and we record that accretion as such, that will certainly fluctuate over time. But I\u2019d say those are the two biggest components of the guide this year. And certainly, integration costs are starting to wind down, so you would expect to see those come down. But it is going down from last year. And so you would expect it potentially trend down. But overall, I think you can model this level going forward. I mean, I think it\u2019s a good point and that we are fully investing to support the long-term growth. If you think about we\u2019re launching AD, that\u2019s a new area for us. Qulipta and Vuity, we\u2019re also going to fully invest there. Aesthetics, we\u2019ve seen that the strength of the investment in aesthetics in the way we\u2019ve been able to grow the market. So that\u2019s really important. At the same time, we\u2019re expanding operating margin. We\u2019re exceeding our expectations for synergies. And so, you\u2019re seeing us deliver another year of operating margin expansion. So, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re top tier in operating margin, very healthy P&L profile. And then, the other thing that you probably have to factor in here is that we\u2019ve assumed half year Restasis as well. We don\u2019t really have visibility to the generic until we make an assumption every time we update guidance six months out. So that\u2019s something that if you look at year-over-year that you should figure into your comparisons. But overall, we\u2019re very pleased with delivering double-digit growth in earnings and seeing another year of very strong operating margin expansion while fully investing to support the growth of the business. Yes, Geoff. So obviously, when we go through our long-range plan, we consider the various dynamics of the pricing environment. So, we factor that into our 2025 guidance. I would not say that there\u2019s really been an assumption change for duration of therapy. But we did -- we certainly took into account the impact of label on RA, AD and SpA, but then that was offset by the stronger performance at OUS as well as the stronger IBD data that we saw for Rinvoq and just the overall performance of Skyrizi in psoriasis. It was all factored into that updated guidance, but we did not make an assumption change for duration of therapy, and we certainly factor in various pricing assumptions as we go through our long-range plan. Josh, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take your first question. So, we did actually record in Q2 of last year, additional accretion for higher sales forecast for Skyrizi, and that was really tied to both our long-range plan as well as because it\u2019s a fair value measure. You have to take external forecast into account. And obviously, Street numbers had moved up as well. We came out with publicly with the updated guidance in December, but we already contemplated that in our contingent consideration accretion in Q2 of last year. So, that\u2019s already accounted for."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook, and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our quarterly business highlights, pipeline progress, financial results and guidance for 2022 in more detail.  Our performances this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie with results well above our initial expectations. We delivered full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.70, representing growth of more than 20% versus the prior year. Full-year adjusted net revenues were more than $56 billion, up 10.5% on a comparable operational basis. These results demonstrate balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, aesthetics, and neuroscience. I\u2019m extremely pleased with our momentum, and we\u2019ve entered this year in a strong position, which is reflected in our guidance. We anticipate 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $14 to $14.20, representing growth of 11% at the midpoint. Longer-term, we remain well positioned with an impressive set of diversified growth assets. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are already contributing meaningful revenue, including $4.6 billion in combined sales last year with substantial growth anticipated in 2022 and beyond. Over the next few months, we expect to add several new indications to the list of approved uses for these two assets, at which point, Skyrizi and Rinvoq will be commercialized across all of Humira\u2019s major indications, plus atopic dermatitis. With the strong performance that we\u2019re seeing in their initial indications and the robust data we\u2019ve demonstrated across our broad development programs, we expect combined peak sales for Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira.  In hematological oncology, we\u2019ve established a leading position with Imbruvica and Venclexta, which were both expected to remain important revenue contributors through the decade. To support our next wave of growth, we also have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both blood cancers and solid tumors. Notable opportunities from our mid to late stage oncology pipeline include Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, which has the potential to provide disease modification in a market where current treatments only address symptoms. At Epcoritamab, a potentially best-in-class CD3XCD20 for B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL and follicular lymphoma; ABBV-383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific, which has the potential to become a best-in-class treatment in multiple myeloma; and Teliso-V, our promising c-Met ADC being studied for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, which was recently granted breakthrough therapy designation. In neuroscience, we have a portfolio of compelling and differentiated therapies to support robust long-term growth in migraine, Parkinson\u2019s disease and psychiatric conditions. Ubrelvy and Qulipta are both demonstrating strong launch trajectories in migraine, with each treatment expected to contribute more than $1 billion in peak sales. Vraylar continues to have a significant opportunity with currently approved indications with peak sales expected to approach $4 billion. An approval in major depressive disorder represents upside to our current projections. And 951, a potentially transformative improvement to our current treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease with peak sales also anticipated to be more than $1 billion. Our leading aesthetics portfolio represents another extremely attractive growth opportunity. This business is performing well above expectations, delivering full year 2021 sales of more than $5.2 billion, $700 million higher than our initial guidance. AbbVie\u2019s increased promotional investments are driving accelerated category growth, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration globally. Dedicated resources are also of focused on delivering new product innovation within aesthetics, with several exciting R&D programs internally, including both short-acting and long-acting toxins, as well as novel fillers with biostimulatory or regenerative features. And we remain active with business development to pursue promising external technologies and complementary opportunities, including the recently closed Soliton acquisition, which further expands our body contouring portfolio. Given this focus and investment, we expect our aesthetics franchise to deliver high single digit revenue growth, through the end of the decade, including sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. Lastly, we\u2019ve developed a robust pipeline, including numerous attractive late-stage programs, novel early stage therapies in a growing range of potential platform technologies, which we expect will collectively contribute to our growth through the decade. With the actions that we\u2019ve taken to diversify our sources of growth, we remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Following the U.S. Humira LOE event in 2023, we expect to quickly return to growth in 2024 and deliver high-single-digit growth from 2025 to the end of the decade. This is a testament to the strength of AbbVie\u2019s broad and balanced portfolio. In summary, this is an exciting time for our Company. We\u2019re demonstrating excellent execution across our portfolio, and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff? Okay. Ronny, this is Rick Gonzalez. I\u2019ll take the Humira questions. I think if you look at the guidance we provided thus far, I mean, I think that\u2019s consistent with how we see the market playing out overall. We\u2019ve said basically you should be thinking about 45% erosion, plus or minus 10%, that\u2019s probably a reasonable range. Nothing has really given us any indication that it should be different than that at this point. I think we will be in a position as we move later on this year to potentially be able to provide some more specificity around that. We should be through all of the contracting at that point, in a better position to be able to understand the ramp and the change that will occur over that period of time, and we certainly want to provide guidance when we have confidence that we can give you a high degree of specificity of what that guidance looks like. As it relates to your question about floor for Humira, I think your question is, will the floor for Humira be in \u201823 or \u201824. And I believe you\u2019ll see further erosion from \u201823 to \u201824 on the Humira business alone. But what we have described is we returned to growth on the overall business. So, you have to think about it from the perspective of this underlying growth engine that gets suppressed in \u201823 by the significant erosion that you see around Humira, both price and some volume. And then, as that continues, it continues at a slower pace when we get into \u201824. So, the overall business has the ability to be able to drive growth for the total Company. But yes, Humira would continue to decline in \u201824. And then Rob, why don\u2019t you cover the third one? Andrew, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the Aesthetics questions for you. And certainly, as you look at Botox, both here in the U.S. and internationally, it competes today against a significant number of competitive alternatives that are available. I think it\u2019s a pretty impressive position that Botox has in the market. When you look at the brand equity that it has, when you look at the confidence that injectors have in using the product, they tend to describe it as the most forgiving of all the toxins that they have experience with. And then there\u2019s obviously a fairly significant customer loyalty aspect to Botox with the loyalty programs and Allergan has a very significant loyalty program that offers patients incentives to be able to use the product and to go back and get repeat procedures. Having said all of that, we feel confident in the position that we have competitively against the competitive alternatives that we see out there and those that we see coming. We have a very active R&D effort in the aesthetics R&D group now that\u2019s looking at next-generation toxins. Two in particular that we highlighted in the comments earlier are we had a short-acting toxin that\u2019s in development that\u2019s progressing very nicely, and we have a true long-acting toxin that\u2019s in development as well. And we believe that those will help grow the market. But, if I look at the market now, obviously, we\u2019ve seen significant acceleration in the market since we\u2019ve activated many of the strategies that we put in place after acquiring Allergan. But if I look at our overall share, overall share has stayed very steady, in fact, might have ticked up one point in the latest set of data. So, that tells you that we\u2019re not only growing the market very rapidly but we\u2019re continuing to compete quite effectively against the alternatives that are out there. So, I\u2019m not overly concerned about what I see on the horizon. I think, we have the opportunity to build the market even larger with some of the next generation toxins that we\u2019re working on when we bring those to the marketplace. So, I feel good about our position in toxins and in fillers as we move forward. Vamil, this is Rick. So, I\u2019ll cover the first one, and then I\u2019m going to have Jeff cover the Ubrelvy question that you\u2019ve asked. So, it\u2019s a good question. Obviously, the HemOnc market in the areas that we participate in, in particular, I would say CLL has changed over the last several years. I think one of the -- certainly, one of the things that was not ever anticipated in that guidance was the impact that COVID would have on the market and the reduction that we saw in the number of new patients, which was quite sizable. And that obviously wasn\u2019t contemplated in it. And the second thing is we are seeing certainly more competitive pressure, both from price and some volume than we anticipated in that time frame. Having said all of that and -- well, I\u2019d say a third item is, certainly, Venclexta is performing well as well. And I\u2019d say, it\u2019s tended to exceed some of our expectations, at least at this point within the launch trajectory of the brand. So, all of those have factors in what we\u2019re describing here. I\u2019d also say we have done a nice job of building out our HemOnc portfolio from an R&D standpoint. When I look at some of those assets that I described in my opening comments, I think they\u2019re going to have a very significant opportunity. As an example, one that I didn\u2019t mention there would be Venclexta and the t(11;14) multiple myeloma population. That could be a very significant opportunity, we feel good about that. We should get a readout on that. And we think that could be a significant contributor to both improvement in in-patient therapy, but also a significant improvement in the overall revenue in the franchise. And then, you have things like Navitoclax and epcoritamab and 383, those are all significant opportunities to be able to drive growth. So, I still feel confident in the overall ability for us to grow our HemOnc franchise. Having said that, I would say, Imbruvica is under more pressure than we anticipated. When we put that guidance out, at that point, we didn\u2019t even contemplate a follow-on BTKs in any meaningful way. But we do see more competitive pressure there. But overall, I\u2019d say, I still feel very confident in our ability to be able to grow that, that will be a growth franchise for the Company over the long term. Steve, this is Rick. Maybe Rob and I will tag team your first question, and then Michael will cover your second question. I think if I look at 2022 and I look at our overall performance coming off of a strong year in 2021, it\u2019s pretty impressive performance. When I look at the EPS growth, certainly, do we have an opportunity to drive it harder? I can tell you, every year, we endeavor to drive it as hard as we can drive it. And when I look at all of the businesses individually, and I look at their ability to be able to perform, I\u2019m extremely confident in the trajectory that we have going forward. Specifically, we\u2019re assuming as an example, in HCV that there\u2019s still a COVID impact in HCV. So, I wouldn\u2019t say the pandemic is completely gone in 2022. But, I\u2019d say, overall, the brands are performing well. We\u2019re investing in the business to ensure that we continue to be able to drive long-term performance. And so certainly, that obviously drives some expectations around what the EPS growth will be year-over-year. I don\u2019t know, Rob, anything you\u2019d like to add? Okay. Tim, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover your first question. Mike can address the second one. We certainly are in a position now to be able to commit that we would give earnings guidance in the third quarter. I think clearly, we\u2019ll be able to give a better feel for what that erosion curve looks like. And could that ultimately end up being at least a pretty good perspective for us to be able to build off of what earnings guidance would look like. It might. I think if we\u2019re in a position where we can confidently provide that guidance, we would provide it. But I certainly think we\u2019ll be in a position where we have very good visibility as to what that erosion curve will look like. And at that point, we can tighten it a bit and be able to provide a higher level of specificity. We understand it\u2019s an important issue for investors. As far as EPS is concerned, in 2023, we have said that we expect EPS to decline in 2023. So, I don\u2019t think any investor is -- that would be a surprise to any investor. But obviously, it\u2019s important for us to be able to frame it as accurately as we can for the investment community and be able to provide direction around that. And at the point at which we think we can do that in a reliable way, we\u2019re committed to be able to do that. So, let\u2019s see how it plays out. And certainly, as we get to the third quarter call, that would be the position at -- the point at which I think we\u2019d be in a position to be able to provide more clarity. Mike? Gary, it\u2019s a good question on Omicron in new studies because it is something we track very carefully in every major geography around the world as well as by state here in the United States. And I will tell you that at least as far as the U.S. is concerned, there has not been much of an impact on aesthetic volume, unlike what we saw when there was an actual shutdown. And obviously, you would think shutdown, you\u2019re going to see the volume go down. But I\u2019d say here, we\u2019re seeing very little impact on the volume. So, we have factored in that we don\u2019t expect a major disruption going forward. And I think the data would clearly support that that\u2019s a reasonable position to take. And as far as the business overall, I mean, I can tell you, we\u2019re very pleased with how the business is performing. I think that group is executing at a very high level. And certainly, the resourcing and the dedicated structure that we put in place, I think, are helping a lot in major geographies like the U.S. and China. We\u2019re obviously comfortable with the guide that we provided. It is an area that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in and continue to drive. And I think it\u2019s a market that I think is extremely attractive. And it\u2019s going to require both us to continue to execute and invest in it appropriately to grow the market, but also to build out more assets that meet patients\u2019 needs to be able to expand the market. And so, we\u2019ve almost doubled the R&D investment that we have in aesthetics since we took it over. And we have a number of programs that I think are very exciting programs. Some of the biostimulatory and regenerative fillers that we\u2019re working on now, I think, could be exciting opportunities like tropoelastin to be able to stimulate tropoelastin in patients using fillers is an exciting program that continues to advance. And so, it\u2019s going to require both. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re absolutely committed to continue to drive. And I think this can be, as we indicated in our comments, I think this can be a strong business for AbbVie over the long term. Jeff, do you want to cover Qulipta? Rob? Yes. And maybe Mike and I will tag team number two. I mean, certainly, as we -- you\u2019ve seen us pay down debt at a very significant pace. We\u2019re continuing to commit to pay down significant debt this year. And we\u2019ll certainly be in a position where we could do larger opportunities if that was something that we desired and we thought it was the right kind of opportunity as we move forward in \u201823 and \u201824. Certainly, the $2 billion that we\u2019ve allocated has been sufficient to be able to cover the things that we\u2019re looking for. Mike has responsibility for business development. So, I think it\u2019s probably a little closer to the valuation question. Mike? So, on the biostimulatory fillers, I think the way to think about it, there are multiple programs, but I\u2019ll talk about two areas specifically. Certainly, one of the areas that you want to be able to look at is your ability to be able to stimulate collagen so that your own body can produce collagen to be able to provide support and filling in a specific area that you desire. And there are some products on the market today that provide that. One of the negatives of those products is you don\u2019t get the immediate filling effect that you normally get with a filler, where you get physical filling immediately upon the procedure. You get a little bit of swelling that occurs. So, for a very short period of time, you will get what looks to be filling, but then that swelling goes down. And then for a period of time, the patient has to wait in order for them to get the collagen impact, and that takes a significant period of time. So we have a technology in-house that we acquired, and we\u2019re further developing that combines both physical filling and collagen stimulation in one product. So, you get the immediate filling effect of a normal filler. And then, as that starts to resolve over time, you get the collagen impact that\u2019s building over that same period of time to provide long-term filling. So, I would say that most of these technologies that we\u2019re working on are market expansion opportunities, so that\u2019s one example. The second example would be one of the areas that is important for patients is what we describe as skin quality, the smoothness of your skin essentially. And one of the things that provides smoothness of your skin is the elasticity of the skin. So, tropoelastin is an example of a product that we have in development that will allow the body to be able to produce more elastin. So, you can inject this product and it will provide, we believe, we have to prove this in the clinical studies, that would provide not only some level, not a dramatic level of filling but an ability to be able to provide elastin information along those areas and be able to smooth the skin out. That would clearly be a market expansion opportunity, today there really aren\u2019t fillers that do that. They can stretch the skin with the physical filling, but they don\u2019t really provide smoothing of the skin. And so, those are two examples of what we\u2019re working on. And so on Vuity, you\u2019re right, we didn\u2019t comment on this meeting. You typically wouldn\u2019t comment on a product that\u2019s -- of this size. And I mean, it\u2019s a very interesting product. I think it clearly has a unique fit in the market. I\u2019ll have -- I\u2019ll let Jeff talk a little bit about the total available market, what we see as far as the size of that market going forward. But the reason we didn\u2019t highlight it is, like I said, if we look at what we think peak sales will be here, it\u2019s not a product of the magnitude that we would typically highlight. I think the big assumption that you have to look at here is, what is the utilization per month the patient would actually use it for. I mean, as an example, I keep bugging the guys that I have to go get a prescription for it. Now, what do I want it for? When I go to a restaurant, I have trouble reading in low light. So, I\u2019ll use it for that purpose. And so, it\u2019s very difficult to come up with what the frequency at which it will be used. If it\u2019s used in a high frequency, it will obviously be a bigger product. If it\u2019s used at a relatively low frequency, it will be smaller product. So, we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. We made significant advancement across all stages of our pipeline in 2021, and we expect continued progress again this year. In immunology, we had several recent important regulatory updates. We implemented safety and indication updates to our RA label for Rinvoq, and also received FDA approval in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis to curing strong labels that highlight Rinvoq\u2019s favorable benefit risk profile in both new indications. In atopic dermatitis, we received approval for both the 15 milligram and 30 milligram doses, and based on the impressive levels of skin clearance and itch reduction demonstrated in our development program, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new treatment option for adult and adolescent patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, who have not responded well to other systemic agents, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or biologics. We also have regulatory applications under review for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision next month for ulcerative colitis, in the second quarter for ankylosing spondylitis, and in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. In Europe, we anticipate approval decisions for ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial SpA in the second half of the year. We\u2019re nearing completion of Rinvoq\u2019s registrational program in Crohn\u2019s disease, which is the last major indication expansion program for Rinvoq. We recently announced positive top-line results from the first Phase 3 Crohn\u2019s induction study, where Rinvoq demonstrated a very impact on clinical remission and endoscopic response in a difficult-to-treat refractory patient population. We expect to see results from the second Phase 3 Crohn\u2019s induction study and from the maintenance study in the first half of this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2022. Also in immunology, we recently received FDA approval for Skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, an important indication expansion for this asset. Based on the strong joint efficacy and the high level of skin clearance that Skyrizi provided in our registrational trials, we believe Skyrizi will be very competitively positioned as an effective new treatment option for psoriatic arthritis patients. We also have regulatory applications under review for Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s disease with approval decisions expected in the U.S. next month and in Europe, later this year. We\u2019ve seen impressive results in our Crohn\u2019s disease program, and we believe Skyrizi has the potential to become an important new therapy in this market, where there continues to be considerable unmet need. We\u2019re making very good progress with our early-stage immunology pipeline as well, where we are developing novel agents with the goal of significantly advancing the standard-of-care across our core areas, by providing deeper and more durable responses. Our anti-TNF steroid ADC ABBV-154 is a novel approach for delivering a potent steroid that has the potential to provide durable remission in diseases such as RA, PMR and Crohn\u2019s disease. We expect to see preliminary data from our Phase 2 dose ranging study in RA in the fourth quarter of this year. We also expect to see Phase 2 proof-of-concept data in PMR and Crohn\u2019s disease in 2023. In dermatology, our early-stage efforts are focused on developing oral agents that can provide clear skin with durable responses. Our RoR\u03b3T inverse agonist, ABBV-157 is designed to more effectively inhibit IL-17 production compared to pure antagonists, which has the potential to result in a greater impact on skin inflammation. We\u2019ve recently been again a Phase 2 dose ranging study for 157 in psoriasis. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. We recently received an FDA breakthrough therapy designation for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced or metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer, based on the encouraging results we\u2019ve seen to-date in our clinical program. Treatment options for patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are limited to single agent chemo, which typically provides response rates of only 15% to 20%, with a median overall survival of less than one year. Prognosis for these patients is very poor. While targeted therapies have been approved by the FDA for the 3% to 4% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, there are currently no therapies approved, specifically for the much larger group of patients, who exhibit c-Met protein overexpression. Patients with overexpressed c-Met represents about 25% to 30% of the advanced or metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer population with wild-type EGFR, which corresponds to an incidence of approximately 35,000 patients each year in the U.S. In stage 1 of our Phase 2 study, we saw promising efficacy in heavily pretreated patients who received Teliso-V, including a 54% objective response rate in those with highly expressed c-Met. The second stage of the Phase 2 study is ongoing and has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second-line plus advanced metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. We expect to see additional data from this study next year. We also recently began the clinical program for our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400, which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload to potentially drive deeper tumor responses in patients with both, intermediate and high levels of c-Met expression. We also expect to see data this year from several important indication expansion programs for Venclexta, including results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation as well as results from our program for Venclexta in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, where we received a breakthrough therapy designation. We plan to submit our regulatory applications to the FDA in the first half of this year for an accelerated approval in MDS, and late in \u201822 or early \u201823 for multiple myeloma. Both indications represent important expansion opportunities for Venclexta and will help drive long-term growth for our oncology portfolio. We are also making very good progress with epcoritamab, where we continue to generate strong data in early-stage studies to support our view that epcoritamab has the potential to become a differentiated and best-in-class CD3xCD20 bispecific across several B-cell malignancies including diffuse B cell and follicular lymphomas. We\u2019ll see monotherapy data in the third quarter from the Phase 2 expansion cohort in DLBCL, which has the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We also have a Phase 3 study ongoing in third-line relapsed/refractory DLBCL and we plan to initiate several additional Phase 3 trials this year, including studies in earlier lines of therapy for diffuse B-cell lymphoma in multiple combinations, as well as in follicular lymphoma in combination with rituximab and Revlimid. This year, we\u2019ll also see additional data maturing from our cohort expansion studies for ABBV-383, both as a monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care and novel agents in multiple myeloma. We believe our BCMA-CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and can be best-in-class across multiple lines of therapy. We plan to initiate Phase 3 studies later this year in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We also continue to make good progress with Navitoclax in myelofibrosis, where we\u2019ve seen strong mid-stage data supporting our view that Navitoclax has the potential to provide disease modification, which we believe will lead to improved and durable clinical outcomes for patients. We expect a Phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the first half of next year, with approval anticipated near the end of 2023. Moving to neuroscience, where we expect several important pipeline events in 2022 as well. We recently completed discussions with the FDA and are preparing to submit our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the totality of the data and the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar has the potential to be competitively positioned as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. We expect a submission in the first quarter and an approval decision by the end of the year. We\u2019ve also completed our registration-enabling program for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. In our Phase 3 studies, 951 proved superior to oral levodopa/carbidopa in reducing motor fluctuations in this advanced population, and we believe our innovative new delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the first half of this year in the U.S. and Europe, with both approval decisions anticipated in early 2023. And we expect to see Phase 3 data for Qulipta in chronic migraine prevention later in the first quarter and plan to submit our regulatory applications in both, the U.S. and Europe this summer, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2023. So, in summary, we remain focused on continuing to execute on our pipeline programs and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones across all stages of our pipeline in 2022. This includes important indication expansion for on-market drugs and data readouts and regulatory actions for key late-stage assets as well as proof-of-concept data from several early-stage NME programs. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2022 financial outlook. Rob? And this is Mike. I\u2019ll take the question on CF. I think, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that this is a pre proof-of-concept program that doesn\u2019t contribute in any meaningful way to our long-term outlook and doesn\u2019t factor into our thinking about the long-term potential in the pipeline. And the way we have discussed it is consistent with that view. We\u2019ve always said that it represents significant upside if it were to hit, but it\u2019s an early program. With respect to the timing of the data, we continue to track towards the timing that we\u2019ve described previously. We would expect to have data from the triple, sufficient to enable a go/no-go decision later on this quarter. So, on CF, what we said towards the end of last year is that data would begin to come in-house around the end of the year, and we would have sufficient data to make a go/no-go in the first quarter. And we\u2019re still tracking to that overall timeline. There were some challenges towards the end of the year, where a number of patients were expected from Australia, for example, and Australia shut down because of COVID and we had to shift that enrollment. So, we perhaps have slightly less data than we would have hoped to have had at this point in the year. But again, we\u2019re still tracking to be able to make that go/no-go decision by the end of the year, because it\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are short studies. And so once you get those patients in, you can turn the data around and make a decision pretty quickly. But the overall timing hasn\u2019t changed substantially from what we described at the end of last year. I think -- this is Mike. I\u2019ll take that question. If you look at the performance of Rinvoq and inflammatory bowel diseases, both in UC where we have the full data set and in Crohn\u2019s disease, where we have an important component of the induction data set, the performance across the board is very, very strong. Not only in terms of just overall response rates that are measured, but particularly when one looks at deeper measures of response, clinical remission, mucosal healing, major clinical response, which is the combination of remission and endoscopic improvement. And across the board, we\u2019re driving very high levels of disease control. And we think that feature of the drug, combined with the overall benefit risk position us to compete very effectively against not only oral competitors but many competitors, all competitors in the field. When we look at those data to our eye, given the limitations of cross-study comparisons, we see response rates that just aren\u2019t paralleled in the field. And so we think that there is a very real opportunity for Rinvoq and our view of its role in IBD reflects that. With respect to mixed induction and maintenance regimens, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that there are no data to support those sorts of regimens. All of the programs look at induction, followed by maintenance, which is usually a step-down in dose from the induction dose. And that\u2019s the data set that physicians will have. Now, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that in the long term, patients often lose control and then they need to be reinduced with a new agent. And one of the very strong features of Rinvoq and quite frankly, Skyrizi also shares this characteristic, is it has very durable response. So, it does maintain response for a very long period of time in the studies that we have continued to follow, including our long-term extensions from Phase 2 and our Phase 3 program. So, we think those are also very strong attributes to the products. Well, what I would say is that valuations have certainly come down, and that brings opportunities into the focus that might previously been outside of that range of $2 billion a year that we had contemplated. And as Rick said, as we pay down debt, we have some more flexibility. But we\u2019re going to continue to look at BD in the same way that we always have, which is that it is an important component of adding innovation to our pipeline and needs to be coupled with our internal innovation. So, we\u2019re going to match what\u2019s out there. The innovation we see, the therapeutic areas that are most promising with what\u2019s going on in our early pipeline and use that to make sure that, overall, we have a very strong and very innovative pipeline. And you can see that, for example, in the way that we have built our HemOnc franchise, where we have a nice blend of internally discovered and partnered programs from Venclexta and Imbruvica, obviously, our lead programs to the significant programs behind that, things like Navitoclax, epcoritamab, 383 and now Teliso-V demonstrating extremely strong data in non-small cell lung cancer. So, that\u2019s a blend of internal and external innovation. And we\u2019re going to continue to look at areas in that same way. And it\u2019s principally going to be the fit for our overall situation, the strength of the innovation and that balance between internal and external innovation that we look at. So, this is Mike. I\u2019ll start with the question on Qulipta and Botox combo use and then Jeff may want to add and take the second question. With respect to that combination, it really goes back to what Jeff said before, this concept of migraine freedom. If you think about chronic migraine, these are patients who have 15 or more migraine days a month. That\u2019s a migraine every other day, and these are debilitating attacks. So a substantial reduction in that is great. But, what patients and physicians are really seeking is an elimination of the migraine so that they can be free to go across their daily lives, to go about their daily lives. And given the options that are out there today to really get to that level in those most severely affected patients. Combination therapy is an obvious place to go, particularly when it\u2019s complementary approaches that work through different mechanisms. And so you would expect their effects to be independent and additive. And where you have a treatment like Botox, it has a long track record, is infrequently administered and has a long duration. So, it\u2019s that thinking that led to that combination trial. And I do think we would also agree that there is significant interest in treating physicians around these approaches. So, on epco, we have a high degree of confidence in epco overall. It continues to deliver very strong results, high overall response rates, very deep responses, good complete response rates across a number of indications, DLBCL and follicular lymphoma both. With respect to the confidence in accelerated approval for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, when we look at the data, we think it clearly exceeds the benchmarks of available therapies in highly pre-treated refractory patients. So, we would think that accelerated approval should be supported by those data, will allow the data to continue to mature from the expansion cohorts and have our final regulatory discussions later on this year to set up that accelerated approval submission. So, it certainly is in our planning, and we think it\u2019s very supportable based on the data. With respect to confidence in Vraylar and MDD, we\u2019re confident in that -- we\u2019ve been confident. We were confident when we saw the data and looked at the strength of those data and looked at the relevant precedents for molecules that have achieved indications, not only in depression, broadly speaking, but in adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. We\u2019ve completed all of the regulatory discussions that we need to have for the submission, and we\u2019re planning the submission shortly as we described in my prepared remarks. In terms of potential for an AdCom, it\u2019s really too early to comment on that. We typically start to have those conversations with the agency a few months into the review process. But, based on the data and based on the precedence, it\u2019s not something that we would anticipate. However, if the agency were to have one, it wouldn\u2019t concern us either. We think the data package is very strong and would hold its own."

Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for Allergan.  For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast to conform to AbbVie's revenue recognition accounting policies, and exclude the divestitures of ZENPEP and Bio case. References to operational growth further exclude the impact of exchange. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I will now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our third quarter performance and outlook and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie continues to perform very well. We once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.13. Total adjusted net revenues of more than $14.3 billion was up 10.8% on an operational basis, with balance growth across each of the major growth platforms. We continue to see double-digit revenue growth in immunology, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established very strong launch trajectories. These 2 assets are either approved, under regulatory review, or in late-stage development across all of Humira's major indications. And we remain confident that they will both be significant contributors to AbbVie 's long-term growth. Aesthetics is also demonstrating impressive double-digit operational sales growth. Our dedicated global aesthetics structure and increased investment are driving accelerated category growth across both toxins and fillers, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration. Our strategic investments and targeted field force expansions have improved overall our customer retention rates and significantly increased the number of first-time patients to our leading brands. We are once again raising our full-year guidance for aesthetics this quarter. And we view these portfolio as an extremely attractive growth opportunity over the long term with high single-digit compounded annual growth rates expected through the end of the decade. Our Neuroscience business drove robust double-digit revenue performance again this quarter. And we added a compelling new product to our migraine portfolio with the approval of Qulipta, a once-daily oral medication for the preventative treatment of episodic migraine. Our Hematological Oncology portfolio delivered operational sales growth of approximately 8% this quarter, despite a protracted market recovery in CLL, which remains below pre -COVID levels. Beyond the significant contributions of Imbruvica and Venclexta, we have an exciting oncology pipeline with several promising programs in development for blood cancers and solid tumors, to support sustainable long-term growth. These include Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, Epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, ABBV383 for multiple myeloma, lemzoparlimab for AML and MDS, as well as Teliso -V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer.  Lastly, we continue to make excellent progress with the integration of Allergan. Our financial results show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse Company with numerous products across our newly combined portfolio, delivering robust growth. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our momentum and we are once again raising our full-year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.63 to $12.67, reflecting growth of nearly 20% at the midpoint. Additionally, as noted in our news release, today, we are announcing an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, from a $1.30 per share to a $1.41 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. Since our inception, we've grown our quarterly dividend by more than 250%. In summary, we're demonstrating strong execution across our portfolio. We've assembled an impressive set of diversified assets with significant growth potential giving us a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, Jeff.\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. We continue to demonstrate strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with Immunology, where we remain well-positioned for sustained leadership with a portfolio of best-in-class medicines. Total immunology revenues were approximately $6.7 billion, up 14.9% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were more than $5.4 billion up 5.2% on an operational basis, with 10.1% revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 16.7% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $800 million were up 18.1% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. In the U.S. SKYRIZI's leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients, is now roughly 36% more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. SKYRIZI total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now nearly 20%, second only to HUMIRA. Internationally, SKYRIZI continues to ramp nicely, having also achieved in-play patient share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. This compelling share performance will be further supported by 2 important near-term enhancements. The availability of more simple delivery forms for SKYRIZI, as well as the potential indication expansion in psoriatic arthritis. First, we recently launched the new and convenient SKYRIZI single-dose, 150 milligrams, self - injectable pen and syringe in major territories around the world. The market response has been very favorable, and the approval now makes SKYRIZI the only quarterly dosed brand that is available in a single self - injectable pen for patients. Second, we are preparing for the global launch of SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis, as we near approval decisions in both the U.S. and Europe. We received a CHMP positive opinion earlier this month, with anticipated approval in Europe by year-end. And we continue to expect FDA approval early next year. The addition of this indication, once approved, will round out Skyrizi's dermatology label, and give patients with PSA access to a new compelling therapeutic option. We're also making excellent progress with Skyrizi's development in Crohn's disease, which was recently submitted for U.S. regulatory review, with commercialization expected next year. Rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $450 million were up nearly 20% on a sequential basis. Total in-play RA share remains strong and now reflects approximately 17% patient share in the U.S., as well as leadership in a half a dozen key countries around the world. Internationally, RINVOQ share continues to ramp in RA. And we're making excellent progress with the recent commercial launches of PSA, AS and atopic dermatitis, where we have secured strong labels for each of these indications.  As many of you are aware, the FDA issued a safety communication regarding new and updated warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ in early September. While we do not yet have an updated label, we are closely monitoring prescription trends and feedback from the field. And we have not observed a significant impact to RINVOQ utilization at this time. That said, should the updated label restrict to use the TNF inadequate responders, we would certainly expect a near-term impact to new patient starts in RA. Based on the robust data we have generated across our development program against multiple biologics and later lines of RA therapy, we do expect that RINVOQ will ultimately attain higher share growth in the second line-plus setting, as most patients ultimately fail TNF therapies over time. Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and profile of RINVOQ and remain confident this asset will be a major contributor to AbbVie's long-term growth.  In Hematologic Oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 8.1% on an operational basis. Imbruvica and Venclexta have a strong position across multiple heme -indications, including CLL, where AbbVie's combined portfolio remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Global Imbruvica revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 0.3%. In the U.S., performance continues to be primarily impacted by a slower-than-expected market recovery in CLL, as well as some modest share erosion from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. New patients starts in CLL remain below pre -COVID levels, and it is difficult to predict when this dynamic may fully recover. Venclexta sales were up 38.7% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications, including a strong AML launch trajectory in the international markets.  In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.6 billion up 25% on an operational basis. I'm particularly pleased with the results and outlook for our emerging migraine portfolio, where we are now the only Company to have a portfolio of distinctive therapies to address the spectrum of this common complex and debilitating disease, including Botox Therapeutic, a unique foundational treatment for the prevention of chronic migraine, which is performing very well. Total sales of $645 million for all the Therapeutic Botox uses were up 22.5% on an operational basis. Ubrelvy, our leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine is also demonstrating rapid growth. Total sales of a $162 million were up nearly 30% on a sequential basis. Based on Ubrelvy's competitive profile, continued strong new patients starts, and a rapidly expanding market, we remain confident that Ubrelvy represents a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity. And now we're just launching Qulipta, the only oral CGRP specifically developed for the preventative treatment of migraine, which is already off to an excellent start. Early feedback from our physicians has been very positive given QULIPTA 's strong efficacy, safety, and convenient dosing profile relative to the current standards of care. The QULIPTA launch is being supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly through the first half of 2022. QULIPTA also represents a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity.  Now we believe having 3 distinct and competitively positioned therapies across the spectrum of migraine conditions with Botox Therapeutic, UBRELVY and QULIPTA, which each have been optimized for a specific migraine indication, enables physicians to tailor treatment for the broadest range of patients. Our portfolio of migraine therapy puts us in a very strong position to capture growth in this dynamic market. Turning to psychiatry, we also see robust performance with Vraylar, which remains the fastest-growing atypical anti-psychotic. Total revenues of $461 million were up 29% on an operational basis, with continued strong demand across schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar depression. Lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $871 million up 2.9% on an operational basis. Mavyret sales were $426 million up 2.9% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes still remain suppressed compared to pre -COVID levels. And we saw double-digit growth operationally for both Creon and Lupron. So overall, I'm pleased with our continued execution across the Therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike.\nMichael Severino: Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology, where we had several regulatory updates and data readouts for both Rinvoq and Skyrizi across therapeutic areas. Following successful completion of the registrational programs for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, and Skyrizi in Crohn's disease, we submitted our regulatory applications for each asset in their respected indications. We saw a very strong data for both Rinvoq and Skyrizi as induction and maintenance treatments in UC and Crohn's respectively. And based on these results, we believe both drugs have the potential to become a highly effective, differentiated therapies in these indications. We anticipate approval decisions for both in 2022. Earlier this month, we announced positive top line results from our Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 program for Rinvoq in axial SpA, which included data from 2 standalone studies. One for ankylosing spondylitis patients who had an inadequate response to biologics. And another for patients with non-radiographic axial SpA. In the ankylosing spondylitis biorefractory study, RINVOQ performed very well, demonstrating significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms, as well as physical function and imaging endpoints compared to placebo.  We saw levels of efficacy in this difficult to treat refractory population similar to those more typically observed in bio-naive patients. These results will be added to our submission package for RINVOQ in AS which is currently under review by the FDA. In a non - radiographic axial spot study, RINVOQ also performed very well, meeting the primary and key secondary endpoints. We plan to submit our regulatory applications in this indication later this quarter as well.  RINVOQ's safety profile in these actual spot trials was consistent with previous studies, and there was no evidence for increased risk of DVT, PE, MACE events, or malignancies in either study. Based on the data generated in the select access program, we believe RINVOQ has the potential to improve care for patients suffering from Axial SpondyloArthritis by providing sustained disease control and rapid and durable pain reduction as well as improving function. As you're likely aware, in September, the FDA communicated that they will require new warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ and their use will be limited to certain patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate anti - TNFs. We continue to work with the FDA regarding updated labeling language for the RA indication, while simultaneously engaging with the agency on our files for atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. We remain confident in our submission packages for these 3 new indications and continue to expect approvals following completion of the RA label update.  In the area of oncology, we continue to make good progress advancing all stages of our pipeline. We're nearing completion of several indication expansion programs for VENCLEXTA. In our study in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, which recently received a breakthrough therapy designation, we expect to make a data cut early next year to include 6-month follow-up data for duration of response. Based on this data cut, we plan to submit our regulatory applications to the FDA in the first half of 2022, for an accelerated approval. We continue to make good progress with Venclexta in the Canova trial, which is evaluating Venclexta in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation. VENCLEXTA has shown strong anti - myeloma activity in this biomarker-defined population and if successful, has an opportunity to play an important role in the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma. We expect a data readout from this event-driven trial next year. In our early to mid-stage hem/onc pipeline, we continue to expand the cohorts in the aducanumab Phase 1 2 studies in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.  And we're evaluating aducanumab as both a monotherapy and in combinations. We expect to see data from both the monotherapy and combo studies next year. And we will discuss the monotherapy data with regulators regarding a file for accelerated approval. We also recently began the dose escalation stage of the Phase 1b studies for [Indiscernible] in AML, MDS and multiple myeloma. And ABBV -383, our BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody, is currently in the expansion stage of its Phase 1 study in multiple myeloma patients. And we expect to begin registrational phase 3 studies next year. Moving to Neuroscience, where we had several notable pipeline events since our last earnings call. In September, we received FDA approval for Qulipta, the only oral CGRP specifically designed as a preventative treatment for migraine. We're very pleased with the label, which reflects Qulipta a strong benefit risk profile, and is supported by a robust clinical development program. In our registrational program, which evaluated Qulipta in nearly 2,000 patients suffering from episodic migraine, treatment with Qulipta resulted in a significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared to placebo. And approximately 60% of patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in the migraine days. We think these data compare favorably to other preventative migraine treatments on the market, and believe our new oral treatment option will be competitively positioned in the prevention market. Our migraine portfolio now includes Ubrelvy for acute treatment of migraine, Qulipta for preventative treatment of episodic migraine, and Botox for preventative treatment of chronic migraine. With this distinct portfolio, AbbVie is uniquely positioned to address the full spectrum of this complex and debilitating disease. This morning, we announced top-line results from two Phase 3 studies evaluating Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. In the 301 study, a 1.5 milligram a day Vraylar dose met the primary endpoint demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in total MADRS score compared to placebo at Week 6 with a highly statistically significant p-value of 0.005. In this study, the 3 milligram Vraylar dose did not reach statistical significance, but it did show a clear trend toward improvement with a nominal p-value of approximately 0.073 at Week 6. In the second phase 3 trial, the 302 study, neither Vraylar doses met the primary endpoint of change in total MADRS score at week 6. But both the 1.5 and 3 milligram doses demonstrated clear trends toward a clinically meaningful benefit at weeks 2 and 4, with nominal P values less than 0.05 for a number of comparisons. Additionally, as a reminder, we had 1 prior positive registrational Phase 2B study where Vraylar demonstrated efficacy in MDD when added to ongoing antidepressant treatment. Based on precedent in the field and the totality of the data, we believe we have a viable regulatory pathway for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. We plan to engage with regulatory agencies to discuss these results and expect to spend our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of next year. We also recently announced positive top-line results from a phase 3 study comparing our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system, ABBV -951 to oral levodopa/carbidopa in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. In this pivotal study, treatment with 951 resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in on time without troublesome dyskinesia, as well as similar improvements in normalized off time compared to oral Levodopa or Carbidopa. We're very pleased with these results, which we believe support our view that 951 has the potential to become a transformative improvement to current treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We plan to submit our regulatory application next year with approval decisions anticipated in the U.S. and Europe in early 2023. And in Eye Care, we announced the partnership with REGENXBIO to develop and commercialize RGX -314, a potential gene therapy for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other chronic retinal diseases. RGX-314 is a very attractive addition to our pipeline, and complements our Eye Care portfolio with a potential flagship product in retinal disease. REGENXBIO recently presented initial data from 2 Phase 2 studies evaluating RGX -314 in wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, using in-office suprachoroidal delivering. While early, these results are encouraging, with RGX -314 demonstrating efficacy at the lowest dose. And the study showing that the drug and delivery method both appear to be well tolerated. Also, in eye care, we continue to expect approval for [Viewty] (ph) shortly, formerly known as AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with Presbyopia. This once-daily eye-drop was developed to help address presbyopia that is often corrected through reading glasses. And once approved via convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild-to-moderate presbyopia who may not want to wear reading glasses. This has been a very productive year thus far for our R&D organization, and we anticipate several additional milestones in the coming months. We expect this momentum to continue into next year, which is looking to be a milestone filled year for AbbVie as well. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob.\nRob Michael: Thank you, Mike. As you have heard from Rick, Jeff, and Mike, we once again delivered outstanding performance this quarter, while also advancing our strategic priorities. Our results demonstrate the strong momentum of the business, and support AbbVie's long-term financial outlook. Turning to third quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.33 up 17.7% compared to prior year, and $0.13 above our guidance midpoint. This includes $0.05 from accelerated synergies, and $0.03 from mark-to-market equity gains. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.3 billion, up 10.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.1% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.6% of sales. Net interest expense was $585 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6% as Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.63 and $12.67 reflecting growth of 19.8% at the midpoint.  Excluded from this guidance is $6.34 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance continues to contemplate full-year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange at a 0.7% favorable impact on full-year comparable sales growth. This implies a full-year revenue forecast of approximately $56.2 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full-year assumptions. We now expect Aesthetics global revenue of approximately $5.1 billion. We now expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $3.3 billion. For IMBRUVICA, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion, reflecting slower recovery of the CLL market. For Mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. And we now expect Allergan expense synergies of approximately $1.8 billion. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $15 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.24 and $3.28, excluding approximately $1.14 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of September was $12 billion Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we announce an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. And we remain on track to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year, with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.3 times by the end of 2021, and approximately 2 times by the end of 2022. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I will turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we'll take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you Ms. Shea. Our first question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Your line is open, sir.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. Rick, I guess I'll jump in with the big one that I think is still the overhang for the stock, which is the RINVOQ outlook. You have $15 billion out there for 2025 in combined SKYRIZI, RINVOQ forecast guidance. And I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of the puts and takes. SKYRIZI doing really well but some overhangs for RINVOQ. Is that $15 billion still achievable, do you think you're trending above that, or do you have to make up a shortfall. Thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: Geoffrey, this is Rick. It's a great question. What I'd say is the following: If I look at SKYRIZI, I would say that SKYRIZI performance is very, very impressive. Jeff outlined what the in-play share is and what the total TRxs are and it's very close to the passing HUMIRA now, which in this short period of time is frankly a surprise, how quickly it has ramped. I think that's a very positive case. If I look at RINVOQ, actually the in-place share looks very good. Now, we would expect if the label gets changed and restricts the label to behind TNFs, that that will have some impact on the front line patients -- the na\u00efve patients that we're capturing now. And so we will see that impact. Having said that, I would say that when I look at RINVOQ's performance overall and how durable it's been throughout this situation, we'll obviously shift more towards second line patients and beyond, which was originally in the plan, but the emphasis would have occurred a year or 2 later than this, where we would have driven that. We have very good data to be able to support that.  The other thing I'd say is if you look at the indications that we have coming out for these two assets, we have AD, which is a very significant opportunity for us. We have PSA and is a very significant opportunity. But next year we have the IVD indications that are coming out. And I'd say there, when we gave the $15 billion forecast, the performance that was in our TPP or our target product profile that we had assumed, we have outperformed that in the clinical trials that we've submitted. And so I think that's a very significant opportunity for us, and a significant opportunity for us to outperform. Having said all of that, we don't want to reconfirm the guidance yet. We want to see what the final label looks like from the agency. And then we'll be in a position, I think, to come out and tell the investor community exactly what we think. The only other thing I'd say is, I think if you go back 5, 6 years ago, what we're trying to accomplish with the Company, we were basically trying to accomplish with the Company, build a set of assets that could ultimately significantly replace HUMIRA in the marketplace and be superior to HUMIRA. These 2 assets already are at $5 billion and growing very rapidly. So I think everything I know about these 2 assets, they'll be able to do exactly what we expect of them. Even in the most negative outcome from a label standpoint that we would expect. Second thing is we built a significant heme/onc portfolio, that when I look at the pipeline behind IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA I think there's a significant opportunity to drive significant growth in that portfolio. And then with the Allergan acquisition, I couldn't be more pleased. Aesthetics franchise is performing at an outstanding level, the neuroscience franchise is performing an outstanding level. I think migraine is a very significant opportunity for us to be able to drive, and eye care is another one. And so we now have multiple assets, and multiple portfolios to be able to drive the growth. And our goal is still what we described to the analysts early on, we expect to see the impact of the LOE on Humira in '23, and immediately be able to grow beyond that starting in '24, return to growth, sales growth at that point. And regardless of what happens with RINVOQ'S label, I have a high-level of confidence we can continue to do that. Rob, anything you\u2019d add?\nRob Michael: I would just add that obviously with the confidence we have and the dividend increase we announced today, we feel very strong about the long-term outlook. We haven't backed off on the high single-digit growth on 25 and beyond. You look at the portfolio we've assembled, you look at the assets we have today, you look at our pipeline, you look at the BD work we've been doing over the last couple of years, that was some nice licensing deals and we still feel very confident in the outlook for this business.\nGeoffrey Porges: Great. Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Geoffrey. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open sir.\nAndrew Baum: Yes, thank you. Can you flip back to the other side of RINVOQ, SKYRIZI and just talk HUMIRA. Could you talk to your comfort level with where consensus currently has HUMIRA pegged and the anticipated scale and scope of the erosion? And then second, in relation to your ongoing Alvotech pending court case, could you just confirm whether if they prevail that would effectively invalidate the signed settlements with the other biosimilar players, meaning that you would have a number of players coming that much quicker onto the market with anticipated pricing volume impact. Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Andrew, this is Rick. So I will cover the second one, the Alvotech one. I'm going to have Rob cover the first one.\nRob Michael: We've seen movement in terms of consensus numbers since we've given just some direction on how to model it. I think right now, consensus in '23 sell-side consensus has about 41% erosion in the U.S. in '23. And we've said, think about it in terms of 45% based on what we saw in Europe in year 1, plus or minus 10% given the differences in the payer landscape in the U.S. versus other markets. So we have seen the Humira consensus move. Today, it's at 41%, so it's a lot closer than it was a year ago.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay, Andrew, this is Rick. I'll cover the Alvotech situation. As you know, we're in litigation with Alvotech. I think it's important to understand the nuances behind that litigation. In this first set of litigation, this first wave of litigation, we are basically applying 10 patents in HUMIRA. And as you know, we have a very robust patent portfolio around HUMIRA, but these 10 patents are both formulation patents and indication patents. Many of these patents were challenged through the IPR process and upheld by the patent office. I'll give you some idea of the strength of these patents. The first thing I'd say to you is, we have a high level of confidence that we will prevail in this litigation. There will be a second wave of litigation that occurs after that, which will bring into the portfolio the rest of the patents that we think Alvotech infringes. So there could be another phase of litigation that occurs after this one, but I can tell you we're highly confident that we will prevail in this first set of litigation based on the strength of those patents. To specifically answer your question, if they were to prevail, which I don't believe they will, then it would accelerate the other patent settlements. Yes, that is correct.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Andrew. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. It comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.\nChris Schott: All right, great, thanks so much. Just one quick follow-up on RINVOQ and the upcoming indications. I guess do you see a scenario where you are unable to get the drug approved in these pending indications particularly AD over the next few months, or is your review based on all the interactions, etc. that this is largely, I guess, a label and maybe a line of therapy discussion and decision with the agency? And my second question was on Botox aesthetics, a very healthy growth we're seeing here, we're now coming up against even some more normalized comps and you're still seeing the growth rate very, very healthy. Just -- are we still seeing catch-up usage in this, or is this just really underlying demand at this point. And just a little bit more color about just how you're thinking about the near-term growth trajectory. I know you talked about high single-digits over time, but just as you maybe look out to 22-23, could this remain a mid-teens type of growth rate product over that window. Thanks so much.\nRick Gonzalez: Mike.\nMichael Severino: Okay. Thanks, Chris. This is Mike. I will take the first one, and then Rick will take the second part of your question. With respect to RINVOQ in the 3 new indications. So psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. We remain very confident in those files, and we remain very confident in approval decisions. The gating factor here is really getting to the specifics of the language around RA, which is a process that is well underway. And we would expect to be in a position to gain approvals after that is completed. And again, we hope that's completed in the near future, certainly this year. The psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings, we would expect to follow fairly closely on the heels of that RA decision for ankylosing spondylitis. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we rolled in a new study, which is a positive study and a very strong study in ankylosing spondylitis into that submission. And so that one might be on a slightly different time-frame, but we remain very confident in that approval as well.\nRick Gonzalez: This is Rick. On Botox, I think one of the things when we first went through the integration process that was compelling to us was the amount of penetration in these markets and Allergan's ability to be able to reach out and touch consumers and activate those consumers. And that's part of what drove our decision globally to go with this fully integrated, totally dedicated Aesthetics organization.  Because in many other markets around the world, although the data is not quite as good as it is here in the U.S., but in China as an example you see is very similar kinds of dynamics. And so focusing that team purely on Aesthetics was part of the effort here to be able to drive accelerated growth. The second was, when we looked at the ability to be able to use various methods to be able to activate consumers. We believe that the business was being underfunded in a way, both in the way it was being funded and the total amount that was being funded. And so we did some early work to determine whether or not that funding could drive incremental market growth, and it showed a positive result. And then when we saw that, we applied significantly greater funding to it. And what you're actually seeing now, I think, is we are driving the market. We're bringing more patients into the category, and obviously because we have the leadership position from a market share standpoint, we get the vast majority of those patients. Is there still some pent-up demand? I would tell you it's hard to believe at this point that there can be a lot of it, but there has to be some of it. Remember those practices reopened in the U.S. in the summer of 2020. That's a long time to have pent-up demand, but it's impossible to tell one way or another. I would say the majority of it is certainly being driven by us activating patients and retaining more patients. One of the other things we saw was the retention rate was relatively low once you activated a patient. And so we spent some time working with the team to figure out how could you retain those patients at a higher rate, meaning they repeat their procedures. They don't just do it once and then disappear, but they come back for a second procedure or plus going to fillers as an example. So the data is very clear. If you look at the U.S. as an example, toxins and fillers are growing high 30% of the market. We're growing at about the same rate, maybe a little bit lower on fillers but about that rate on toxins. When we look at globally, the overall brands are growing at about that rate. And so, I think this is a business that is sustainable over the long term. When we say across the decade high single-digits, obviously, if we keep this growth rates. The business is getting bigger and bigger. So therefore, the percentage will come down a bit. But I'd tell you, I'm very optimistic about this market, and our ability to be able to bring new assets into this market. They can change the standard of care going forward and us being able to drive market growth at the same time. It's a very good business.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. That comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. I wanted to ask a question on HUMIRA in 2023, I'm just really trying to nail down what's in that erosion guidance of 45% plus or minus 10. That's sales erosion, not volume, correct? I'm trying to think through what happens to the U.S. rebate stream in 2023, which is likely in the billions of dollars. Do you think you'll retain favorable formulae positioning even with biosimilars, in which case you keep paying that rebate, but you also would have less volume loss, or do you think it becomes disadvantage on formulary, in which case you pull back those billions of dollars in rebates, and that flows through the bottom-line. To me, I just wonder if your guidance on aversion is frankly too conservative or, I should say too aggressive because those rebate dynamics in the U.S., they make us a more durable market than ex-U.S. for those rebate dynamics don't exist.\nRick Gonzalez: Tim, this is Rick, maybe Rob and I will tag team this one. I'll start. I think the guidance we laid out of 45% or 48%, whichever is the latest number plus or -10%, is still guidance that we feel pretty comfortable with. To your point about, is the bulk of it priced? It is. Even if you look at the international market it's about 1/3, 2/3, or maybe slightly higher than that. I mean, 2/3 of its price, 1/3 of it is volume. And I would expect that we will maintain a significant part of the volume. Obviously, we don't talk publicly about what our manage care strategy is, but what I would tell you is we're close enough now to that 23 time-frame that you would expect us to be starting the work to ensure formulary access on all of our products, and certainly HUMIRA is one of those for 2023. And I think it is logical to assume that we will maintain that formulary position. And we've been pretty effective at doing that historically, so I believe will be pretty effective at doing it again. Rob, anything you want to add?\nRob Michael: Just as a reminder. I mean, so we gave that and we're using Europe as an analog, but keep in mind that the U.S. system is very, very different. This is why we gave you a range. And so as we get closer to '23, obviously we'll give more specific guidance on the U.S. But we are communicating as more directional information based on the experience we saw with Europe. Keep in mind there were 4 biosimilars that came in the market at that time, and there will be more biosimilars coming to the U.S. markets. So there's a different level of competitive intensity, but also it's a very different payer landscape. So it's something to keep in mind.\nTim Anderson: Okay. Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Tim. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. It comes from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.\nGary Nachman: Thanks. Good morning. A couple on neuro that had some recent wins. So first on Vraylar the Phase 2 studies and MDD. In 1 study, you hit on the 1.5 milligram dose, but not the 3 milligram dose, it was close, but not statistically significant. Will that matter to the FDA, maybe you could remind us what those who sit in the previous Phase 3. And now that you have the full dataset, how do you think Vraylar will stack up competitively at the NDD space? And then just quickly on migrating, a little bit more how the initial launch has gone to lift, and how has that been rolled in to the Botox in UBRELVY offering, and just your confidence about the reimbursement you said going into the first half of next year. Thanks.\nMichael Severino: Okay. This is Mike. I'll take the first part of your question, and then Jeff will take the second part of your of your question. With respect to Vraylar MDD, in the study that you described the 1.5 milligram dose medicine point and met it with a highly statistically significant P-value of 0.005, so 0005. And that's important in terms of strength of evidence overall and weight of evidence overall. And then as you point out, in the 3 milligram arm in that same study, we didn't hit significance, but we had a P-value that was very small.  The nominal P-value is 0.073, if we around. When you look at that overall study to RA clearly shows an effect in NDD. Now, the second Phase 3 study that we just read out did not reach statistical significance for either dose group, but there were favorable trends and across a number of comparisons, there were nominal p-values that were quite small and many of them were out lower than 0.05. And I'll just remind the listeners that it's very common in depression studies, even with classes of medicines that have firmly established efficacy to have some study that read out positive and some studies that are negative. And so we think that overall package that we announced today is very strong. And it's also important to keep in mind that we did have a prior study that was conducted several years ago that was also positive that demonstrated a statistically significant effect. And that study -- look at different dosing, there were dose ranges that were studied in that trial with titration.  It was the upper 2 of the dose ranges that was significant, but it did show both a clinically meaningful and significant benefit. So we have 2 positive studies and that's important because the way these studies are typically looked at is an overall weight of evidence, do you have a convincingly positive phase 3 study? And is there other evidence within the overall data package that is supportive and we feel comfortable that that is the case here.  And lastly, what I'd say is, if you look at the precedent, and you look at other approvals, findings like the ones that we described on not a long time, and, in fact, that's the very common amongst approved agents in this space, including some of the more recent approvals in adjunctive NDD like resulting. So overall we think it is a strong package that has a viable regulatory pathway. And we will stack up very nicely to competitors. So we're going to begin those regulatory discussions shortly. So without I'll turn it over to Jeff.\nJeff Stewart: Yeah, thank you, Mike. Look, it's a meaningful opportunity for sure. When we look at the market sizes, about 60 million total prescriptions for the adjunctive MDD market. And that's very similar to the bipolar market that we operate in now, so it's a very meaningful opportunity for us. If you think about the -- what Mike was saying in terms of the competitive profile, I think we have to remember that while it's got a fairly low share, the -- Vraylar is very attractive, which is why it's the fasting growing agent. So the efficacy is viewed very, very nicely overall, and I think that if approved, this also has competitive efficacy of very gentle metabolic profile, minimal weight gain, very tolerable, and also very simple dosing for the psychiatrists and the primary care doctors that look at this. So when you start to see the potential for an agent like Vraylar that's got the full spectrum across bipolar disease in terms of mania, mixed episodes and depression. And then the adjunctive depression indication, if approved, it will be very attractive. So we anticipate a nice catalyst here and certainly a nice add to Vraylar's overall profile.\nGary Nachman: If you want to cover the second question.\nJeff Stewart: Yeah. Perfect. The second question you had was QULIPTA. And QULIPTA, its very early, we just introduced the product with our full commercial promotion. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have now as of this quarter, a dedicated migraine sales force which shows you how important we think that this franchise is and what we can do with this franchise. So we have an entire sales team out there that is launching QULIPTA and now also focused on UBRELVY. And the early feedback has been very strong. What we hear qualitatively from our field and certainly from our research in the first few weeks of launch is, first, the simplicity and strength of QULIPTA for prevention.  We see very, very nice response to our efficacy data, which is -- Mike has said before, and I've said before is on the very high end of preventative performance. So 60% of patients in our trials achieved greater than 50% reduction in migraine days, which is viewed as very significant. And almost 30% have a complete control. A 100% decrease in their migraine days. That's very compelling in terms of this Qulipta power. Also, physicians like the simple, everyday dosing, once a day.  And so things are quite strong in terms of our early qualitative feedback. So we do obviously anticipate that the majority of our prescriptions will be bridged prescriptions until are -- we get the full ramp of our market access, which as I mentioned, we're quite confident by the first half of the year, we should ramp similar to Ubrelvy, where ultimately, as you remember, we achieved about a 90% access in the U.S. So quite good early feedback on the launch, and again we think that the 3 assets together are unique competitive positioning for AbbVie.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Gary. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nMatthew Harrison: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two for me. 1. If I could just follow up on CGRP, I'm curious, obviously, you have a different strategy than your competitor when it comes to the prophylactic market. I'm just wondering how you think where your source of the patients are going to come from. Are you expecting more transitions from injectables or do you think they're going to be more de novo patients, and if you could just talk about that a little bit. And then secondly, on REGENXBIO, could you just talk about your confidence in the data there. Obviously there was some inflammation there though it did seem self-limiting. I'm just curious how you think about that impacting the profile, because obviously in other gene therapy products in the eye inflammation has sometimes proven to be pretty significant as a long-term sequelae. Thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: Jeff lunge.\nJeff Stewart: Yeah, I'll take the first one, thanks. So in terms of the source of business, we think that QULIPTA is going to source business from 2 primary areas. First is, the big headache specialists, the big neurologists. We think absolutely from our research and feedback that you'll start to see an early trade-off of the injectable MABS in favor of the orals and certainly in favor of QULIPTA. I think that this is viewed as very attractive. In many cases, some people have spontaneously highlighted wow it looks like a very strong MAB in a single oral pill. So that's a source of business in terms of market share trade-off. I think the other insight that we have from the market is that we are going to a -- calling on a substantial amount of high prescribing primary care physicians who don't write a lot of MABS, but they certainly write a lot of generic topiramate and some other older agents. And so we also see that we have a unique opportunity in a wider audience to source from physicians that really don't lean towards the MABS because of the injectable nature of those, etc. So we think we're going to have a good balance between those two sources of business and that's quite attractive for us right now.\nMichael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take the question regarding REGENX. We're very encouraged by the recent data. If we take a step back and look at the program overall, they have very strong efficacy data already demonstrated with sub-retinal delivery and that's in a lot of procedure. But it gives us clear proof-of-concept for the approach, and shows that we can get durable control. And that component of the program is already in Phase 3. And then the more recent data that were presented just about a month ago, several weeks ago, looked at suprachoroidal delivery. So that is a delivery method that can be done in-office. It's a specialized form of injection, but it is a form of injection. And that is also showing very good promise. We're already seeing signs of efficacy in the first cohort, which is the lowest dose cohort, which quite frankly is sooner than we expected to see them before that study had started to deliver results. And the tolerability is very good. If one looks at the inflammation that has reported in the [Indiscernible] trials, it's very different in its nature and its [Indiscernible] than that, that has been seen with other agents. It's principally anterior, chamber is exclusively anterior chamber, there's no vasculitis, no more significant inflammation.  It is readily treated with topical steroids, and generally resolves without any difficulty, and in fact, quite rapidly. And it's also important to remember that there's no prophylactic steroids being used here. Other approaches have required that. So these are patients who have no prophylaxis upfront in responding to what's often a brief course of topical steroids. And the reason why there's no prophylactic steroids, given as they're just not felt to be needed given the very mild nature of the inflammation that's being observed. So we're very confident with it. And again, we feel it's qualitatively very different than what has been seen in other agents. And we've obviously talked to retinal specialists as well who are quite familiar with the program, and the views we've heard from them are supportive of what I just described.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Matthew. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open, sir.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. I have a few questions, a couple of follow-ups. How would you describe the nature and the tone of conversations with FDA regarding RINVOQ's new label in RA, would you say you're pleased with how things are going, is the outcome unclear to AbbVie at this juncture, or is the outcome obvious sending in line with what the FDA had an it's statement in September? That's the first question. Second question: To my knowledge, Vraylar has shown superiority to placebo but not generics in MDD. How would AbbVie establish it as a leading MDD agent given the presence of lower cost alternatives? And then lastly, any thoughts on Soliton acquisition relative to its closing? Thank you.\nMichael Severino: Okay. This is Mike. I'll start And then Rick will take the question regarding Soliton. With respect to the tone of conversations with the FDA for RINVOQ, I would describe them as productive. With respect to your question specifically about the RA label, those discussions are productive as well. I would assume the base case is what they announced conceptually back in early September, but we are working through the specifics of how that translates into labeling language. And I would characterize the discussions around the other indications as being very productive and very positive as well. And so as I mentioned earlier in this call, we remain very confident in the files for those new indications for all three of them. With respect to Vraylar, head-to-head superiority studies are not typically done in this space. They are very challenging. It is challenging to show an impact even with established classes period in major depressive disorder and particularly in this space, because this is the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. So these are patients who aren't responding to the current therapies, and require an add-on and atypical antipsychotics with pharmacology similar to Vraylar, our one of the most commonly used agents in this space. So we think the very strong data that we have from the study that we described, and the fact that we have prior supportive evidence as well from the earlier study, will position it very well to be competitive in that marketplace.\nJeff Stewart: And Steve, it's Jeff. Just to build on Mike's point, if you think about the size of Vraylar now approaching $1.8 billion it has a 2.5 share in terms of the anti-psychotic market. It's a low share, high-value in growth area. When you think about most of our business is already stepped through in some cases one or two of the generics. The problem is that these patients are so fragile, they just don't respond well. We would still anticipate that with the new approval for MDD, you're still going to have step therapy and other approaches in the marketplace, but there is still a very nice commercial opportunity. That's just the way the markets work today.\nSteve Scala: Alright, thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: So this is Rick, Steve. On Soliton, as you know, we obviously announced the -- our intention to acquire the Company and submitted it for approval. We did receive a second request. Maybe just to frame a bit why we're interested in this area. We tend to look at this market where the third major leg of the stool in a stage is body contouring. And this is a good fit with CoolSculpting, and CoolTones. Obviously, CoolSculpting is focused more on reduction of fat in targeted areas, and CoolTones more focused on the area of enhancing muscle tone in specific areas.  This particular asset is designed to reduce cellulite. We don't have a position in cellulite now so there's not any kind of competitive overlap in that area. Having said that, we are responding to the FTC's inquiry. We believe that's going reasonably well, so we would expect this to be resolved at some point here in the future. I can't tell you a specific date, but I would expect it to have a positive outcome over a period of time here.\nSteve Scala: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thank, you, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So just maybe 1 more just on Vraylar following up on the other comments. I think before you talked about it being as maybe sort of multi-billion-dollar type opportunity in MDD. Is that still the lines you're thinking now that you've seen the data that you've disclosed today? And then the second one, just going back to RINVOQ and obvious sounds like you're still pretty confident on that products outlook. But I'm just curious if that's changed any of your priorities hitting about business development, specifically in immunology? The need for maybe look at other oral agents that might be in development there, just so how you're thinking about the broader BD landscape there. Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Yes, Jeff.\nJeff Stewart: Yeah. I think if you look at the -- as I highlighted, that the market sizes are roughly the same. However, the competitive context is quite a bit different and the competitive set is a little bit different. So we view it again as an important incremental opportunity that even with low incremental share, that we can drive Vraylar to the -- that multibillion dollar guidance that we look at it. We do think it's an incremental catalyst, and an exciting approach if it were to be approved.\nMichael Severino: So this is Mike. I'll take the Rinvoq question. So as you pointed out, yes, we are very confident in Rinvoq as a molecule overall. We've talked about the progress on the RA indication, and our confidence in the new indications, both those that are under review. And indications where we have data, but have not yet submitted like the IBD indications. And so we feel that it's going to be an important part of our portfolio, and the treatment armamentarium going forward. So having said that, immunology is always an area where we are scouring the landscape to look for the best opportunities.  So I wouldn't say it's changed our focus in any way or changed our approach, but we will continue to look for novel therapies that can raise the bar on the standard of care. Across a number of areas, the current indications where we are already playing and new indications that have fewer treatment options, areas like lupus and scleroderma. So the RINVOQ situation has not changed that strategy in anyway.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. It's from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open, sir.\nRonny Gal: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I've got a clarification and then a couple of questions. First, Rick, you mentioned regarding Alphatec about the acceleration clauses. And I just want to clarify if this is on District Court decision or appeal, given the timing it actually makes quite a bit of difference. Then the two questions I have first are interchangeability for HUMIRA. Do you think this will matter in the marketplace? We are hearing different things from the large payers. What is your take here and what is going to be AbbVie's position about this? And the second question is, the last draft we've seen from this year regarding the infrastructure bill does not include a reduction of out-of-pocket costs in Medicare. We're still hearing from context, this still might be the case if it's still included. If you can comment on this issue, do you expect it to be included, and the impact it might have on AbbVie's business.\nRick Gonzalez: So Ronny, this is Rick. On Alvotech, obviously these agreements that we have with the other biosimilar players are confidential, I'm not going to delve into some of the specifics around those. What I can tell you is what I said before. I mean, we are highly confident in our position with this IP. This IP has been challenged multiple times and we have a high degree of confidence that we will prevail.  So I think it's obviously a hypothetical scenario, but I don't -- I wouldn't give it a lot of merit. Second on interchangeable HUMIRA s as we've discussed previously, when we built the erosion model that we described a couple of years ago, or certainly a year-and-a-half or so ago, we did assume at that point that they were going to be 2 interchangeable biosimilars. It does matter from a pricing standpoint to some extent. So I think it will have an impact but it's consistent with what we had assumed. And so we've essentially taken that into consideration in the forecast that we provided you, and the estimates that we provided you. On drug pricing in the U.S., I would say it's a very fluid situation. It's a little difficult to truly understand exactly where we are. You are correct, if you look at this framework that came out yesterday [Indiscernible] talked about repeal of the rebate rule being eliminated. And it didn't talk about much else. Look, the things that we're focused on and things that we think would make a difference on our out-of-pocket costs for patients, and making them lower for Medicare patients, making them something that they can spread over a period of time -- a 12-month period of time to make the cash flow easier to deal with. And as we've said before, we think industry will play a role in that as one of the participants. And we would hope that we will get back to that, because I think -- we think that is the most fundamental issue is reducing the out-of-pocket costs for these patients.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Ronny. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nGeoff Meacham: Great. Hey guys. Thanks so much for the question. I just have 2 quick ones, and probably for Mike. The follow-up on Rinvoq. I know it's been asked a lot, but you have a number of labeling scenarios that could play out just with respect to dose, or TNF requirement, or language on black box, or any maybe -- any limit on duration. Is there one of those items that has more of an impact than the others. I'm just trying to think about what informs your assumptions. The second question on cystic fibrosis. When you look to the upcoming proof-of-concept data readout, is there a minimal effect size, or profile that you're looking for that would justify moving to a larger scale Phase 3. Thanks so much.\nMichael Severino: I will take the RINVOQ question first and then make some comments on CF. What I would say about RINVOQ is our assumptions around the labeling at a base case are based on what the agency announced in their safety communication in September. That principally updates to the black box warnings that all of these agents have in fact all agents in immunology have some degree of this. They treat similar conditions to RINVOQ, for example, the TNS have some of the same but not all of the same warnings. Updating that section label is part of our base case and then the restriction that the agency described for certain patients around TNF inadequate response forms our base case. And those are the two factors that we're considering. We would not anticipate any limit into ration of therapy, for example. And the question those principally applies to the atopic dermatitis file, because we have just a single dose in the other files, in the files that are in the rheumatology space. And we feel confident about both doses in terms of the benefit risk that we've demonstrated in that atopic dermatitis program. It's really those two dimensions and how those translate into specific language in RA. And then of course, how they translate to the other indications, because TNFs are not the standard of care in all indications, they are not used in atopic dermatitis. So then it's how do those concepts get translated into the label in other indications. Those are the principal dimensions that we're looking at when we think about those programs. And again, we feel very confident in the files that we've put forward, and feel very good about how discussions have gone to date. With respect to CF and what we're looking for, we're looking for something that has demonstrated benefit compared to what's already out there, what will be out there at the time our agents come to market. Obviously the principal competitor, the only group with a marketed product right now in this space is Vertex so that's what we would be benchmark ourselves against.  I would say at an absolute minimum, you'd have to have efficacy that was just as good with other meaningful advantages. But what we're striving for is something that has an efficacy advantage of a small number of absolute FEV1 points. A small number of absolute FEV1 points might not sound like much, but it can translate into real benefit for patients in this disease.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open, ma'am.\nLuisa Hector: Thank you. Good morning. And sorry. I still have a couple more on RINVOQ. I just wanted to understand whether the label updates in RA and then the approvals in the new indications can essentially all happen on the same day? Or is the gating item the RA update? And then there's still a bit more work to be done for the new indications. And then looking on to the UC filing. Is the acceptance of that filing in any way dependent on the RA label being resolved first or that's free to be accepted as a filing while the label update is still outstanding? Thank you.\nMichael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take those 2 questions. So with respect to the ongoing reviews, what I would say is the discussions around the RA label update, and the new indications that are under our review are going on simultaneously. And there is some level of interdependence. In other words, we need to understand where the RA label will land, because some of those elements, like the warnings and precautions, will translate over to the other indications because in the U.S. you get 1 label for the molecule that applies across all of the indications. So there's some interdependency, that's why getting the RA label update resolved is a gating factor. Whether it could happen on the same day or in close succession, I think it's too early to call with that fine level of detail, but we would expect the psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings to follow in a very reasonable time-frame after that label update. As I mentioned, we're adding new data to the ankylosing spondylitis submission, which is the smallest of the three indications. And so that one might be on a slightly different time-frame as the agency reviews those new data. With respect to the SEC filings, the RA label update is not on critical path to file acceptance. What the agency looks at when they look at file acceptance is, have you provided sufficient data for them to evaluate the file, is it in an appropriate format that they can review, are there any significant deficiencies. And of course, we're very confident in the file that we've submitted, so we would not in any way anticipate any challenges there. And the RA safety label update is not a gating factor for that file acceptance.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Luisa. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nAllie Braculon: Hi, good morning. This is Allie Braculon for Chris. Thanks for taking the question. So on ABBV -951 and Parkinson's, we're just hoping you could put some of those safety findings from the Phase 3 trial in context, particularly the imbalance in hallucination psychosis and the 22%, I think, treatment discontinuation rate. Basically, just how did that safety profile stack up against your expectations and how could this translate into real-world use of 951. Thanks.\nMichael Severino: So this is Mike. I'll take that question. With respect to the data for 951, we're very pleased with the data. There is very strong efficacy, and the safety is within our expectations, it matches our expectations across essentially all important areas. What's important to keep in mind is this agent delivers transformative benefit to patients who have extremely difficult to control Parkinson's disease through other measures, and to have a very, very difficult time controlling their disease. For example, with orals or with other approaches. And so the overall picture has to be looked at in that context. With respect to treatment discontinuations, what I would say is the treatment discontinuations, The rate of that overall is very similar to what you see with similar devices with insulin pump like devices used across a range of conditions. Most of these were driven by either local tolerability issues like injection site reactions, which were principally erythema or technical usability issues because these are older patient populations with limited mobility and dexterity in many cases, and there's always a subset of patients who find that they have difficulty using any device under those circumstances. Again, those rates of discontinuation are very similar to what you see with similar insulin pump-like devices. And keep in mind this is a very, very large population. This advanced Parkinson's population, only a very small proportion of which currently get advanced treatments because it's so limited in how that can be delivered. We think there's a big opportunity here and that treatment discontinuation rate doesn't change that and is in line with our expectations. With respect to hallucinations. We know that that is on mechanism. Or Levodopa and Carbidopa and it's essentially evidenced that we are delivering Levodopa and Carbidopa in a way that's more effective than can be done through other methods. And it's something that can be titrated and something that can be managed. And what I would point to is in the other direction. The oral group, the control group that got oral Levodopa and Carbidopa had more falls. And that to our eye shows a lower degree of control, which matches the clinical efficacy data, because we know falls are common in Parkinson's disease patients. So we need to keep that in mind. And with the efficacy that we've delivered, we think these are all very attractive profiles and ones that will translate into significant real-world use. When we look at how this will impact overall use, again and keep in mind that the very broad population, only a very small segment which can access the therapies that they need to control their disease. Therapies like DUOPA, which is transformative, that takes us surgical gastric tube actually threaded into the small bow to get deep brain stimulation and other types of measures. This is a much less invasive approach that delivers very strong efficacy and we think that will translate very, very effectively into the real world.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Allie. Operator, we have time for 1 final question.\nOperator: That will come from Josh Schimmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.\nJosh Schimmer: Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you talk about the current contracting season with payers for Humira, and whether you think you'll be able to lock in multi-year contracts either now to extend to 2023, or next year to extend to 2024. And then I'm surprised you're not more bullish with your guidance for the migraine franchise, given the strong trajectory it's on already. Any reason to think there's going to be a significant plateau in the years ahead. Thank you.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. So typically, when -- we start to negotiate with the payers in the spring of the year for the following year. And typically those contracts can be multiyear contracts, maybe 2-year contract. So really that's the season where we'll have as Rob and Rick said, we'll have probably some more guidance over how things are shaping up for '23 and possibly '24 depending on the posture of the payers and how those things work out. So we're not quite there yet. I think that what I can say is we're quite confident based on the timing that I described in terms of general cycles, in terms of where we're going to be for our portfolio certainly in '22. In terms of QULIPTA, look, we are off to a very good start.  I can tell you that UBRELVY continues to run a pace, that total oral CGRP market is upwards of maybe 18% of new prescriptions. And it's still early and that would be us and neurotech in the acute segment. And at a theoretical peak level, you could see maybe 30% or 40% based on cardiovascular issues with Triptan's or some other issues. But we still have clear -- clearly some runway to go. It's probably a little early to sort of determine how that preventative segment will really grow because you've only seen really the MABS so far.  They certainly tripled the market size. How will both of these orals and particularly in oral like QULIPTA in terms of the market development run a pace? It's encouraging for sure, particularly, if you have all 3 of these agents in the market and the investment behind it. Right now though we feel quite comfortable with the billion-dollar opportunity for both of the orals.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Josh. And that concludes today's conference call. If you would like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors. abbVie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Jeff Stewart",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. We continue to demonstrate strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with Immunology, where we remain well-positioned for sustained leadership with a portfolio of best-in-class medicines. Total immunology revenues were approximately $6.7 billion, up 14.9% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were more than $5.4 billion up 5.2% on an operational basis, with 10.1% revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 16.7% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $800 million were up 18.1% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. In the U.S. SKYRIZI's leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients, is now roughly 36% more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. SKYRIZI total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now nearly 20%, second only to HUMIRA. Internationally, SKYRIZI continues to ramp nicely, having also achieved in-play patient share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. This compelling share performance will be further supported by 2 important near-term enhancements. The availability of more simple delivery forms for SKYRIZI, as well as the potential indication expansion in psoriatic arthritis. First, we recently launched the new and convenient SKYRIZI single-dose, 150 milligrams, self - injectable pen and syringe in major territories around the world. The market response has been very favorable, and the approval now makes SKYRIZI the only quarterly dosed brand that is available in a single self - injectable pen for patients. Second, we are preparing for the global launch of SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis, as we near approval decisions in both the U.S. and Europe. We received a CHMP positive opinion earlier this month, with anticipated approval in Europe by year-end. And we continue to expect FDA approval early next year. The addition of this indication, once approved, will round out Skyrizi's dermatology label, and give patients with PSA access to a new compelling therapeutic option. We're also making excellent progress with Skyrizi's development in Crohn's disease, which was recently submitted for U.S. regulatory review, with commercialization expected next year. Rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $450 million were up nearly 20% on a sequential basis. Total in-play RA share remains strong and now reflects approximately 17% patient share in the U.S., as well as leadership in a half a dozen key countries around the world. Internationally, RINVOQ share continues to ramp in RA. And we're making excellent progress with the recent commercial launches of PSA, AS and atopic dermatitis, where we have secured strong labels for each of these indications.  As many of you are aware, the FDA issued a safety communication regarding new and updated warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ in early September. While we do not yet have an updated label, we are closely monitoring prescription trends and feedback from the field. And we have not observed a significant impact to RINVOQ utilization at this time. That said, should the updated label restrict to use the TNF inadequate responders, we would certainly expect a near-term impact to new patient starts in RA. Based on the robust data we have generated across our development program against multiple biologics and later lines of RA therapy, we do expect that RINVOQ will ultimately attain higher share growth in the second line-plus setting, as most patients ultimately fail TNF therapies over time. Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and profile of RINVOQ and remain confident this asset will be a major contributor to AbbVie's long-term growth.  In Hematologic Oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 8.1% on an operational basis. Imbruvica and Venclexta have a strong position across multiple heme -indications, including CLL, where AbbVie's combined portfolio remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Global Imbruvica revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 0.3%. In the U.S., performance continues to be primarily impacted by a slower-than-expected market recovery in CLL, as well as some modest share erosion from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. New patients starts in CLL remain below pre -COVID levels, and it is difficult to predict when this dynamic may fully recover. Venclexta sales were up 38.7% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications, including a strong AML launch trajectory in the international markets.  In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.6 billion up 25% on an operational basis. I'm particularly pleased with the results and outlook for our emerging migraine portfolio, where we are now the only Company to have a portfolio of distinctive therapies to address the spectrum of this common complex and debilitating disease, including Botox Therapeutic, a unique foundational treatment for the prevention of chronic migraine, which is performing very well. Total sales of $645 million for all the Therapeutic Botox uses were up 22.5% on an operational basis. Ubrelvy, our leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine is also demonstrating rapid growth. Total sales of a $162 million were up nearly 30% on a sequential basis. Based on Ubrelvy's competitive profile, continued strong new patients starts, and a rapidly expanding market, we remain confident that Ubrelvy represents a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity. And now we're just launching Qulipta, the only oral CGRP specifically developed for the preventative treatment of migraine, which is already off to an excellent start. Early feedback from our physicians has been very positive given QULIPTA 's strong efficacy, safety, and convenient dosing profile relative to the current standards of care. The QULIPTA launch is being supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly through the first half of 2022. QULIPTA also represents a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity.  Now we believe having 3 distinct and competitively positioned therapies across the spectrum of migraine conditions with Botox Therapeutic, UBRELVY and QULIPTA, which each have been optimized for a specific migraine indication, enables physicians to tailor treatment for the broadest range of patients. Our portfolio of migraine therapy puts us in a very strong position to capture growth in this dynamic market. Turning to psychiatry, we also see robust performance with Vraylar, which remains the fastest-growing atypical anti-psychotic. Total revenues of $461 million were up 29% on an operational basis, with continued strong demand across schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar depression. Lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $871 million up 2.9% on an operational basis. Mavyret sales were $426 million up 2.9% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes still remain suppressed compared to pre -COVID levels. And we saw double-digit growth operationally for both Creon and Lupron. So overall, I'm pleased with our continued execution across the Therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike. Yeah, thank you, Mike. Look, it's a meaningful opportunity for sure. When we look at the market sizes, about 60 million total prescriptions for the adjunctive MDD market. And that's very similar to the bipolar market that we operate in now, so it's a very meaningful opportunity for us. If you think about the -- what Mike was saying in terms of the competitive profile, I think we have to remember that while it's got a fairly low share, the -- Vraylar is very attractive, which is why it's the fasting growing agent. So the efficacy is viewed very, very nicely overall, and I think that if approved, this also has competitive efficacy of very gentle metabolic profile, minimal weight gain, very tolerable, and also very simple dosing for the psychiatrists and the primary care doctors that look at this. So when you start to see the potential for an agent like Vraylar that's got the full spectrum across bipolar disease in terms of mania, mixed episodes and depression. And then the adjunctive depression indication, if approved, it will be very attractive. So we anticipate a nice catalyst here and certainly a nice add to Vraylar's overall profile. Yeah. Perfect. The second question you had was QULIPTA. And QULIPTA, its very early, we just introduced the product with our full commercial promotion. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have now as of this quarter, a dedicated migraine sales force which shows you how important we think that this franchise is and what we can do with this franchise. So we have an entire sales team out there that is launching QULIPTA and now also focused on UBRELVY. And the early feedback has been very strong. What we hear qualitatively from our field and certainly from our research in the first few weeks of launch is, first, the simplicity and strength of QULIPTA for prevention.  We see very, very nice response to our efficacy data, which is -- Mike has said before, and I've said before is on the very high end of preventative performance. So 60% of patients in our trials achieved greater than 50% reduction in migraine days, which is viewed as very significant. And almost 30% have a complete control. A 100% decrease in their migraine days. That's very compelling in terms of this Qulipta power. Also, physicians like the simple, everyday dosing, once a day.  And so things are quite strong in terms of our early qualitative feedback. So we do obviously anticipate that the majority of our prescriptions will be bridged prescriptions until are -- we get the full ramp of our market access, which as I mentioned, we're quite confident by the first half of the year, we should ramp similar to Ubrelvy, where ultimately, as you remember, we achieved about a 90% access in the U.S. So quite good early feedback on the launch, and again we think that the 3 assets together are unique competitive positioning for AbbVie. Yeah, I'll take the first one, thanks. So in terms of the source of business, we think that QULIPTA is going to source business from 2 primary areas. First is, the big headache specialists, the big neurologists. We think absolutely from our research and feedback that you'll start to see an early trade-off of the injectable MABS in favor of the orals and certainly in favor of QULIPTA. I think that this is viewed as very attractive. In many cases, some people have spontaneously highlighted wow it looks like a very strong MAB in a single oral pill. So that's a source of business in terms of market share trade-off. I think the other insight that we have from the market is that we are going to a -- calling on a substantial amount of high prescribing primary care physicians who don't write a lot of MABS, but they certainly write a lot of generic topiramate and some other older agents. And so we also see that we have a unique opportunity in a wider audience to source from physicians that really don't lean towards the MABS because of the injectable nature of those, etc. So we think we're going to have a good balance between those two sources of business and that's quite attractive for us right now. And Steve, it's Jeff. Just to build on Mike's point, if you think about the size of Vraylar now approaching $1.8 billion it has a 2.5 share in terms of the anti-psychotic market. It's a low share, high-value in growth area. When you think about most of our business is already stepped through in some cases one or two of the generics. The problem is that these patients are so fragile, they just don't respond well. We would still anticipate that with the new approval for MDD, you're still going to have step therapy and other approaches in the marketplace, but there is still a very nice commercial opportunity. That's just the way the markets work today. Yeah. I think if you look at the -- as I highlighted, that the market sizes are roughly the same. However, the competitive context is quite a bit different and the competitive set is a little bit different. So we view it again as an important incremental opportunity that even with low incremental share, that we can drive Vraylar to the -- that multibillion dollar guidance that we look at it. We do think it's an incremental catalyst, and an exciting approach if it were to be approved. Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. So typically, when -- we start to negotiate with the payers in the spring of the year for the following year. And typically those contracts can be multiyear contracts, maybe 2-year contract. So really that's the season where we'll have as Rob and Rick said, we'll have probably some more guidance over how things are shaping up for '23 and possibly '24 depending on the posture of the payers and how those things work out. So we're not quite there yet. I think that what I can say is we're quite confident based on the timing that I described in terms of general cycles, in terms of where we're going to be for our portfolio certainly in '22. In terms of QULIPTA, look, we are off to a very good start.  I can tell you that UBRELVY continues to run a pace, that total oral CGRP market is upwards of maybe 18% of new prescriptions. And it's still early and that would be us and neurotech in the acute segment. And at a theoretical peak level, you could see maybe 30% or 40% based on cardiovascular issues with Triptan's or some other issues. But we still have clear -- clearly some runway to go. It's probably a little early to sort of determine how that preventative segment will really grow because you've only seen really the MABS so far.  They certainly tripled the market size. How will both of these orals and particularly in oral like QULIPTA in terms of the market development run a pace? It's encouraging for sure, particularly, if you have all 3 of these agents in the market and the investment behind it. Right now though we feel quite comfortable with the billion-dollar opportunity for both of the orals."

            "name": "Rob Michael",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. As you have heard from Rick, Jeff, and Mike, we once again delivered outstanding performance this quarter, while also advancing our strategic priorities. Our results demonstrate the strong momentum of the business, and support AbbVie's long-term financial outlook. Turning to third quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.33 up 17.7% compared to prior year, and $0.13 above our guidance midpoint. This includes $0.05 from accelerated synergies, and $0.03 from mark-to-market equity gains. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.3 billion, up 10.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.1% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.6% of sales. Net interest expense was $585 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6% as Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.63 and $12.67 reflecting growth of 19.8% at the midpoint.  Excluded from this guidance is $6.34 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance continues to contemplate full-year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange at a 0.7% favorable impact on full-year comparable sales growth. This implies a full-year revenue forecast of approximately $56.2 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full-year assumptions. We now expect Aesthetics global revenue of approximately $5.1 billion. We now expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $3.3 billion. For IMBRUVICA, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion, reflecting slower recovery of the CLL market. For Mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. And we now expect Allergan expense synergies of approximately $1.8 billion. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $15 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.24 and $3.28, excluding approximately $1.14 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of September was $12 billion Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we announce an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. And we remain on track to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year, with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.3 times by the end of 2021, and approximately 2 times by the end of 2022. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I will turn the call back over to Liz. I would just add that obviously with the confidence we have and the dividend increase we announced today, we feel very strong about the long-term outlook. We haven't backed off on the high single-digit growth on 25 and beyond. You look at the portfolio we've assembled, you look at the assets we have today, you look at our pipeline, you look at the BD work we've been doing over the last couple of years, that was some nice licensing deals and we still feel very confident in the outlook for this business. We've seen movement in terms of consensus numbers since we've given just some direction on how to model it. I think right now, consensus in '23 sell-side consensus has about 41% erosion in the U.S. in '23. And we've said, think about it in terms of 45% based on what we saw in Europe in year 1, plus or minus 10% given the differences in the payer landscape in the U.S. versus other markets. So we have seen the Humira consensus move. Today, it's at 41%, so it's a lot closer than it was a year ago. Just as a reminder. I mean, so we gave that and we're using Europe as an analog, but keep in mind that the U.S. system is very, very different. This is why we gave you a range. And so as we get closer to '23, obviously we'll give more specific guidance on the U.S. But we are communicating as more directional information based on the experience we saw with Europe. Keep in mind there were 4 biosimilars that came in the market at that time, and there will be more biosimilars coming to the U.S. markets. So there's a different level of competitive intensity, but also it's a very different payer landscape. So it's something to keep in mind."

            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our third quarter performance and outlook and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie continues to perform very well. We once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.13. Total adjusted net revenues of more than $14.3 billion was up 10.8% on an operational basis, with balance growth across each of the major growth platforms. We continue to see double-digit revenue growth in immunology, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established very strong launch trajectories. These 2 assets are either approved, under regulatory review, or in late-stage development across all of Humira's major indications. And we remain confident that they will both be significant contributors to AbbVie 's long-term growth. Aesthetics is also demonstrating impressive double-digit operational sales growth. Our dedicated global aesthetics structure and increased investment are driving accelerated category growth across both toxins and fillers, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration. Our strategic investments and targeted field force expansions have improved overall our customer retention rates and significantly increased the number of first-time patients to our leading brands. We are once again raising our full-year guidance for aesthetics this quarter. And we view these portfolio as an extremely attractive growth opportunity over the long term with high single-digit compounded annual growth rates expected through the end of the decade. Our Neuroscience business drove robust double-digit revenue performance again this quarter. And we added a compelling new product to our migraine portfolio with the approval of Qulipta, a once-daily oral medication for the preventative treatment of episodic migraine. Our Hematological Oncology portfolio delivered operational sales growth of approximately 8% this quarter, despite a protracted market recovery in CLL, which remains below pre -COVID levels. Beyond the significant contributions of Imbruvica and Venclexta, we have an exciting oncology pipeline with several promising programs in development for blood cancers and solid tumors, to support sustainable long-term growth. These include Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, Epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, ABBV383 for multiple myeloma, lemzoparlimab for AML and MDS, as well as Teliso -V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer.  Lastly, we continue to make excellent progress with the integration of Allergan. Our financial results show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse Company with numerous products across our newly combined portfolio, delivering robust growth. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our momentum and we are once again raising our full-year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.63 to $12.67, reflecting growth of nearly 20% at the midpoint. Additionally, as noted in our news release, today, we are announcing an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, from a $1.30 per share to a $1.41 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. Since our inception, we've grown our quarterly dividend by more than 250%. In summary, we're demonstrating strong execution across our portfolio. We've assembled an impressive set of diversified assets with significant growth potential giving us a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, Jeff. Geoffrey, this is Rick. It's a great question. What I'd say is the following: If I look at SKYRIZI, I would say that SKYRIZI performance is very, very impressive. Jeff outlined what the in-play share is and what the total TRxs are and it's very close to the passing HUMIRA now, which in this short period of time is frankly a surprise, how quickly it has ramped. I think that's a very positive case. If I look at RINVOQ, actually the in-place share looks very good. Now, we would expect if the label gets changed and restricts the label to behind TNFs, that that will have some impact on the front line patients -- the na\u00efve patients that we're capturing now. And so we will see that impact. Having said that, I would say that when I look at RINVOQ's performance overall and how durable it's been throughout this situation, we'll obviously shift more towards second line patients and beyond, which was originally in the plan, but the emphasis would have occurred a year or 2 later than this, where we would have driven that. We have very good data to be able to support that.  The other thing I'd say is if you look at the indications that we have coming out for these two assets, we have AD, which is a very significant opportunity for us. We have PSA and is a very significant opportunity. But next year we have the IVD indications that are coming out. And I'd say there, when we gave the $15 billion forecast, the performance that was in our TPP or our target product profile that we had assumed, we have outperformed that in the clinical trials that we've submitted. And so I think that's a very significant opportunity for us, and a significant opportunity for us to outperform. Having said all of that, we don't want to reconfirm the guidance yet. We want to see what the final label looks like from the agency. And then we'll be in a position, I think, to come out and tell the investor community exactly what we think. The only other thing I'd say is, I think if you go back 5, 6 years ago, what we're trying to accomplish with the Company, we were basically trying to accomplish with the Company, build a set of assets that could ultimately significantly replace HUMIRA in the marketplace and be superior to HUMIRA. These 2 assets already are at $5 billion and growing very rapidly. So I think everything I know about these 2 assets, they'll be able to do exactly what we expect of them. Even in the most negative outcome from a label standpoint that we would expect. Second thing is we built a significant heme/onc portfolio, that when I look at the pipeline behind IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA I think there's a significant opportunity to drive significant growth in that portfolio. And then with the Allergan acquisition, I couldn't be more pleased. Aesthetics franchise is performing at an outstanding level, the neuroscience franchise is performing an outstanding level. I think migraine is a very significant opportunity for us to be able to drive, and eye care is another one. And so we now have multiple assets, and multiple portfolios to be able to drive the growth. And our goal is still what we described to the analysts early on, we expect to see the impact of the LOE on Humira in '23, and immediately be able to grow beyond that starting in '24, return to growth, sales growth at that point. And regardless of what happens with RINVOQ'S label, I have a high-level of confidence we can continue to do that. Rob, anything you\u2019d add? Okay. Andrew, this is Rick. So I will cover the second one, the Alvotech one. I'm going to have Rob cover the first one. Okay, Andrew, this is Rick. I'll cover the Alvotech situation. As you know, we're in litigation with Alvotech. I think it's important to understand the nuances behind that litigation. In this first set of litigation, this first wave of litigation, we are basically applying 10 patents in HUMIRA. And as you know, we have a very robust patent portfolio around HUMIRA, but these 10 patents are both formulation patents and indication patents. Many of these patents were challenged through the IPR process and upheld by the patent office. I'll give you some idea of the strength of these patents. The first thing I'd say to you is, we have a high level of confidence that we will prevail in this litigation. There will be a second wave of litigation that occurs after that, which will bring into the portfolio the rest of the patents that we think Alvotech infringes. So there could be another phase of litigation that occurs after this one, but I can tell you we're highly confident that we will prevail in this first set of litigation based on the strength of those patents. To specifically answer your question, if they were to prevail, which I don't believe they will, then it would accelerate the other patent settlements. Yes, that is correct. Mike. This is Rick. On Botox, I think one of the things when we first went through the integration process that was compelling to us was the amount of penetration in these markets and Allergan's ability to be able to reach out and touch consumers and activate those consumers. And that's part of what drove our decision globally to go with this fully integrated, totally dedicated Aesthetics organization.  Because in many other markets around the world, although the data is not quite as good as it is here in the U.S., but in China as an example you see is very similar kinds of dynamics. And so focusing that team purely on Aesthetics was part of the effort here to be able to drive accelerated growth. The second was, when we looked at the ability to be able to use various methods to be able to activate consumers. We believe that the business was being underfunded in a way, both in the way it was being funded and the total amount that was being funded. And so we did some early work to determine whether or not that funding could drive incremental market growth, and it showed a positive result. And then when we saw that, we applied significantly greater funding to it. And what you're actually seeing now, I think, is we are driving the market. We're bringing more patients into the category, and obviously because we have the leadership position from a market share standpoint, we get the vast majority of those patients. Is there still some pent-up demand? I would tell you it's hard to believe at this point that there can be a lot of it, but there has to be some of it. Remember those practices reopened in the U.S. in the summer of 2020. That's a long time to have pent-up demand, but it's impossible to tell one way or another. I would say the majority of it is certainly being driven by us activating patients and retaining more patients. One of the other things we saw was the retention rate was relatively low once you activated a patient. And so we spent some time working with the team to figure out how could you retain those patients at a higher rate, meaning they repeat their procedures. They don't just do it once and then disappear, but they come back for a second procedure or plus going to fillers as an example. So the data is very clear. If you look at the U.S. as an example, toxins and fillers are growing high 30% of the market. We're growing at about the same rate, maybe a little bit lower on fillers but about that rate on toxins. When we look at globally, the overall brands are growing at about that rate. And so, I think this is a business that is sustainable over the long term. When we say across the decade high single-digits, obviously, if we keep this growth rates. The business is getting bigger and bigger. So therefore, the percentage will come down a bit. But I'd tell you, I'm very optimistic about this market, and our ability to be able to bring new assets into this market. They can change the standard of care going forward and us being able to drive market growth at the same time. It's a very good business. Tim, this is Rick, maybe Rob and I will tag team this one. I'll start. I think the guidance we laid out of 45% or 48%, whichever is the latest number plus or -10%, is still guidance that we feel pretty comfortable with. To your point about, is the bulk of it priced? It is. Even if you look at the international market it's about 1/3, 2/3, or maybe slightly higher than that. I mean, 2/3 of its price, 1/3 of it is volume. And I would expect that we will maintain a significant part of the volume. Obviously, we don't talk publicly about what our manage care strategy is, but what I would tell you is we're close enough now to that 23 time-frame that you would expect us to be starting the work to ensure formulary access on all of our products, and certainly HUMIRA is one of those for 2023. And I think it is logical to assume that we will maintain that formulary position. And we've been pretty effective at doing that historically, so I believe will be pretty effective at doing it again. Rob, anything you want to add? Jeff lunge. So this is Rick, Steve. On Soliton, as you know, we obviously announced the -- our intention to acquire the Company and submitted it for approval. We did receive a second request. Maybe just to frame a bit why we're interested in this area. We tend to look at this market where the third major leg of the stool in a stage is body contouring. And this is a good fit with CoolSculpting, and CoolTones. Obviously, CoolSculpting is focused more on reduction of fat in targeted areas, and CoolTones more focused on the area of enhancing muscle tone in specific areas.  This particular asset is designed to reduce cellulite. We don't have a position in cellulite now so there's not any kind of competitive overlap in that area. Having said that, we are responding to the FTC's inquiry. We believe that's going reasonably well, so we would expect this to be resolved at some point here in the future. I can't tell you a specific date, but I would expect it to have a positive outcome over a period of time here. Yes, Jeff. So Ronny, this is Rick. On Alvotech, obviously these agreements that we have with the other biosimilar players are confidential, I'm not going to delve into some of the specifics around those. What I can tell you is what I said before. I mean, we are highly confident in our position with this IP. This IP has been challenged multiple times and we have a high degree of confidence that we will prevail.  So I think it's obviously a hypothetical scenario, but I don't -- I wouldn't give it a lot of merit. Second on interchangeable HUMIRA s as we've discussed previously, when we built the erosion model that we described a couple of years ago, or certainly a year-and-a-half or so ago, we did assume at that point that they were going to be 2 interchangeable biosimilars. It does matter from a pricing standpoint to some extent. So I think it will have an impact but it's consistent with what we had assumed. And so we've essentially taken that into consideration in the forecast that we provided you, and the estimates that we provided you. On drug pricing in the U.S., I would say it's a very fluid situation. It's a little difficult to truly understand exactly where we are. You are correct, if you look at this framework that came out yesterday [Indiscernible] talked about repeal of the rebate rule being eliminated. And it didn't talk about much else. Look, the things that we're focused on and things that we think would make a difference on our out-of-pocket costs for patients, and making them lower for Medicare patients, making them something that they can spread over a period of time -- a 12-month period of time to make the cash flow easier to deal with. And as we've said before, we think industry will play a role in that as one of the participants. And we would hope that we will get back to that, because I think -- we think that is the most fundamental issue is reducing the out-of-pocket costs for these patients."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology, where we had several regulatory updates and data readouts for both Rinvoq and Skyrizi across therapeutic areas. Following successful completion of the registrational programs for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, and Skyrizi in Crohn's disease, we submitted our regulatory applications for each asset in their respected indications. We saw a very strong data for both Rinvoq and Skyrizi as induction and maintenance treatments in UC and Crohn's respectively. And based on these results, we believe both drugs have the potential to become a highly effective, differentiated therapies in these indications. We anticipate approval decisions for both in 2022. Earlier this month, we announced positive top line results from our Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 program for Rinvoq in axial SpA, which included data from 2 standalone studies. One for ankylosing spondylitis patients who had an inadequate response to biologics. And another for patients with non-radiographic axial SpA. In the ankylosing spondylitis biorefractory study, RINVOQ performed very well, demonstrating significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms, as well as physical function and imaging endpoints compared to placebo.  We saw levels of efficacy in this difficult to treat refractory population similar to those more typically observed in bio-naive patients. These results will be added to our submission package for RINVOQ in AS which is currently under review by the FDA. In a non - radiographic axial spot study, RINVOQ also performed very well, meeting the primary and key secondary endpoints. We plan to submit our regulatory applications in this indication later this quarter as well.  RINVOQ's safety profile in these actual spot trials was consistent with previous studies, and there was no evidence for increased risk of DVT, PE, MACE events, or malignancies in either study. Based on the data generated in the select access program, we believe RINVOQ has the potential to improve care for patients suffering from Axial SpondyloArthritis by providing sustained disease control and rapid and durable pain reduction as well as improving function. As you're likely aware, in September, the FDA communicated that they will require new warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ and their use will be limited to certain patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate anti - TNFs. We continue to work with the FDA regarding updated labeling language for the RA indication, while simultaneously engaging with the agency on our files for atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. We remain confident in our submission packages for these 3 new indications and continue to expect approvals following completion of the RA label update.  In the area of oncology, we continue to make good progress advancing all stages of our pipeline. We're nearing completion of several indication expansion programs for VENCLEXTA. In our study in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, which recently received a breakthrough therapy designation, we expect to make a data cut early next year to include 6-month follow-up data for duration of response. Based on this data cut, we plan to submit our regulatory applications to the FDA in the first half of 2022, for an accelerated approval. We continue to make good progress with Venclexta in the Canova trial, which is evaluating Venclexta in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation. VENCLEXTA has shown strong anti - myeloma activity in this biomarker-defined population and if successful, has an opportunity to play an important role in the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma. We expect a data readout from this event-driven trial next year. In our early to mid-stage hem/onc pipeline, we continue to expand the cohorts in the aducanumab Phase 1 2 studies in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.  And we're evaluating aducanumab as both a monotherapy and in combinations. We expect to see data from both the monotherapy and combo studies next year. And we will discuss the monotherapy data with regulators regarding a file for accelerated approval. We also recently began the dose escalation stage of the Phase 1b studies for [Indiscernible] in AML, MDS and multiple myeloma. And ABBV -383, our BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody, is currently in the expansion stage of its Phase 1 study in multiple myeloma patients. And we expect to begin registrational phase 3 studies next year. Moving to Neuroscience, where we had several notable pipeline events since our last earnings call. In September, we received FDA approval for Qulipta, the only oral CGRP specifically designed as a preventative treatment for migraine. We're very pleased with the label, which reflects Qulipta a strong benefit risk profile, and is supported by a robust clinical development program. In our registrational program, which evaluated Qulipta in nearly 2,000 patients suffering from episodic migraine, treatment with Qulipta resulted in a significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared to placebo. And approximately 60% of patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in the migraine days. We think these data compare favorably to other preventative migraine treatments on the market, and believe our new oral treatment option will be competitively positioned in the prevention market. Our migraine portfolio now includes Ubrelvy for acute treatment of migraine, Qulipta for preventative treatment of episodic migraine, and Botox for preventative treatment of chronic migraine. With this distinct portfolio, AbbVie is uniquely positioned to address the full spectrum of this complex and debilitating disease. This morning, we announced top-line results from two Phase 3 studies evaluating Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. In the 301 study, a 1.5 milligram a day Vraylar dose met the primary endpoint demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in total MADRS score compared to placebo at Week 6 with a highly statistically significant p-value of 0.005. In this study, the 3 milligram Vraylar dose did not reach statistical significance, but it did show a clear trend toward improvement with a nominal p-value of approximately 0.073 at Week 6. In the second phase 3 trial, the 302 study, neither Vraylar doses met the primary endpoint of change in total MADRS score at week 6. But both the 1.5 and 3 milligram doses demonstrated clear trends toward a clinically meaningful benefit at weeks 2 and 4, with nominal P values less than 0.05 for a number of comparisons. Additionally, as a reminder, we had 1 prior positive registrational Phase 2B study where Vraylar demonstrated efficacy in MDD when added to ongoing antidepressant treatment. Based on precedent in the field and the totality of the data, we believe we have a viable regulatory pathway for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. We plan to engage with regulatory agencies to discuss these results and expect to spend our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of next year. We also recently announced positive top-line results from a phase 3 study comparing our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system, ABBV -951 to oral levodopa/carbidopa in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. In this pivotal study, treatment with 951 resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in on time without troublesome dyskinesia, as well as similar improvements in normalized off time compared to oral Levodopa or Carbidopa. We're very pleased with these results, which we believe support our view that 951 has the potential to become a transformative improvement to current treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We plan to submit our regulatory application next year with approval decisions anticipated in the U.S. and Europe in early 2023. And in Eye Care, we announced the partnership with REGENXBIO to develop and commercialize RGX -314, a potential gene therapy for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other chronic retinal diseases. RGX-314 is a very attractive addition to our pipeline, and complements our Eye Care portfolio with a potential flagship product in retinal disease. REGENXBIO recently presented initial data from 2 Phase 2 studies evaluating RGX -314 in wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, using in-office suprachoroidal delivering. While early, these results are encouraging, with RGX -314 demonstrating efficacy at the lowest dose. And the study showing that the drug and delivery method both appear to be well tolerated. Also, in eye care, we continue to expect approval for [Viewty] (ph) shortly, formerly known as AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with Presbyopia. This once-daily eye-drop was developed to help address presbyopia that is often corrected through reading glasses. And once approved via convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild-to-moderate presbyopia who may not want to wear reading glasses. This has been a very productive year thus far for our R&D organization, and we anticipate several additional milestones in the coming months. We expect this momentum to continue into next year, which is looking to be a milestone filled year for AbbVie as well. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob. Okay. Thanks, Chris. This is Mike. I will take the first one, and then Rick will take the second part of your question. With respect to RINVOQ in the 3 new indications. So psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. We remain very confident in those files, and we remain very confident in approval decisions. The gating factor here is really getting to the specifics of the language around RA, which is a process that is well underway. And we would expect to be in a position to gain approvals after that is completed. And again, we hope that's completed in the near future, certainly this year. The psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings, we would expect to follow fairly closely on the heels of that RA decision for ankylosing spondylitis. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we rolled in a new study, which is a positive study and a very strong study in ankylosing spondylitis into that submission. And so that one might be on a slightly different time-frame, but we remain very confident in that approval as well. Okay. This is Mike. I'll take the first part of your question, and then Jeff will take the second part of your of your question. With respect to Vraylar MDD, in the study that you described the 1.5 milligram dose medicine point and met it with a highly statistically significant P-value of 0.005, so 0005. And that's important in terms of strength of evidence overall and weight of evidence overall. And then as you point out, in the 3 milligram arm in that same study, we didn't hit significance, but we had a P-value that was very small.  The nominal P-value is 0.073, if we around. When you look at that overall study to RA clearly shows an effect in NDD. Now, the second Phase 3 study that we just read out did not reach statistical significance for either dose group, but there were favorable trends and across a number of comparisons, there were nominal p-values that were quite small and many of them were out lower than 0.05. And I'll just remind the listeners that it's very common in depression studies, even with classes of medicines that have firmly established efficacy to have some study that read out positive and some studies that are negative. And so we think that overall package that we announced today is very strong. And it's also important to keep in mind that we did have a prior study that was conducted several years ago that was also positive that demonstrated a statistically significant effect. And that study -- look at different dosing, there were dose ranges that were studied in that trial with titration.  It was the upper 2 of the dose ranges that was significant, but it did show both a clinically meaningful and significant benefit. So we have 2 positive studies and that's important because the way these studies are typically looked at is an overall weight of evidence, do you have a convincingly positive phase 3 study? And is there other evidence within the overall data package that is supportive and we feel comfortable that that is the case here.  And lastly, what I'd say is, if you look at the precedent, and you look at other approvals, findings like the ones that we described on not a long time, and, in fact, that's the very common amongst approved agents in this space, including some of the more recent approvals in adjunctive NDD like resulting. So overall we think it is a strong package that has a viable regulatory pathway. And we will stack up very nicely to competitors. So we're going to begin those regulatory discussions shortly. So without I'll turn it over to Jeff. This is Mike. I'll take the question regarding REGENX. We're very encouraged by the recent data. If we take a step back and look at the program overall, they have very strong efficacy data already demonstrated with sub-retinal delivery and that's in a lot of procedure. But it gives us clear proof-of-concept for the approach, and shows that we can get durable control. And that component of the program is already in Phase 3. And then the more recent data that were presented just about a month ago, several weeks ago, looked at suprachoroidal delivery. So that is a delivery method that can be done in-office. It's a specialized form of injection, but it is a form of injection. And that is also showing very good promise. We're already seeing signs of efficacy in the first cohort, which is the lowest dose cohort, which quite frankly is sooner than we expected to see them before that study had started to deliver results. And the tolerability is very good. If one looks at the inflammation that has reported in the [Indiscernible] trials, it's very different in its nature and its [Indiscernible] than that, that has been seen with other agents. It's principally anterior, chamber is exclusively anterior chamber, there's no vasculitis, no more significant inflammation.  It is readily treated with topical steroids, and generally resolves without any difficulty, and in fact, quite rapidly. And it's also important to remember that there's no prophylactic steroids being used here. Other approaches have required that. So these are patients who have no prophylaxis upfront in responding to what's often a brief course of topical steroids. And the reason why there's no prophylactic steroids, given as they're just not felt to be needed given the very mild nature of the inflammation that's being observed. So we're very confident with it. And again, we feel it's qualitatively very different than what has been seen in other agents. And we've obviously talked to retinal specialists as well who are quite familiar with the program, and the views we've heard from them are supportive of what I just described. Okay. This is Mike. I'll start And then Rick will take the question regarding Soliton. With respect to the tone of conversations with the FDA for RINVOQ, I would describe them as productive. With respect to your question specifically about the RA label, those discussions are productive as well. I would assume the base case is what they announced conceptually back in early September, but we are working through the specifics of how that translates into labeling language. And I would characterize the discussions around the other indications as being very productive and very positive as well. And so as I mentioned earlier in this call, we remain very confident in the files for those new indications for all three of them. With respect to Vraylar, head-to-head superiority studies are not typically done in this space. They are very challenging. It is challenging to show an impact even with established classes period in major depressive disorder and particularly in this space, because this is the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. So these are patients who aren't responding to the current therapies, and require an add-on and atypical antipsychotics with pharmacology similar to Vraylar, our one of the most commonly used agents in this space. So we think the very strong data that we have from the study that we described, and the fact that we have prior supportive evidence as well from the earlier study, will position it very well to be competitive in that marketplace. So this is Mike. I'll take the Rinvoq question. So as you pointed out, yes, we are very confident in Rinvoq as a molecule overall. We've talked about the progress on the RA indication, and our confidence in the new indications, both those that are under review. And indications where we have data, but have not yet submitted like the IBD indications. And so we feel that it's going to be an important part of our portfolio, and the treatment armamentarium going forward. So having said that, immunology is always an area where we are scouring the landscape to look for the best opportunities.  So I wouldn't say it's changed our focus in any way or changed our approach, but we will continue to look for novel therapies that can raise the bar on the standard of care. Across a number of areas, the current indications where we are already playing and new indications that have fewer treatment options, areas like lupus and scleroderma. So the RINVOQ situation has not changed that strategy in anyway. I will take the RINVOQ question first and then make some comments on CF. What I would say about RINVOQ is our assumptions around the labeling at a base case are based on what the agency announced in their safety communication in September. That principally updates to the black box warnings that all of these agents have in fact all agents in immunology have some degree of this. They treat similar conditions to RINVOQ, for example, the TNS have some of the same but not all of the same warnings. Updating that section label is part of our base case and then the restriction that the agency described for certain patients around TNF inadequate response forms our base case. And those are the two factors that we're considering. We would not anticipate any limit into ration of therapy, for example. And the question those principally applies to the atopic dermatitis file, because we have just a single dose in the other files, in the files that are in the rheumatology space. And we feel confident about both doses in terms of the benefit risk that we've demonstrated in that atopic dermatitis program. It's really those two dimensions and how those translate into specific language in RA. And then of course, how they translate to the other indications, because TNFs are not the standard of care in all indications, they are not used in atopic dermatitis. So then it's how do those concepts get translated into the label in other indications. Those are the principal dimensions that we're looking at when we think about those programs. And again, we feel very confident in the files that we've put forward, and feel very good about how discussions have gone to date. With respect to CF and what we're looking for, we're looking for something that has demonstrated benefit compared to what's already out there, what will be out there at the time our agents come to market. Obviously the principal competitor, the only group with a marketed product right now in this space is Vertex so that's what we would be benchmark ourselves against.  I would say at an absolute minimum, you'd have to have efficacy that was just as good with other meaningful advantages. But what we're striving for is something that has an efficacy advantage of a small number of absolute FEV1 points. A small number of absolute FEV1 points might not sound like much, but it can translate into real benefit for patients in this disease. This is Mike. I'll take those 2 questions. So with respect to the ongoing reviews, what I would say is the discussions around the RA label update, and the new indications that are under our review are going on simultaneously. And there is some level of interdependence. In other words, we need to understand where the RA label will land, because some of those elements, like the warnings and precautions, will translate over to the other indications because in the U.S. you get 1 label for the molecule that applies across all of the indications. So there's some interdependency, that's why getting the RA label update resolved is a gating factor. Whether it could happen on the same day or in close succession, I think it's too early to call with that fine level of detail, but we would expect the psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings to follow in a very reasonable time-frame after that label update. As I mentioned, we're adding new data to the ankylosing spondylitis submission, which is the smallest of the three indications. And so that one might be on a slightly different time-frame as the agency reviews those new data. With respect to the SEC filings, the RA label update is not on critical path to file acceptance. What the agency looks at when they look at file acceptance is, have you provided sufficient data for them to evaluate the file, is it in an appropriate format that they can review, are there any significant deficiencies. And of course, we're very confident in the file that we've submitted, so we would not in any way anticipate any challenges there. And the RA safety label update is not a gating factor for that file acceptance. So this is Mike. I'll take that question. With respect to the data for 951, we're very pleased with the data. There is very strong efficacy, and the safety is within our expectations, it matches our expectations across essentially all important areas. What's important to keep in mind is this agent delivers transformative benefit to patients who have extremely difficult to control Parkinson's disease through other measures, and to have a very, very difficult time controlling their disease. For example, with orals or with other approaches. And so the overall picture has to be looked at in that context. With respect to treatment discontinuations, what I would say is the treatment discontinuations, The rate of that overall is very similar to what you see with similar devices with insulin pump like devices used across a range of conditions. Most of these were driven by either local tolerability issues like injection site reactions, which were principally erythema or technical usability issues because these are older patient populations with limited mobility and dexterity in many cases, and there's always a subset of patients who find that they have difficulty using any device under those circumstances. Again, those rates of discontinuation are very similar to what you see with similar insulin pump-like devices. And keep in mind this is a very, very large population. This advanced Parkinson's population, only a very small proportion of which currently get advanced treatments because it's so limited in how that can be delivered. We think there's a big opportunity here and that treatment discontinuation rate doesn't change that and is in line with our expectations. With respect to hallucinations. We know that that is on mechanism. Or Levodopa and Carbidopa and it's essentially evidenced that we are delivering Levodopa and Carbidopa in a way that's more effective than can be done through other methods. And it's something that can be titrated and something that can be managed. And what I would point to is in the other direction. The oral group, the control group that got oral Levodopa and Carbidopa had more falls. And that to our eye shows a lower degree of control, which matches the clinical efficacy data, because we know falls are common in Parkinson's disease patients. So we need to keep that in mind. And with the efficacy that we've delivered, we think these are all very attractive profiles and ones that will translate into significant real-world use. When we look at how this will impact overall use, again and keep in mind that the very broad population, only a very small segment which can access the therapies that they need to control their disease. Therapies like DUOPA, which is transformative, that takes us surgical gastric tube actually threaded into the small bow to get deep brain stimulation and other types of measures. This is a much less invasive approach that delivers very strong efficacy and we think that will translate very, very effectively into the real world."

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may proceed.\nLiz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for Allergan. For this comparison of underlying performance all historically reported Allergan revenues has been recast to conform to AbbVie\u2019s revenue recognition accounting policies, and exclude the divestitures Zenpep and Viokace. References to operational growth further exclude the impact of exchange. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our second quarter performance and outlook. And then Jeff, Mike and Rob will do our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie delivered another excellent quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.11, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04. Total adjusted net revenues of nearly $14 billion were up 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, approximately $375 million ahead of our expectations. These results demonstrate our strong and balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, hem/onc, neuroscience and aesthetics. Looking at the most recent trends, the vast majority of our portfolio is well into the recovery phase from the pandemic. In immunology, we continue to see strong recovery across the room, derm and gastro segments with positive trends across all key indicators, including new patient starts. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ continue to ramp nicely in their initial indications, with both products demonstrating robust double-digit sequential revenue growth. In neuroscience, Vraylar is demonstrating strong new prescription volume in the atypical antipsychotic market and the launch of Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine continues to exceed our expectations. Aesthetics continues to perform well above pre-COVID levels exceeding our internal expectations. We're pleased with the rapid market growth in both toxins and fillers, driven by our increased promotional resources globally, brand strength and COVID-related pent-up demand. Rapid global market demand is expected to remain well above historical levels in the near to medium-term and we are raising our full year guidance once again for aesthetics. While the recovery across the AbbVie portfolio is going very well in aggregate, in certain disease areas like CLL and HCV, we continue to see a residual impact from the pandemic. We expect these specialty areas to further recover as the year progresses. One of AbbVie\u2019s greatest strengths is the dedication and engagement of our people. Across AbbVie, the majority of our employees have safely returned to the workplace. And our field teams are now predominantly conducting live engagements with physicians and customers, where protocols and guidelines permit. I'm extremely proud of the teamwork and collaboration our people have demonstrated throughout this pandemic, to bring our medicines to patients and keep our business performing at a strong level. As an organization, we have also made a tremendous amount of progress with the Allergan transaction and integration. We just recently completed our first full year as a combined company, which I'd say has gone exceptionally well. We're tracking well against the operational and financial commitments we outlined at the time of the transaction, with a crucian performing above our original projections. But I'm particularly pleased with the robust revenue performance that we've been able to drive since acquiring Allergan. With 2021 sales tracking to grow significantly faster than legacy Allergan\u2019s historical performance. Our results continue to show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with numerous products within our newly combined portfolio delivering robust growth. Based on the continued strong momentum of our business in the quarter and our progress year-to-date, we are once again raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.52 to $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Our strong performance allows us to continue to fully invest in the business for long-term growth. As you'll hear from Mike momentarily, we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our research and development programs. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter and with our continued strong momentum of the business, which has positioned as well for the remainder of 2021 and many years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on commercial highlights. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. I'll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 13.8% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ continue to have significant impact on AbbVie\u2019s growth and performance, contributing more than $1 billion in combined sales this quarter. SKYRIZI global revenues were up 17.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting increasing market share globally. In the U.S., SKYRIZI continues to perform well and has maintained its leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at approximately 34%. SKYRIZI\u2019s total prescription share capture is now approaching 20%, second only to Humira. Internationally, SKYRIZI has achieved in-play patient share leadership in 13 markets, including Canada, France and Japan. RINVOQ is also demonstrating robust growth with global sales up nearly 25% on a sequential basis. We continue to see in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market, where physician and patient feedback remain very positive on RINVOQ\u2019s strong benefit risk profile. Internationally, RINVOQ access and share continue to ramp nicely in RA, with in-play market leadership now in half a dozen key countries. We are also making excellent progress with the regulatory approval and commercial launch of PSA and AS across several OUS countries. And we look forward to the approval and commercialization of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis later this year following the recent CHMP positive opinion for both the 15-milligram and 30-milligram doses. Humira global sales were approximately $5.1 billion, up 3.6% on an operational basis, with continued high single-digit revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 12.6% on an operational basis. In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.8 billion, up 13.2% on an operational basis. AbbVie maintains a strong leadership position in CLL with a combined portfolio, including both Imbruvica and Venclexta, new patient share of approximately 42% and total patient share of approximately 72% across all lines of therapy. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 7.2%. In the U.S., performance continues to be impacted by lower new patient starts in CLL, which remain below pre-COVID levels as well as increasing competitive dynamics from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. Venclexta sales increased 38.3% on an operational basis with strong demand across all approved indications. We're particularly pleased with the performance in AML with robust share in the U.S. and increasing momentum internationally following recent approvals in the EU and Asia.  In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.4 billion, up 29.6% on a comparable operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum with Vraylar, which recently achieved multiple all-time highs in weekly prescriptions and market share. Vraylar revenues of $432 million were up more than 25% on a comparable operational basis. And Ubrelvy once again delivered robust results. Sales of our leading acute migraine treatment were $126 million, exceeding our expectations. Feedback from physicians remains very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy\u2019s rapid and sustained pain relief, safety, convenient and flexible dosing profile and overall commercial access. Ubrelvy is now capturing roughly 9% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market, with more than 1 million cumulative total prescriptions since the launch. We continue to believe there is substantial room for long term growth in this rapidly expanding acute market based on unmet need and strong patient demand. In migraine prevention, we've also been planning and preparing for the forthcoming regulatory approval and commercial launch of Atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine. We're very encouraged with the efficacy profile of Atogepant, including reduction in migraine days versus placebo, as well as the overall percentage of response rates in patients. Now the launch of Atogepant will be supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly, we remain on track for a U.S. regulatory decision in September. Botox Therapeutics continues to perform well across nearly a dozen medical indications, with a total sales of $603 million, up more than 38% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, Botox Therapeutic remains a foundational prevention treatment, and the clear branded leader in new patient starts. Lastly, in our other therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eyecare, which had revenues of $919 million, up 24.1% on a comparable operational basis. Mavyret sales were $442 million, up 13.9% on an operational basis, although treated patient volumes remain suppressed versus pre COVID levels. And we also saw double digit comparable operational revenue growth for both Creon and Linzess. So, overall I'm pleased with the momentum of our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating a strong recovery as well as our progress with new recent product launches. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?\nMichael Severino: Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology where we had several notable pipeline events in the quarter. In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we reported positive top line results from the Phase 3 maintenance studies for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis, and SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease. In the RINVOQ UC maintenance study, both the 15 and 30 milligram doses met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 52. In the induction portion of the program, RINVOQ demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease. And the results from this maintenance study demonstrate that patients continuing treatment with RINVOQ maintain high levels of clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement at the one-year mark. In fact, maintenance treatment with either dose of RINVOQ resulted in some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in UC clinical studies. With the 30 milligram RINVOQ dose 52% of patients achieved clinical remission, 62% achieved endoscopic improvement, 49% achieved histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement, and 68% achieved steroid free remission. We are very pleased with how RINVOQ performed from a safety perspective as well. In this maintenance study, the exposure adjusted event rates for overall adverse events including serious and severe events were higher in the placebo group than in either RINVOQ dose group. Additionally, the exposure adjusted rates for MACE, VTE and malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer were comparable between RINVOQ groups and placebo. These results provide further evidence that RINVOQ has the potential to become a highly effective therapy for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We're also nearing completion of the Crohn's disease program for RINVOQ and expect to see data from the first Phase 3 induction study later this year. Results from the second induction study and the maintenance study are expected in the first half of next year, with regulatory submissions also anticipated in 2022. We also saw very impressive results from SKYRIZI in the maintenance phase of our Crohn's disease program, particularly with the 360 milligram maintenance dose, which met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response versus the withdrawal arm at week 52. Importantly, when we look at the most stringent endpoints, we see strong separation between SKYRIZI 360 milligrams and control with the response rates of 39% for endoscopic remission, and 29% for deep remission, compared to 13% and 10% for the withdrawal group at week 52. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in UC and SKYRIZI in Crohn\u2019s in the coming months. In the quarter, we also announced updates regarding our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. In June, RINVOQ received a positive CHMP opinion in Europe recommending both the 15 milligram and 30 milligram doses in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This CHMP opinion puts us on track for European approval in August. When approved atopic dermatitis will be the fourth indication for RINVOQ in Europe. Regarding our supplemental NDAs in the U.S., we recently announced that we were notified by the FDA that they would not need our PDUFA action dates for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis, which were in late June for psoriatic arthritis and AS and mid-July for atopic dermatitis. The agency cited their ongoing review of the tofacitinib ORAL surveillance study indicating that they needed more time to complete their reviews of the data. The FDA has not requested any additional safety analyses for RINVOQ since the PDUFA dates were missed. While there are no new action dates, based on our discussions with the agency, we expect decisions on our regulatory applications in the next few months. Following completion of the agency's review of the tofacitinib ORAL surveillance data. We remain confident in the benefit risk profile for RINVOQ across all indications. And we'll continue to work with the FDA to bring RINVOQ to market in these new disease areas. In our early-stage immunology pipeline, we recently began two new trials for ABBV-154 our TNF-steroid conjugate. We initiated a definitive dose ranging study in patients with RA and also started our Phase 2 study in polymyalgia rheumatica. Later this year, we expect to begin the Phase 2 study for 154 in Crohn's disease. Also in the quarter, we completed the induction stage of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis patients. While this CD 40 antagonists demonstrated greater efficacy compared to historical control, the efficacy results did not meet our prespecified criteria. As a result, we will not be advancing ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis. In oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings, data were presented from the GLOW and CAPTIVATE studies evaluating a Fixed Duration Imbruvica and Venclexta regimen in CLL patients. Results from these two studies demonstrated that the all oral Fixed Duration Imbruvica plus Venclexta regimen has the potential to provide deeper and more durable remission and extends progression free survival as a frontline treatment across the spectrum for the age and fitness status for CLL patients. We plan to submit these data to regulatory agencies and look forward to bringing this new Fixed Duration treatment option to CLL patients once approved. Earlier this month, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for Venclexta in combination with azacitidine for previously untreated higher risk MDS patients, based on the strong data demonstrated thus far in our ongoing Phase 1b study. We expect to see final results from this study in the coming months and plan to discuss the data with regulators regarding the potential to support an accelerated approval for Venclexta in MDS. Also in the quarter, we saw interim results from a Phase 1 study evaluating the BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody TNB-383B in multiple myeloma patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy. 383 performed very well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated patients, demonstrating an objective response rate of nearly 80% and a very good partial response or better rate of 63% and a complete response rate of nearly 30% at doses greater than 40 milligrams in the dose escalation cohort. Based on these promising results, we exercise our right to acquire TNB-383B from Teneobio. We expected the transaction to close in the coming months, and we\u2019ll provide more information on our development plan for 383 in multiple myeloma later this year. This is a highly competitive area. But based on the data to-date, we believe this BCMA CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and could be best in class as both a monotherapy and combination therapy across lines of treatment in multiple myeloma. We continue to make good progress with navitoclax program in myelofibrosis, which consists of randomized Phase 3 trials in both the frontline and relapsed refractory setting, as well as a single arm Phase 2 study. Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to submit our regulatory application with randomized Phase 3 data together with the Phase 2 trial results. We expect the Phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the second half of 2022 with navitoclax approval in myelofibrosis anticipated in 2023. In neuroscience, we recently completed the Phase 2 proof of concept studies for two assets, elezanumab in multiple sclerosis and ABB-8E12 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In the respective studies either assay meet the efficacy endpoints of the trial. And we will be discontinuing the development of elezanumab and MS and 8E12 in Alzheimer's disease. Given the enormous unmet need in Alzheimer's disease, we remain committed to finding disease modifying therapies. And we continue to pursue a range of approaches. We have several additional programs that are either in the clinic today or are in preclinical development. These include programs that modulate the neuroinflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease, such as our TREM2 and CD33 programs that are both in clinical development and programs that target pathologic tau through novel mechanisms, such as approaches that target intracellular aggregates for clearance that are in preclinical development. Following the accelerated approval of aducanumab in the U.S., there has been an increased focus on a-Beta directed programs. We have monitored this area closely over the last several years. And based on all of the available data, we believe there is a continued opportunity for an a-Beta directed monoclonal antibody that clears plaque more rapidly than existing agents with a reduced risk of amyloid related imaging abnormalities or area. We have profile the number of a-Beta antibodies preclinically. And we have a candidate with the potential to meet these requirements. We expect to introduce this candidate into the clinic by the end of this year or early next year. Also in neuroscience, we're nearing completion of our registrational program for a ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease. We recently completed an interim analysis in the first of two Phase 3 studies where our subcutaneous Levodopa Carbidopa delivery system demonstrated safety and efficacy, comparable to DUOPA after six months of treatment. The primary objective of this trial was safety, but efficacy was also evaluated as secondary endpoints. In this analysis, 951 performed very well, demonstrating a 52% reduction in normalized off time, and a 41% increase in normalized on time without troublesome dyskinesia. Patients also benefited from 915s 24 hour continuous Levodopa Carbidopa infusion, with patients experiencing substantial benefits in sleep and reduction in mourning off time. Full data from this six month interim analysis will be presented at a medical meeting later this year. Data from a second Phase 3 study are expected in the fourth quarter with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year, or early next year. And lastly, in eyecare at the recent meeting for the American Society for cataract and refractive surgery, we presented results from the Phase 3 Gemini 1 study evaluating our topical eye drop AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. In this study, 584 demonstrated improved near vision without impacting distance vision, with a rapid onset of action within 15 minutes, and sustained vision improvements for up to six hours. 584 has the potential to be convenient, on demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia, and we look forward to an approval decision later this year. So, in summary, we've made great progress with our pipeline in the first half of this year. And we look forward to several additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you, Mike. Starting with second quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.11 up 32.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were nearly $14 billion 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.6% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.7% of sales, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $606 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.52 and $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $6.48 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange have 0.9% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $56.3 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect aesthetics global revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, including approximately $2 billion from Botox Cosmetic, and approximately $1.4 billion from Juvederm. We now expect Restasis sales of approximately $1.1 billion and assume no generic competition in 2021. For Ubrelvy, we now expect sales of approximately $500 million. For women's health, we now expect global revenue of approximately $900 million. And for Mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.9 billion. Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are now forecasting adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.7 billion and adjusted SGA expense of approximately $11.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenue of approximately $14.3 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have 0.5% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.18 and $3.22, excluding approximately $1.64 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We are exceeding our revenue expectations in several areas, including Botox, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and eyecare. We've also delivered expense synergies of almost $800 million during the first half of this year, and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. And we have already paid down $12 billion of combined company debt. We expect to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paid down by the end of this year, with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4 times by the end of 2021. And approximately two times by the end of 2022. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance. And we are very pleased with the strong momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Shea. Our first question is from Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open, sir.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So maybe two if I could. So one, Rick, you mentioned some of the Allergan products, maybe doing better than your expectation. Can you maybe, I mean, I know you don\u2019t want to share your secret sauce. But in terms of what is it that you've noticed that has helped to drive those products? Because it seems like it's pretty much across the Board, from an aesthetic to Vraylar, Ubrelvy. So, is it around promotion efforts? Is it around some payor dynamics? Or anything you could share would be helpful there? And then the second one on Imbruvica. I just want to confirm, I think you guys said that the new patient share across all indications now is 42%. So, I just want to see you guys are in line with what you expect at this point. Obviously, there's been questions around some like competitors that have entered the market. And maybe you can just talk about the patients who are not studying on Imbruvica. So, what are you seeing as the reasons why they might be choosing a competitor? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Yeah, Vamil, this is Rick. I'll cover certain part of the first question, and maybe I'll ask Jeff to jump in and cover any additional thoughts that he might have. I think as you look at this business, one of the things that I think AbbVie is sort of known for is that, we tend to operate in a very focused and disciplined way, especially across what we consider to be growth franchises. We expect every one of our major businesses to develop plans, to be able to maximize the value of their assets, both from a strategic long-term basis, but also from a short-term tactical basis. And I'll use aesthetics as the example. Early on, we made the decision that we were going to fully integrate the aesthetics business to make sure that it had the focus and attention there it needed because we believe this business had a significant opportunity to be able to grow. We did that globally. So, if you look at Allergan in the past internationally, those people representing those products also had to represent eyecare and other therapeutic products. So, we moved those out into the therapeutic areas of AbbVie internationally and solely dedicated the aesthetics group internationally to just their products. And then in the U.S., we operate with a similar structure and a fully integrated R&D organization is totally committed to just developing aesthetics products and reports directly to Mike and then the Head of the Business for aesthetics reports directly to me. And we had them develop a plan that they are now executing against to be able to deliver against that. So, I think it's really three aspects of it from my perspective. It's one the structure we put in place. And that was a thoughtful, planned out structure. Two, it's the discipline processes that we use to be able to execute across all of our businesses. And then third, I'd say we have consistently invested and we do invest in businesses that we think have the opportunity to be able to drive long-term growth and performance in a way that we can drive that at maximum speed. And certainly, as you look at aesthetics, we've increased the investment in SG&A and we've increased the investment in R&D. Jeff, anything you'd add?\nJeff Stewart: I think, Rick, the \u2013 I would agree, I think, big piece Vamil, was the - is the level of the investment. So, as we looked at the - particularly the neuroscience compounds, Vraylar and Ubrelvy, we were able to structure the sales forces a little differently, which was important from commercial execution and also really upgrade and drive some of the investment around patient activation. So, I think that all of these brands are spectacular brands leadership position. And when we got that investment profile right, we've seen the response, so nothing that beyond that. Going back to your question on the hematology share, the 42% that I referred to was the combined AbbVie shares. So that's Imbruvica plus Venclexta across all lines of CLL. So, if you take a look - if I give you a little bit more color on the latest data that we have, for example, in frontline, we have 35% total AbbVie share, which is made up around 24% for Imbruvica and 11% for Venclexta. For second line share, for example, we have a 48% total AbbVie position, which is approximately 33% for Imbruvica and 15% for Venclexta. So, both of these brands are now operating at a very significant share level across CLL. I'll give you some more thoughts as you ask for in terms of color in the market. Beyond that leadership level that we have across the CLL indication, we do see that the CLL market is still suppressed. So, for example, patient starts year-to-date are down in the high single digits. And even within the quarter, they were down in the low single digits. We see that improving. And so that outlook looks to improve over the second part of the year. In terms of overall share dynamics, over the last several quarters, we have lost a few share points to Calquence, within the range of our expectations as they've ramped with their CLL ramp. But also interesting, we've seen that there's been some share increases in monotherapy CD20, which we think is also a COVID type of effect that will ultimately revert back to normality as we go along through the pandemic. So overall, the franchise is performing very, very well. And as you heard from Mike, we're tremendously excited about the future of the hem/onc franchises as we move forward.\nRob Michael: And Vamil, this is Rob. I'm going to come back to your first question. Just one more thing we should mention is, we've been able to really leverage our international infrastructure. And so, we set up this business. We have the aesthetics franchise, focus fully internationally on that business whereas Allergan had combined with therapeutics. So, we've been able to bring that focus and the level of investment. I think we've also been able to leverage our market access prowess. So, we\u2019re very strong across the globe. And so, when you think about the opportunities for us going forward, I think, international certainly plays a big role as we leverage the Allergan business.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just another one on aesthetics. Obviously, some incredibly strong numbers here. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on sustainability of this growth? So, I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of how much of what we're seeing right now is catch up as we exit lockdowns versus a more sustained step up in sales going forward? Just any color on that would be appreciated. My second question was RINVOQ in UC. Can you just put some of this data into context as you think about the competitive landscape, and particularly relative to what you had anticipated in your long-term guidance for this indication? I think you\u2019re about $1 billion in IBD sales by 2025. And is that we've seen more of this data set, just how comfortable are you feeling with that target and ultimately the role RINVOQ\u2019s going to play in this space? Thanks so much. \nRick Gonzalez: Hey, Chris, this is Rick. I'll take the aesthetics question and then Mike can maybe cover the second question that you had. So, it's a great question. And it's one that we have been looking at very carefully. I mean, if you just step back and you look at the performance of the business, we've done a number of things to drive the business. We believe this business is significantly underpenetrated when you look at the available patient population here and your ability to drive long-term penetration is tremendous. And so, that's why we've done the things that we've done to try to drive that demand. Globally, the aesthetic sales were up 31%. If we look at the U.S. toxin and filler business, the markets up about 40% versus 2019. So, but it's hard to evaluate, I can tell you the vast majority of it is driven by fundamental demand. And we can see that through the funnel that we see patients coming in and how many of them are activated to go get procedures. But we just conducted a fairly robust market research study to try to understand how much of it was COVID related. And we looked at things like how many of those patients got stimulus checks, how many of them were affected from an employment standpoint, and are now back at work? I'd say that study, if you looked at the data in that study, the conclusion that you withdraw from that is very little of it is COVID related. Now, I think the flaw is this, most patients are not going to say they use stimulus money for these kinds of procedures or other kinds of things. So, I think to the best of our ability, what I would tell you is about two thirds of the performance, I think, is fundamental demand, and maybe one-third of it is pent up demand. We're going to need a couple more quarters, I think to see how that plays out. But I'd say that's our best assessment right now. So, very robust growth either way, and it could sustain a little bit better than that. But I think, you can pretty well count on two thirds of it being fundamental demand at sustainable longer term. Mike?\nMichael Severino: I'll take the question on RINVOQ UC. What I would say is the data that we've seen from RINVOQ UC has exceeded our expectations from an episode perspective, and the results they are very strong. UC has been very difficult to treat pharmacologically and getting high rates of permission. And this response has been challenging and both has delivered those now account just across number of studies. And I think from a safety perspective, it's also performed very well. I commented in my remarks, fact that overall rates of these serious AEs are actually lower with RINVOQ [ph]. Now the reason for that is that many of these AEs are driven by self and with the improvement in the ease to use UC then improve as well. And with respect to events of interest, the safety profile has worked very, very well with their segment A, segment B and other events rates have been comparable to controls. And so overall, we feel very confident in the long term guidance that we put out. But one thing that's important to keep in mind is that long term guidance is 2025 guidance. And our IBD assets will be in relatively early stage of launch by that time. But the profiles that I've talked about not only for RINVOQ, but also for SKYRIZI bode well, not only 2025 guidance, but for the long term growth of that aesthetic as opportunity there as well.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Chris. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. You may ask your question sir.\nRonny Gal: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. First one is on ABBV-951. You've mentioned the efficacy rates. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the skin safety profile as compared to the neogen product or the apomorphine IV from Europe, especially when it comes to the some more severe effects like Abscess and Okta? The second question is staying with a pipeline is a little bit of budget a-Beta. Didn't take long for you guys to walk into that. I was kind of wondering if you can talk a little bit about the science that you're discovering, is the right approach to get to the best effect with minimal side effects to try to remove as much flak as possible in a very targeted manner? Or should the approach be to go after soluble [indiscernible] and approach to removal of plaque indirectly?\nMichael Severino: Okay, so this is Mike, I'll take both of those questions. With respect to 951 we\u2019ll publish full data from the Phase 3 study that I described at a medical meeting and then ultimately, in peer reviewed journals as well. But what I can say is the skin safety has looked good to our eye and is within our expectations well within our expectations. As one would expect with a cutaneous device, there are some local reactions, but those have generally been mild and resolved with continuing treatment. We've not seen significant issues with more severe types of skin about the safety profile, and we think the patient friendly aspects of subcutaneous delivery that has some parallels to an insulin pump like device will be a real advantage here because it allows patients to get that to open like efficacy that's transformative without the need for placement of a gastric tube that's unthreaded in the small bowel and very, very difficult to manage. And so, we feel very good about the potential for 951. With respect to a-Beta, I think if one looks at all of the data, it's quite clear that if you can remove plaque rapidly, then there will be a benefit, and the key parameter that we would need to see is deep reductions in level of plaque and rapid reductions in the level of plaque, because you won't start to see a cognitive benefit, we believe until you get to that amyloid negativity level bypass, which is 20 centroids, until you reduce patients to that level. So, the goal would be to get them there as rapidly as possible. And to do that, while minimizing the impact of area. And we think that that can be done through epitopes selection. There are slight differences in the amyloid forms that are present in vessel wall compared to plaque. And with appropriate epitopes selection, we believe that our preclinical data would support that you can do that with reduced risk of area. And of course, we now need to see whether the clinical data supports that as well. But those are the basic principles that we're following. We've obviously had these candidates before the aducanumab approval, because as I said, we've been monitoring this area quite closely. But we think this is a good time to advance those candidates and to determine whether the science I described plays out in the clinic. But our approaches with respect to a-Beta are based on plaque, not soluble forms of [Indiscernible].\nRonny Gal: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Ronnie. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum with Citi. You may ask your question.\nAndrew Baum: Many thanks. A few question, Jeff. Firstly, on the outlook for rebaiting and oncology, this is somewhat of a novelty, at least historically. I know that yes, excluded Calquence from their formulary, there's obviously increased therapeutic competition in the space. How should we be thinking about the rebaiting outlook and oncology going forward more broadly? Second, on the U.S. paybacks through COVID and now in the recovery stage, could you outline the magnitude of which you've had to increase and then decrease the Medicaid components in the patient assistance programs? Or whether you're seeing that improvements, some sense of scale and direction there? Many thanks.\nMichael Severino: Yeah, thank you, Andrew. And to start with oncology. I mean, largely, as you know the rebaiting has been done through the sort of the GPO channel. And particularly with the physician in office dynamics that are in that sector, we don't see significant rebaiting happening at the PDM level. And if it is, it's quite modest. I think the certainly from the ESI standpoint that you highlighted, that was an ESI decision. That was not certainly something that AbbVie approach that particular payer with any sort of deal. Our philosophy is that these drugs are very important for oncologists to have basically open access for all of these agents. So, I think it is something that we've seen some of these lights that have started to turn on. But they've been quite modest. And I don't think that they're going to be a super accelerant that we should be overly worried about. That's my position on that. I think this the second approach in terms of sorry, that was the question on the magnitude of the Medicaid. Yeah, this has been quite interesting. We've seen, certainly on all of the data, the fact that the enrollment in Medicaid has gone up. When we look across our businesses at let's say, acute channel shifts in terms of the utilization, they're relatively modest. They're there, so we don't see massive movements around our channels shifting that link to the magnitude of what you might see in terms of the enrollments. So it's relatively modest, certainly manageable. And I think, certainly, as we see the jobs positioned come back and that could be quite strong, I think we'll see any modest movement will be corrected over the next several quarters.\nRick Gonzalez: And this is Rick. Going ahead I'd add to the second question is so we have a very extensive and I would say generous PAP program in place that's really designed to ensure that patients who can't afford our medicines, have the ability to be able to access those medicines free of charge in many cases. As an example, 99% of the applications we get for uninsured patients we approve we actually just increased the program to 600% of the federal poverty level across all of our brands. And so, it's a program that I think is designed to fulfill the mission that I just described. And that is that patients who need our medicines can get them from us if they can't afford to pay for them, or whatever system that they operate in. And but we have not seen and much to our surprise, we have not seen that program increased dramatically, even through COVID. And we advertise directly to patients that if they lost their job during COVID, that we would provide our medicines to them. But I wouldn't say, as I said, much to our surprise we didn't see the volume go up dramatically.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Your line is open, sir.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. Lots of questions. But I'll focus first on RINVOQ. Rick, you've given the long term guidance of recall $7 billion in revenue by 2025. I think and by means correct me if I don't recall correctly. But if you only get the 15 milligram dose approved, if that's the outcome of the deliberations of the FDA, but you get the approvals in Europe, can you achieve that revenue guidance? You\u2019re confident enough in the 15 milligram program? And then secondly, for Mike. You'll see us development program seems to have been sort of reactivated. And could you talk a little bit about your conviction, a little bit more detail on a 119? We don't know much about that. Are you confident that it can be active see through correct that matches up to your competition? Because clearly that's a big revenue opportunity that we have reflected in. Thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: So, Jeffrey, this is Rick, on your first question. Yes, the guidance for RINVOQ is $8 billion. And I would say we're confident that even with a 15 milligram, we will sustain that guidance. If you look at the performance of the 15 milligram is quite remarkable. And so, we feel good about the performance of RINVOQ, we continue to see strong uptake of RINVOQ, and physician interest and is consistent with what we would expect. So, I think we're fine now.\nMichael Severino: This is my context, a question on the CF program. When we restructured the collaboration with Galapagos. A few years ago, to take direct operational control of that program, we had a couple of goals. One is we wanted to make sure that we're optimizing the potentiator in C1 components of the regimen. We felt we had a best in class, C1 in Q2. But we believed we needed to make a switch in the potentiator to one that we already had in hand. And we've done that. We also believe that we needed a C2 corrector. That\u2019s in that time period a few years ago did not exist. So, we needed a C2 corrector that had the potential to be best in class. And so, what we did is we put a significant internal chemistry effort to come up with a number of compounds. 119 is the most advanced and a very promising one that we believe fit that bill. And based on all the preclinical profiling, we think 119 can be a best in class C2 corrector. And with the other components of or triple, we think we can deliver best in class efficacy with appropriate pharmacological properties, dosing, low DDIs, et cetera. And so, we are now in a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study in the clinic to determine whether those preclinical data will in fact spare out. What I would say here is the preclinical assays are good. They're much more predictive than they are in other areas because we fundamentally know what the defect is in CF, and we can study it in appropriate tissues in human tissues in vitro. But ultimately, we're going to need to see the clinical data. By right around the end of the year, we'll see internally proof of concept results for that triple. We'd probably be in a position to announce them externally early next year, and those will be data that will include impact on FET1 with a triple. And so that will tell us whether we can be best in class. And I agree if we are best in class, I think it's a very significant opportunity and we will progress it rapidly. Now, it's a proof-of-concept study. So, if it's successful, we'd have some additional dose ranging to do. We're studying the highest dose of 119, to determine whether it can have that effect we'd have to do some additional dose ranging to determine the optimal dose of 119, but that can be done rapidly. And then we would, if successful move into Phase 3 development.\nGeoffrey Porges: All right. Thanks Mike.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from 6 Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nGeoff Meacham: Morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just had a few quick ones. Another one on JAK safety. And Mike you mentioned you expect regulatory action in the next few months? Can you just give us some perspective on that? Is there any data that you're still waiting on to submit? And is there still the potential for an advisory panel? And then the second one is on Ubrelvy. Maybe just give us some color on the on the new start dynamic? What are the patients recapturing? What share are you getting from and maybe just help us with kind of the -- what other wins do you have to make with respect to formulary access and share? Thank you.\nMichael Severino: I'll take the first question and then Jeff will take the second question on Ubrelvy. So, with respect to JAK safety, we have indicated that we believe that an action is possible in the next few months. That's based on our discussions with the agency and what timing we think is reasonable. It's not a specific action date, like the PDUFA dates that had been set in the past. So, we will continue to monitor it as the process continues to move along. But the rate limiting factor, as we understand it is the agency's review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance data. And I think once that is completed, we will be able to move forward with Goodspeed with arm review. But there are no additional data from a safety perspective or no other substantial analysis that the agency is waiting on for us. We provided our updated benefit risk quite some time ago, as we announced publicly. And the agency has not requested any additional data. So, it's really that review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance is gaining as we understand it. With respect to an advisory panel, the agency always has the authority to call one if they desire to have one. But what I would say is, if they were planning on having an advisory committee. I would expect them to already be preparing for that and already have that process in motion. And we would know that, and there's no indication that that is underway at this time.\nJeff Stewart: Right, and I'll take the Ubrelvy question. As I mentioned, we're very, very pleased with Ubrelvy and really our overall migraine portfolio that we're rapidly developing here. To give you some sense, it's quite remarkable. I mean, if you look at the total acute oral CGRP category, so that's us and the competitor. It's about 18% of all new prescriptions, and it continues to grow very, very quickly. So again, it shows you how hard patients and physicians are. Are looking for the adoption of these particular agents, even though you have to step through a Triptan, some cases two Triptan. So, the market demand is very, very substantial. When we look to the overall performance, we can see that roughly the two agents are sort of splitting the acute indication. Some of the more weeklies are now being a little confounded by the new preventative episodic approval from Neurotech. But nonetheless, I think that's a small piece of the story. When we sort of peel out some of their new preventative scripts, we still have the leadership position for the acute market. But I really think the bigger picture is how fast that segment will expand over time? And we anticipate that will continue to lead that based on Ubrelvy\u2019s overall profile. Our overall access dynamics are quite good. So, we really have roughly a 90% access. Again, some of that access demands a step through a Triptan. But overall, when you look at how fast that category is going, we don't really anticipate that there's major new plans that we need to achieve any sort of incremental access position. And so, basically our commercial strategy continues to be how hard can we drive this acute segment and lead that acute segment. And as I mentioned in my prepared remark, anticipating the arrival in the late third quarter for Atogepant, which has just a spectacular profile for episodic migraine. So, thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Geoff. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. It's well known that AbbVie rebates heavily on Humira in the U.S. So, when biosimilars launch, won\u2019t you potentially have room to pull back on those rebates, which could mean, basically the meaningful offset to last Humira volumes. It seems like it could end up being in the billions of dollars that you could pull back in house. And I realized there's RINVOQ and SKYRIZI dynamic to consider. And related to that line of questioning how does the prospect of interchangeability biosimilars impact your thinking on this front? If interchangeable, generics are allowed or not allowed? How does that impact what you might do with those rebate dollars? And then second question, quick one, just the range of outcomes for when Imbruvica might face generics in the U.S. Is it in the realm of possibilities that AbbVie enters into settlement agreements with legal challengers that could push out generic timing?\nRick Gonzalez: Hi Jim, it\u2019s Rick. So, I'll cover the first two questions that you have there. I would say let me start with interchangeability. We've outlined now over the last year or two, I think pretty specifically what we view the biosimilar impact in the U.S. to be and we are assuming that there will be two interchangeable biosimilars. And that's in the thought process of the erosion models that we have described many, many times now. So, we are assuming there will be interchangeability. We're certainly not in a position where we're going to talk about what we're going to do from the standpoint of rebates. We've always competed very effectively in these markets. Certainly, the focus for us going forward is the next generation assets, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And you can see now, those two assets this year will do $4.6 billion. So, call it $5 billion. They're rapidly growing. And they're doing exactly what we had hoped they would do. They have higher levels of efficacy, and they're ramping dramatically. And they will buffer the impact of biosimilar impact in the U.S. And so, what I'd say is the strategy is going exactly the way we had hoped it would go. We'll fill out the range of indications on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And continue to drive those assets into the marketplace effectively. On Imbruvica?\nLaura Schumacher: Yeah, hi. This is Laura Schumacher. Our Imbruvica composition of matter patent expires in May of 2028 assuming that we get the pediatric extension. We do have later expiring IP covering methods of use formulations, crystal forms, and the like. Our long-range plan currently assumes the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in May of 2028 when the composition of matter of patent expires. There is litigation ongoing with one remaining and a filer. And we're awaiting a decision on that.\nTim Anderson: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Great, thank you Tim. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow up question on CFP, I guess first two parts here. First, are you confident that you have a potentiator that's active and improve versus the Galapagos compound? Because I think we've seen a lot of issues with people trying to develop potentiators. They're as good as Kaleidoco. And then, second, I know you talked about FPV 1, have you looked at sweat chloride at all? Obviously, you need a larger patient sample size to get a good directional view on FPV 1. I'm wondering if we looked at smaller patient numbers on sweat chloride. Thanks.\nMichael Severino: So, this is Mike. I\u2019ll take that. With respect to the potentiator, we are convinced that we have a potentiator that has activity and we've changed the potentiator from some of those prior combinations that were pursued earlier on in the Galapagos collaboration. We think that, that potentiator it has clear signs of activity, we think the C1 character is very good and probably best in class based on the data that we have seen that were generated earlier in the collaboration. We put this up, the principal piece that was missing was that CTO and we think we have a good one. With respect to the endpoints while it does take a larger sample size, to look at FPV 1 we feel like FPV 1 is what really matters here. That's what's going to translate into clinical benefit for patients. And so, our proof-of-concept study will show us FPV 1 and that's the primary measure that we are going to use to determine whether to advance the triple or not.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Matthew. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open, sir.\nSteve Scala: Thank you, a couple questions. Many of the questions so far suggests concerns around RINVOQ. But I'm wondering if this could all turn into be a positive. So, to what extent do you believe RINVOQ prescribing might be being held back by competitor product concerns? So, once those concerns are resolved and or RINVOQ emerges unscathed, if it does. RINVOQ could even do better. And we could be looking at a sharp acceleration in share gains and prescription trends in Q4. So that's the first question. And secondly, on Humira contract renewals that will be signed in coming months for 2022. What is the typical duration of those contracts? Are they typically 12 months? 24 months, 36 months? If you can give us an idea of that that would be helpful. Thank you.\nMichael Severino: Yeah, it's a very good question. And this question we fought a lot about, let me give you some perspective on RINVOQ. So, if you look at our, let's say, our demand performance, and I think I mentioned my prepared remarks, we've been very consistent about 15% in place share in the large RA market, which is just under Humira, which has grown a little bit over the COVID times and since January to about 18%. So, we're very, very stable. And I do believe that there is some overhang on certain segments of prescribers that have, let's say, going back a little bit to the TNF, really our own product, Humira. So, it's not outside of the realm of possibility as this resolves and really largely, as you probably heard, or seen Xeljanz has lost in play share over that period. So, I do believe there's a little overhang in certain, probably significant segments of Rheumatology. So, we are anxiously awaiting the resolution here of oral surveillance, which obviously has delayed our regulatory submissions. But it's not outside of the realm of possibility, given the very significant and differentiated data that we have in our packages, that we can see an acceleration as things resolve. But we're going to anxiously be monitoring. And certainly, be prepared to anticipate any outcome there.\nRick Gonzalez: And see, this is Rick. On the contracting question, I'll handle that one. It varies quite a bit based on product and by managed care organization, but I'd say typically, so it can be some of them can be as short as 12 months, it's probably more common to be in a 24 month range from a contracting standpoint.\nSteve Scala: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator next question, please.\nOperator:\nQ - Chris Raymond:\nChris Raymond: Thanks. Just on the a-Beta program and you answered a few questions. But I think I heard you describe the product that you're targeting the plaques and not the cybil forms of a-Beta. Just kind of maybe if you, wonder if you can give a little bit more color on the driver of that have gone forward with that. Did you guys -- does your science sort of tell you that amyloid beta oligomers, for example, are not a driver of the disease or this is more of a decision that's driven by the regulatory precedents of approving targeting the a-Beta plaques. And then maybe also, if you can get a little more detail on this molecule is likely an IV, or possibly subcue delivered antibody? Thanks.\nMichael Severino: So, this is Mike, I'll take that. With respect to the focus on plaque, I think when one looks at all of the data, you can conclude that if you can reduce plaque rapidly, from that point forward, you can see a benefit. So, in other words, getting the majority of patients to a level where they are amyloid negative by PET, so below 20 [ph] centoloids. And doing that rapidly is what's required to see a benefit emerge over time. And part of the importance of speed is that you're not going to see that benefit until you get to that level. So, if you spend the entire period of a trial, getting to that level, you don't then have an opportunity within that trial to see an improvement in cognition. And of course, for patients, if you don't get to that level fast enough, they're not going to drive benefit for a period of sometimes too many years. And they need really faster than that. So, that's our focus on plaque. With respect to different components and the role of oligomers. I think it's hard to tease that apart right now, what we know from the data is what I said that getting patients to amyloid negativity, but reducing plaque is what seems to drive a clinical benefit, whether there are upstream steps that one could try to impact to achieve the same result. I think it's an open question. And we're going where the science tells us to go today. With respect to IV or subcue, I think it's early to answer that question. It's going to relate to ultimately the delivered dose. And then dose forms that can be delivered. So, for example, there are on body injectors and other things that can deliver more than the traditional one or two and those of a solution containing a monoclonal antibody. So, there are approaches that could be IV or subcue, but I think it's a little bit early to make predictions on how that will all play out.\nChris Raymond: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. It comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nLuisa Hector: Hello, thank you for taking my question. Sorry, going back to RINVOQ again, but I just wanted to check that the approval of the pending indications isn't a particular gating item for your filing in UC. And then I see that you haven't changed your guidance for RINVOQ for this year. And I know previously, you've stated that maybe would only ever be a small contribution this year. But rather than self, I just wonder whether there's any particular savings on your launch costs this year due to the delay? And then maybe on TMB-383. Again, I think I've understood this is now 100% belonging to you. So just to check, no impact from the Amgen acquisition? And then when might we see a Phase 2 start looks like you have a dose data very compelling. So how soon could we be looking out for that trial starting data? Thank you.\nMichael Severino: Okay, this is Mike. I'll start with the RINVOQ question and pass it to Rob. And then I'll come back or the 383 question. With respect to the UC filing, the UC filing is not dependent on the approvals in the other indications. And obviously, the timing of release of review of the UC filing would carry it out to a point where those matters where I think, based on any reasonable expectation be resolved.\nRob Michael: Yeah, and your question regarding the guidance for RINVOQ. So you're right, we did give guidance to $1.7 billion early this year, assuming we would have a new indications approved. We said that would be a minor contribution, think of it in that couple of hundred-million-dollar range. But given the strong performance out of the RA indication, we've maintained that guidance, despite the fact that those approvals are delayed. There is some level of savings in terms of SG&A related to approvals being delayed. But at the same time, we're investing the business you'd look at, we're doing the aesthetics. Obviously, other parts of Allergan business, there's opportunity to invest more broadly. So overall, SG&A is up because we are investing for long term growth, but there is some level of savings associated with the RINVOQ delays.\nMichael Severino: With respect to 383, the BCMA, CD3 bispecific, you're correct, there is no impact of the Amgen acquisition of Teneobio on that. The asset would be ours and it would be unencumbered by anything related to the Amgen acquisition. In terms of Phase 2 timing, we plan to move forward very rapidly, not only with Phase 2, but with Phase 3 studies. With this asset, we think the data that have been generated are very strong, very high levels of response, good levels at the DGPR were better thresholds with a very good safety profile as well and a profile that would fit well with combination therapy and move to earlier lines of therapy. So, we'll advance the program aggressively and we'll update on the specifics a little bit later on in the year.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Luisa. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Daniel Busby with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nDaniel Busby: Good morning. I've got two questions. First, a bigger picture question on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. You've got to do peak sales for both products in the early 2030s. There's been a lot of focus on near term regulatory hurdles, particularly for RINVOQ. But there's also a lot that could happen competitively between now and then. So, with that said, what do you view is the biggest potential longer term competitive threats for both of those drugs, and particularly given the ongoing emergence and maturation of new drug modalities? And second, can you talk a little bit about the assumptions you've built into overall guidance relating to the Delta variant, and whether that's changed at all the way you think about the second half recovery? Thank you.\nMichael Severino: We go through a fairly rigorous and by that I'd say a very rigorous long range planning process where we evaluate what we think the comparative alternatives might be and the profile of our assets versus other assets. And I would say as we look at RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, and the clinical data that has been generated is certainly achieving or exceeding the expectations that we had for those assets. I don't see anything on the horizon, that would make it in a timeframe that would have a material impact on those assets based on the guidance that we provided, or even longer-term guidance out to typically do a 10-year long range planning process. So yes, there are certainly many, many modalities that are available today across many of these therapeutic areas. It's having the right kind of asset, and the right kind of clinical performance. And then everything else that wraps around that market access and all the other things you have to be effective at in order to achieve the level of performance that these assets are achieving. And so, bottom line is, I think we feel very confident in our assumptions here. As it relates to the Delta variant. I think as we look at the guidance that we are providing in the second half, it certainly is reflective of what we assume -- we don't assume dramatic changes in the U.S. or other major markets around the world and where we are today. We're assuming major levels of recovery in certain markets, either that are currently in lockdown, like Australia as an example, or in many of the Asian markets outside of outside of China and Singapore. So, I think we've properly represented it. I think the healthcare system in the U.S. in particular has experienced that we have last year tells us that the healthcare system can much better treat these patients. And we're not assuming that we see anything that would be significant in this shift in the U.S. from a lockdown standpoint.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Daniel. Operator, we have time for one final question.\nOperator: It will come from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.\nGary Nachman: Hi. Good morning. And thanks for squeezing me in. Sorry, but one more RINVOQ first. Curious why you think Europe doesn't seem as concerned with JAK class the way the FDA has been since you got the positive opinion on atopic derm for both doses there? And how you see uptake in Europe versus the U.S. overall? Is there a difference in perception, you think in those regions with the class? And then regarding Vraylar for MDD? How are the Phase 3 studies gone overall? Did you change anything with respect to enrollment numbers or sites during the course of the pandemic since these Phase 3 data are coming soon? And have you done any more work sizing up the potential market opportunity, where you think it would be used most for MDD? What types of patients? Thank you.\nMichael Severino: So, this is Mike, I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Jeff for some initial additional comments. With respect to RINVOQ and the regulatory environment in the prescriber perception prescriber environment, between Europe and the U.S., we do see differences. And the European authorities, and the European prescribing base seems to place less emphasis on these signals and view them more specifically to the molecules that generated the data then the EU have. Why that is? I can't give you a single reason other than these are both very large, competent jurisdictions that have come to their own impressions of the data. And those impressions have different somewhat. As you've said, for atopic derm we got the positive opinion from the CHMP for both the 15 and 30 milligram doses. We think the data are very supportive of that decision. And we look forward to launching that indication in Europe. And we think it's going to be an important additional indication, as it will be in the U.S. when we do get to approval. With respect to uptake in Europe, Jeff, I don't know if you want to comment?\nJeff Stewart: Yeah, as I mentioned in my remarks, the uptake on RINVOQ in many major markets is very, very strong. Now, as you know, waiting for reimbursement takes a little bit more time than the U.S. but as I highlighted, we have in play leadership and this is including the TNF to biosimilars in Germany, France, Canada, for example. So, it's quite strong. I think another point that I'd like to make, and we certainly see it in some of the early launch countries with PSA and AS. There appears to be a synergistic effect which makes some sense from a commercial standpoint. As countries like Germany start to introduce PSA and AS, the entire RINVOQ molecule starts to accelerate and move faster. And so again, given the last question I answered, we're actually anxiously awaiting the approval of those extra room indications there. So it's quite strong. And as I highlighted again and Mike mentioned, our label here in atopic derm is going to look quite strong in the European markets. Mike, maybe you can hit on MDD and then I'll address the market structure there.\nMichael Severino: With respect to Vraylar and MDD, we did a deep dive on the Phase 3 studies shortly after closing the acquisition of Allergan. And what I would say is, we found that the studies were very well designed. We were comfortable with important considerations like patient selection, selection of sites that we believe would give quality data. We looked at the blinded aggregate characteristics of the population roles. You look at the baseline characteristics, and you don't know who's on active or placebo, but you can just see if you're enrolling the right patient population, and we believe we were. All of the measures are designed and seem to be behaving appropriately. And so, we feel good about the design characteristics of that study. And we did not feel that it was necessary to make any changes. But we did do that deep dive to be sure of that as I said, what we found was in fact reassuring. With respect to the market opportunity, I'll just make a couple of comments. And I'll hand it off to Jeff, for some more detail. But what I would say is, depression obviously is a substantial indication. And it's one that is very difficult to treat with existing agents. About 50% of patients don't achieve adequate control with monotherapy with frontline agents like SSRIs, or SNRIs. And so, there is an important opportunity for adjunctive therapy. And obviously, this is an adjunctive MDD indication. So, that would be the population that we would be looking at. Jeff, do you want to comment in more detail on that?\nJeff Stewart: Yeah, I mean, if we look at the market structure, obviously, you have schizophrenia, which is a relatively modest market, and we have a good growing position there with our existing indication. And then you have the prescriptions and really the different bipolar segments. And what I would say about not the big depression market, but the adjunctive MDD market that Mike spoke about. It's about the same size in terms of a prescription value to the bipolar segment. So, adjunctive MDD, if the studies were to progress as we see is really gives us a chance to access a market that's equally sized for the one that we're competing in today. So, it's quite attractive as we continue to look for the final readout of those trials.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Gary. That concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our second quarter performance and outlook. And then Jeff, Mike and Rob will do our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie delivered another excellent quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.11, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04. Total adjusted net revenues of nearly $14 billion were up 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, approximately $375 million ahead of our expectations. These results demonstrate our strong and balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, hem/onc, neuroscience and aesthetics. Looking at the most recent trends, the vast majority of our portfolio is well into the recovery phase from the pandemic. In immunology, we continue to see strong recovery across the room, derm and gastro segments with positive trends across all key indicators, including new patient starts. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ continue to ramp nicely in their initial indications, with both products demonstrating robust double-digit sequential revenue growth. In neuroscience, Vraylar is demonstrating strong new prescription volume in the atypical antipsychotic market and the launch of Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine continues to exceed our expectations. Aesthetics continues to perform well above pre-COVID levels exceeding our internal expectations. We're pleased with the rapid market growth in both toxins and fillers, driven by our increased promotional resources globally, brand strength and COVID-related pent-up demand. Rapid global market demand is expected to remain well above historical levels in the near to medium-term and we are raising our full year guidance once again for aesthetics. While the recovery across the AbbVie portfolio is going very well in aggregate, in certain disease areas like CLL and HCV, we continue to see a residual impact from the pandemic. We expect these specialty areas to further recover as the year progresses. One of AbbVie\u2019s greatest strengths is the dedication and engagement of our people. Across AbbVie, the majority of our employees have safely returned to the workplace. And our field teams are now predominantly conducting live engagements with physicians and customers, where protocols and guidelines permit. I'm extremely proud of the teamwork and collaboration our people have demonstrated throughout this pandemic, to bring our medicines to patients and keep our business performing at a strong level. As an organization, we have also made a tremendous amount of progress with the Allergan transaction and integration. We just recently completed our first full year as a combined company, which I'd say has gone exceptionally well. We're tracking well against the operational and financial commitments we outlined at the time of the transaction, with a crucian performing above our original projections. But I'm particularly pleased with the robust revenue performance that we've been able to drive since acquiring Allergan. With 2021 sales tracking to grow significantly faster than legacy Allergan\u2019s historical performance. Our results continue to show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with numerous products within our newly combined portfolio delivering robust growth. Based on the continued strong momentum of our business in the quarter and our progress year-to-date, we are once again raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.52 to $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Our strong performance allows us to continue to fully invest in the business for long-term growth. As you'll hear from Mike momentarily, we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our research and development programs. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter and with our continued strong momentum of the business, which has positioned as well for the remainder of 2021 and many years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on commercial highlights. Jeff? Yeah, Vamil, this is Rick. I'll cover certain part of the first question, and maybe I'll ask Jeff to jump in and cover any additional thoughts that he might have. I think as you look at this business, one of the things that I think AbbVie is sort of known for is that, we tend to operate in a very focused and disciplined way, especially across what we consider to be growth franchises. We expect every one of our major businesses to develop plans, to be able to maximize the value of their assets, both from a strategic long-term basis, but also from a short-term tactical basis. And I'll use aesthetics as the example. Early on, we made the decision that we were going to fully integrate the aesthetics business to make sure that it had the focus and attention there it needed because we believe this business had a significant opportunity to be able to grow. We did that globally. So, if you look at Allergan in the past internationally, those people representing those products also had to represent eyecare and other therapeutic products. So, we moved those out into the therapeutic areas of AbbVie internationally and solely dedicated the aesthetics group internationally to just their products. And then in the U.S., we operate with a similar structure and a fully integrated R&D organization is totally committed to just developing aesthetics products and reports directly to Mike and then the Head of the Business for aesthetics reports directly to me. And we had them develop a plan that they are now executing against to be able to deliver against that. So, I think it's really three aspects of it from my perspective. It's one the structure we put in place. And that was a thoughtful, planned out structure. Two, it's the discipline processes that we use to be able to execute across all of our businesses. And then third, I'd say we have consistently invested and we do invest in businesses that we think have the opportunity to be able to drive long-term growth and performance in a way that we can drive that at maximum speed. And certainly, as you look at aesthetics, we've increased the investment in SG&A and we've increased the investment in R&D. Jeff, anything you'd add? Hey, Chris, this is Rick. I'll take the aesthetics question and then Mike can maybe cover the second question that you had. So, it's a great question. And it's one that we have been looking at very carefully. I mean, if you just step back and you look at the performance of the business, we've done a number of things to drive the business. We believe this business is significantly underpenetrated when you look at the available patient population here and your ability to drive long-term penetration is tremendous. And so, that's why we've done the things that we've done to try to drive that demand. Globally, the aesthetic sales were up 31%. If we look at the U.S. toxin and filler business, the markets up about 40% versus 2019. So, but it's hard to evaluate, I can tell you the vast majority of it is driven by fundamental demand. And we can see that through the funnel that we see patients coming in and how many of them are activated to go get procedures. But we just conducted a fairly robust market research study to try to understand how much of it was COVID related. And we looked at things like how many of those patients got stimulus checks, how many of them were affected from an employment standpoint, and are now back at work? I'd say that study, if you looked at the data in that study, the conclusion that you withdraw from that is very little of it is COVID related. Now, I think the flaw is this, most patients are not going to say they use stimulus money for these kinds of procedures or other kinds of things. So, I think to the best of our ability, what I would tell you is about two thirds of the performance, I think, is fundamental demand, and maybe one-third of it is pent up demand. We're going to need a couple more quarters, I think to see how that plays out. But I'd say that's our best assessment right now. So, very robust growth either way, and it could sustain a little bit better than that. But I think, you can pretty well count on two thirds of it being fundamental demand at sustainable longer term. Mike? And this is Rick. Going ahead I'd add to the second question is so we have a very extensive and I would say generous PAP program in place that's really designed to ensure that patients who can't afford our medicines, have the ability to be able to access those medicines free of charge in many cases. As an example, 99% of the applications we get for uninsured patients we approve we actually just increased the program to 600% of the federal poverty level across all of our brands. And so, it's a program that I think is designed to fulfill the mission that I just described. And that is that patients who need our medicines can get them from us if they can't afford to pay for them, or whatever system that they operate in. And but we have not seen and much to our surprise, we have not seen that program increased dramatically, even through COVID. And we advertise directly to patients that if they lost their job during COVID, that we would provide our medicines to them. But I wouldn't say, as I said, much to our surprise we didn't see the volume go up dramatically. So, Jeffrey, this is Rick, on your first question. Yes, the guidance for RINVOQ is $8 billion. And I would say we're confident that even with a 15 milligram, we will sustain that guidance. If you look at the performance of the 15 milligram is quite remarkable. And so, we feel good about the performance of RINVOQ, we continue to see strong uptake of RINVOQ, and physician interest and is consistent with what we would expect. So, I think we're fine now. Hi Jim, it\u2019s Rick. So, I'll cover the first two questions that you have there. I would say let me start with interchangeability. We've outlined now over the last year or two, I think pretty specifically what we view the biosimilar impact in the U.S. to be and we are assuming that there will be two interchangeable biosimilars. And that's in the thought process of the erosion models that we have described many, many times now. So, we are assuming there will be interchangeability. We're certainly not in a position where we're going to talk about what we're going to do from the standpoint of rebates. We've always competed very effectively in these markets. Certainly, the focus for us going forward is the next generation assets, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And you can see now, those two assets this year will do $4.6 billion. So, call it $5 billion. They're rapidly growing. And they're doing exactly what we had hoped they would do. They have higher levels of efficacy, and they're ramping dramatically. And they will buffer the impact of biosimilar impact in the U.S. And so, what I'd say is the strategy is going exactly the way we had hoped it would go. We'll fill out the range of indications on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And continue to drive those assets into the marketplace effectively. On Imbruvica? And see, this is Rick. On the contracting question, I'll handle that one. It varies quite a bit based on product and by managed care organization, but I'd say typically, so it can be some of them can be as short as 12 months, it's probably more common to be in a 24 month range from a contracting standpoint."

            "name": "Michael Severino",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology where we had several notable pipeline events in the quarter. In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we reported positive top line results from the Phase 3 maintenance studies for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis, and SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease. In the RINVOQ UC maintenance study, both the 15 and 30 milligram doses met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 52. In the induction portion of the program, RINVOQ demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease. And the results from this maintenance study demonstrate that patients continuing treatment with RINVOQ maintain high levels of clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement at the one-year mark. In fact, maintenance treatment with either dose of RINVOQ resulted in some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in UC clinical studies. With the 30 milligram RINVOQ dose 52% of patients achieved clinical remission, 62% achieved endoscopic improvement, 49% achieved histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement, and 68% achieved steroid free remission. We are very pleased with how RINVOQ performed from a safety perspective as well. In this maintenance study, the exposure adjusted event rates for overall adverse events including serious and severe events were higher in the placebo group than in either RINVOQ dose group. Additionally, the exposure adjusted rates for MACE, VTE and malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer were comparable between RINVOQ groups and placebo. These results provide further evidence that RINVOQ has the potential to become a highly effective therapy for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We're also nearing completion of the Crohn's disease program for RINVOQ and expect to see data from the first Phase 3 induction study later this year. Results from the second induction study and the maintenance study are expected in the first half of next year, with regulatory submissions also anticipated in 2022. We also saw very impressive results from SKYRIZI in the maintenance phase of our Crohn's disease program, particularly with the 360 milligram maintenance dose, which met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response versus the withdrawal arm at week 52. Importantly, when we look at the most stringent endpoints, we see strong separation between SKYRIZI 360 milligrams and control with the response rates of 39% for endoscopic remission, and 29% for deep remission, compared to 13% and 10% for the withdrawal group at week 52. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in UC and SKYRIZI in Crohn\u2019s in the coming months. In the quarter, we also announced updates regarding our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. In June, RINVOQ received a positive CHMP opinion in Europe recommending both the 15 milligram and 30 milligram doses in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This CHMP opinion puts us on track for European approval in August. When approved atopic dermatitis will be the fourth indication for RINVOQ in Europe. Regarding our supplemental NDAs in the U.S., we recently announced that we were notified by the FDA that they would not need our PDUFA action dates for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis, which were in late June for psoriatic arthritis and AS and mid-July for atopic dermatitis. The agency cited their ongoing review of the tofacitinib ORAL surveillance study indicating that they needed more time to complete their reviews of the data. The FDA has not requested any additional safety analyses for RINVOQ since the PDUFA dates were missed. While there are no new action dates, based on our discussions with the agency, we expect decisions on our regulatory applications in the next few months. Following completion of the agency's review of the tofacitinib ORAL surveillance data. We remain confident in the benefit risk profile for RINVOQ across all indications. And we'll continue to work with the FDA to bring RINVOQ to market in these new disease areas. In our early-stage immunology pipeline, we recently began two new trials for ABBV-154 our TNF-steroid conjugate. We initiated a definitive dose ranging study in patients with RA and also started our Phase 2 study in polymyalgia rheumatica. Later this year, we expect to begin the Phase 2 study for 154 in Crohn's disease. Also in the quarter, we completed the induction stage of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis patients. While this CD 40 antagonists demonstrated greater efficacy compared to historical control, the efficacy results did not meet our prespecified criteria. As a result, we will not be advancing ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis. In oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings, data were presented from the GLOW and CAPTIVATE studies evaluating a Fixed Duration Imbruvica and Venclexta regimen in CLL patients. Results from these two studies demonstrated that the all oral Fixed Duration Imbruvica plus Venclexta regimen has the potential to provide deeper and more durable remission and extends progression free survival as a frontline treatment across the spectrum for the age and fitness status for CLL patients. We plan to submit these data to regulatory agencies and look forward to bringing this new Fixed Duration treatment option to CLL patients once approved. Earlier this month, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for Venclexta in combination with azacitidine for previously untreated higher risk MDS patients, based on the strong data demonstrated thus far in our ongoing Phase 1b study. We expect to see final results from this study in the coming months and plan to discuss the data with regulators regarding the potential to support an accelerated approval for Venclexta in MDS. Also in the quarter, we saw interim results from a Phase 1 study evaluating the BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody TNB-383B in multiple myeloma patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy. 383 performed very well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated patients, demonstrating an objective response rate of nearly 80% and a very good partial response or better rate of 63% and a complete response rate of nearly 30% at doses greater than 40 milligrams in the dose escalation cohort. Based on these promising results, we exercise our right to acquire TNB-383B from Teneobio. We expected the transaction to close in the coming months, and we\u2019ll provide more information on our development plan for 383 in multiple myeloma later this year. This is a highly competitive area. But based on the data to-date, we believe this BCMA CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and could be best in class as both a monotherapy and combination therapy across lines of treatment in multiple myeloma. We continue to make good progress with navitoclax program in myelofibrosis, which consists of randomized Phase 3 trials in both the frontline and relapsed refractory setting, as well as a single arm Phase 2 study. Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to submit our regulatory application with randomized Phase 3 data together with the Phase 2 trial results. We expect the Phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the second half of 2022 with navitoclax approval in myelofibrosis anticipated in 2023. In neuroscience, we recently completed the Phase 2 proof of concept studies for two assets, elezanumab in multiple sclerosis and ABB-8E12 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In the respective studies either assay meet the efficacy endpoints of the trial. And we will be discontinuing the development of elezanumab and MS and 8E12 in Alzheimer's disease. Given the enormous unmet need in Alzheimer's disease, we remain committed to finding disease modifying therapies. And we continue to pursue a range of approaches. We have several additional programs that are either in the clinic today or are in preclinical development. These include programs that modulate the neuroinflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease, such as our TREM2 and CD33 programs that are both in clinical development and programs that target pathologic tau through novel mechanisms, such as approaches that target intracellular aggregates for clearance that are in preclinical development. Following the accelerated approval of aducanumab in the U.S., there has been an increased focus on a-Beta directed programs. We have monitored this area closely over the last several years. And based on all of the available data, we believe there is a continued opportunity for an a-Beta directed monoclonal antibody that clears plaque more rapidly than existing agents with a reduced risk of amyloid related imaging abnormalities or area. We have profile the number of a-Beta antibodies preclinically. And we have a candidate with the potential to meet these requirements. We expect to introduce this candidate into the clinic by the end of this year or early next year. Also in neuroscience, we're nearing completion of our registrational program for a ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease. We recently completed an interim analysis in the first of two Phase 3 studies where our subcutaneous Levodopa Carbidopa delivery system demonstrated safety and efficacy, comparable to DUOPA after six months of treatment. The primary objective of this trial was safety, but efficacy was also evaluated as secondary endpoints. In this analysis, 951 performed very well, demonstrating a 52% reduction in normalized off time, and a 41% increase in normalized on time without troublesome dyskinesia. Patients also benefited from 915s 24 hour continuous Levodopa Carbidopa infusion, with patients experiencing substantial benefits in sleep and reduction in mourning off time. Full data from this six month interim analysis will be presented at a medical meeting later this year. Data from a second Phase 3 study are expected in the fourth quarter with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year, or early next year. And lastly, in eyecare at the recent meeting for the American Society for cataract and refractive surgery, we presented results from the Phase 3 Gemini 1 study evaluating our topical eye drop AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. In this study, 584 demonstrated improved near vision without impacting distance vision, with a rapid onset of action within 15 minutes, and sustained vision improvements for up to six hours. 584 has the potential to be convenient, on demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia, and we look forward to an approval decision later this year. So, in summary, we've made great progress with our pipeline in the first half of this year. And we look forward to several additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? I'll take the question on RINVOQ UC. What I would say is the data that we've seen from RINVOQ UC has exceeded our expectations from an episode perspective, and the results they are very strong. UC has been very difficult to treat pharmacologically and getting high rates of permission. And this response has been challenging and both has delivered those now account just across number of studies. And I think from a safety perspective, it's also performed very well. I commented in my remarks, fact that overall rates of these serious AEs are actually lower with RINVOQ [ph]. Now the reason for that is that many of these AEs are driven by self and with the improvement in the ease to use UC then improve as well. And with respect to events of interest, the safety profile has worked very, very well with their segment A, segment B and other events rates have been comparable to controls. And so overall, we feel very confident in the long term guidance that we put out. But one thing that's important to keep in mind is that long term guidance is 2025 guidance. And our IBD assets will be in relatively early stage of launch by that time. But the profiles that I've talked about not only for RINVOQ, but also for SKYRIZI bode well, not only 2025 guidance, but for the long term growth of that aesthetic as opportunity there as well. Okay, so this is Mike, I'll take both of those questions. With respect to 951 we\u2019ll publish full data from the Phase 3 study that I described at a medical meeting and then ultimately, in peer reviewed journals as well. But what I can say is the skin safety has looked good to our eye and is within our expectations well within our expectations. As one would expect with a cutaneous device, there are some local reactions, but those have generally been mild and resolved with continuing treatment. We've not seen significant issues with more severe types of skin about the safety profile, and we think the patient friendly aspects of subcutaneous delivery that has some parallels to an insulin pump like device will be a real advantage here because it allows patients to get that to open like efficacy that's transformative without the need for placement of a gastric tube that's unthreaded in the small bowel and very, very difficult to manage. And so, we feel very good about the potential for 951. With respect to a-Beta, I think if one looks at all of the data, it's quite clear that if you can remove plaque rapidly, then there will be a benefit, and the key parameter that we would need to see is deep reductions in level of plaque and rapid reductions in the level of plaque, because you won't start to see a cognitive benefit, we believe until you get to that amyloid negativity level bypass, which is 20 centroids, until you reduce patients to that level. So, the goal would be to get them there as rapidly as possible. And to do that, while minimizing the impact of area. And we think that that can be done through epitopes selection. There are slight differences in the amyloid forms that are present in vessel wall compared to plaque. And with appropriate epitopes selection, we believe that our preclinical data would support that you can do that with reduced risk of area. And of course, we now need to see whether the clinical data supports that as well. But those are the basic principles that we're following. We've obviously had these candidates before the aducanumab approval, because as I said, we've been monitoring this area quite closely. But we think this is a good time to advance those candidates and to determine whether the science I described plays out in the clinic. But our approaches with respect to a-Beta are based on plaque, not soluble forms of [Indiscernible]. Yeah, thank you, Andrew. And to start with oncology. I mean, largely, as you know the rebaiting has been done through the sort of the GPO channel. And particularly with the physician in office dynamics that are in that sector, we don't see significant rebaiting happening at the PDM level. And if it is, it's quite modest. I think the certainly from the ESI standpoint that you highlighted, that was an ESI decision. That was not certainly something that AbbVie approach that particular payer with any sort of deal. Our philosophy is that these drugs are very important for oncologists to have basically open access for all of these agents. So, I think it is something that we've seen some of these lights that have started to turn on. But they've been quite modest. And I don't think that they're going to be a super accelerant that we should be overly worried about. That's my position on that. I think this the second approach in terms of sorry, that was the question on the magnitude of the Medicaid. Yeah, this has been quite interesting. We've seen, certainly on all of the data, the fact that the enrollment in Medicaid has gone up. When we look across our businesses at let's say, acute channel shifts in terms of the utilization, they're relatively modest. They're there, so we don't see massive movements around our channels shifting that link to the magnitude of what you might see in terms of the enrollments. So it's relatively modest, certainly manageable. And I think, certainly, as we see the jobs positioned come back and that could be quite strong, I think we'll see any modest movement will be corrected over the next several quarters. This is my context, a question on the CF program. When we restructured the collaboration with Galapagos. A few years ago, to take direct operational control of that program, we had a couple of goals. One is we wanted to make sure that we're optimizing the potentiator in C1 components of the regimen. We felt we had a best in class, C1 in Q2. But we believed we needed to make a switch in the potentiator to one that we already had in hand. And we've done that. We also believe that we needed a C2 corrector. That\u2019s in that time period a few years ago did not exist. So, we needed a C2 corrector that had the potential to be best in class. And so, what we did is we put a significant internal chemistry effort to come up with a number of compounds. 119 is the most advanced and a very promising one that we believe fit that bill. And based on all the preclinical profiling, we think 119 can be a best in class C2 corrector. And with the other components of or triple, we think we can deliver best in class efficacy with appropriate pharmacological properties, dosing, low DDIs, et cetera. And so, we are now in a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study in the clinic to determine whether those preclinical data will in fact spare out. What I would say here is the preclinical assays are good. They're much more predictive than they are in other areas because we fundamentally know what the defect is in CF, and we can study it in appropriate tissues in human tissues in vitro. But ultimately, we're going to need to see the clinical data. By right around the end of the year, we'll see internally proof of concept results for that triple. We'd probably be in a position to announce them externally early next year, and those will be data that will include impact on FET1 with a triple. And so that will tell us whether we can be best in class. And I agree if we are best in class, I think it's a very significant opportunity and we will progress it rapidly. Now, it's a proof-of-concept study. So, if it's successful, we'd have some additional dose ranging to do. We're studying the highest dose of 119, to determine whether it can have that effect we'd have to do some additional dose ranging to determine the optimal dose of 119, but that can be done rapidly. And then we would, if successful move into Phase 3 development. I'll take the first question and then Jeff will take the second question on Ubrelvy. So, with respect to JAK safety, we have indicated that we believe that an action is possible in the next few months. That's based on our discussions with the agency and what timing we think is reasonable. It's not a specific action date, like the PDUFA dates that had been set in the past. So, we will continue to monitor it as the process continues to move along. But the rate limiting factor, as we understand it is the agency's review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance data. And I think once that is completed, we will be able to move forward with Goodspeed with arm review. But there are no additional data from a safety perspective or no other substantial analysis that the agency is waiting on for us. We provided our updated benefit risk quite some time ago, as we announced publicly. And the agency has not requested any additional data. So, it's really that review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance is gaining as we understand it. With respect to an advisory panel, the agency always has the authority to call one if they desire to have one. But what I would say is, if they were planning on having an advisory committee. I would expect them to already be preparing for that and already have that process in motion. And we would know that, and there's no indication that that is underway at this time. So, this is Mike. I\u2019ll take that. With respect to the potentiator, we are convinced that we have a potentiator that has activity and we've changed the potentiator from some of those prior combinations that were pursued earlier on in the Galapagos collaboration. We think that, that potentiator it has clear signs of activity, we think the C1 character is very good and probably best in class based on the data that we have seen that were generated earlier in the collaboration. We put this up, the principal piece that was missing was that CTO and we think we have a good one. With respect to the endpoints while it does take a larger sample size, to look at FPV 1 we feel like FPV 1 is what really matters here. That's what's going to translate into clinical benefit for patients. And so, our proof-of-concept study will show us FPV 1 and that's the primary measure that we are going to use to determine whether to advance the triple or not. Yeah, it's a very good question. And this question we fought a lot about, let me give you some perspective on RINVOQ. So, if you look at our, let's say, our demand performance, and I think I mentioned my prepared remarks, we've been very consistent about 15% in place share in the large RA market, which is just under Humira, which has grown a little bit over the COVID times and since January to about 18%. So, we're very, very stable. And I do believe that there is some overhang on certain segments of prescribers that have, let's say, going back a little bit to the TNF, really our own product, Humira. So, it's not outside of the realm of possibility as this resolves and really largely, as you probably heard, or seen Xeljanz has lost in play share over that period. So, I do believe there's a little overhang in certain, probably significant segments of Rheumatology. So, we are anxiously awaiting the resolution here of oral surveillance, which obviously has delayed our regulatory submissions. But it's not outside of the realm of possibility, given the very significant and differentiated data that we have in our packages, that we can see an acceleration as things resolve. But we're going to anxiously be monitoring. And certainly, be prepared to anticipate any outcome there. So, this is Mike, I'll take that. With respect to the focus on plaque, I think when one looks at all of the data, you can conclude that if you can reduce plaque rapidly, from that point forward, you can see a benefit. So, in other words, getting the majority of patients to a level where they are amyloid negative by PET, so below 20 [ph] centoloids. And doing that rapidly is what's required to see a benefit emerge over time. And part of the importance of speed is that you're not going to see that benefit until you get to that level. So, if you spend the entire period of a trial, getting to that level, you don't then have an opportunity within that trial to see an improvement in cognition. And of course, for patients, if you don't get to that level fast enough, they're not going to drive benefit for a period of sometimes too many years. And they need really faster than that. So, that's our focus on plaque. With respect to different components and the role of oligomers. I think it's hard to tease that apart right now, what we know from the data is what I said that getting patients to amyloid negativity, but reducing plaque is what seems to drive a clinical benefit, whether there are upstream steps that one could try to impact to achieve the same result. I think it's an open question. And we're going where the science tells us to go today. With respect to IV or subcue, I think it's early to answer that question. It's going to relate to ultimately the delivered dose. And then dose forms that can be delivered. So, for example, there are on body injectors and other things that can deliver more than the traditional one or two and those of a solution containing a monoclonal antibody. So, there are approaches that could be IV or subcue, but I think it's a little bit early to make predictions on how that will all play out. Okay, this is Mike. I'll start with the RINVOQ question and pass it to Rob. And then I'll come back or the 383 question. With respect to the UC filing, the UC filing is not dependent on the approvals in the other indications. And obviously, the timing of release of review of the UC filing would carry it out to a point where those matters where I think, based on any reasonable expectation be resolved. With respect to 383, the BCMA, CD3 bispecific, you're correct, there is no impact of the Amgen acquisition of Teneobio on that. The asset would be ours and it would be unencumbered by anything related to the Amgen acquisition. In terms of Phase 2 timing, we plan to move forward very rapidly, not only with Phase 2, but with Phase 3 studies. With this asset, we think the data that have been generated are very strong, very high levels of response, good levels at the DGPR were better thresholds with a very good safety profile as well and a profile that would fit well with combination therapy and move to earlier lines of therapy. So, we'll advance the program aggressively and we'll update on the specifics a little bit later on in the year. We go through a fairly rigorous and by that I'd say a very rigorous long range planning process where we evaluate what we think the comparative alternatives might be and the profile of our assets versus other assets. And I would say as we look at RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, and the clinical data that has been generated is certainly achieving or exceeding the expectations that we had for those assets. I don't see anything on the horizon, that would make it in a timeframe that would have a material impact on those assets based on the guidance that we provided, or even longer-term guidance out to typically do a 10-year long range planning process. So yes, there are certainly many, many modalities that are available today across many of these therapeutic areas. It's having the right kind of asset, and the right kind of clinical performance. And then everything else that wraps around that market access and all the other things you have to be effective at in order to achieve the level of performance that these assets are achieving. And so, bottom line is, I think we feel very confident in our assumptions here. As it relates to the Delta variant. I think as we look at the guidance that we are providing in the second half, it certainly is reflective of what we assume -- we don't assume dramatic changes in the U.S. or other major markets around the world and where we are today. We're assuming major levels of recovery in certain markets, either that are currently in lockdown, like Australia as an example, or in many of the Asian markets outside of outside of China and Singapore. So, I think we've properly represented it. I think the healthcare system in the U.S. in particular has experienced that we have last year tells us that the healthcare system can much better treat these patients. And we're not assuming that we see anything that would be significant in this shift in the U.S. from a lockdown standpoint. So, this is Mike, I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Jeff for some initial additional comments. With respect to RINVOQ and the regulatory environment in the prescriber perception prescriber environment, between Europe and the U.S., we do see differences. And the European authorities, and the European prescribing base seems to place less emphasis on these signals and view them more specifically to the molecules that generated the data then the EU have. Why that is? I can't give you a single reason other than these are both very large, competent jurisdictions that have come to their own impressions of the data. And those impressions have different somewhat. As you've said, for atopic derm we got the positive opinion from the CHMP for both the 15 and 30 milligram doses. We think the data are very supportive of that decision. And we look forward to launching that indication in Europe. And we think it's going to be an important additional indication, as it will be in the U.S. when we do get to approval. With respect to uptake in Europe, Jeff, I don't know if you want to comment? With respect to Vraylar and MDD, we did a deep dive on the Phase 3 studies shortly after closing the acquisition of Allergan. And what I would say is, we found that the studies were very well designed. We were comfortable with important considerations like patient selection, selection of sites that we believe would give quality data. We looked at the blinded aggregate characteristics of the population roles. You look at the baseline characteristics, and you don't know who's on active or placebo, but you can just see if you're enrolling the right patient population, and we believe we were. All of the measures are designed and seem to be behaving appropriately. And so, we feel good about the design characteristics of that study. And we did not feel that it was necessary to make any changes. But we did do that deep dive to be sure of that as I said, what we found was in fact reassuring. With respect to the market opportunity, I'll just make a couple of comments. And I'll hand it off to Jeff, for some more detail. But what I would say is, depression obviously is a substantial indication. And it's one that is very difficult to treat with existing agents. About 50% of patients don't achieve adequate control with monotherapy with frontline agents like SSRIs, or SNRIs. And so, there is an important opportunity for adjunctive therapy. And obviously, this is an adjunctive MDD indication. So, that would be the population that we would be looking at. Jeff, do you want to comment in more detail on that?"

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. I'll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 13.8% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ continue to have significant impact on AbbVie\u2019s growth and performance, contributing more than $1 billion in combined sales this quarter. SKYRIZI global revenues were up 17.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting increasing market share globally. In the U.S., SKYRIZI continues to perform well and has maintained its leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at approximately 34%. SKYRIZI\u2019s total prescription share capture is now approaching 20%, second only to Humira. Internationally, SKYRIZI has achieved in-play patient share leadership in 13 markets, including Canada, France and Japan. RINVOQ is also demonstrating robust growth with global sales up nearly 25% on a sequential basis. We continue to see in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market, where physician and patient feedback remain very positive on RINVOQ\u2019s strong benefit risk profile. Internationally, RINVOQ access and share continue to ramp nicely in RA, with in-play market leadership now in half a dozen key countries. We are also making excellent progress with the regulatory approval and commercial launch of PSA and AS across several OUS countries. And we look forward to the approval and commercialization of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis later this year following the recent CHMP positive opinion for both the 15-milligram and 30-milligram doses. Humira global sales were approximately $5.1 billion, up 3.6% on an operational basis, with continued high single-digit revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 12.6% on an operational basis. In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.8 billion, up 13.2% on an operational basis. AbbVie maintains a strong leadership position in CLL with a combined portfolio, including both Imbruvica and Venclexta, new patient share of approximately 42% and total patient share of approximately 72% across all lines of therapy. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 7.2%. In the U.S., performance continues to be impacted by lower new patient starts in CLL, which remain below pre-COVID levels as well as increasing competitive dynamics from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. Venclexta sales increased 38.3% on an operational basis with strong demand across all approved indications. We're particularly pleased with the performance in AML with robust share in the U.S. and increasing momentum internationally following recent approvals in the EU and Asia.  In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.4 billion, up 29.6% on a comparable operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum with Vraylar, which recently achieved multiple all-time highs in weekly prescriptions and market share. Vraylar revenues of $432 million were up more than 25% on a comparable operational basis. And Ubrelvy once again delivered robust results. Sales of our leading acute migraine treatment were $126 million, exceeding our expectations. Feedback from physicians remains very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy\u2019s rapid and sustained pain relief, safety, convenient and flexible dosing profile and overall commercial access. Ubrelvy is now capturing roughly 9% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market, with more than 1 million cumulative total prescriptions since the launch. We continue to believe there is substantial room for long term growth in this rapidly expanding acute market based on unmet need and strong patient demand. In migraine prevention, we've also been planning and preparing for the forthcoming regulatory approval and commercial launch of Atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine. We're very encouraged with the efficacy profile of Atogepant, including reduction in migraine days versus placebo, as well as the overall percentage of response rates in patients. Now the launch of Atogepant will be supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly, we remain on track for a U.S. regulatory decision in September. Botox Therapeutics continues to perform well across nearly a dozen medical indications, with a total sales of $603 million, up more than 38% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, Botox Therapeutic remains a foundational prevention treatment, and the clear branded leader in new patient starts. Lastly, in our other therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eyecare, which had revenues of $919 million, up 24.1% on a comparable operational basis. Mavyret sales were $442 million, up 13.9% on an operational basis, although treated patient volumes remain suppressed versus pre COVID levels. And we also saw double digit comparable operational revenue growth for both Creon and Linzess. So, overall I'm pleased with the momentum of our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating a strong recovery as well as our progress with new recent product launches. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike? I think, Rick, the \u2013 I would agree, I think, big piece Vamil, was the - is the level of the investment. So, as we looked at the - particularly the neuroscience compounds, Vraylar and Ubrelvy, we were able to structure the sales forces a little differently, which was important from commercial execution and also really upgrade and drive some of the investment around patient activation. So, I think that all of these brands are spectacular brands leadership position. And when we got that investment profile right, we've seen the response, so nothing that beyond that. Going back to your question on the hematology share, the 42% that I referred to was the combined AbbVie shares. So that's Imbruvica plus Venclexta across all lines of CLL. So, if you take a look - if I give you a little bit more color on the latest data that we have, for example, in frontline, we have 35% total AbbVie share, which is made up around 24% for Imbruvica and 11% for Venclexta. For second line share, for example, we have a 48% total AbbVie position, which is approximately 33% for Imbruvica and 15% for Venclexta. So, both of these brands are now operating at a very significant share level across CLL. I'll give you some more thoughts as you ask for in terms of color in the market. Beyond that leadership level that we have across the CLL indication, we do see that the CLL market is still suppressed. So, for example, patient starts year-to-date are down in the high single digits. And even within the quarter, they were down in the low single digits. We see that improving. And so that outlook looks to improve over the second part of the year. In terms of overall share dynamics, over the last several quarters, we have lost a few share points to Calquence, within the range of our expectations as they've ramped with their CLL ramp. But also interesting, we've seen that there's been some share increases in monotherapy CD20, which we think is also a COVID type of effect that will ultimately revert back to normality as we go along through the pandemic. So overall, the franchise is performing very, very well. And as you heard from Mike, we're tremendously excited about the future of the hem/onc franchises as we move forward. Right, and I'll take the Ubrelvy question. As I mentioned, we're very, very pleased with Ubrelvy and really our overall migraine portfolio that we're rapidly developing here. To give you some sense, it's quite remarkable. I mean, if you look at the total acute oral CGRP category, so that's us and the competitor. It's about 18% of all new prescriptions, and it continues to grow very, very quickly. So again, it shows you how hard patients and physicians are. Are looking for the adoption of these particular agents, even though you have to step through a Triptan, some cases two Triptan. So, the market demand is very, very substantial. When we look to the overall performance, we can see that roughly the two agents are sort of splitting the acute indication. Some of the more weeklies are now being a little confounded by the new preventative episodic approval from Neurotech. But nonetheless, I think that's a small piece of the story. When we sort of peel out some of their new preventative scripts, we still have the leadership position for the acute market. But I really think the bigger picture is how fast that segment will expand over time? And we anticipate that will continue to lead that based on Ubrelvy\u2019s overall profile. Our overall access dynamics are quite good. So, we really have roughly a 90% access. Again, some of that access demands a step through a Triptan. But overall, when you look at how fast that category is going, we don't really anticipate that there's major new plans that we need to achieve any sort of incremental access position. And so, basically our commercial strategy continues to be how hard can we drive this acute segment and lead that acute segment. And as I mentioned in my prepared remark, anticipating the arrival in the late third quarter for Atogepant, which has just a spectacular profile for episodic migraine. So, thank you. Yeah, as I mentioned in my remarks, the uptake on RINVOQ in many major markets is very, very strong. Now, as you know, waiting for reimbursement takes a little bit more time than the U.S. but as I highlighted, we have in play leadership and this is including the TNF to biosimilars in Germany, France, Canada, for example. So, it's quite strong. I think another point that I'd like to make, and we certainly see it in some of the early launch countries with PSA and AS. There appears to be a synergistic effect which makes some sense from a commercial standpoint. As countries like Germany start to introduce PSA and AS, the entire RINVOQ molecule starts to accelerate and move faster. And so again, given the last question I answered, we're actually anxiously awaiting the approval of those extra room indications there. So it's quite strong. And as I highlighted again and Mike mentioned, our label here in atopic derm is going to look quite strong in the European markets. Mike, maybe you can hit on MDD and then I'll address the market structure there. Yeah, I mean, if we look at the market structure, obviously, you have schizophrenia, which is a relatively modest market, and we have a good growing position there with our existing indication. And then you have the prescriptions and really the different bipolar segments. And what I would say about not the big depression market, but the adjunctive MDD market that Mike spoke about. It's about the same size in terms of a prescription value to the bipolar segment. So, adjunctive MDD, if the studies were to progress as we see is really gives us a chance to access a market that's equally sized for the one that we're competing in today. So, it's quite attractive as we continue to look for the final readout of those trials."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Starting with second quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.11 up 32.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were nearly $14 billion 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.6% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.7% of sales, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $606 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.52 and $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $6.48 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange have 0.9% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $56.3 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect aesthetics global revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, including approximately $2 billion from Botox Cosmetic, and approximately $1.4 billion from Juvederm. We now expect Restasis sales of approximately $1.1 billion and assume no generic competition in 2021. For Ubrelvy, we now expect sales of approximately $500 million. For women's health, we now expect global revenue of approximately $900 million. And for Mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.9 billion. Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are now forecasting adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.7 billion and adjusted SGA expense of approximately $11.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenue of approximately $14.3 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have 0.5% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.18 and $3.22, excluding approximately $1.64 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We are exceeding our revenue expectations in several areas, including Botox, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and eyecare. We've also delivered expense synergies of almost $800 million during the first half of this year, and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. And we have already paid down $12 billion of combined company debt. We expect to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paid down by the end of this year, with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4 times by the end of 2021. And approximately two times by the end of 2022. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance. And we are very pleased with the strong momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. And Vamil, this is Rob. I'm going to come back to your first question. Just one more thing we should mention is, we've been able to really leverage our international infrastructure. And so, we set up this business. We have the aesthetics franchise, focus fully internationally on that business whereas Allergan had combined with therapeutics. So, we've been able to bring that focus and the level of investment. I think we've also been able to leverage our market access prowess. So, we\u2019re very strong across the globe. And so, when you think about the opportunities for us going forward, I think, international certainly plays a big role as we leverage the Allergan business. Yeah, and your question regarding the guidance for RINVOQ. So you're right, we did give guidance to $1.7 billion early this year, assuming we would have a new indications approved. We said that would be a minor contribution, think of it in that couple of hundred-million-dollar range. But given the strong performance out of the RA indication, we've maintained that guidance, despite the fact that those approvals are delayed. There is some level of savings in terms of SG&A related to approvals being delayed. But at the same time, we're investing the business you'd look at, we're doing the aesthetics. Obviously, other parts of Allergan business, there's opportunity to invest more broadly. So overall, SG&A is up because we are investing for long term growth, but there is some level of savings associated with the RINVOQ delays."

With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll discuss our first quarter performance and outlook, and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. We\u2019re off to an excellent start this year, delivering strong top and bottom line first quarter performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.14. Total adjusted net revenue of $12.9 billion was up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, nearly $250 million ahead of our expectations. These results include strong performance across each of our core therapeutic areas, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, neuroscience, and esthetics, as well as high single digit operational growth from hematological oncology. Additionally, we continue to see robust sales from our key and newly launched products. Skyrizi and Rinvoq contributed nearly $900 million in combined revenues this quarter, more than double the sales versus the prior year as both products continue to ramp in their initial indications. Imbruvica and Venclexta delivered combined sales of approximately $1.7 billion, reflecting continued leadership in CLL and other hematological malignancies. Vraylar, which remains one of the fastest growing medicines in psychiatry, delivered more than 20% comparable operational growth. Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, generated revenue growth of approximately 25% on a sequential basis, and within our leading esthetics portfolio, which is performing well above pre-COVID levels, Botox cosmetics and Juvederm are demonstrating robust performance. Both of these brands grew more than 40% on a comparable operational basis. The integration of Allergan also continues to go very well. As illustrated by our balanced results this quarter, we are clearly demonstrating that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with the scale and flexibility to fully invest in the business for long term growth. While the pandemic has categorically impacted our day-to-day lives, we are encouraged by the latest recovery trends. We see market growth and new patient activity increasing overall, especially in March, although certain markets continue to remain below pre-COVID levels, including CLL and HCV in particular. We expect that increasing vaccinations globally will continue to support a fully recovery across our therapeutic areas as we progress through the remainder of this year. Based on our robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance and we now expect adjusted earnings per share between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of more than 18% at the midpoint. I\u2019m also extremely pleased with our R&D prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities especially within our late stage pipeline. We\u2019re on the cusp of the potential commercial approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including five total expected approvals in 2021. This includes Atogepant, a novel oral CGRP for episodic migraine, adding to our already attractive migraine portfolio; a new eye drop for the treatment of presbyopia, as well as expanded indications for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis, and we expect more than half a dozen new product or indication launches in 2022, including Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, ABBV-951 for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, Skyrizi for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, Vraylar for major depressive disorder, and initial indications for Imbruvica and Venclexta. With these collective new growth opportunities and the continued momentum of our underlying portfolio, our long term outlook remains very strong. In closing, our focus remains on strong commercial and operational execution as well as pipeline advancement. I\u2019m pleased with the financial results for the quarter and the overall pace of the recovery across our portfolio. We\u2019re off to another excellent start in 2021. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Thank you Rick. We demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. Our immunology portfolio delivered global revenues of more than $5.7 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 12% on an operational basis. Humira sales were approximately $4.9 billion, up 2.6% on an operational basis with continued high single digit growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across our international markets, where the unfavorable impact was more moderate than expected in the quarter. Our new immunology agents, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are both demonstrating robust prescription growth well above all comparable launches. Skyrizi sales were $574 million, reflecting 34% in-play patient share, which includes new and switching patients. This is more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. Skyrizi total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now approximately 15%, second only to Humira. Additionally, we recently received approval for a single dose prefilled pen for Skyrizi which will reduce the number of injections per treatment. Skyrizi is now the only quarterly dose psoriasis treatment available in an auto injector, further improving the patient experience. Rinvoq sales were $303 million with strong in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market. Physician and patient feedback remains very positive on Rinvoq\u2019s level of efficacy, speed of response, and strong benefit-risk profile. Internationally, both of these new assets delivered strong double-digit sequential growth with ramping access in share. Skyrizi has now also achieved in-play patient share leadership in the EU 5 psoriasis market, exceeding Tremfya and Cosentyx and at parity with Taltz. As Mike will discuss momentarily, we are also making considerable progress to expand the uses of Skyrizi and Rinvoq in several immune-mediated diseases with half a dozen additional indication approvals expected later this year and in 2022. In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.7 billion, up 7.3% on an operational basis. Imbruvica continues to perform well across multiple indications, including CLL, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Imbruvica sales increased 2.9% on an operational basis this quarter with performance impacted by lower new patient starts within CLL, where the market remains below pre-COVID levels. Imbruvica growth was also unfavorably impacted by the COVID-relating stocking benefit that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. Venclexta sales were $405 million, up 24.5% on an operational basis with increasing share in frontline CLL and continued strong performance in AML. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 10.9% on a comparable operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of $346 million were up 21.2% on a comparable operational basis, reflecting a nearly 2.5% total prescription share of the U.S. atypical antipsychotic market. Within migraine, the launch of Ubrelvy is exceeding our expectations with $81 million of revenue in the quarter. Feedback from physicians has been very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy\u2019s efficacy, safety, convenient dosing profile, and overall commercial access. Ubrelvy is the number one branded acute treatment for migraine based on both new patient share and prescription growth. The oral CGRP therapies, including our leading Ubrelvy, now represent roughly 16% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market. We believe there is substantial room for long term growth in this rapidly expanding segment based on unmet need and strong patient demand. We also look forward to the expected commercial approval of Atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine later this year. Botox therapeutic is seeing a very nice recovery in chronic migraine as well as its other indications, with total sales of $532 million, up 7% on a comparable operational basis. Lastly in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $817 million. Mavyret sales were $450 million, down 28.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID levels, and we also saw double-digit comparable growth from Linzess, the leading branded prescription medicine in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with IBSC, or chronic idiopathic constipation. Overall, I\u2019m extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on track to deliver very strong revenue growth in 2021. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?\nMike Severino: Thank you Jeff. I\u2019ll start with immunology, where we continue to make good progress with Rinvoq and Skyrizi in new disease areas, as well as in our early and mid-stage immunology programs. We recently reported positive top line results from the second induction study for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. Similar to results from the first induction study, in this Phase III trial Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on disease activity as measured by clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The 45 milligram induction dose was well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previous Rinvoq studies. In these induction trials, we saw no DVT, PE, MACE events, or malignancies in the Rinvoq groups, and the rates of serious adverse events were numerically lower than placebo. We believe these induction data compare very favorably to other UC treatments on the market or in development and based on the data generated to date, Rinvoq has the potential to become one of the most highly effective therapies for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We expect to see results from the UC maintenance study this summer with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of the year. The Rinvoq program in Crohn\u2019s disease is also progressing very well, and we expect to see induction data from the first of two Phase III trials in the fourth quarter, followed by induction data from a second Phase III trial and maintenance data in the first half of 2022. We\u2019re also nearing completion of our pivotal program for Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s disease. Earlier this year, we reported positive results from the two Crohn\u2019s induction studies and we expect to see maintenance data this summer. Our regulatory submissions for Skyrizi and Crohn\u2019s disease remain on track for the second half of 2021. Following completion of our registrational program for Skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, we recently submitted our regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2022. We\u2019re very pleased with the level of activity we saw with Skyrizi on both joint disease and skin clearance in our Phase III program and look forward to providing this new treatment to patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis. Our regulatory submissions are currently under review for Rinvoq in three new indications in the U.S.: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. As we\u2019ve previously announced, the FDA recently extended the review periods for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis following a request for an updated assessment of the benefit-risk profile for Rinvoq in these indications. In response to the FDA request, we provided updated data from across Rinvoq programs in RA, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. Based on the review extensions, we now expect approval decisions for psoriatic arthritis in June and for atopic dermatitis in July. The regulatory action date for Rinvoq in ankylosing spondylitis is unchanged and remains on track for June. We remain confident in the benefit-risk profile of Rinvoq across all indications and will work with the FDA to bring Rinvoq to market in these new disease areas. Earlier this year, we received European approval for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and AS. Our European regulatory application for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis is under review and we remain on track for a CHMP opinion this summer with an approval decision anticipated in the third quarter. We also recently saw results from a four-week Phase Ib study evaluating our novel small molecule ROR\u03b3T inverse agonist, ABBV-157, in patients with psoriasis. By targeting ROR\u03b3T with an inverse agonist rather than an antagonist, we believe we can more effectively inhibit IL-17 production, thus resulting in a greater impact on skin inflammation. In our Phase 1b study, 157 showed promising activity as an oral psoriasis agent and we plan to move the asset forward to a larger Phase IIb dose ranging study in the second half of this year. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, we continue to make very good progress with our late stage programs for Imbruvica, Venclexta and Navitoclax, as well as with our early stage oncology assets. We remain on track for several key regulatory submissions, data presentations, and phase transitions this year. At the upcoming ASCO and EHA meetings, we will be presenting more than 40 abstracts, including results from the Imbruvica plus Venclexta CAPTIVATE trial fixed duration cohort in treatment-na\u00efve CLL patients. The Imbruvica-Venclexta combination is an important element of our hema-on strategy to provide a differentiated fixed duration treatment that offers deeper levels of response. Data from our Imbruvica-Venclexta combination studies will support regulatory submissions in frontline CLL later this year. We will also be presenting four-year follow-up data from Venclexta\u2019s CLL14 trial in frontline CLL as well as updated efficacy and safety data from a Phase Ib study evaluating Venclexta plus azacitidine in treatment-na\u00efve, high risk MDS patients. We expect this MDS study to complete in the second half of this year and, if positive, it could support a submission in the first half of 2022 to seek an accelerated approval. In the area of solid tumors, at the recent AACR meeting we presented Phase II results for Teliso-V in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, Teliso-V demonstrated promising response rates in heavily pretreated patients, particularly in patients with highly expressed c-Met where we saw a 54% objective response rate. c-Met is an attractive target across multiple tumor types, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer where approximately 30% of patients have over-expressed c-Met. Approaches in this area have historically focused on small molecule kinase inhibitors and anti c-Met antibodies, both of which have shown only limited efficacy in this patient population that has not been sufficient for approval. In contrast our c-Met antibody drug conjugate is a novel approach that we believe will have broader applicability and will provide enhanced efficacy compared to previous approaches. We recently began the second stage of our Phase II study which has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second line plus metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. We also plan to evaluate Teliso-V in the frontline setting, including in combination with other agents, as well as in other c-Met positive tumor types. We also have a next-generation c-Met ADC program that will be entering the clinic later this year. Our new c-Met ADC, ABBV-400, utilizes a topoisomerase inhibitor payload which we believe will provide greater anti-tumor efficacy against both amplified Met and over-expressed c-Met subtypes, thus providing deeper responses with broader applicability than other anti c-Met targeting agents. In neuroscience, we recently presented data from several key programs at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting. A total of 33 abstracts were presented, including data from the Phase III ADVANCE study in episodic migraine prevention, showing that Atogepant has the potential to be a highly effective, safe and well tolerated oral treatment option with a rapid onset of action. The FDA recently accepted our NDA for Atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine and an approval decision is expected in September of this year. We also presented results from an open label Phase III study evaluating Ubrelvy in perimenstrual migraine which showed that Ubrelvy has potential as a safe and efficacious treatment of migraine attacks that occur during or near menstruation. Menstrual-related migraine attacks can be more difficult to treat because they are often longer in duration, more severe, and often resistant to treatment. We presented data from a Phase I study demonstrating that ABBV-951 subcutaneous infusions maintain an equivalent Levodopa exposure to Duopa in advanced Parkinson\u2019s patients. Results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 are expected this summer with the regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of this year. We also remain on track for readouts in the fourth quarter from two Phase III studies for Vraylar in adjunctive major depressive disorder and, if successful, we would anticipate regulatory submissions in the first half of 2022. In eye care, we submitted our regulatory application in the U.S. for AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. 584 is a once-daily eye drop being developed to help address symptoms that are often corrected through reading glasses. This new technology represents a complementary product to reading glasses and would be a convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia. An approval decision is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. In esthetics, we are investing to accelerate key next generation toxins and filler programs. By combining the esthetic team\u2019s deep expertise with AbbVie\u2019s breadth and scale of resources, we\u2019ll be able to bring novel products to market significantly faster. Looking across our portfolio, we\u2019ve identified a number of programs to accelerate, including our short acting and long acting toxins, as well as our next generation bio-stimulatory tropoelastin and collagen fillers. Acceleration of these programs is expected to drive significant long term growth for the esthetics franchise. In summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you Mike. Starting with first quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, up 21.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $12.9 billion, up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis excluding a 1.1% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $622 million and the adjusted tax rate was 12.3%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of 18.8% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.10 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 9.8% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $55.9 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect international Humira revenue of approximately $3.1 billion and we now expect Botox cosmetic sales of approximately $1.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09, excluding approximately $1.78 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We realized over $360 million in expense synergies in the first quarter and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. We have already paid down $10.4 billion of combined company debt. We continue to expect cumulative debt pay down of $17 billion by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4 times by the end of 2021 and approximately two times by the end of 2022. In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interests of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please?\nOperator: Our first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Great, thanks so much for the questions. The first one from me was on Rinvoq and dose. As we think about FDA balancing lowest effective dose versus incremental efficacy and safety risks, what would the impact of only having a 15 milligram versus a 15 and 30 milligram approval have on your view on the atopic derm opportunity, which I think you talked about is about a $2 billion sales potential previously? Then my second question was just a little bit more color on the esthetic dynamics. Is there anything we\u2019re seeing with the results we\u2019re seeing--very, very strong here, is there any catch-up type event as the world reopens that we\u2019re seeing with these results, or are these sustainable underlying trends that are kind of coming in above expectations for that business? I\u2019m trying to get a sense of just how to think about that progressing as we go through the rest of the year. Thanks so much.\nMike Severino: Thanks Chris, this is Mike. I\u2019ll take the first question and then Rick will take the second question that you asked. With respect to Rinvoq, we feel very confident in the benefit-risk profile across indications and across the doses that we study. Having said that, both the 15 and 30 milligram doses have performed very well, both from an efficacy and a safety perspective, and so if you look at the efficacy results that we drove with 15 in atopic dermatitis, we drove high levels of response, very rapid response, and had a very prominent impact on itch, which is one of the most bothersome symptoms, with 15 as well as with 30. With the 15 milligram dose, for example, we saw statistically significant and clinically significant reduction in itch after only two days, which is really quite remarkable in this disease. Again, that\u2019s really one of the most bothersome symptoms to patients. We think we could be successful with either dose, to answer your question specifically, but we also remain confident in the benefit-risk of both doses.\nRick Gonzalez: Chris, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the esthetics one for you, as Mike said. I think if you look at the underlying performance of the esthetics business, in particular the market growth in the U.S. and in China, it\u2019s driving the fundamental growth that we see through the business. Certainly there is some impacts still from COVID, so we\u2019re seeing some impact there, but I think the majority of it is when we took over Allergan, we made a decision to really invest in promotion at a much higher level than they were investing in it prior, and they had an approach that was more of an episodic investment approach where we have basically made a decision that we\u2019ll fund across the entire year at a relatively significant level to drive demand, because the data clearly supports that you can grow this market. I think the best comparison is to start to look at what it looked like versus 2019, because you obviously had the COVID impact in 2020, but you take for example Botox - Botox versus 2019, cosmetic Botox versus 2019, it\u2019s up about 27%. The market\u2019s growing very robustly. Some of that is probably COVID-driven - these are U.S. numbers I\u2019m describing right now. Some of that is probably COVID-driven, but I wouldn\u2019t say a lot of it at this point is COVID-driven in the U.S. China continues to grow very well - in fact, I\u2019d say China is back to the level of growth, and we have expanded the sales force in China once, about four or five months ago. We\u2019re in the process now of going through a second expansion in China and we expect that China will continue to drive significant growth going forward. The one area that still is being impacted in a fairly significant way from COVID is the European market. We still see it--we see it starting to emerge in areas like the U.K., but there are other areas in Europe that are still in lockdown. I would expect that Europe and Brazil as well will hopefully start to see some recovery as we get into the second half of this year and they can start to contribute, which would add additional growth to the overall business. But I would tell you I\u2019m very pleased with the decisions we\u2019ve made around driving more promotion, and I\u2019m pleased with the execution of this team. This team has done extremely well in executing and driving the kind of share position that we want and the growth that we want, so I think it is sustainable going forward.\nChris Schott: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Chris. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much, appreciate the couple questions. First Rick, something we don\u2019t talk about a lot, which is the neuroscience portfolio, and you\u2019ve started reporting it combined. I know there\u2019s four products in there, but adding them up, the long term guidance you provided previously was about $8.3 billion, I think, and you\u2019re already annualizing it close to $6 billion. Could you give us a sense of how much upside that portfolio has, given the trends that you\u2019re seeing? Then on a related question, I hate to harp on the JAK question, but obviously there\u2019s a lot coming to us from what this impact might be, so if you were confined to the 15 milligram dose not because of any signal but because of the regulators\u2019 view of the safety of the class, how much impact would that have on the $8 billion long term guidance, and do you have other levers which you could pull to fill whatever shortfall that would cause? Thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: On the neuroscience portfolio, it is an area that we\u2019re very excited about, so maybe Jeff and I will tag team here. But I think when you look at the two major growth franchises there, being the migraine franchise and the anti-psychotic franchise with Vraylar, both of those, we think, have significant opportunity to continue to grow. You\u2019re obviously seeing Ubrelvy now perform extremely well in the marketplace - I think Jeff can probably give you a little more color on that, and Vraylar is continuing to perform very well as well. I think if we are able to achieve one positive study on MDD, I think that will give us significant growth going forward. This is a franchise that we\u2019re excited about. I think it will be a meaningful franchise for us over the long term scenario where we continue to look at assets that we could potentially add to it, and I think it will be a nice growth driver for us. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Yes, I think just to reiterate, as I mentioned in my comments, the oral CGRP market is moving very nicely. It\u2019s hit, I mentioned 16% for the quarter, but now on the weeklies it\u2019s 17% or above on just the penetration of that segment, so we see a lot of runway in that segment over our long range planning. Certainly the availability of another oral CGRP, in this case for episodic migraine, allows us to compete in a much larger segment beyond the acute, and to Rick\u2019s point, remember we have the big anchor asset with Botox therapeutic in migraine on the back end for chronic migraine and we have plans in place to expand that upstream also into episodic migraine. This is actually in some ways non-overlapping because we have a big injector base for Botox and then we can have the neurologist and primary care base for Atogepant, and so when you look basically really across the waterfront - you know, leading acute agent, oral, very, very potent and active oral agent in the middle with episodic, and then on the back end with Botox, it\u2019s a very nice portfolio for us that will drive growth. As Rick mentioned, we are encouraged on the potential for adjunctive MDD, and that segment itself when we do the market analysis is about as large, the adjunctive MDD segment, as bipolar depression, and so this basically has the opportunity for us to really double the potential penetration over our long range plans, so we\u2019re very encouraged over this set of assets.\nRob Michael: And Geoff, this is Rob. I would just add, if you can take the pieces we\u2019ve given in terms of long term guidance, for Vraylar we\u2019ve talked about approaching $4 billion with the current approved indications. For migraine, both Ubrelvy and Atogepant, we\u2019ve talked about peak potential greater than a billion for each of those assets, and then we have Duopa plus we have 951 in the pipeline, that I think can drive significant growth in addition to our early stage pipeline in neuroscience, so I do see that as a therapeutic area that will drive long term growth for the company going forward.\nGeoffrey Porges: Great, thanks. Then the JAKs?\nRick Gonzalez: On the JAKs, we\u2019ve obviously evaluated carefully the positioning of the product. I think if we look at where we are today, one, we\u2019re confident in the high dose that has a good risk-benefit profile, but I would tell you it wouldn\u2019t change our guidance going forward. The assumptions that we have made in areas like atopic dermatitis, we believe we can get to those assumptions without the high dose. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t want the high dose, but at the end of the day I believe we will maintain the guidance that we have based on that.\nJeff Stewart: The other thing that I would point out is that we\u2019ve had additional data on upadacitinib Rinvoq across a number of areas since that guidance, including IBD, so we\u2019ve had the UC data that have come largely since that guidance, and those have exceeded our expectations, and so we remain confident overall in the performance of Rinvoq.\nGeoffrey Porges: Great, thanks Jeff.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Geoffrey. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Baum: Many thanks. A couple of questions, please. There\u2019s not much bipartisan agreement in the U.S. over drug price reform but there seems to be a lot when it come to antitrust in relation to the pharmaceutical industry. Perhaps Rick could comment, following last night\u2019s House Committee on the Judiciary, where there was lots of pointed talk from both sides focusing firstly on patent thickets, second on having a presumption of anticompetitive behavior in terms of assessment of large scale in particular M&A, meaning that it would impact future business development for the industry, so that\u2019s the first question. Then the second question, rather more positive, in terms of the JAK, when I look at consensus, the forecasts for Rinvoq are about $6 billion. When you look at the size of the opportunity in RA alone, let alone psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, UC, and the other indications you have, is it conceivable to you, short of this drug effectively or the class being heavily limited or pulled from the market, that that $6 billion looks like an incredibly conservative estimate for what this drug could do?\nRick Gonzalez: Andrew, this is Rick. I\u2019ll comment maybe on your point of view around the antitrust discussions. Clearly I\u2019ve accepted the invitation to be able to testify to the Committee on May 18. We certainly feel absolutely comfortable and confident in the way we operate in this market. This is a highly competitive market where Humira competes, and certainly as we look at the patents that were issued for Humira, they went through a rigorous process in order to be issued. They represent true innovation to the product. They were challenged by competitors, just like every competitor has a right to challenge a patent if they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s valid or appropriate, and those patents were challenged and the vast majority of those patents survived that challenge. What I\u2019d say is when we look at our behavior in this market, I think our behavior was absolutely pro competitive. We had patents that went all the way out to 2034 in that portfolio and yet we chose to license every single biosimilar player in 2023, literally 11 years before the last patent would have expired. I feel highly confident in the position that we have taken in this marketplace, that we have operated totally appropriately. Your next question on Rinvoq--I\u2019m sorry, I was thinking about the first one. Can you repeat your question?\nAndrew Baum: I will. Just finishing on the first, so you reference your future testimony. I guess it was more general rather than just AbbVie-centric, how it would impact BD and the ability of the industry to operate if pricing can\u2019t get resolved. But moving onto the second question, my question was whether consensus forecasts for Rinvoq look unrealistically conservative given the scale of the opportunity and given in RA alone, looking at the size of that market, it\u2019s a progressive disease, that you don\u2019t actually need atopic dermatitis to get in excess of where consensus currently pegs forecasts, which when look, about $6 billion.\nRob Michael: Andrew, this is Rob. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Jeff. I think we agree with you - we do think consensus is conservative. We\u2019ve given 2025 guidance of $8 billion for Rinvoq, and we would expect it to grow beyond 2025. When I look at the current consensus, obviously as you quoted, it\u2019s a little bit--just a little bit above $6 billion from the numbers that I\u2019m looking at, and I look at the growth beyond \u201925, it\u2019s nowhere near what we\u2019re expecting, so we feel very good about the opportunity there. I think what we covered with you in December still holds as we\u2019ve broken out the contribution by indication. We still feel very good about that, but we would agree that consensus is very conservative right now.\nJeff Stewart: Yes, thanks Rob, this is Jeff. Agree - these are spectacular assets with incredibly dynamic market, so we see across the rheumatology markets, the atopic derm market, we see the IBD market which with both assets we think is underappreciated. I mean, even expansion in second and third lines as new assets come in that are really breakthrough assets with higher levels of efficacy, and so we clearly believe that consensus is conservative here. Just a comment on atopic derm - this is an explosive market. I mean, it is significantly underdeveloped in terms of the penetration, so it\u2019s going to grow substantially, and even if you look at conservative assumptions on where we source business - you know, the growth of the second line, that\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re not going to be very competitive in front line. It\u2019s a very, very attractive space. Again, I think the performance that we\u2019ve seen, the clinical performance that we\u2019ve seen right now, primarily on the induction trials for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s, Rinvoq in UC, is very, very encouraging, so we see that cascading over our long range plans as well. We are very, very bullish and agree that consensus is conservative.\nAndrew Baum: Many thanks.\nLiz Shea: Thank you Andrew. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.\nVamil Divan: Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe a couple, if I could, on the migraine side. First on Ubrelvy, you mentioned it looks like the class is doing very well and gaining share. It also looks like over the last few weeks or so, you\u2019ve been gaining a little share within the class relative to Nurtec, so I\u2019m just wondering if you can share your perspective on what you think is driving that. Some of us thought it might be due to pricing and access, but based on our calculations, it looks like your gross to net is actually lower than what it is from the Biohaven side, so any perspective would be helpful. Then on Atogepant, maybe just a little more, if you could talk to your go-to-market strategy, assuming approval in September, especially given Nurtec will likely have an indication for both treatment and prevention. How do you see coming in with two separate drugs - you know, could be two co-pays, could be just a different message relative to a single drug, so just any perspective on how competing with that would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nJeff Stewart: It\u2019s Jeff. In terms of the acute market, as I mentioned, the penetration of the overall segment is increasing very, very nicely, as I highlighted. If you look at the mix between Ubrelvy and Nurtec, we have gained a little bit over the last few weeks, but it\u2019s very close. We typically run at 51%, 52%, 53% of the new prescription basis. I think you are quite perceptive over the value creation that\u2019s taking place there, and I clearly don\u2019t have full insight into the Biohaven fall through, but we\u2019ve been quite disciplined. We have over 90% commercial access, so we\u2019re quite comfortable where we are from an overall access perspective, and our team remains quite disciplined in terms of making sure that we both drive the right type of volume with our positioning but also the right type of profitability over time. We\u2019re encouraged with our continued momentum with Ubrelvy. In terms of Atogepant, I think what\u2019s quite impressive about our program there is just the sheer level of efficacy that we have, and I think this is very important in terms of sometimes the narrative over simple or easy versus, look, how do you think about the best drug for episodic prevention, particularly when you choose an oral, so we are at the very, very high end of the migraine freedom or the days of migraine control with this new asset, and we think that frankly you need to take care of the migraine and Atogepant will be very well positioned to do that. We also think that we\u2019ll have nice synergies. Obviously we have a fairly significant sales force that is promoting Ubrelvy to both neurologist and high prescribing general practitioners, and it will fit in very well as we put Atogepant into that sales fleet, so we\u2019re set up well, we think, for our go-to-market.\nVamil Divan: Okay, thank you very much.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Vamil. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. A couple of questions please. I haven\u2019t heard really any drug company this reporting season talk about future potential austerity measures in ex-U.S. geographies, meaning broad-based price cuts following the impact of COVID. As a company, as one of the few companies that\u2019s given detailed long term financial guidance, I\u2019m guessing you have been thinking about this, and I\u2019m wondering how you are currently viewing this in terms of its likelihood of occurring, what the magnitude could be and what the timing might be. Then second question just on an early stage pipeline asset, your TNF-steroid antibody drug conjugate, I believe you have in-house probably a fair amount of data that the markets haven\u2019t seen yet. I\u2019m wondering when we might see additional human data and what your current level of enthusiasm is towards that platform.\nRick Gonzalez: Tim, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the OUS austerity measures. Certainly if we go back to 2008, we saw that kind of an impact, so as we were building out our long range plan, we have made some sets of assumptions around that. I would expect that we will see some pressure outside the U.S. going forward over the next couple of years. It\u2019s certainly manageable within the expectations that we have built for the business going forward, certainly based on that level of experience that we\u2019ve seen historically - it\u2019s manageable. It is something that we have contemplated and I would frankly expect to see some level of pressure going forward.\nMike Severino: This is Mike, I\u2019ll take the second question. With respect to the TNF-steroid conjugate program, we\u2019re obviously advancing ABBV-154. We have a large Phase IIb RA study that will start this quarter, and then we\u2019re starting studies in additional immune-mediated conditions as well over the course of the year. With respect to publication of the data from 3373, which is the closely related compound from the same platform that we top line results some time ago, I think you can expect to see more detailed data over the course of the summer.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Tim. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open.\nSteve Scala: Many thanks. First on Rinvoq, I\u2019m curious what additional safety data has FDA been provided that it did not have previously, and has all of it been previously presented and if not, what was the conclusion of what now has been submitted, so that\u2019s the first question. Secondly regarding Imbruvica, to what extent can AbbVie tease out COVID impact on new patient starts versus competition from new frontline agents? Thank you.\nMike Severino: This is Mike, I\u2019ll take the first question, and then Rick will handle the second. With respect to Rinvoq, the additional safety data that were presented to the FDA or provided to the FDA are essentially a roll forward of the analysis that we did at the time of the NDA submission. Obviously our database continues to grow, we accumulate patient years experience, and so there weren\u2019t fundamentally new analyses but we did an updated assessment with the additional data that have accrued in the time between submission and when we submitted those responses. What I would say is the data that we reviewed have not changed our impression of benefit-risk in any way. I think they\u2019re very consistent with all of the data that have been publicly presented. Obviously since they represent data that were current up to the time that we submitted just a few weeks ago, not all of these data have been presented in the public domain, but I would say that our response is very consistent with what we have described publicly in the past.\nRick Gonzalez: On your second question - this is Rick, we get data on new patient starts, so we have relatively, I think, accurate data. It\u2019s offset by a couple of months - I\u2019ll have Jeff maybe talk about it in a little more detail, so we know any CLL patient, when they start, regardless of therapy, we can measure that, and obviously we can measure again what type of therapy they start on, so I think the level of data integrity that we operate with from a market standpoint here is pretty good. It\u2019s offset by a few months, and maybe Jeff can speak to the time offset.\nJeff Stewart: Yes, so Steve, it\u2019s Jeff. We have pretty good visibility to what\u2019s happening from the share perspective versus the market start perspective. I\u2019ll give you some flavor. With regard to Calquence, we can see the impact of the approvals in the front and second line CLL, and it\u2019s largely consistent with what our expectations were, so they\u2019re ramping in a similar fashion to what we saw in the MCL or NHL, so we know that there\u2019s some impact on Imbruvica there. The largest impact has been, unfortunately, into the market, and unfortunately I mean for the patient. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of the numbers. Typically the CLL market, which is the largest driver, it grows sort of at a population level, like 2% every year. If you look at the impact from COVID, we can see almost three different waves - we can see a wave where the new patient starts in the market, we\u2019re down in the high teens in the first part. Then it started to claw back a little bit into the single digits down, and then it got hit again into the teens in the August period and we saw it down again in early January, about 18%. We can see what\u2019s happening, and as I mentioned in my remarks, the biggest impact here has been on continued market suppression due to COVID.\nRob Michael: Steve, this is Rob. I would just remind you also on the first quarter that we had the stocking impact from COVID last year, so if you adjust for that, it\u2019s about a four point impact on Imbruvica\u2019s growth year-over-year due to the prior year comp with the stocking impact.\nSteve Scala: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Steve. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on the results and updates. I have two questions. First, just to follow on, on that comment, could you just help us understand a little bit more about why Imbruvica is such an outlier in the cancer market, why the pandemic is hitting Imbruvica very hard whereas the pandemic is not hitting other cancer agents so hard? Then second, with respect to esthetics, it\u2019s obviously booming, and it is validating your acquisition of Allergan. But I think that you updated guidance for the year for Botox cosmetic to $1.9 billion, and that implies flat sequential sales from the $477 million that you booked in the first quarter, so if you could explain that please. Thank you.\nMike Severino: This is Mike. I\u2019ll take the first question and then others will comment on your second question. With respect to why Imbruvica is being hit harder than other anti-cancer agents in the pandemic, I think it has to do with the underlying rate of progression CLL. CLL, while it is a very significant limiter of long-term function and survival, in the short term there\u2019s a sense that therapy can be delayed if necessary because the rate of progression is relatively slower than other forms of cancer, for example certainly much slower than AML, another indication that we are very active in, in the hema-on space. I think in the setting of the pandemic, that\u2019s why you are seeing more deferrals for start-up therapy and, in some cases, longer time to switch a therapy, which would explain why Imbruvica dynamics are different than other anti-cancer agents that treat other diseases.\nRob Michael: David, this is Rob. On your question regarding Botox cosmetic, we did see in the first quarter, if you just look at toxins market growth, it\u2019s over 30% in the first quarter. There is some impact from pent-up demand as we come out of the pandemic, but we feel very good about the forecast we put forward. We obviously took it up $100 million, so it\u2019s essentially pass through to beat in the quarter. I\u2019d say your math on flat sequentially, I think it\u2019s up a little bit, but really if you consider that we did have some level of pent-up demand come through in the quarter, you\u2019ve got to back that out to truly understand the underlying demand dynamics.\nDavid Risinger: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks David. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nRonny Gal: Hi everybody. Congratulations on a very nice quarter, and thank you for fitting me in. Two questions, if I may. First, there was data presented from Richter about negative symptom improvement using Vraylar. I was wondering what was your take on the data in terms of your ability to use it in the United States, is it something that you\u2019re considering doing with [indiscernible], could this potentially be added to the label, and so forth. Second, the growth in Botox neurology is really impressive. It seems relatively odd that there was such a big jump in the middle of a wave of the epidemic in January-February for a physician-administered product. Can you just give us a flavor of what\u2019s the underlying trends there, is there just a lot more success that you\u2019re having in pushing first patients who failed [indiscernible] into Botox? How should we think about this?\nMike Severino: This is Mike. I\u2019ll take the first question and then others will comment on your second question. With respect to negative symptoms and the treatment of those negative symptoms in schizophrenia, it\u2019s a very challenging area, it\u2019s a very important area because they\u2019re responsible for much of the long term loss of function in patients who suffer from schizophrenia. It has been a very difficult are to approach in general, and we believe Vraylar has a good profile there and has a good overall impact on the disease, a very strong overall impact on the disease, but it\u2019s also one that\u2019s been very challenging from a labeling perspective in the U.S. It\u2019s been a very difficult claim to get in the U.S. It\u2019s not clear that there is a specific path to negative symptoms in the label, but I do think the overall profile of Vraylar in schizophrenia, both with respect to symptom control and benefit risk, are viewed very positively by treating physicians, and I think the overall benefits are well understood by treating physicians and I think that is reflected in Vraylar\u2019s overall strong performance.\nJeff Stewart: It\u2019s Jeff. In regard to Botox, it\u2019s insightful because we are seeing some robust activity, particularly in migraine. I think there\u2019s a couple reasons for that. One, Rick highlighted the sales force dynamics in China. We\u2019ve definitely focused our sales team on the migraine component. The other thing that\u2019s taken place is a little bit, I think, of an investment approach. We\u2019ve had more consistent consumer investment since we had the integration than previously at the legacy Allergan, so I think the combination of the consumer investment, new waves where if patients access an injector at a neurologist, they can get a sample of Botox right at their first appointment rather than wait for many months. There are various commercial reasons, we think, that give us a lot of encouragement on the therapeutic Botox performance, again specifically and particularly in migraine.\nRonny Gal: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Ronny. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for me. I recognize there are still a lot of unknowns here, but how are you thinking about the potential headwind from any changes to corporate tax rates and guilty? Then given the progress you outlined on debt pay down, you\u2019ll be back to about a two times leverage ratio, you mentioned. How are you thinking about capital allocation into the end of this year and into 2022? What types of assets are you focused on for BD and M&A? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: This is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the tax. As you said, it\u2019s certainly early in the process and we obviously know what\u2019s being proposed, but we don\u2019t necessarily know where we will end up. I think one of the important things that we need to continue to think through is if we go back to--you know, one of the reasons why back in 2017 tax reform was passed was to make sure that two things happened: one, that U.S.-based companies were competitive with their foreign competitors, and two, it encouraged companies like ours to invest in the United States. I can certainly talk about the AbbVie example. I think it\u2019s pretty compelling when you sit back and look at--you know, we were able to go out and acquire a Irish company, re-domicile it back to the United States. AbbVie today has 24,000 jobs in the United States. We\u2019ve also increased investment significantly in the U.S. since tax reform. Over the last three years, we\u2019ve invested $1.5 billion, we committed that we\u2019d do $2.5 billion over time. We\u2019re going to exceed that commitment. We\u2019ve added about 1,500 jobs over that period of time. Companies like ours clearly took the benefit of tax reform and that has allowed us to be able to be more competitive and certainly in the acquisition of a company like Allergan, I think that was clearly demonstrated, but we also have invested much more aggressively in the U.S. I think going forward, one of the things that important for policymakers to balance is to make sure that we don\u2019t go back to where we were, and that is where U.S. companies aren\u2019t as competitive against their foreign competitors. The current proposal would make the U.S. have the highest rate of all developed countries - I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the position you\u2019d want to be in, so hopefully as we go forward, there will be a balance that\u2019s looked at in raising taxes but also making companies maintain a competitive position and continue to be incented to invest in the U.S.\nRob Michael: Terence, this is Rob. On your question regarding capital allocation, I\u2019ll start and then Mike will add more color in terms of BD. We\u2019ve said all along that we will continue to de-lever through 2023, so think about that net leverage ratio getting to two times in \u201822, the balance sheet would be in very good shape, but we want to continue to pay down the debt through \u201923. During that period, we\u2019ve allocated $2 billion of capital for business development. You\u2019ve seen us do some very nice deals, whether you look at Genmab, I-Mab, we\u2019ve done a number of nice transactions in this space with that amount of capital. I\u2019ll let Mike speak to future opportunities as well.\nMike Severino: In terms of the areas in which we would expect to be active between now and the end of 2022, we\u2019ll continue to be active in oncology, both in hematological oncology and in solid tumors. That has been an area of focus for us, and I see that continuing as an area of focus. We would certainly like to add to the esthetics franchise - we\u2019ve talked about how we will invest and continue to drive that franchise, and from a business development perspective, I think there are a number of opportunities there that could present themselves in that time frame. There are other areas that opportunistically we would certainly like to add to - I would point to neuroscience, if we could find the right opportunities, and eye care as additional areas where we could be investing.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Terence. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Busby with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDaniel Busby: Hi, good morning. I\u2019d like to ask a follow-up on esthetics and your high single digit annual growth target for that business over the next decade. Broadly speaking, how much of that growth is dependent on bringing new products to market, such as long and short acting toxins, versus driving continued growth from the esthetics portfolio that you have today? Second, as we near the one-year anniversary of your acquisition of Allergan, can you provide updated thoughts on your appetite for potential divestitures of non-core products or therapeutic areas now that you\u2019ve had about a year to digest that transaction? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: This is Rick. I\u2019ll cover that, and maybe Rob can tag team along here. I think if you look at our overall estimate of high single digit growth on esthetics, it\u2019s not heavily reliant on a large number of new products. There will be new products that come in - they\u2019re probably closer towards the back end of the long range plan so they don\u2019t have a significant impact on that overall growth rate, so I think we fundamentally believe that the market dynamics are such and the brands are competitive, highly competitive in this market, that we have the ability to grow the market and continue to maintain our share position in that market, and that will allow us to be able to drive that level of growth or higher.\nRob Michael: This is Rob. I would just add that if you look at the esthetics business, we\u2019ll see significant growth not just from toxins and fillers, but also in body contouring, so as we think about the potential for that leg of the stool, we think we\u2019ve got really three key drivers of growth within esthetics that will help us get to that high single digit long term expectation. Again, as Rick mentioned, we\u2019re not counting on a significant contribution to the pipeline, although we will continue to drive innovation particularly with toxins and fillers, and of course as you\u2019ve heard before, it\u2019s important within body contouring to continue to drive innovation there as well, so we feel very good about that outlook and we\u2019re not counting on a ton from the pipeline there.\nRick Gonzalez: And your second question, I would say even before the Allergan acquisition, we constantly looked at our portfolio and determined whether or not there were areas of our business that we ultimately though we were interested in divesting. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a process that we go through on a fairly consistent basis to ensure that we\u2019re maximizing the value of the assets that we have within our portfolio, and so we will continue to do that. When we find opportunities where we think that\u2019s the right strategy, then we\u2019ll execute against that strategy.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Daniel. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGary Nachman: Thanks. A couple more from me in Rinvoq. Are you hearing anecdotally any physicians that may be switching patients from Xeljanz to Rinvoq in RA, if there is a perceived safety benefit with Rinvoq as a more selective JAK, are you able to take advantage of that at all? Then secondly, if Rinvoq gets approved for atopic derm, how will you look to build out your presence with dermatologists? Will you leverage your current footprint on the esthetics side, or will you have a completely different medical derm team? Just talk about how you go after that opportunity and how you\u2019re preparing for it, given your clear level of excitement there. Thank you.\nJeff Stewart: Hi, it\u2019s Jeff, and I\u2019ll take both of those. We\u2019re actually not hearing physicians, from our intelligence, from our field teams, actively thinking to switch patients from Xeljanz to Rinvoq. I mean, that\u2019s a big decision for a physician. What we have heard is when we do some of our research and our ear to the ground, we clearly see that oral surveillance is perceived as a Xeljanz issue, so typically what will happen is you may see people take their foot off the gas on some new starts, but we don\u2019t see or hear certainly any widespread news of active switching, so that\u2019s basically our intelligence on your first question. In terms of your second question, we will not be using the esthetics sales force. We will basically leverage our existing infrastructure that we have with some expansion we\u2019ve taken place for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. I think as you know, in terms of our reputation amongst the medical derms is extremely strong. We have the number one reputation because of the years of Humira in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and HS, and obviously we have a very, very strong impression and launch from Skyrizi, so we\u2019ve basically designed a sales force that through our management, which has been connected to these derms for more than a decade, and existing reps with some new reps in there, we are building--we have built a sales force that will work seamlessly with our Skyrizi teams to give a very nice offering to those dermatologists. An important fact is that basically the overlap of those dermatologists that drive basically the atopic derm market is about 90% between the atopic derm market and the psoriasis market, so we feel we\u2019re well positioned in terms of how we\u2019ve set up our go-to-market approach with the segment.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Gary. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nGregg Gilbert: Thank you. Mike, I was interested in your oral psoriasis commentary. Are you assuming that a new bar has been set by deucravacitinib in terms of efficacy versus Otezla, and is that something you\u2019re very mindful of as you consider your own programs? Secondly for Rick, I realize AbbVie was born out of a company that had devices and pharma under one roof, but clearly you\u2019ve embraced esthetics, for example, that good franchise building could involve drugs and devices or drugs that need to be delivered by device. Does that apply as you think ahead about ophthalmology or other areas when you consider long term BD? Thank you.\nMike Severino: This is Mike. I\u2019ll take the first question. With respect to oral psoriasis agents, we would want to come in from an efficacy perspective with something that clearly exceeded the threshold that existed in the past with Otezla, and I think coming in a range that is Humira-like or better would be our goal. I think if you look at BMS\u2019 Tyk2, they sort of come in at that Humira-like efficacy, and so I think that is generally the range that we\u2019re talking about. I think when one talks about a direct comparison in terms of where a bar is set, we have to look not only at efficacy but at safety and at the totality of the data. Obviously it\u2019s extremely early for our ROR\u03b3T agent, but we think it is a molecule, because it impacts very well understood biology with a good understanding of where to go from an efficacy perspective and a good understanding of safety, that we can get in a range that\u2019s very competitive there, so I think we\u2019d be looking for that Humira-like efficacy or greater as something that we would like to use to enter the space with in oral, obviously coupled with a strong safety profile.\nRick Gonzalez: On your second question, this is Rick. I think the way we approach the markets that we operate in is we look for areas where there is significant unmet need and then we ultimately try to come up with solutions for those needs. Sometimes it\u2019s drug only - in fact, I\u2019d say the majority of our historical experience as AbbVie has been drug-only, but as an example, 951 is a good example of where it\u2019s a combination product, right - a device and a drug. Certainly as we look at ophthalmology, we have implantable devices that were part of the Allergan acquisition that are important therapeutic options, that are available for physicians and patients. I\u2019d say we tend to go at it and we\u2019re certainly not opposed to devices being part of it if they can add to the ability to be able to provide for an advancement in the standard of care. In esthetics, as Rob indicated a moment ago, we\u2019re looking at what is that big third leg on the stool, and we believe that is body. I would say in the area of body, devices are going to play a much more critical role, and so that\u2019s an area where I think you\u2019ll see us embrace even device-only kinds of strategies because they provide the right solution for that particular improvement. It\u2019s an area that historically many of us know well because of our experience, as you pointed out, in our previous life, but I\u2019d say also the teams in the organization itself tend to look for broad-based solutions that can meet the unmet need.\nGregg Gilbert: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Gregg. Operator, we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Navin Jacob with UBS. Your line is open.\nNavin Jacob: Hi, thanks so much for squeezing me in here. A couple if I may, if we have time. Just on Vraylar, you have strong long term guidance of $4 billion with just the existing indications, but the script trends at least seem to have slowed down, obviously in part because neuro has been weak as an overall therapeutic area during the pandemic. But just wondering--and just given that the quarter itself was a little bit weaker, I think, versus expectations, can you talk about the broader neuro market? Is that weakness there, because we do see strength with Ubrelvy and with Botox therapeutics, so just wondering if there\u2019s something going on specifically with Vraylar? Has the bipolar depression opportunity been tapped out for some reason, and what can you and need to do to accelerate growth for Vraylar with the existing indication? That\u2019s number one. Number two on Rinvoq, I think understands the rates around DVTP and MACE, but if you could give a little bit more clarity, based on the updated data that you\u2019ve filed with the agency, what the rate of malignancy is across the indications, and whether that\u2019s any different between the strengths and how that compares to the background rate. Thank you so much.\nJeff Stewart: Hi, it\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll take the Vraylar comment. The macro prescription market has been down a little bit versus historical trends, but we really think it\u2019s simply a timing issue, and I\u2019ll give you some numbers that support that. Before COVID hit, right in the first quarter of last year, the new to brand, or NBRx for Vraylar was about 3,500 new to brand prescriptions a week, and what we saw is during COVID, that dropped down all the way to about 2,700 - that was the nadir, and then it\u2019s consistently come back up. Towards the end of March, we started to hit or recover that pre-COVID historical rate, so progress is there, and ultimately the way we see these markets function, as you recover your NBRx momentum, the TRx\u2019s will start to come, so we\u2019re encouraged on the latest trends. But your point is right - it has been a little bit soft on the market, and certainly as a brand Vraylar dropped because of COVID, but is now really fully recovered and so we should see continued recovery of the momentum there. Hopefully that helps.\nMike Severino: This is Mike. I\u2019ll take your second question. With respect to the rates of malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer because that\u2019s the way these rates are typically reviewed, I recently described a rate across Rinvoq studies with roughly 10,000 patient years experience of 0.8 events per 100 patient years experience, and that compared to an expected rate that was 0.9 or higher, depending on the estimate, so we\u2019ll call it in the range of about 0.9 events, so not different from that expected rate and without any difference between doses, so no evidence of a dose response, and nothing that we\u2019ve seen in the recent work that we\u2019ve done changes that view in any way.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Navin. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. If you\u2019d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com.

            "name": "Mike Severino",
            "content": "Thank you Jeff. I\u2019ll start with immunology, where we continue to make good progress with Rinvoq and Skyrizi in new disease areas, as well as in our early and mid-stage immunology programs. We recently reported positive top line results from the second induction study for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. Similar to results from the first induction study, in this Phase III trial Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on disease activity as measured by clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The 45 milligram induction dose was well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previous Rinvoq studies. In these induction trials, we saw no DVT, PE, MACE events, or malignancies in the Rinvoq groups, and the rates of serious adverse events were numerically lower than placebo. We believe these induction data compare very favorably to other UC treatments on the market or in development and based on the data generated to date, Rinvoq has the potential to become one of the most highly effective therapies for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We expect to see results from the UC maintenance study this summer with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of the year. The Rinvoq program in Crohn\u2019s disease is also progressing very well, and we expect to see induction data from the first of two Phase III trials in the fourth quarter, followed by induction data from a second Phase III trial and maintenance data in the first half of 2022. We\u2019re also nearing completion of our pivotal program for Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s disease. Earlier this year, we reported positive results from the two Crohn\u2019s induction studies and we expect to see maintenance data this summer. Our regulatory submissions for Skyrizi and Crohn\u2019s disease remain on track for the second half of 2021. Following completion of our registrational program for Skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, we recently submitted our regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2022. We\u2019re very pleased with the level of activity we saw with Skyrizi on both joint disease and skin clearance in our Phase III program and look forward to providing this new treatment to patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis. Our regulatory submissions are currently under review for Rinvoq in three new indications in the U.S.: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. As we\u2019ve previously announced, the FDA recently extended the review periods for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis following a request for an updated assessment of the benefit-risk profile for Rinvoq in these indications. In response to the FDA request, we provided updated data from across Rinvoq programs in RA, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. Based on the review extensions, we now expect approval decisions for psoriatic arthritis in June and for atopic dermatitis in July. The regulatory action date for Rinvoq in ankylosing spondylitis is unchanged and remains on track for June. We remain confident in the benefit-risk profile of Rinvoq across all indications and will work with the FDA to bring Rinvoq to market in these new disease areas. Earlier this year, we received European approval for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and AS. Our European regulatory application for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis is under review and we remain on track for a CHMP opinion this summer with an approval decision anticipated in the third quarter. We also recently saw results from a four-week Phase Ib study evaluating our novel small molecule ROR\u03b3T inverse agonist, ABBV-157, in patients with psoriasis. By targeting ROR\u03b3T with an inverse agonist rather than an antagonist, we believe we can more effectively inhibit IL-17 production, thus resulting in a greater impact on skin inflammation. In our Phase 1b study, 157 showed promising activity as an oral psoriasis agent and we plan to move the asset forward to a larger Phase IIb dose ranging study in the second half of this year. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, we continue to make very good progress with our late stage programs for Imbruvica, Venclexta and Navitoclax, as well as with our early stage oncology assets. We remain on track for several key regulatory submissions, data presentations, and phase transitions this year. At the upcoming ASCO and EHA meetings, we will be presenting more than 40 abstracts, including results from the Imbruvica plus Venclexta CAPTIVATE trial fixed duration cohort in treatment-na\u00efve CLL patients. The Imbruvica-Venclexta combination is an important element of our hema-on strategy to provide a differentiated fixed duration treatment that offers deeper levels of response. Data from our Imbruvica-Venclexta combination studies will support regulatory submissions in frontline CLL later this year. We will also be presenting four-year follow-up data from Venclexta\u2019s CLL14 trial in frontline CLL as well as updated efficacy and safety data from a Phase Ib study evaluating Venclexta plus azacitidine in treatment-na\u00efve, high risk MDS patients. We expect this MDS study to complete in the second half of this year and, if positive, it could support a submission in the first half of 2022 to seek an accelerated approval. In the area of solid tumors, at the recent AACR meeting we presented Phase II results for Teliso-V in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, Teliso-V demonstrated promising response rates in heavily pretreated patients, particularly in patients with highly expressed c-Met where we saw a 54% objective response rate. c-Met is an attractive target across multiple tumor types, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer where approximately 30% of patients have over-expressed c-Met. Approaches in this area have historically focused on small molecule kinase inhibitors and anti c-Met antibodies, both of which have shown only limited efficacy in this patient population that has not been sufficient for approval. In contrast our c-Met antibody drug conjugate is a novel approach that we believe will have broader applicability and will provide enhanced efficacy compared to previous approaches. We recently began the second stage of our Phase II study which has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second line plus metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. We also plan to evaluate Teliso-V in the frontline setting, including in combination with other agents, as well as in other c-Met positive tumor types. We also have a next-generation c-Met ADC program that will be entering the clinic later this year. Our new c-Met ADC, ABBV-400, utilizes a topoisomerase inhibitor payload which we believe will provide greater anti-tumor efficacy against both amplified Met and over-expressed c-Met subtypes, thus providing deeper responses with broader applicability than other anti c-Met targeting agents. In neuroscience, we recently presented data from several key programs at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting. A total of 33 abstracts were presented, including data from the Phase III ADVANCE study in episodic migraine prevention, showing that Atogepant has the potential to be a highly effective, safe and well tolerated oral treatment option with a rapid onset of action. The FDA recently accepted our NDA for Atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine and an approval decision is expected in September of this year. We also presented results from an open label Phase III study evaluating Ubrelvy in perimenstrual migraine which showed that Ubrelvy has potential as a safe and efficacious treatment of migraine attacks that occur during or near menstruation. Menstrual-related migraine attacks can be more difficult to treat because they are often longer in duration, more severe, and often resistant to treatment. We presented data from a Phase I study demonstrating that ABBV-951 subcutaneous infusions maintain an equivalent Levodopa exposure to Duopa in advanced Parkinson\u2019s patients. Results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 are expected this summer with the regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of this year. We also remain on track for readouts in the fourth quarter from two Phase III studies for Vraylar in adjunctive major depressive disorder and, if successful, we would anticipate regulatory submissions in the first half of 2022. In eye care, we submitted our regulatory application in the U.S. for AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. 584 is a once-daily eye drop being developed to help address symptoms that are often corrected through reading glasses. This new technology represents a complementary product to reading glasses and would be a convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia. An approval decision is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. In esthetics, we are investing to accelerate key next generation toxins and filler programs. By combining the esthetic team\u2019s deep expertise with AbbVie\u2019s breadth and scale of resources, we\u2019ll be able to bring novel products to market significantly faster. Looking across our portfolio, we\u2019ve identified a number of programs to accelerate, including our short acting and long acting toxins, as well as our next generation bio-stimulatory tropoelastin and collagen fillers. Acceleration of these programs is expected to drive significant long term growth for the esthetics franchise. In summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? Thanks Chris, this is Mike. I\u2019ll take the first question and then Rick will take the second question that you asked. With respect to Rinvoq, we feel very confident in the benefit-risk profile across indications and across the doses that we study. Having said that, both the 15 and 30 milligram doses have performed very well, both from an efficacy and a safety perspective, and so if you look at the efficacy results that we drove with 15 in atopic dermatitis, we drove high levels of response, very rapid response, and had a very prominent impact on itch, which is one of the most bothersome symptoms, with 15 as well as with 30. With the 15 milligram dose, for example, we saw statistically significant and clinically significant reduction in itch after only two days, which is really quite remarkable in this disease. Again, that\u2019s really one of the most bothersome symptoms to patients. We think we could be successful with either dose, to answer your question specifically, but we also remain confident in the benefit-risk of both doses. This is Mike, I\u2019ll take the second question. With respect to the TNF-steroid conjugate program, we\u2019re obviously advancing ABBV-154. We have a large Phase IIb RA study that will start this quarter, and then we\u2019re starting studies in additional immune-mediated conditions as well over the course of the year. With respect to publication of the data from 3373, which is the closely related compound from the same platform that we top line results some time ago, I think you can expect to see more detailed data over the course of the summer. This is Mike, I\u2019ll take the first question, and then Rick will handle the second. With respect to Rinvoq, the additional safety data that were presented to the FDA or provided to the FDA are essentially a roll forward of the analysis that we did at the time of the NDA submission. Obviously our database continues to grow, we accumulate patient years experience, and so there weren\u2019t fundamentally new analyses but we did an updated assessment with the additional data that have accrued in the time between submission and when we submitted those responses. What I would say is the data that we reviewed have not changed our impression of benefit-risk in any way. I think they\u2019re very consistent with all of the data that have been publicly presented. Obviously since they represent data that were current up to the time that we submitted just a few weeks ago, not all of these data have been presented in the public domain, but I would say that our response is very consistent with what we have described publicly in the past. This is Mike. I\u2019ll take the first question and then others will comment on your second question. With respect to why Imbruvica is being hit harder than other anti-cancer agents in the pandemic, I think it has to do with the underlying rate of progression CLL. CLL, while it is a very significant limiter of long-term function and survival, in the short term there\u2019s a sense that therapy can be delayed if necessary because the rate of progression is relatively slower than other forms of cancer, for example certainly much slower than AML, another indication that we are very active in, in the hema-on space. I think in the setting of the pandemic, that\u2019s why you are seeing more deferrals for start-up therapy and, in some cases, longer time to switch a therapy, which would explain why Imbruvica dynamics are different than other anti-cancer agents that treat other diseases. This is Mike. I\u2019ll take the first question and then others will comment on your second question. With respect to negative symptoms and the treatment of those negative symptoms in schizophrenia, it\u2019s a very challenging area, it\u2019s a very important area because they\u2019re responsible for much of the long term loss of function in patients who suffer from schizophrenia. It has been a very difficult are to approach in general, and we believe Vraylar has a good profile there and has a good overall impact on the disease, a very strong overall impact on the disease, but it\u2019s also one that\u2019s been very challenging from a labeling perspective in the U.S. It\u2019s been a very difficult claim to get in the U.S. It\u2019s not clear that there is a specific path to negative symptoms in the label, but I do think the overall profile of Vraylar in schizophrenia, both with respect to symptom control and benefit risk, are viewed very positively by treating physicians, and I think the overall benefits are well understood by treating physicians and I think that is reflected in Vraylar\u2019s overall strong performance. In terms of the areas in which we would expect to be active between now and the end of 2022, we\u2019ll continue to be active in oncology, both in hematological oncology and in solid tumors. That has been an area of focus for us, and I see that continuing as an area of focus. We would certainly like to add to the esthetics franchise - we\u2019ve talked about how we will invest and continue to drive that franchise, and from a business development perspective, I think there are a number of opportunities there that could present themselves in that time frame. There are other areas that opportunistically we would certainly like to add to - I would point to neuroscience, if we could find the right opportunities, and eye care as additional areas where we could be investing. This is Mike. I\u2019ll take the first question. With respect to oral psoriasis agents, we would want to come in from an efficacy perspective with something that clearly exceeded the threshold that existed in the past with Otezla, and I think coming in a range that is Humira-like or better would be our goal. I think if you look at BMS\u2019 Tyk2, they sort of come in at that Humira-like efficacy, and so I think that is generally the range that we\u2019re talking about. I think when one talks about a direct comparison in terms of where a bar is set, we have to look not only at efficacy but at safety and at the totality of the data. Obviously it\u2019s extremely early for our ROR\u03b3T agent, but we think it is a molecule, because it impacts very well understood biology with a good understanding of where to go from an efficacy perspective and a good understanding of safety, that we can get in a range that\u2019s very competitive there, so I think we\u2019d be looking for that Humira-like efficacy or greater as something that we would like to use to enter the space with in oral, obviously coupled with a strong safety profile. This is Mike. I\u2019ll take your second question. With respect to the rates of malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer because that\u2019s the way these rates are typically reviewed, I recently described a rate across Rinvoq studies with roughly 10,000 patient years experience of 0.8 events per 100 patient years experience, and that compared to an expected rate that was 0.9 or higher, depending on the estimate, so we\u2019ll call it in the range of about 0.9 events, so not different from that expected rate and without any difference between doses, so no evidence of a dose response, and nothing that we\u2019ve seen in the recent work that we\u2019ve done changes that view in any way."

            "content": "Thank you Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll discuss our first quarter performance and outlook, and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. We\u2019re off to an excellent start this year, delivering strong top and bottom line first quarter performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.14. Total adjusted net revenue of $12.9 billion was up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, nearly $250 million ahead of our expectations. These results include strong performance across each of our core therapeutic areas, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, neuroscience, and esthetics, as well as high single digit operational growth from hematological oncology. Additionally, we continue to see robust sales from our key and newly launched products. Skyrizi and Rinvoq contributed nearly $900 million in combined revenues this quarter, more than double the sales versus the prior year as both products continue to ramp in their initial indications. Imbruvica and Venclexta delivered combined sales of approximately $1.7 billion, reflecting continued leadership in CLL and other hematological malignancies. Vraylar, which remains one of the fastest growing medicines in psychiatry, delivered more than 20% comparable operational growth. Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, generated revenue growth of approximately 25% on a sequential basis, and within our leading esthetics portfolio, which is performing well above pre-COVID levels, Botox cosmetics and Juvederm are demonstrating robust performance. Both of these brands grew more than 40% on a comparable operational basis. The integration of Allergan also continues to go very well. As illustrated by our balanced results this quarter, we are clearly demonstrating that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with the scale and flexibility to fully invest in the business for long term growth. While the pandemic has categorically impacted our day-to-day lives, we are encouraged by the latest recovery trends. We see market growth and new patient activity increasing overall, especially in March, although certain markets continue to remain below pre-COVID levels, including CLL and HCV in particular. We expect that increasing vaccinations globally will continue to support a fully recovery across our therapeutic areas as we progress through the remainder of this year. Based on our robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance and we now expect adjusted earnings per share between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of more than 18% at the midpoint. I\u2019m also extremely pleased with our R&D prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities especially within our late stage pipeline. We\u2019re on the cusp of the potential commercial approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including five total expected approvals in 2021. This includes Atogepant, a novel oral CGRP for episodic migraine, adding to our already attractive migraine portfolio; a new eye drop for the treatment of presbyopia, as well as expanded indications for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis, and we expect more than half a dozen new product or indication launches in 2022, including Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, ABBV-951 for advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, Skyrizi for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, Vraylar for major depressive disorder, and initial indications for Imbruvica and Venclexta. With these collective new growth opportunities and the continued momentum of our underlying portfolio, our long term outlook remains very strong. In closing, our focus remains on strong commercial and operational execution as well as pipeline advancement. I\u2019m pleased with the financial results for the quarter and the overall pace of the recovery across our portfolio. We\u2019re off to another excellent start in 2021. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Chris, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the esthetics one for you, as Mike said. I think if you look at the underlying performance of the esthetics business, in particular the market growth in the U.S. and in China, it\u2019s driving the fundamental growth that we see through the business. Certainly there is some impacts still from COVID, so we\u2019re seeing some impact there, but I think the majority of it is when we took over Allergan, we made a decision to really invest in promotion at a much higher level than they were investing in it prior, and they had an approach that was more of an episodic investment approach where we have basically made a decision that we\u2019ll fund across the entire year at a relatively significant level to drive demand, because the data clearly supports that you can grow this market. I think the best comparison is to start to look at what it looked like versus 2019, because you obviously had the COVID impact in 2020, but you take for example Botox - Botox versus 2019, cosmetic Botox versus 2019, it\u2019s up about 27%. The market\u2019s growing very robustly. Some of that is probably COVID-driven - these are U.S. numbers I\u2019m describing right now. Some of that is probably COVID-driven, but I wouldn\u2019t say a lot of it at this point is COVID-driven in the U.S. China continues to grow very well - in fact, I\u2019d say China is back to the level of growth, and we have expanded the sales force in China once, about four or five months ago. We\u2019re in the process now of going through a second expansion in China and we expect that China will continue to drive significant growth going forward. The one area that still is being impacted in a fairly significant way from COVID is the European market. We still see it--we see it starting to emerge in areas like the U.K., but there are other areas in Europe that are still in lockdown. I would expect that Europe and Brazil as well will hopefully start to see some recovery as we get into the second half of this year and they can start to contribute, which would add additional growth to the overall business. But I would tell you I\u2019m very pleased with the decisions we\u2019ve made around driving more promotion, and I\u2019m pleased with the execution of this team. This team has done extremely well in executing and driving the kind of share position that we want and the growth that we want, so I think it is sustainable going forward. On the neuroscience portfolio, it is an area that we\u2019re very excited about, so maybe Jeff and I will tag team here. But I think when you look at the two major growth franchises there, being the migraine franchise and the anti-psychotic franchise with Vraylar, both of those, we think, have significant opportunity to continue to grow. You\u2019re obviously seeing Ubrelvy now perform extremely well in the marketplace - I think Jeff can probably give you a little more color on that, and Vraylar is continuing to perform very well as well. I think if we are able to achieve one positive study on MDD, I think that will give us significant growth going forward. This is a franchise that we\u2019re excited about. I think it will be a meaningful franchise for us over the long term scenario where we continue to look at assets that we could potentially add to it, and I think it will be a nice growth driver for us. Jeff? On the JAKs, we\u2019ve obviously evaluated carefully the positioning of the product. I think if we look at where we are today, one, we\u2019re confident in the high dose that has a good risk-benefit profile, but I would tell you it wouldn\u2019t change our guidance going forward. The assumptions that we have made in areas like atopic dermatitis, we believe we can get to those assumptions without the high dose. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t want the high dose, but at the end of the day I believe we will maintain the guidance that we have based on that. Andrew, this is Rick. I\u2019ll comment maybe on your point of view around the antitrust discussions. Clearly I\u2019ve accepted the invitation to be able to testify to the Committee on May 18. We certainly feel absolutely comfortable and confident in the way we operate in this market. This is a highly competitive market where Humira competes, and certainly as we look at the patents that were issued for Humira, they went through a rigorous process in order to be issued. They represent true innovation to the product. They were challenged by competitors, just like every competitor has a right to challenge a patent if they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s valid or appropriate, and those patents were challenged and the vast majority of those patents survived that challenge. What I\u2019d say is when we look at our behavior in this market, I think our behavior was absolutely pro competitive. We had patents that went all the way out to 2034 in that portfolio and yet we chose to license every single biosimilar player in 2023, literally 11 years before the last patent would have expired. I feel highly confident in the position that we have taken in this marketplace, that we have operated totally appropriately. Your next question on Rinvoq--I\u2019m sorry, I was thinking about the first one. Can you repeat your question? Tim, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the OUS austerity measures. Certainly if we go back to 2008, we saw that kind of an impact, so as we were building out our long range plan, we have made some sets of assumptions around that. I would expect that we will see some pressure outside the U.S. going forward over the next couple of years. It\u2019s certainly manageable within the expectations that we have built for the business going forward, certainly based on that level of experience that we\u2019ve seen historically - it\u2019s manageable. It is something that we have contemplated and I would frankly expect to see some level of pressure going forward. On your second question - this is Rick, we get data on new patient starts, so we have relatively, I think, accurate data. It\u2019s offset by a couple of months - I\u2019ll have Jeff maybe talk about it in a little more detail, so we know any CLL patient, when they start, regardless of therapy, we can measure that, and obviously we can measure again what type of therapy they start on, so I think the level of data integrity that we operate with from a market standpoint here is pretty good. It\u2019s offset by a few months, and maybe Jeff can speak to the time offset. This is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the tax. As you said, it\u2019s certainly early in the process and we obviously know what\u2019s being proposed, but we don\u2019t necessarily know where we will end up. I think one of the important things that we need to continue to think through is if we go back to--you know, one of the reasons why back in 2017 tax reform was passed was to make sure that two things happened: one, that U.S.-based companies were competitive with their foreign competitors, and two, it encouraged companies like ours to invest in the United States. I can certainly talk about the AbbVie example. I think it\u2019s pretty compelling when you sit back and look at--you know, we were able to go out and acquire a Irish company, re-domicile it back to the United States. AbbVie today has 24,000 jobs in the United States. We\u2019ve also increased investment significantly in the U.S. since tax reform. Over the last three years, we\u2019ve invested $1.5 billion, we committed that we\u2019d do $2.5 billion over time. We\u2019re going to exceed that commitment. We\u2019ve added about 1,500 jobs over that period of time. Companies like ours clearly took the benefit of tax reform and that has allowed us to be able to be more competitive and certainly in the acquisition of a company like Allergan, I think that was clearly demonstrated, but we also have invested much more aggressively in the U.S. I think going forward, one of the things that important for policymakers to balance is to make sure that we don\u2019t go back to where we were, and that is where U.S. companies aren\u2019t as competitive against their foreign competitors. The current proposal would make the U.S. have the highest rate of all developed countries - I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the position you\u2019d want to be in, so hopefully as we go forward, there will be a balance that\u2019s looked at in raising taxes but also making companies maintain a competitive position and continue to be incented to invest in the U.S. This is Rick. I\u2019ll cover that, and maybe Rob can tag team along here. I think if you look at our overall estimate of high single digit growth on esthetics, it\u2019s not heavily reliant on a large number of new products. There will be new products that come in - they\u2019re probably closer towards the back end of the long range plan so they don\u2019t have a significant impact on that overall growth rate, so I think we fundamentally believe that the market dynamics are such and the brands are competitive, highly competitive in this market, that we have the ability to grow the market and continue to maintain our share position in that market, and that will allow us to be able to drive that level of growth or higher. And your second question, I would say even before the Allergan acquisition, we constantly looked at our portfolio and determined whether or not there were areas of our business that we ultimately though we were interested in divesting. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a process that we go through on a fairly consistent basis to ensure that we\u2019re maximizing the value of the assets that we have within our portfolio, and so we will continue to do that. When we find opportunities where we think that\u2019s the right strategy, then we\u2019ll execute against that strategy. On your second question, this is Rick. I think the way we approach the markets that we operate in is we look for areas where there is significant unmet need and then we ultimately try to come up with solutions for those needs. Sometimes it\u2019s drug only - in fact, I\u2019d say the majority of our historical experience as AbbVie has been drug-only, but as an example, 951 is a good example of where it\u2019s a combination product, right - a device and a drug. Certainly as we look at ophthalmology, we have implantable devices that were part of the Allergan acquisition that are important therapeutic options, that are available for physicians and patients. I\u2019d say we tend to go at it and we\u2019re certainly not opposed to devices being part of it if they can add to the ability to be able to provide for an advancement in the standard of care. In esthetics, as Rob indicated a moment ago, we\u2019re looking at what is that big third leg on the stool, and we believe that is body. I would say in the area of body, devices are going to play a much more critical role, and so that\u2019s an area where I think you\u2019ll see us embrace even device-only kinds of strategies because they provide the right solution for that particular improvement. It\u2019s an area that historically many of us know well because of our experience, as you pointed out, in our previous life, but I\u2019d say also the teams in the organization itself tend to look for broad-based solutions that can meet the unmet need."

            "content": "Thank you Rick. We demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. Our immunology portfolio delivered global revenues of more than $5.7 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 12% on an operational basis. Humira sales were approximately $4.9 billion, up 2.6% on an operational basis with continued high single digit growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across our international markets, where the unfavorable impact was more moderate than expected in the quarter. Our new immunology agents, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are both demonstrating robust prescription growth well above all comparable launches. Skyrizi sales were $574 million, reflecting 34% in-play patient share, which includes new and switching patients. This is more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. Skyrizi total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now approximately 15%, second only to Humira. Additionally, we recently received approval for a single dose prefilled pen for Skyrizi which will reduce the number of injections per treatment. Skyrizi is now the only quarterly dose psoriasis treatment available in an auto injector, further improving the patient experience. Rinvoq sales were $303 million with strong in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market. Physician and patient feedback remains very positive on Rinvoq\u2019s level of efficacy, speed of response, and strong benefit-risk profile. Internationally, both of these new assets delivered strong double-digit sequential growth with ramping access in share. Skyrizi has now also achieved in-play patient share leadership in the EU 5 psoriasis market, exceeding Tremfya and Cosentyx and at parity with Taltz. As Mike will discuss momentarily, we are also making considerable progress to expand the uses of Skyrizi and Rinvoq in several immune-mediated diseases with half a dozen additional indication approvals expected later this year and in 2022. In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.7 billion, up 7.3% on an operational basis. Imbruvica continues to perform well across multiple indications, including CLL, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Imbruvica sales increased 2.9% on an operational basis this quarter with performance impacted by lower new patient starts within CLL, where the market remains below pre-COVID levels. Imbruvica growth was also unfavorably impacted by the COVID-relating stocking benefit that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. Venclexta sales were $405 million, up 24.5% on an operational basis with increasing share in frontline CLL and continued strong performance in AML. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 10.9% on a comparable operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of $346 million were up 21.2% on a comparable operational basis, reflecting a nearly 2.5% total prescription share of the U.S. atypical antipsychotic market. Within migraine, the launch of Ubrelvy is exceeding our expectations with $81 million of revenue in the quarter. Feedback from physicians has been very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy\u2019s efficacy, safety, convenient dosing profile, and overall commercial access. Ubrelvy is the number one branded acute treatment for migraine based on both new patient share and prescription growth. The oral CGRP therapies, including our leading Ubrelvy, now represent roughly 16% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market. We believe there is substantial room for long term growth in this rapidly expanding segment based on unmet need and strong patient demand. We also look forward to the expected commercial approval of Atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine later this year. Botox therapeutic is seeing a very nice recovery in chronic migraine as well as its other indications, with total sales of $532 million, up 7% on a comparable operational basis. Lastly in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $817 million. Mavyret sales were $450 million, down 28.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID levels, and we also saw double-digit comparable growth from Linzess, the leading branded prescription medicine in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with IBSC, or chronic idiopathic constipation. Overall, I\u2019m extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on track to deliver very strong revenue growth in 2021. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike? Yes, I think just to reiterate, as I mentioned in my comments, the oral CGRP market is moving very nicely. It\u2019s hit, I mentioned 16% for the quarter, but now on the weeklies it\u2019s 17% or above on just the penetration of that segment, so we see a lot of runway in that segment over our long range planning. Certainly the availability of another oral CGRP, in this case for episodic migraine, allows us to compete in a much larger segment beyond the acute, and to Rick\u2019s point, remember we have the big anchor asset with Botox therapeutic in migraine on the back end for chronic migraine and we have plans in place to expand that upstream also into episodic migraine. This is actually in some ways non-overlapping because we have a big injector base for Botox and then we can have the neurologist and primary care base for Atogepant, and so when you look basically really across the waterfront - you know, leading acute agent, oral, very, very potent and active oral agent in the middle with episodic, and then on the back end with Botox, it\u2019s a very nice portfolio for us that will drive growth. As Rick mentioned, we are encouraged on the potential for adjunctive MDD, and that segment itself when we do the market analysis is about as large, the adjunctive MDD segment, as bipolar depression, and so this basically has the opportunity for us to really double the potential penetration over our long range plans, so we\u2019re very encouraged over this set of assets. The other thing that I would point out is that we\u2019ve had additional data on upadacitinib Rinvoq across a number of areas since that guidance, including IBD, so we\u2019ve had the UC data that have come largely since that guidance, and those have exceeded our expectations, and so we remain confident overall in the performance of Rinvoq. Yes, thanks Rob, this is Jeff. Agree - these are spectacular assets with incredibly dynamic market, so we see across the rheumatology markets, the atopic derm market, we see the IBD market which with both assets we think is underappreciated. I mean, even expansion in second and third lines as new assets come in that are really breakthrough assets with higher levels of efficacy, and so we clearly believe that consensus is conservative here. Just a comment on atopic derm - this is an explosive market. I mean, it is significantly underdeveloped in terms of the penetration, so it\u2019s going to grow substantially, and even if you look at conservative assumptions on where we source business - you know, the growth of the second line, that\u2019s not to say that we\u2019re not going to be very competitive in front line. It\u2019s a very, very attractive space. Again, I think the performance that we\u2019ve seen, the clinical performance that we\u2019ve seen right now, primarily on the induction trials for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s, Rinvoq in UC, is very, very encouraging, so we see that cascading over our long range plans as well. We are very, very bullish and agree that consensus is conservative. It\u2019s Jeff. In terms of the acute market, as I mentioned, the penetration of the overall segment is increasing very, very nicely, as I highlighted. If you look at the mix between Ubrelvy and Nurtec, we have gained a little bit over the last few weeks, but it\u2019s very close. We typically run at 51%, 52%, 53% of the new prescription basis. I think you are quite perceptive over the value creation that\u2019s taking place there, and I clearly don\u2019t have full insight into the Biohaven fall through, but we\u2019ve been quite disciplined. We have over 90% commercial access, so we\u2019re quite comfortable where we are from an overall access perspective, and our team remains quite disciplined in terms of making sure that we both drive the right type of volume with our positioning but also the right type of profitability over time. We\u2019re encouraged with our continued momentum with Ubrelvy. In terms of Atogepant, I think what\u2019s quite impressive about our program there is just the sheer level of efficacy that we have, and I think this is very important in terms of sometimes the narrative over simple or easy versus, look, how do you think about the best drug for episodic prevention, particularly when you choose an oral, so we are at the very, very high end of the migraine freedom or the days of migraine control with this new asset, and we think that frankly you need to take care of the migraine and Atogepant will be very well positioned to do that. We also think that we\u2019ll have nice synergies. Obviously we have a fairly significant sales force that is promoting Ubrelvy to both neurologist and high prescribing general practitioners, and it will fit in very well as we put Atogepant into that sales fleet, so we\u2019re set up well, we think, for our go-to-market. Yes, so Steve, it\u2019s Jeff. We have pretty good visibility to what\u2019s happening from the share perspective versus the market start perspective. I\u2019ll give you some flavor. With regard to Calquence, we can see the impact of the approvals in the front and second line CLL, and it\u2019s largely consistent with what our expectations were, so they\u2019re ramping in a similar fashion to what we saw in the MCL or NHL, so we know that there\u2019s some impact on Imbruvica there. The largest impact has been, unfortunately, into the market, and unfortunately I mean for the patient. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of the numbers. Typically the CLL market, which is the largest driver, it grows sort of at a population level, like 2% every year. If you look at the impact from COVID, we can see almost three different waves - we can see a wave where the new patient starts in the market, we\u2019re down in the high teens in the first part. Then it started to claw back a little bit into the single digits down, and then it got hit again into the teens in the August period and we saw it down again in early January, about 18%. We can see what\u2019s happening, and as I mentioned in my remarks, the biggest impact here has been on continued market suppression due to COVID. It\u2019s Jeff. In regard to Botox, it\u2019s insightful because we are seeing some robust activity, particularly in migraine. I think there\u2019s a couple reasons for that. One, Rick highlighted the sales force dynamics in China. We\u2019ve definitely focused our sales team on the migraine component. The other thing that\u2019s taken place is a little bit, I think, of an investment approach. We\u2019ve had more consistent consumer investment since we had the integration than previously at the legacy Allergan, so I think the combination of the consumer investment, new waves where if patients access an injector at a neurologist, they can get a sample of Botox right at their first appointment rather than wait for many months. There are various commercial reasons, we think, that give us a lot of encouragement on the therapeutic Botox performance, again specifically and particularly in migraine. Hi, it\u2019s Jeff, and I\u2019ll take both of those. We\u2019re actually not hearing physicians, from our intelligence, from our field teams, actively thinking to switch patients from Xeljanz to Rinvoq. I mean, that\u2019s a big decision for a physician. What we have heard is when we do some of our research and our ear to the ground, we clearly see that oral surveillance is perceived as a Xeljanz issue, so typically what will happen is you may see people take their foot off the gas on some new starts, but we don\u2019t see or hear certainly any widespread news of active switching, so that\u2019s basically our intelligence on your first question. In terms of your second question, we will not be using the esthetics sales force. We will basically leverage our existing infrastructure that we have with some expansion we\u2019ve taken place for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. I think as you know, in terms of our reputation amongst the medical derms is extremely strong. We have the number one reputation because of the years of Humira in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and HS, and obviously we have a very, very strong impression and launch from Skyrizi, so we\u2019ve basically designed a sales force that through our management, which has been connected to these derms for more than a decade, and existing reps with some new reps in there, we are building--we have built a sales force that will work seamlessly with our Skyrizi teams to give a very nice offering to those dermatologists. An important fact is that basically the overlap of those dermatologists that drive basically the atopic derm market is about 90% between the atopic derm market and the psoriasis market, so we feel we\u2019re well positioned in terms of how we\u2019ve set up our go-to-market approach with the segment. Hi, it\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll take the Vraylar comment. The macro prescription market has been down a little bit versus historical trends, but we really think it\u2019s simply a timing issue, and I\u2019ll give you some numbers that support that. Before COVID hit, right in the first quarter of last year, the new to brand, or NBRx for Vraylar was about 3,500 new to brand prescriptions a week, and what we saw is during COVID, that dropped down all the way to about 2,700 - that was the nadir, and then it\u2019s consistently come back up. Towards the end of March, we started to hit or recover that pre-COVID historical rate, so progress is there, and ultimately the way we see these markets function, as you recover your NBRx momentum, the TRx\u2019s will start to come, so we\u2019re encouraged on the latest trends. But your point is right - it has been a little bit soft on the market, and certainly as a brand Vraylar dropped because of COVID, but is now really fully recovered and so we should see continued recovery of the momentum there. Hopefully that helps."

            "name": "Rob Michael",
            "content": "Thank you Mike. Starting with first quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, up 21.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $12.9 billion, up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis excluding a 1.1% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $622 million and the adjusted tax rate was 12.3%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of 18.8% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.10 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 9.8% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $55.9 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect international Humira revenue of approximately $3.1 billion and we now expect Botox cosmetic sales of approximately $1.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09, excluding approximately $1.78 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We realized over $360 million in expense synergies in the first quarter and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. We have already paid down $10.4 billion of combined company debt. We continue to expect cumulative debt pay down of $17 billion by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4 times by the end of 2021 and approximately two times by the end of 2022. In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz. And Geoff, this is Rob. I would just add, if you can take the pieces we\u2019ve given in terms of long term guidance, for Vraylar we\u2019ve talked about approaching $4 billion with the current approved indications. For migraine, both Ubrelvy and Atogepant, we\u2019ve talked about peak potential greater than a billion for each of those assets, and then we have Duopa plus we have 951 in the pipeline, that I think can drive significant growth in addition to our early stage pipeline in neuroscience, so I do see that as a therapeutic area that will drive long term growth for the company going forward. Andrew, this is Rob. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Jeff. I think we agree with you - we do think consensus is conservative. We\u2019ve given 2025 guidance of $8 billion for Rinvoq, and we would expect it to grow beyond 2025. When I look at the current consensus, obviously as you quoted, it\u2019s a little bit--just a little bit above $6 billion from the numbers that I\u2019m looking at, and I look at the growth beyond \u201925, it\u2019s nowhere near what we\u2019re expecting, so we feel very good about the opportunity there. I think what we covered with you in December still holds as we\u2019ve broken out the contribution by indication. We still feel very good about that, but we would agree that consensus is very conservative right now. Steve, this is Rob. I would just remind you also on the first quarter that we had the stocking impact from COVID last year, so if you adjust for that, it\u2019s about a four point impact on Imbruvica\u2019s growth year-over-year due to the prior year comp with the stocking impact. David, this is Rob. On your question regarding Botox cosmetic, we did see in the first quarter, if you just look at toxins market growth, it\u2019s over 30% in the first quarter. There is some impact from pent-up demand as we come out of the pandemic, but we feel very good about the forecast we put forward. We obviously took it up $100 million, so it\u2019s essentially pass through to beat in the quarter. I\u2019d say your math on flat sequentially, I think it\u2019s up a little bit, but really if you consider that we did have some level of pent-up demand come through in the quarter, you\u2019ve got to back that out to truly understand the underlying demand dynamics. Terence, this is Rob. On your question regarding capital allocation, I\u2019ll start and then Mike will add more color in terms of BD. We\u2019ve said all along that we will continue to de-lever through 2023, so think about that net leverage ratio getting to two times in \u201822, the balance sheet would be in very good shape, but we want to continue to pay down the debt through \u201923. During that period, we\u2019ve allocated $2 billion of capital for business development. You\u2019ve seen us do some very nice deals, whether you look at Genmab, I-Mab, we\u2019ve done a number of nice transactions in this space with that amount of capital. I\u2019ll let Mike speak to future opportunities as well. This is Rob. I would just add that if you look at the esthetics business, we\u2019ll see significant growth not just from toxins and fillers, but also in body contouring, so as we think about the potential for that leg of the stool, we think we\u2019ve got really three key drivers of growth within esthetics that will help us get to that high single digit long term expectation. Again, as Rick mentioned, we\u2019re not counting on a significant contribution to the pipeline, although we will continue to drive innovation particularly with toxins and fillers, and of course as you\u2019ve heard before, it\u2019s important within body contouring to continue to drive innovation there as well, so we feel very good about that outlook and we\u2019re not counting on a ton from the pipeline there."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn -- introduce the call to Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed.\nLiz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman and President; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President, Allergan Aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Scott Reents, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Roopal Thakkar, Vice President, Global Regulatory Affairs. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook and then Jeff, Carrie, Tom and Rob, who will review our business highlights pipeline progress financial results and 2023 guidance in more detail. Today, we reported another strong quarter and a highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $13.77 reflecting double-digit growth. Total net revenues of more than $58 billion were up by 5.1% on an operational basis, driven by impressive growth from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ which generated nearly $7.7 billion of combined sales in 2022. As I reflect on our 10 years as an independent company, we have made excellent progress evolving AbbVie into a leading biopharmaceutical company. We have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in attractive and sustainable markets. This includes the rapid development and launch of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ across all of HUMIRA's major indications, plus a distinct new indication, atopic dermatitis. We anticipate these 2 products will collectively exceed the peak revenues achieved by HUMIRA by 2027 with significant growth expected through the end of the decade. We are also building a substantial portfolio of novel, heme and solid tumor assays for oncology. The anticipated launches and indication ramp of several new products like venetoclax in multiple myeloma and MDS, epacritumab across B-cell malignancies and Teliso-V, a new treatment option in non-small cell lung cancer will collectively support growth in the middle of the decade. We expect continued robust performance in neuroscience with our leading on-market portfolio to address migraine and psychiatric conditions as well as a promising pipeline for neurodegenerative diseases. And we see significant long-term growth potential for aesthetics, an extremely attractive market which is underpenetrated, where we have the leading position in toxins with BOTOX cosmetic and Fillers Rejuvido [ph]. Second, we've established a productive innovation-driven R&D organization with a robust pipeline. Our R&D engine has discovered and developed Five major billion-plus medicines over the past decade. We are committed to pursuing new ways to address patients' most serious health issues and have more than doubled our annual R&D investment since our inception. The breadth and the depth of our pipeline which now includes more than 80 programs across all development stages, further supports our long-term growth outlook. Lastly, we have maintained a strong financial position. to fully invest in innovative science and commercial initiatives across our therapeutic categories to drive long-term growth. We've also used that financial position to support a robust and growing dividend which we have increased by 270% since our inception. And we have also used it as capacity to pursue value-enhancing business development to augment our existing portfolio and pipeline. With these strong operating characteristics, we remain well positioned to absorb the impact of the HUMIRA LLE and quickly return to robust sales growth in 2025. As it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we anticipate 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $10.70 to $11.10. This guidance range contemplates, we expected headwind from direct biosimilar competition with U.S. HUMIRA sales down approximately 37% which is at the lower end of our previous erosion projection of 35% to 55%. Robust performance from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ which we expect will collectively generate $11.1 billion of revenue, reflecting year-over-year growth of nearly 45%. Revenue pressure in [indiscernible] with recent challenging market and share dynamics impacting IMBLUVICA, partially offset by strong sales growth of venetoclax. Double-digit revenue growth of neuroscience including accelerating sales of Vraylar with our recent MDD approval. Our guidance also contemplates the transient economic impact primarily in the U.S. on aesthetic procedure growth, affecting near-term performance for toxins, fillers and body contouring. Given that it's difficult to predict the duration of economic and inflationary pressures, we have not assumed the recovery in 2023. And finally, this guidance reflects increasing investments in both R&D and SG&A to support our long-term growth opportunities. It's also important to note that while it is possible 2023 could outperform our guidance, depending upon the shape of the HUMIRA erosion curve. We don't anticipate that 2024 earnings will be lower than the $10.70 for of the 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance which we are issuing today. In summary, we are executing well across our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology which delivered total revenues of more than $7.9 billion, up 19.5% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $2.3 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 70%. SKYRIZI continues to exceed our expectations, outperforming our initial full year guidance by more than $750 million. Global revenues this quarter were nearly $1.6 billion, up 12.8% on a sequential basis. SKYRIZI is achieving strong market share momentum globally with in-play psoriatic disease leadership in 24 countries and total market share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. In psoriasis, SKYRIZI's total prescription share of the U.S. biologic psoriasis market has increased to more than 28%. And there is substantial room for continued growth in psoriasis based on SKYRIZI's leading in-play share of new and switching patients which remains at nearly 50%. Psoriatic arthritis is also providing a nice inflection to SKYRIZI sales, especially in the U.S. Dermatology segment, where we have achieved approximately 10% share of the total biologic market. And we are also seeing encouraging SKYRIZI new patient starts in the U.S. room segment as well which accounts for more than 80% of all PSA treatments. SKYRIZI is being co-positioned with RINVO to rheumatologists where these 2 products combined have already achieved a leading in-play PSA room share of approximately 16%. In Crohn's disease, we are making excellent progress with the U.S. launch. Feedback from gastroenterologists has been very positive, especially as it relates to SKYRIZI's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We recently started DTC promotion for this indication and are already achieving a total in-play patient share of more than 15%. Turning now to invoke which delivered global sales of $770 million, representing double-digit sequential growth. In rheumatology, global prescriptions are ramping nicely across RINVOQ's 4 approved indications, RA, PSA, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We continue to see positive market share momentum in both the U.S. and across key international geographies. In atopic dermatitis, RINVOQ is demonstrating strong uptake in both treatment naive and second-line patients globally. Feedback from the global derm community supports the importance of RINVOQ as a long-term chronic therapy to control atopic dermatitis, especially as it relates to skin clearance and rapid itch relief. RINVOQ AD prescriptions are trending up globally with 20% to 35% in-place shares across our major international markets and a mid-teens in-place share in the U.S. which are both tracking in line with our expectations. In gastroenterology, the launch trends for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis are very strong. Physicians have been pleased with RINVOQ's high rates of endoscopic healing as well as the speed of onset which has quickly resulted in RINVOQ achieving approximately 20% in-play share in the U.S. second line plus setting. Internationally, RINVOQ UC is now approved in 50 countries with reimbursement discussions progressing in line with our expectations. This strong adoption in UC amongst gastroenterologists is very encouraging for RINVOQ's potential in Crohn's disease as well. We are on track for U.S. and EMA regulatory decisions in the second quarter and are preparing for the commercial launch. Global HUMIRA sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 6% on an operational basis with 9.9% growth in the U.S. partially offset by international, where revenues were down 16.9% operationally due to biosimilar competition. In the U.S., we have secured broad formulary access for HUMIRA encompassing more than 90% of all covered lives which enables us to compete for patient volume at parity to biosimilars. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.6 billion, down 11.2% on an operational basis. Imbruvica [ph] global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 19.5%. The U.S. performance continues to be impacted by challenging market and share dynamics attributed to the pace of COVID recovery as well as increasing competition. Venclexta global sales were $56 million, up 12.2% on an operational basis, with continued strong demand in both AML and CLL. We are particularly pleased with the international performance driven by robust share gains in the EU and across Asia. In neuroscience, revenues were $1.7 billion, up 5.1% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Sales of $565 million were up 15.5% on an operational basis, reflecting increasing market share, primarily in bipolar 1 disorder. Vraylar was also recently approved as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, marking its fourth approved indication and adding a new substantial opportunity for long-term growth. We are very pleased with the AMDD label which confirms Vraylar's strong benefit risk profile, dosing flexibility with positive efficacy results for both the 1.5 and 3-milligram dose and the ability to reduce depressive symptoms as an add-on for the partial responders who present and this is important, with or without symptoms of anxiety. The AMDD launch is off to a strong start and we are already seeing a nice inflection in total new prescriptions in the marketplace. Within migraine, our leading oral CGRP portfolio contributed $249 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and QULIPTA. We are also pursuing in the U.S. commercial approval for QULIPTA as a preventative treatment for patients with chronic migraine which would further strengthen our competitive profile and uniquely position QULIPTA as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. Rounding out the migraine portfolio is BOTOX Therapeutic, a unique treatment with a dozen approved therapeutic indications and the clear branded leader in chronic migraine prevention. Total BOTOX Therapeutic sales were $728 million, up 10.7% on an operational basis. And last, we continue to prepare for the launch of ABBV-951 in both the U.S., Europe and Japan later this year. 951 represents a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. So overall, I'm pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\nCarrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Full year 2022, global aesthetic sales were approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting growth of 5% on an operational basis. Global Botox cosmetic sales were approximately $2.6 billion, up nearly 21% operationally and global Juvederm sales were approximately $1.4 billion, down roughly 2% operationally. Our global aesthetics portfolio grew in 2022 despite several headwinds, most notably inflationary dynamics in the U.S., COVID-related lockdowns in China and suspension of our operations in Russia. In the U.S. we began to see a slowdown in aesthetic procedures in the second quarter of last year which coincided with the softening in economic metrics. These trends continued through the end of the year with the most significant impact on higher priced more deferrable procedures, including fillers and body contouring. Despite these economic pressures, U.S. Botox cosmetic sales grew approximately 16% in 2022, driven by strong first half sales with growth moderating over the remainder of the year. Similarly, U.S. Juvederm saw strong growth in the first quarter of the year but filler market declines throughout the second half of the year resulted in full year sales being down approximately 17% versus a robust 2021. We continue to track a number of key external economic metrics, including real personal consumption and the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index. While we have not seen major improvements in these metrics, data over the course of the last several months has shown stabilization. It remains difficult to predict the duration of these economic headwinds. But as Rick noted, we have modeled them to persist through the end of 2023. Our international aesthetics portfolio continued to demonstrate robust growth with the strong performance in most major markets, offsetting impacts from China and Russia. International Botox cosmetic sales of nearly $1 billion were up approximately 29% operationally and international Juvederm sales grew approximately 9% on an operational basis. We delivered this performance despite the significant headwinds we faced last year in our 2 largest international filler market, China and Russia. While our aesthetics portfolio in China continues to be impacted by COVID-related headwinds -- the current wave appears to have peaked. We expect the situation to improve through the first half of 2023 with full recovery in China beginning in the third quarter. Despite the transitory challenges we're facing, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio. Consumers continue to be very interested in the aesthetics category and in our brands. We see substantial room for further market penetration across each of our aesthetics categories and are continuing to invest to support long-term growth. Our promotional efforts are focused on driving more consumers into our customers' offices while increasing retention and productivity of existing patients. We have built a best-in-class commercial technology team known for developing our consumer loyalty program, Eli. We have over 5 million consumers who use Eli and more than 20,000 of our customers' offices. We have a series of new technology products launching this year to drive growth in the aesthetics market and support our customers and consumers. Internationally, we are focused on markets with significant growth potential. We have increased investments in injector training and expanded our field force in China which is our second largest market. Latin America which is very aesthetically oriented and Japan which is growing rapidly and is expected to be one of our fastest-growing markets in 2023. Additionally, we are focused on delivering new product innovation. This year, we're launching 2 new fillers in the U.S., VOLUX for improvement of jawline which was approved late last year and Skin Vive for enhanced skin quality attributes, including hydration which is expected to be approved in the first half of 2023. We're also continuing to launch Harmonica, our hybrid bio-stimulatory HA filler in several international markets. The investments we're making to support long-term growth for our aesthetics portfolio, along with the stabilizing economic outlook and improving tobidynamics in China, leave us well positioned for future growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Hudson: Thank you, Carrie. We expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline this year. In immunology, we continue to make very good progress with programs in our core diseases as well as in adjacent areas of rheumatology and dermatology, where we are expanding our portfolio. We're nearing completion of SKYRIZI's registrational program in ulcerative colitis which is the last major indication expansion program for SKYRIZI. In the first half of this year, we'll see data from the Phase III induction and maintenance studies for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year. We'll also see data this year from our head-to-head comparison studies evaluating SKYRIZI versus other commonly used agents which we expect will further distinguish its profile from competitive offerings. These studies include our Phase III trial in Crohn's disease versus STELARA and our Phase III trial in psoriasis versus Otezla. Results from these studies will add to the body of evidence supporting SKARIZI as a best-in-category agent in these indications. We're also nearing completion of the core indication expansion programs for RINVOQ. Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ and Crohn's disease are under review and we anticipate approval decisions in the second quarter. RINVOQ demonstrated very strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement in our Phase III induction and maintenance studies and we believe RINVOQ will be an important new treatment option once approved in Crohn's disease. This is a market where approximately 80% of bioexperience patients have used the TNF inhibitor and there remains considerable unmet need for therapies that can deliver high rates of response and long-term remission. Beyond our core immunology indications, we're developing RINVOQ in several diseases where we've seen strong evidence that our JAK inhibitor has the potential to become a highly effective therapy. Our Phase III program is already underway in 1 of these indications, giant cell arteritis. And later this year, we plan to begin Phase III studies for 4 additional diseases, systemic lupus, hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo and alopecia areata. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we expect several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year. In the area of hematology oncology, we'll see data from several Phase III studies, including results from Venclexta's event-driven de novo trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a T114 mutation and Navitoclax' TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. Results from these studies are expected to support regulatory submissions in the second half of the year for Venclexta and navitoclax in their respective indications. We also anticipate regulatory approval this year for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma in several major geographies, including the U.S. in the second quarter and in Europe and Japan in the second half of the year. Based on the very deep and drillable responses demonstrated thus far in our clinical program, we believe that epcoritamab has the potential to significantly improve upon treatment options for these patients. We believe that epcoritamab has the potential to become a core therapy for B-cell malignancies. And we continue to make very good progress, expanding our development programs for epcoritamab across several indications. Over the course of 2023, we expect to begin several new studies, including a Phase III study in frontline DLBCL in combination with R-CHOP and multiple Phase II studies in CLL and MCL. We remain very excited about epcroritumab's potential to become a best-in-class therapy across multiple B-cell malignancies and look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving our solid tumor pipeline. We remain on track to see data later this year from our Phase II study evaluating Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. As a reminder, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for Teliso-V, our c-Met ADC, based on the encouraging results from Stage 1 of this Phase II study and the data we'll see later this year has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Our Phase III confirmatory study in patients with overexpressed c-MET is also ongoing. Treatment options for these cancer patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are very limited and prognosis for these patients is extremely poor. As a targeted therapy for patients with overexpressed cement which represents approximately 25% of the non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer population, we believe Teliso-V has the potential to become an important new treatment option for these patients. We're also making good progress with our next-generation c-MET ADC, ABBV-400 which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload, to potentially drive deeper tumor responses as well as broaden the range of solid tumors where c-MET therapies can be used such as gastroesophageal and colorectal tumors. We expect to see early data from our Phase I program in 2024. Elsewhere in the solid tumor pipeline, we have begun to see encouraging data from several programs which we plan to advance into Phase II studies this year. Our anti-GARP antibody, ABBV-151 is showing strong signals of activity, including deep responses with prolonged durability. Based on this preliminary efficacy, we plan to initiate Phase II studies in several tumor types. We also plan to advance ABBV-647 into Phase II dose optimizing studies this year based on the promising results from our early stage program. This ADC targets PTK7 which is a subset of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and represents approximately 25% of patients and has little overlap with c-MetSo our c-Met ADCs and PTK7 ADC combined will target approximately 45% of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. Now moving to neuroscience, where we recently received FDA approval for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder which marks its fourth indication approval. We're very excited by this approval and pleased with the label which highlights Real or strong benefit risk profile in this indication. Vraylar is an important new treatment option for patients who are currently taking an antidepressant but continue to have unresolved depression symptoms. We also recently received approval in Japan for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. This innovative approach to delivering DUOPA-LIKE efficacy through a subcutaneous delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. With a less invasive, nonsurgical delivery system, it also has the potential to significantly expand the patient population currently addressed by DUOPA or other more invasive therapies for advanced PD patients such as deep brain stimulation. We remain on track for approval decisions this year in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we anticipate approval in the first half of the year, with product launch expected in the second half after we secured reimbursement. And in Europe, we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of this year. And in the area of migraine, we remain on track for an FDA approval decision in the second quarter of this year for QULIPTA as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine. In Europe, we anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. If approved, this would be another differentiating feature for Lipa as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. This is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life and we look forward to make this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. And in our aesthetics pipeline, we expect to see results this year from several toxin programs including data from our Phase III study for Botox in platysma prominence with regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of 2023 as well as data from our Phase III study for BOTOX in masseter muscle prominence, where we expect to submit regulatory applications in certain international markets in the second half of the year, including China and Canada. These 2 novel indications for prominent neck and jaw muscles will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment. We'll also see data from our Phase III trial for Bot-AE or short-acting toxin in glabellar lines near the end of this year with regulatory applications plan for 2024. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2023 financial outlook. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you, Tom. AbbVie's performance and financial foundation remains strong with our leadership positions across a diverse portfolio, we are well positioned to return to robust growth by 2025. Starting with fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.60 which is $0.07 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.13 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion, up 3.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 52.1% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 86% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.5% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.8% of sales. Net interest expense was $476 million and the adjusted tax rate was 13.4%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2023. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $10.70 and $11.10. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect net revenues of approximately $52 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect immunology sales of $24.8 billion, including SKYRIZI sales of $7.4 billion, reflecting growth of more than $2.2 billion due to strong market share performance across all approved indications. RINVOQ revenue of $3.7 billion, reflecting growth of more than 45% with continued indication expansion and HUMIRA sales of $13.7 billion, including U.S. erosion of 37% and following a loss of exclusivity in late January. With 1 biosimilar currently in the market and potentially 9 more biosimilars available in the middle of the year, we anticipate that sales erosion will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of 2023. In hematologic oncology, we expect VENCLEXTA sales of $2.2 billion and [indiscernible] revenue of $3.5 billion. For aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.2 billion, including $2.5 billion from Botox Cosmetic and $1.4 billion from Juvederm, with growth rates expected to improve when we lap the market slowdown in the middle of the year. For neuroscience, we expect revenue of $7.2 billion representing growth of more than 10%, including Botox Therapeutic sales of $2.8 billion, Vraylar sales of $2.5 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.1 billion, including Ubrelvy growth of approximately 17.5%. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion and we expect Mavyret revenue of $1.4 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2023. We are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of $6.8 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of $12.4 billion. We forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of 47% of sales. This profile includes a 70 basis point benefit that is fully offset in tax expense given the transition of Puerto Rico's excise tax to an income tax effective at the beginning of this year. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $1.8 billion and we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be 15.3%, including an impact of 1.3 points from the Puerto Rico tax transition. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2022. Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate net revenues of $11.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $5.5 billion which includes U.S. HUMIRA erosion of 27%, Oncology revenue of $1.4 billion. Aesthetic sales approaching $1.2 billion; Neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion; and eye care sales approaching $600 million. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 46% of sales and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 13.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.39 and $2.49. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of nearly $19 billion in 2023 which is net of $1.4 billion in SKYRIZI royalty payments. This cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend which we have increased by 270% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down $4 billion in maturities this year bringing our cumulative debt reduction to $34 billion. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong results in 2022. And with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?\nOperator: Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: And so maybe a question -- a bigger question for Rick. So AbbVie -- when we talk to investors, AbbVie has always been 1 of those. The R&D as a percent of sales has always been low. And right now, even it is still less than 15% and that's the pushback we get that the company cannot grow organically. And in some ways, you have always been playing defensive given that since inception, HUMIRA has always been an issue. Now that you're beginning to get past that, do you think something you'll change -- you want to change fundamentally with the company and the way you allocate internal versus external R&D spend? That would be very helpful.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. This is Rick. So it's a good question. We've obviously heard that question. I think there's a number of dynamics that play into it. when you look at our R&D expense as a profile. One is, obviously, we have a large volume of HUMIRA revenue that requires relatively little R&D support. And so that obviously dilutes out the profile of the business. As we see biosimilar impact, obviously, there will be some impact on that as you know, our revenues were to go down. The second thing is the aesthetics business, we're funding it aggressively to grow it. But by definition, it's not that expensive to be able to fund many of those programs. So it has a much lower profile. So some of it is mix when you think about it. The second thing I'd say is we obviously fund R&D at a level that we believe we can drive productivity. And I think if you look at our productivity over the last 10 years, the data I've seen suggests we are 1 of the most productive R&D engines in the industry. Certainly, when you look at products like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, the return on those assets is tremendous. The third thing I'd say is, look, what drives R&D expense to the greatest extent is when you have large volumes of Phase III programs. And we're coming into a phase as we move forward over the next 3 or 4 years, where we have a number of programs that if they are successful, they will create a scenario where we will increase R&D. So an example of that would be our GARP program. We've seen some incredibly encouraging data out of that program thus far to next-generation immuno-oncology program. That combines with checkpoint inhibitors. And if that program continues to advance the way we see it now, we would want to expand our as our Phase II and then Phase III trials in that program significantly across the relatively broad range of solid tumors. That will require a significant increase in investment to be able to do that. So we tend to drive R&D based on programs that we have a high level of confidence can be productive and can be successful. And we don't constrain R&D in any way from that perspective. Another program will be our AbbVie program. If that program proves to deliver high rates of amyloid reduction and low REA. That will be another program that we want to rapidly move into Phase III. And so I can tell you, I'm very comfortable with the productivity we're getting out of R&D. Certainly, we will want to continue to increase that and that's 1 of our objectives. We always look at programs on the outside to bring them in. And in fact, I'd say over the last couple of years, we brought in a number of programs that are earlier stage programs. And we're fortunate from the standpoint that we have the ability to drive very strong growth, as we've indicated to investors between now and the end of this decade. We can drive high single-digit growth. We're going to return to robust growth in '25. So we're looking mostly for assets that will allow us to drive growth in that late 20s and early 30s time frame. So again, as those mature and they're successful and they go into later-stage development programs, they will drive further need for investment.\nRob Michael: Mohit, this is Rob. I'll just add that. If you look at this year's guide, it's a great example of our willingness to increase R&D investment where it's needed. So if you look at we're increasing it from $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion. Those increases are focused on epcoritamab as well as midstage assets such as GARP and PTK7. We also have several new Phase III studies for additional RINVOQ indications which could contribute several billion dollars of revenue in the latter half of the decade. So even in the year where we're seeing a decline in the top line, we're increasing R&D investments. We're very committed to increasing innovation investment, whether it's internal or external.\nOperator: Our next question is from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: I guess, I just wondered, high level, if there was anything different, Rick, or Rob, about your approach to guidance on the revenue side this year versus last year. I think last year, performance was choppy across a number of different franchises. So as you thought about the guidance this year, anything different as you approached it? And then my second question is any other details you can provide on how you're thinking about HUMIRA in 2024. Obviously, I appreciate the color this year but how should we think about 2024 dynamics in the U.S.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. So maybe I'll start and then Rob can fill in anything that I might miss. I think whenever we look at guidance, we look at it and I think this has been our historical practice. We obviously look at guidance as something that we have a very high level that we can execute against that guidance. I would say this year, you've seen that the range is a little bit wider than what we normally project. And we did that based on the fact that as HUMIRA goes biosimilar, obviously, very small changes in the assumptions we're making on erosion for HUMIRA can have a fairly significant impact. So we're right in the range by about $0.10. and that's reflected in this guidance. And so I would say that as we have in historically, we have a high level of confidence we're going to deliver on this guidance. As it relates to 2024, we have provided as part of this guidance, what we are projecting to be a floor because we've gotten a lot of requests from investors about when will we hit the trough and will it be '23 or will it be '24? So maybe to give you a little color around how we think about that. One, the $10.70 is a floor. That doesn't mean that we will go down to $10.70 but it means that we would say to investors that, that's what you should assume is the absolute floor. Now when will that or if it were to occur, when we occur? Will we see the drop in 2023? Or will we see the trough in 2024. And I would tell you that our expectations would be based on this plan, the trough should occur in 2023. But what I would tell you is if we significantly overachieved this plan into 2023 and there's obviously somewhat greater risk it could move into '24. The reason why it is in '23 versus '24 based on our current planning assumptions, is because the strength of the growth platform has the ability between where it will grow in '23 and where we're growing 24% to offset what will obviously be further erosion of HUMIRA in 2024. 2024, you will basically have to impacts on HUMIRA. You will have the annualization of this year. And as Rob said in his remarks, we expect more of an impact in the second half of '23. So when you annualize that, you're going to have an impact that flows through to '24. And then we would expect further erosion of HUMIRA, both price and probably to a greater extent, volume in 2024. But the growth platform has the ability to grow through that based on those assumptions. And so that's the philosophy that we operate with on the guidance. Rob, anything you'd add?\nRob Michael: I think if you reflect back on the history of AbbVie, we've had a long track record at delivering exceeding our guidance. I think 2022 is an exception. And if you look at on the top line now, we didn't make earnings. So that's important to highlight. If you look at the top line, the 2 biggest factors that drove the miss versus original guidance in 2022 were with Imbruvica and Venclexta, the CLO market, we did not anticipate that, that market would actually not recover. I mean that's -- it's down 20% versus pre-pandemic levels. And then we did see some additional share impact on IMBRUVICA. And then aesthetics, we saw, obviously, in the month of May, we started to see a slowdown in the economy. We had a very strong first quarter. So both of those things really are what drove the top line miss, we made earnings. Now we have factored both those things in the 2023 guidance to give investors confidence that we said it appropriately. But we always look to set the most responsible guidance we can and we feel good about where we set 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Just 2 for me. Maybe just following up on the 2023 guidance being a trough number. It seems like you're still going to have about a $12 billion U.S. HUMIRA franchise here. So can you just provide maybe a little bit more color of what you're envisioning 2024 to look like for HUMIRA? Like is it reasonable to think about the down 35% to 40% year as we look out to '24. I think we just turn your hands around just the how much growth in that core platform and how much of a headwind, I guess, HUMIRA is going to be facing at the same time. My second question was just on aesthetics trends as we move through this year. You've talked about some signs of at least sequential stability the last few quarters. You're talking about stepping up investments. You've got a couple of new products launching. I guess why shouldn't we think about some recovery in this business as we look out to the second half of the year?\nRick Gonzalez: Chris, this is Rick. Let me talk a little bit about HUMIRA and the trough. We're 2 weeks into the biosimilar activity. So it's a little difficult to give you precise predictions or 2024. I think the way to think about HUMIRA going forward is what we would expect is the most significant impact on HUMIRA is going to be price. And obviously, we're trying to predict going forward what that price will look like. Certainly, as we look at this year, the most significant impact is clearly price. So that's more predictable because we obviously know what the pricing is in the contracts that we've put together. And so I think that's something that we have a high level of confidence. There will be further pressure on price as we move into '24 and there'll probably be further pressure on volume in '24d. But I would say, at the end of '24, I would expect HUMIRA to start to develop a more stable tail of revenue. It will still have some pressure as we move in '25 but '25 and '26 is where we should see that more stable tail for HUMIRA emerge. And that's 1 of the things that allows us to be able to see the underlying growth from the growth platform. So a number of things happen between '23 and '24 and then '25 as we move forward. As you mentioned in your second comment, we would certainly expect that the U.S. economy will start to recover in '24. It may recover earlier than that. And if it does, that would be great. We don't want to put a plan together to assume that because obviously, that's difficult for us to predict. But I think we would all expect that 24 will see a recovery in the U.S. economy. And we would fully expect for the aesthetics business to return back to historical growth rates very quickly when that happens. And so that will be another opportunity for that business to be able to grow. And then I would say Imbruvica is the other key issue for us. as we move forward. We would expect the majority of the erosion that we see on Imbruvica will occur this year and there will be less downward pressure as we move to '24. So that's what allows the growth to be able to come up. What I would tell you even though I don't want to make a; prediction in '24 of what HUMIRA will look like. I think we have a high level of confidence that we have the ability if the erosion curve looks like how we've modeled it now between '23 and '24 that we have the ability to be able to have the growth platform and go through that. So we can absorb that impact. And so far, like I said, it's early on but I'd say so far, we're comfortable with how things are playing out. Rob, anything you want to add on the first question and Carrie, maybe you can give a little more color.\nRob Michael: I think you characterized it well, Rick. I mean the thing to highlight for this year for '23, the way you think about HUMIRA really in the first half of the year, the vast majority of that erosion will be priced. In the second half, you'll see because we've contracted rebates, you'll see a step-up in the price erosion, although you also will see more volume with biosimilars coming in the market in the middle of the year, we would expect more volume erosion. I think as we think about '24, we would expect, based on the contract to see a step up in price but albeit not at the same level as we see in '23 but '24 would be more volume. It's probably the best way to think about it right now. We're not going to give you guidance but if you think about how to model HUMIRA '23, '24, that's the way to think through it.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Carrie, anything you want to add on aesthetics?\nCarrie Strom: Yes. This is Carrie. The -- in terms of the aesthetics market and how we're thinking about it for 2023, I mean, first, I'd say, yes, this is still a very strong fundamental market with consumers who are very interested in entering the category. And so that remains a strong opportunity the now and in the future. But what we saw as we exited 2022 is as these economic metrics were softening, we also saw that reflected in demand for aesthetic procedures. And in our conversations with customers, we saw that reflected in their practices, market research with consumers, where they said, yes, we're interested in the category but we want to see what's going on with the economy, perhaps before a new patient might want to enter the category. And based on that, we are modeling for those trends to continue in 2023. And what that means for U.S. toxin market is the market growth would be around a mid-single-digit decline for U.S. filler market around a 10% decline. And like we said, those growth rates would be different by quarter as we lap a strong first part of the year. Now of course, if there is a scenario like a deep recession, where unemployment skyrockets, that is not something that we've contemplated. Or on the other hand, if the macroeconomic environment stabilizes or improve that would represent favorability to our plan.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets.\nGary Nachman: First question is on neuro in the quarter. It's actually weaker than we thought. So was there any additional pressure on gross to net, maybe for the oral CGRPs? And what sort of inflection are you expecting for Vraylar and MDD, how rapid do you think that adoption might be this year? And then, Rick, you recently said that you would be in an article that you would be lifting the self-imposed $2 billion annual cap on business development that you have more capacity to do deals. So how much capacity do you guys have what areas are you looking to be most aggressive? And how important is it to add sizable marketed products into the mix? Or would it be mostly focused on pipeline?\nJeff Stewart: Yes. I'll take the first one, it's Jeff. Thanks for the question. No, we did not see material incremental pressure on the gross to net -- we did see a little softening versus our expectation on the overall preventative marketplace but it was quite modest. So no, fairly consistent trending. I mean if you look at our new prescription capture and the oral market, it's basically a 50-50 shared capture rate between ourselves and the major competitor. In terms of the Vraylar adoption trend, we had discussed previously because we really have very, very strong access for Vraylar that we would anticipate a pretty rapid inflection in adoption for the depression indication, the adjunctive depression indication. As I mentioned in my remarks, that's what we've seen. So we're quite encouraged. I mean we can see a significant trend break on the new prescription adoption versus what was already a very nice growth rate for the bipolar 1 indication. So I think the early dynamics and again, it's only really been a month here in January where our sales force has been out promoting the new indication. We're quite encouraged in terms of the market response, both from the metrics in terms of IQVIA, the scripts we see but also the qualitative feedback from the customers.\nRick Gonzalez: And on deal capacity, we obviously look at business development based on what we believe are -- we're trying to accomplish strategically in each of the therapeutic areas that we're operating in. we identify areas that we think would be good opportunities for us and then we look to see if we can find those kinds of assets. As I mentioned before, I think we're in the fortune of a position that we can drive very strong growth. with the assets that we have on the market today as well as what's coming out of our pipeline over the next 3 or 4 years. That gives us the ability to be able to return to growth and then drive that high single-digit growth through the end of the decade. And we're also fortunate that after HUMIRA, we have a -- relative to our peers, we have a very low LOE [ph] exposure. So we don't have a lot of downward pressure on the business. Now having said that, we've done an excellent job of paying down the incremental debt from the Allergan transaction, we put that $2 billion cap in place when we did the Allergan acquisition that allowed us to focus again on some earlier-stage assets. And I'd remind everyone that was about 4x what our historical practice has been for those kinds of assets. So there was plenty of capacity to do that. But we're certainly in a position now that if the right thing were to come along, we could do a transaction that would be much larger. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to be able to do that. And we've certainly shown that we were able to do that and create value in the assets that we bring in. The areas that we typically look at are aligned with our therapeutic growth areas. So immunology, oncology, certain areas of neuroscience and eye care, I would say, are the predominant areas as well as aesthetics. We obviously continue to look for opportunities in the states. They tend to be smaller acquisitions, though. And so at the end of the day, I feel good about where we are and we've been quite active. We have a very active business development group. And we'll continue to look at those. And like I said, we find something that's of interest and it could really help us round out a category that we're in, then you should expect us to act on that.\nOperator: It comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Maybe to come back to aesthetics. It does sound like you built in conservatism on a number of fronts. I wanted to also -- you didn't touch much around sort of China reopening and how you expect that sort of business to -- as it comes back, if you expect it to sort of return to how it was? Or if that will evolve differently. And then in the -- I guess as we think then around the guidance for '23 and the link you've drawn to as you sort of maybe if the guidance potentially evolves over '23, should we think about that link remaining intact? Or is that sort of a near-term phenomenon and that will sort of, I guess, disappear going forward.\nRick Gonzalez: Carrie, why don't you touch on the aesthetics question.\nCarrie Strom: Yes. So your question around China and I'd say China is our second largest global business. It has demonstrated significant growth in the past few years and proven to be very responsive to the increased promotion that we're putting into that market. Of course, in 2022, China COVID-related issues did impact the aesthetics market, especially in the second and fourth quarters. Now, as we look at the year beginning in China and as everyone is returning from the Chinese New Year, it does look like the current wave has peaked. And that the situation is beginning to improve and will continue to improve through the first half of 2023 and we're expecting a full recovery in the market in Q3 and for the second half the year. So despite the challenges in 2022, China still posted positive growth and we will definitely be continuing our investments in China in 2023 and beyond.\nRob Michael: And Carter, this is Rob. I'll try to answer your second question. I think the way to think about '24 -- clearly, as we go through the year, we always look at the trends and contemplate what that could mean for flow through in '24. But the reason we gave you that guidance range, we mentioned the $10.70 [ph] being the way to think about it as a floor for '24 is because of the dynamics around the HUMIRA erosion. So if we do better in '23 and more of it happens in '24, then you can at least anchor back to we're not going to fall below that $10.70 EPS floor in our guidance range. So we always would factor in trends but that's the way to think about it. If it's just the erosion on HUMIRA is better this year than we have in this guidance. We want to make sure you understood that what it means potentially for '24. So that's again, always factor in trends. But as we sit here today, that's the best way to think about it.\nRick Gonzalez: Maybe just let me add 1 thing that might help clarify it. I think you should think about HUMIRA in '24. We believe we're going to get to a certain level of price and volume in '24, almost regardless of what happens in 2013 because of the competitive dynamic. And so when we talk about the shift, what we're really talking about is inflating '23. If you anchor '24 is a solid point that we have a high level of confidence of where HUMIRA's tail will be in '24. And the only thing that happens to shift it between '23 and '24 is that we do much better in '23 than we expected, right? So that inflates but it still anchors against the '24 point [ph]. That's the way to think about this.\nOperator: It comes from Steve Scala with Cowen.\nSteve Scala: The low end of 2023 guidance implies 22% EPS erosion, the high end of Q1 guidance assumes 21% EPS erosion. How is it possible that Q1 could be in line with the full year and not appreciably better? It seems as though the Q1 guide is low? Or is that because AbbVie believes the floor on HUMIRA price is already reached? Maybe another way to restate the question. What should be our anticipation for the quarterly cadence of EPS as we go through the year?\nRob Michael: So Steve, so I think the best way is 1 anchor on the guidance we gave you on U.S. HUMIRA today. So we said for the first quarter, we said it would be 27% erosion. And so -- and that's going to -- the vast majority of that will be priced. And we said because there'll be 9 biosimilars coming to market in the middle of the year, we would expect more of the erosion to come in the second half of the year. So you have to factor that dynamic into the way you look at the quarters that there'll be more erosion in the second half of the year for HUMIRA versus the first half of the year. Then you also have to factor in that you've got things like aesthetics, we haven't quite lapped the economic impact yet, right? So in the first quarter, you have a dynamic where you will see aesthetics still down, right? But when we get into the middle of the year, when we lap it, that also affects your year-over-year growth rates. And then, the underlying performance of the growth platform as we continue to drive those brands, you'll see those growth rates accelerate. So those are all the things that would factor as you look at the quarterly -- really, we've given you Q1 and then full year. We haven't given you Q2, 3 and 4. But that -- those are the variables I would look at. There's not really a whole lot in terms of if you look at investment, for example, that you have to flex. We do tend to see some higher levels typically in the fourth quarter. So, you could -- you could look at historically our investment patterns and use that as a proxy. But those are the variables to consider as you think about the first quarter versus the rest of the year.\nOperator: It will come from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: I'm going to torch you with a couple more questions on the same subject as others. The U.S. HUMIRA erosion guidance of minus 37% in '23. How much of that is price versus volume? If I look at what your Q1 U.S. HUMIRA erosion is, so the guidance is minus 27%. Given that volumes for HUMIRA are, call it, 5% positive, that would suggest the price cuts may be in the 30% to 35% range. So can we triangulate off of the Q1 guidance to understand what percent of that minus 37% comes from price? And then the second question, again, goes back to 2024. I know there's lots of uncertainty on the exact rate of erosion for HUMIRA '23. But if you hit that minus 37% right on the nose, would 2024 erosion likely be slower or faster than net minus 37%.\nRob Michael: So Tim, on your question related to price and volume. The way to think about it is in the first half of the year, the 27% in the first quarter, is the vast majority of that is price, right? So there is some volume impact but not very much. it's in the second half, what you'll see is in the second half, the overall erosion will step up and think of it as equivalent between price and volume because you're going to have -- we know we'll have rebate rates in some cases, increasing as well as the biosimilars coming to market, we expect to see more volume erosion. So as you think about -- as you're trying to triangulate the price volume with the guidance you've given, 27% vast majority's price, second half of the year, you'll have some more volume kicking in. That's I think the best way to think about the price volume split. And then your question on '24, is your question in terms of the percentage or the absolute percentage [ph]?\nTim Anderson: So, if you hit the minus 37% this year which is your guidance for U.S. HUMIRA, the rate of erosion in '24 would be greater or less than that 37%?\nRob Michael: So we're not going to give you a 2024 guidance, Tim. I think the way to think about '24 is we would expect to see additional price but albeit not at the same level as '23 and more volume coming through because you're going to have up to 10 biosimilars in the market for the full year. So we would expect to see more of a volume impact in '24 that we would expect to see in '23.\nOperator: It comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: You previously commented about the operating margin trajectory of '23 into '24. I believe characterizing them is basically flattish. Is that still the case? And then across the immunology category broadly, we're seeing some -- a lot of cross-currency [ph] mix dynamics, clearly, with your portfolio being part of that. What is your expectation about the potential for some of the newer mechanisms that are emerging with clinical data. Are you keen to figure out whether you want to invoke those as part of your portfolio? What do you see the outlook for novel mechanisms, given that we're going to have some biosimilars to some of the most standard of care approaches PNSIL-23.\nRob Michael: Chris, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. I think for modeling purposes, I would expect operating margins stay roughly at this level in '24 and then begin expanding again in with our return to robust sales growth. I think the pace of that expansion will depend on investment needs as we will always prioritize R&D and SG&A investment to drive long-term growth but that's the best way to think through '24 and then what the operating margin will look like in '25 and beyond.\nJeff Stewart: And Chris, it's Jeff. I'll maybe kick off on your immunology question and then ask Tom to comment on some dynamics as well. So it is very, very clear that certainly in the midterm, the most excitement across these immunology categories are for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. It's quite striking. And I think Tom mentioned there's still incredible interest in a next wave of dermatologic indications that follow on for atopic dermatitis that he highlighted. And really, as I noted in my remarks, I mean, the amount of excitement around the IL-23 and particularly our IL-23 across these indications is really profound. Now having said that, we are watching the competitive landscape for some maybe potentially some novel orals. We don't see them as major players. As we look deeper in the pipeline, we can see that there is the possibility for combination use of novel biologics or biomarker-driven approaches, particularly in IBD. And we monitor those very carefully as we look at our long-range plan. And Tom, I don't know if you want to address some of the things that are back in our pipeline in terms of immunology.\nTom Hudson: Sure. I mean I think the -- I just want to start saying that with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ really raised the bar in terms of efficacy and you see it in mucosal healing, for example. So the bar is getting higher and we will continue to do that. But even to show that we're raising the bar, we're also going to do -- we're going to read out head-to-head studies this year with STELARA and Otezla. So another way to kind of show that what we have is really very profound in terms of responses we're seeing with patients. And we continue -- I mean, honestly, we look at the field. We look at competitors. We're hearing data of S1P1 inhibitors but the data appears to be less effective based on a number of patients which are discontinuing treatment and the signals that we see cardiovascular and others that are similar to what we've seen with previous ones. So I mean, again, without having seen the data, it's all difficult to kind of predict how they'll be able to do accept that our data with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI are very strong, durable and again, very strong at the level of endoscopy also. So we think we have already a competitive edge. We continue we'll see PMR data later this year. We have talked about our RIPK1 inhibitor, again, from the coal healing that's in the clinic right now. We're looking at additional indications. So over time, obviously, we're going to look at additional mechanisms. But not necessarily just pushing down on the same cytokines as JAKs but looking at other target pathways of things that happen in the scan or in GI, again, mucosal healing being an tool pathway. And this is where we think a combination of our immunomodulators like RINVOQ and SKYRIZI with other mechanisms will combine well to give even more profound responses.\nOperator: It comes from Colin Bristow with UBS.\nColin Bristow: For all the helpful color so far. So maybe a broader question just with regards to HUMIRA biosimilars. I just I'm curious like, what is the broader impact you anticipate on the I&I market just in terms of net price has been sort of a question we've been getting a lot of people are trying to wrap their heads around -- and then maybe just one on your CF triple. I know that the trial is ongoing. Can you give us an update here? How is the progress? Should we still expect data later this year?\nJeff Stewart: Yes, I'll take the one on the immunology marketplace. I think that the impact overall in the category for net price would be modest. And I think a lot of it has to do what Tom and I've discussed before which is the -- just the pure profile of some of these agents particularly SKYRIZI and RINVOQ and either others in the pipeline that are coming. I mean they really are setting different standards of care versus what they've seen in the past. And certainly, the physicians and the payers are recognizing this. I'll give a really quick example on 1 of our major products which is RINVOQ. I mean RINVOQ, based on the label changes that have taken place is already a post-TNF type of dynamic. And so the pricing is going to be the pricing there's no incremental ability to step it, for example. The other thing I would note is on SKYRIZI, we have 4 head-to-head trials against all the major competitors and another one coming with Otezla, as Tom noted. So you start to see that level of performance, whether it's against STELARA, multiple TNFs. Otezla, as I said, that's pending here. And it just becomes very clear that you're just going to achieve much higher levels of clearance and relief. So we feel pretty confident that the pricing impact over time, particularly in the U.S. market will be very modest. And certainly, we can navigate that based on the power of the performance of the portfolio.\nTom Hudson: This is Tom. I'll just answer about the cystic fibrosis program. Again, this program continues. And just to remind you, we're working on a triplet and where we believe that 2 of the 3 components of -- for this drug, this triplet, we have best-in-class assets. But we were looking for another part of the triple called the C2 corrector, where last year, the previous ones basically didn't give the meaningful improvement we were expecting in FEV1 sweat chloride. So we've actually, in our discovery groups, continue to develop new ones. In the last year, we've moved our ABBV-576 forward. in SAD in Phase I studies. We continue to see these, again, safety, high exposures, good PK, things that with -- if you combine with our preclinical data, makes us think it will, it has a potential to be best-in-class -- and that's triplet again with -- is -- first of all, to being tested, we'll have data this year to actually show how they behave together. And later at this part of this year, I'll be able to give an update.\nOperator: Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Credit Suisse.\nUnidentified Analyst: Trung [ph] from Credit Suisse. Two, if I may. So I was just wondering on your thoughts more broadly on the pricing dynamics in the EU and U.S. So in the EU, you recently exited the U.K. pricing agreement. In Europe, it does feel like there's -- it's just becoming an increasingly complicated pricing environment. There are a number of reforms being proposed in Europe. So I guess my first question is, is do you see these changes being material or any headwinds to you in your growth ex U.S.? And then secondly, can you just perhaps talk about your reasons you decided not to renew your membership for pharma and bio. How are you going to remain engaged in D.C. and have a voice when it comes to things like IRA and pricing controls.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first one there in terms of the EU. We do see some movement there, particularly in the, let's say, industry tax and I'll comment on the so-called VPaaS [ph] in the U.K. In some ways, whether or not we were in that voluntary program or outside of the voluntary program, the impact is about the same. And frankly, it was a policy decision because we really think that the U.K. government needs to reform that VPaaS. They didn't plan properly for how things might dynamically evolve in the U.K. and it's a very substantial part of the revenue now that is causing problems, I think, across all of the company. So it was a position of policy position, net neutral. It didn't matter, frankly, whether we were in or not and the U.K. is a relatively modest business for us. We are seeing perhaps more importantly, some changes in the German law, as you're probably aware of. And that is, I think, a modest net pressure that will come in Europe in Germany, in particular, because there's the move, as you may know, from 1 year of free pricing to 6 months. There's a modest increase in rebates, for example. So we do see some austerity impact. But on the bigger scheme, it's -- I wouldn't say it's material to our growth platform that we've been discussing.\nRob Michael: And Trung [ph], this is Rob. In terms of international prices, I mean, typically, we see year-over-year decline of low to mid-single digits and that's the way we're modeling it for '23 as well.\nRick Gonzalez: And then on pharma, this is Rick. Obviously, every year, we evaluate any kind of significant investment that we're going to make. And we make a decision as to whether or not we believe that investment is appropriate and is going to have the right level of return at that point in time. And ultimately, we made the decision around pharma based on that. We have a very significant government affairs group that's been active and been in place ever since we came into existence. Back in 2013, we've grown that organization. We did grow it somewhat this year as well in anticipation of not being part of pharma. We plan on being active as we have been in the past to try to appropriately advocate for things that we think are appropriate for patients. And I think that group is quite capable of being able to do that. And I would tell you that at a point in the future, we might decide to go back into pharma. But at this point, we've made the decision that we think that investment could be used elsewhere to be more effective. It's as simple as that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoffrey Meacham: I appreciate all the perspective on guidance. I just had a follow-up on it. Rick, on your comments on the HUMIRA scale for starting next year in the U.S. I think when you look at other geographies, international revenues, you're still seeing double-digit declines after 4 years or so. Maybe just give us some context for what you're seeing there broadly versus what we could expect for the U.S. And just to be clear, when you see next year the impact from all the HUMIRA biosimilars, how much do you think that biosimilar STELARA may play a role here when you look at your assumptions for HUMIRA erosion? And then second question, just on the BD front, you guys talked about some of the therapeutic categories that you're interested in. But with the appetite to expand to expand the menu here and to say more orphan indications, I think across the landscape, some companies in the I&I space are getting into more niche indication. I wasn't sure if that was something that you guys would consider?\nRick Gonzalez: So I think on the HUMIRA tail, just to maybe clarify what I said is I would expect that as we move through 2024 then in 2025 and 2026, we would start to see a more stable tail for HUMIRA. In other words, we're going to see erosion in 2024. I want to make sure I didn't somehow communicate that, that wasn't the case. So if you look at OUS, I think what's probably deceiving to you is you had different countries going biosimilar at different periods in time. So you can't necessarily look at that as an analog because it's so heterogeneous in the year that those countries went biosimilars. So you are correct. Yes, it is still experiencing double-digit decline but it's been driven by the fact that those countries have not -- some of those countries haven't reached stability yet. But typically -- and the U.S. market is a little different because you have all a large number -- you have a small number of large payers who drive the bulk of the activity in this market. So, it's more like some of the countries that did other kinds of government-wide activity, like in Germany as an example. And there, we do see after a couple of years, we've seen stability. So I think what's misleading you is you're looking at the overall number but you're not factoring into that, the fact that these countries went biosimilar across a number of years.\nRob Michael: Jeff, this is Rob. Just to add to that. So if you just look at this year, so about half of the erosion is going to come from newer markets like Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. So that, as Rick mentioned, we have different waves. And so you're still seeing some of those waves come through. You also have some volume going to new agents like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, right? So that's something to keep in mind that that's a dynamic that's also playing out for HUMIRA in those markets. And then you typically see negative price trends in international markets, again, low to mid-single digits. So you're going to see some level of pressure there. So those are all factoring into the year-over-year on international HUMIRA something to make sure you're keeping in mind.\nJeff Stewart: And if you look at the STELARA dynamic with the biosimilar, I think there's a couple of dynamics that we're watching. And it does go back to my prior comments over the clinical differentiation. The first is that there will be less biosimilar competitive intensity against STELARA. Certainly, we've not seen anything like the 9 that we were -- 9 or 10 [ph] that we're going to see on HUMIRA. And so -- and that price point is quite high actually. If you look at where Stellar is now with the branded program. Now I think maybe more importantly, as we've highlighted before, we've anticipated that entry. And certainly, in Crohn's, we have an ongoing head-to-head trial against STELARA that will read out towards the end of the year. We plan on putting that into promotion if and we believe it will be positive, particularly what we're studying which is that endoscopic endpoint which is really becoming the standard in the gastroenterology space. So we think we can carry quite well with the ultimate arrival of that IL -- the 12/23 [ph] versus our Pure '23. So I hope that helps.\nRick Gonzalez: I think on your third question, again, what tends to drive our BD strategy is the long-term strategic road map that we put in place across the branch. So if you think about it, you mentioned immunology as an example. I would say in immunology, we have 2 fundamental objectives that we're trying to drive. There are still areas within immunology, where we believe we can significantly raise the effectiveness of the therapies that are used on patients to drive higher levels of remission or higher levels of endoscopic healing. In other words, better clinical outcomes within the areas that we're in. And so we have a tremendous amount of effort in those areas to bring next-generation assets or as Tom mentioned in his comments, there are opportunities to potentially combine 2 mechanisms together to achieve that level of therapeutic benefit. But then we look outside those areas at the adjacencies. And we look for where are the opportunities for us to be able to bring in either an existing mechanism or something we can either develop within our own discovery group or something that we can acquire on the outside as a mechanism that we don't currently have. But we tend to look for where there are areas of large unmet needs and relatively significant patient populations. So, I use 2 examples to illustrate. Vitiligo. Vitiligo is a disease that's very prevalent. There aren't good therapeutic options in it today at all. We do believe there are mechanisms that will allow you to effectively treat vitiligo. If those are effective, that could be a very significant opportunity overtime. Alopecia is another good example of that. So that's how we focus BD in these areas. That's not to say we would never look at a more much opportunity or an orphan opportunity but I wouldn't say orphan is something that is core to our strategy.\nOperator: It comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\nRobyn Karnauskas: It was great with all the color you've given. I just had some -- I want to follow up on, you mentioned Vitiligo. With the competition with topical rux [ph] which might have a first mover advantage and then they have an oral as well in Pfizer. How do you see the opportunity for you in vitiligo for RINVOQ? Can it compete? And then my second question last earnings call, you highlighted your GARP TGF beta. So that's 151. And I know there's been a lot of cardio-tox [ph] in the space. So what gives you some confidence what features and what indications, like how do you focus on this? And how do you view the competition profile?\nRick Gonzalez: On vitiligo, maybe Jeff and I will tag team on it. I would certainly say a topical has a place but it is difficult for people that have large areas of their bodies that are impacted by something like vitiligo for a topical to be a manageable therapy for those patients. So an oral for those patients that have more severe disease typically has greater benefit and frankly, better compliance among those patients which ultimately gives you better clinical outcomes. So I think the RINVOQ will stack up against whoever the competitive alternatives are based on the data. Based on how we've seen RINVOQ perform in other areas, I think we feel pretty good about what the potential is. But the data will speak for itself, see what the data looks like Jeff and Tom, would you add anything?\nJeff Stewart: Just to build on that. When we look at the valuation of, for example, that indication or HS or alopecia which again are those derm oriented indications that will follow on pretty quickly in the middle of the decade on top of atopic dermatitis. We do exactly what Rick highlighted. We will segment the patients based on the body surface area. We know that the topicals will be important for a certain percentage of population. For example, if it's maybe highly located to the face, that might be more appropriate, at least as the first course of action. But we do believe that in almost all indications that we've looked at for RINVOQ, it just performs exceptionally well in the clinic. And we would anticipate that as well above a base case scenario. Perfect example is Crohn's disease. There will not be another JAK inhibitor in Crohn's disease for the United States just because they just don't work. And you have spectacular results with the selective JAK with RINVOQ. So We take that all into that competitive context all into our calculations as we look forward to return for those future derm indications.\nTom Hudson: If I can just continue with. I mean, we will have readouts for our Phase II study this year and we've mostly been looking at those cases where there's more extensive body coverage disease -- or the face. So I think it would be a different -- it's a much better to take an oral than a cream when you actually have significant body coverage. Again, we'll see the data, we will report on another quarter call. Thank you, Robin, for the second question. Yes, TGF-beta is a known tumor suppressive pathway and people have tried to drug it to increase the response to immunotherapies. The first-generation TGF-beta because the target is so many parts of the body, you actually have effects, the cardiovascular effects having related to the TGF-beta activity in some of the endothelial cells in the valves and so on of the heart. Here, we're using GARP as our target. GARP is actually a receptor for TGF-beta that's called latent inactive that GARP sound only on Treg cells, a little bit on some fiber some store sales but it's not some in the heart or other tissues. That's what gives us our safety profile and the ability to causing a suppression on Treg cells found in tumor cells as opposed to other places in the body. So that we felt from the beginning was the attribute we needed to go to target this pathway would be something that will be tumor selective and that's what we've been able to see so far.\nRick Gonzalez: She asked about what tumors potentially.\nTom Hudson: Tumors. So in our -- initially, we focused on tumors. So this pathway is found on almost every solid tumor has some subset tumors which express TGF-beta and GARP. We started off thinking that we'd do a Phase I SAC [ph] study which we did well that we will expand. And we had picked liver and bladder because we saw a lot of TGF-beta pathway in those indications. And we also -- although we knew there was 7 CRC, we saw in patients in our Phase I study which were unselected in terms of tumor type. We saw responses. So we've actually continued expanding studying CRC but we did see responses in liver cancer where we expected to see it based on expression of TGF-beta. We did see it in bladder cancer and we're expanding in those indications at this point. Given the fact that I said earlier that we TGF-beta in all types of tumors, both tumors called hot or cold, we're actually expanding in other tumors to get signals right now. And again, we have we'll have baskets to actually continue to explore its indication space. But right now, we're expanding when we're going to Phase II dose rating studies that's indications where we've actually seen data in our Phase I study.\nOperator: It comes from Simon Baker with Redburn.\nSimon Baker: Two, if I may, please. Just going back to U.S. HUMIRA. Giving us the expected erosion is extremely helpful. It's also extremely impressive that you confident enough to give a point estimate for the percentage erosion in '23. So notwithstanding that, I wonder if you could give us what the likely pushes and pulls are. Is this something where we should be thinking more about the being upside risk due to inability of those additional generics biosimilars to supply the market. So any color pushes and pulls there and also into 2024 and your confidence around the erosion curve in '24? And then a question on tax. One question topic that's been raised by some of your peers has been an impact from the OECD minimum global tax rate initiatives in '23. Your guidance would suggest that isn't a factor for you. I just wonder if you could give us any color on when and if you expect those initiatives to impact your tax rate?\nRob Michael: Simon, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So when we give guidance, we typically give approximate assumptions and we do use point estimates. We don't typically give product level range. So it has been our practice. So we said approximately 37% erosion for U.S. HUMIRA. We have confidence in that number, obviously. But I think in terms of the pushes and pulls, it's really going to be about volume erosion, right? I think that's -- if you think over the course of the year, we made assumptions around volume erosion. We have good visibility of the price. Now it's a question of what will the volume erosion look like? And obviously, as we go through the year, we'll update you on that.\nScott Reents: This is Scott. I'll give you some thoughts on the OECD question that you asked regarding tax. So you're right. For 2023, we do not see any impact from this. In our view, there's a lot of things to be worked out with respect to the global minimum tax you mentioned. We have, in the U.S., as you know, a minimum tax we see ultimately this OECD tax being a top-up on that if that does occur but there's a lot of details to be worked out and we wouldn't anticipate any impact there until 2025, if there is an impact.\nOperator: It comes from Navann Ty with BNP Parabas.\nNavann Ty: I have 3 quick follow-ups, please. The first 1 on aesthetics, in addition to the macro impact. Are you seeing or do you expect increasing competition from your smaller competitors, DTC campaigns and new products? The second question is on HUMIRA. Was AMGEVITA in line with your expectation. And the third follow-up is on capital allocation. So can we think of 2x as a soft net leverage target which is relevant for AbbVie to consider material business development.\nRick Gonzalez: Carrie?\nCarrie Strom: I'll take that first question on aesthetic competition. So in terms of U.S. BOTOX [ph] Cosmetics, this is a product that's around for 20 years and has based increased competition and still commands market-leading market share in the high 60s. And we know though that the competitive market will expand as new entrants are coming and have entered and in terms of a revamped toxin at the end of last year. What we've seen in the aesthetics market is that, of course, customers are going to try these new products. It's highly kind of newness driven and there's a novelty factor and trial and competitive trial is to be expected. And what we see is that these products and past aesthetic launches that we've watched, the share ramps for the first 12 to 18 months and then tends to stabilize. And so, of course, we don't underestimate any of our competitors. And so in 2023, we are modeling what we think is a competitive amount of share erosion in terms of our Botox business. And we'd expect that in '23 and beyond that U.S. BOTOX [ph] cosmetic will continue to be the clear number 1 market leader. And the new toxins that enter the market will be competing for their position number 2, 3 or 4 in our customers' offices.\nJeff Stewart: And it's Jeff. On your comment on AMGEVITA, the range of pricings that were released were not really a surprise. There's been some external thoughts that this is of interest where there were 2 different AMGEVITAs, 1 high WACC and on low WACC. But again, we've seen this across very different categories and studied it very carefully, as you would expect. So we've seen variably priced WACC products in our own HCV market with authorized generics from competitors. We've seen it in the diabetes space across multiple competitors, including biosimilar competitors. And certainly, with the -- with Amgen and the other segments of their own business. They were often moving around the list prices as well. So all in all, within the range that we would expect from Amgen. Yes.\nRob Michael: This is Rob. I'll take the question on net leverage. So the 2x is -- think about it as our sustainable target. So as long as there's a path back to net leverage of 2x, could take us in some cases, it could take 2 to 3 years to get back to that. But as long as there's a path, a very clear path to get back to net leverage of 2x, that's the best way to think about how we would evaluate it.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Gavin Clark-Gartner with Evercore ISI.\nGavin Clark-Gartner: Wanted to confirm if you were planning to submit the Imbruvica plus Venclexta frontline CLL combination to the FDA following the ASH this year? And then on 951 in Parkinson's, we saw top line data from competitors from last month. I don't have the full data yet. One thing that sticks out is that they have lower discontinuation rates. So just wondering if there's any insight on devices or trial design that may explain this.\nRob Michael: It's Roopal. I'll take those. So for the ISV that you referenced, we have that in Europe and I think you're talking about the ASH data, overall survival. There as it clears couple of years is 0.5% or less and the PFS still stays low. At this time, we're not submitting here at the FDA. They would like to see a little more prospective data in another trial setting. So that's the hype. On 951, this is interesting on the competitors you bring up. So the when you run these patients in, you could have discontinuation rates. And if you include them or not include them, it's going to impact what happens post run in. So for example, when you see our data set, we count the run-in discontinuation and post run-in as you get into the main part of the trial. So you see that in the 20 percentile range or so. And that's fairly consistent with what you would see with a subcutaneous infusion. And it's not clear to us how that data, as you're speaking about is reported. Also, we don't know if that's more than 1 injection is that 2 injections and is it rotated daily. I can tell you about 951. We have dosing exposure that gets up to DUOPA unique from DUOPA to 24 hours. It's a single injection and you can leave it in for 72 hours.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Gavin. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook and then Jeff, Carrie, Tom and Rob, who will review our business highlights pipeline progress financial results and 2023 guidance in more detail. Today, we reported another strong quarter and a highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $13.77 reflecting double-digit growth. Total net revenues of more than $58 billion were up by 5.1% on an operational basis, driven by impressive growth from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ which generated nearly $7.7 billion of combined sales in 2022. As I reflect on our 10 years as an independent company, we have made excellent progress evolving AbbVie into a leading biopharmaceutical company. We have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in attractive and sustainable markets. This includes the rapid development and launch of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ across all of HUMIRA's major indications, plus a distinct new indication, atopic dermatitis. We anticipate these 2 products will collectively exceed the peak revenues achieved by HUMIRA by 2027 with significant growth expected through the end of the decade. We are also building a substantial portfolio of novel, heme and solid tumor assays for oncology. The anticipated launches and indication ramp of several new products like venetoclax in multiple myeloma and MDS, epacritumab across B-cell malignancies and Teliso-V, a new treatment option in non-small cell lung cancer will collectively support growth in the middle of the decade. We expect continued robust performance in neuroscience with our leading on-market portfolio to address migraine and psychiatric conditions as well as a promising pipeline for neurodegenerative diseases. And we see significant long-term growth potential for aesthetics, an extremely attractive market which is underpenetrated, where we have the leading position in toxins with BOTOX cosmetic and Fillers Rejuvido [ph]. Second, we've established a productive innovation-driven R&D organization with a robust pipeline. Our R&D engine has discovered and developed Five major billion-plus medicines over the past decade. We are committed to pursuing new ways to address patients' most serious health issues and have more than doubled our annual R&D investment since our inception. The breadth and the depth of our pipeline which now includes more than 80 programs across all development stages, further supports our long-term growth outlook. Lastly, we have maintained a strong financial position. to fully invest in innovative science and commercial initiatives across our therapeutic categories to drive long-term growth. We've also used that financial position to support a robust and growing dividend which we have increased by 270% since our inception. And we have also used it as capacity to pursue value-enhancing business development to augment our existing portfolio and pipeline. With these strong operating characteristics, we remain well positioned to absorb the impact of the HUMIRA LLE and quickly return to robust sales growth in 2025. As it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we anticipate 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $10.70 to $11.10. This guidance range contemplates, we expected headwind from direct biosimilar competition with U.S. HUMIRA sales down approximately 37% which is at the lower end of our previous erosion projection of 35% to 55%. Robust performance from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ which we expect will collectively generate $11.1 billion of revenue, reflecting year-over-year growth of nearly 45%. Revenue pressure in [indiscernible] with recent challenging market and share dynamics impacting IMBLUVICA, partially offset by strong sales growth of venetoclax. Double-digit revenue growth of neuroscience including accelerating sales of Vraylar with our recent MDD approval. Our guidance also contemplates the transient economic impact primarily in the U.S. on aesthetic procedure growth, affecting near-term performance for toxins, fillers and body contouring. Given that it's difficult to predict the duration of economic and inflationary pressures, we have not assumed the recovery in 2023. And finally, this guidance reflects increasing investments in both R&D and SG&A to support our long-term growth opportunities. It's also important to note that while it is possible 2023 could outperform our guidance, depending upon the shape of the HUMIRA erosion curve. We don't anticipate that 2024 earnings will be lower than the $10.70 for of the 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance which we are issuing today. In summary, we are executing well across our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff? Okay. This is Rick. So it's a good question. We've obviously heard that question. I think there's a number of dynamics that play into it. when you look at our R&D expense as a profile. One is, obviously, we have a large volume of HUMIRA revenue that requires relatively little R&D support. And so that obviously dilutes out the profile of the business. As we see biosimilar impact, obviously, there will be some impact on that as you know, our revenues were to go down. The second thing is the aesthetics business, we're funding it aggressively to grow it. But by definition, it's not that expensive to be able to fund many of those programs. So it has a much lower profile. So some of it is mix when you think about it. The second thing I'd say is we obviously fund R&D at a level that we believe we can drive productivity. And I think if you look at our productivity over the last 10 years, the data I've seen suggests we are 1 of the most productive R&D engines in the industry. Certainly, when you look at products like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, the return on those assets is tremendous. The third thing I'd say is, look, what drives R&D expense to the greatest extent is when you have large volumes of Phase III programs. And we're coming into a phase as we move forward over the next 3 or 4 years, where we have a number of programs that if they are successful, they will create a scenario where we will increase R&D. So an example of that would be our GARP program. We've seen some incredibly encouraging data out of that program thus far to next-generation immuno-oncology program. That combines with checkpoint inhibitors. And if that program continues to advance the way we see it now, we would want to expand our as our Phase II and then Phase III trials in that program significantly across the relatively broad range of solid tumors. That will require a significant increase in investment to be able to do that. So we tend to drive R&D based on programs that we have a high level of confidence can be productive and can be successful. And we don't constrain R&D in any way from that perspective. Another program will be our AbbVie program. If that program proves to deliver high rates of amyloid reduction and low REA. That will be another program that we want to rapidly move into Phase III. And so I can tell you, I'm very comfortable with the productivity we're getting out of R&D. Certainly, we will want to continue to increase that and that's 1 of our objectives. We always look at programs on the outside to bring them in. And in fact, I'd say over the last couple of years, we brought in a number of programs that are earlier stage programs. And we're fortunate from the standpoint that we have the ability to drive very strong growth, as we've indicated to investors between now and the end of this decade. We can drive high single-digit growth. We're going to return to robust growth in '25. So we're looking mostly for assets that will allow us to drive growth in that late 20s and early 30s time frame. So again, as those mature and they're successful and they go into later-stage development programs, they will drive further need for investment. Okay. So maybe I'll start and then Rob can fill in anything that I might miss. I think whenever we look at guidance, we look at it and I think this has been our historical practice. We obviously look at guidance as something that we have a very high level that we can execute against that guidance. I would say this year, you've seen that the range is a little bit wider than what we normally project. And we did that based on the fact that as HUMIRA goes biosimilar, obviously, very small changes in the assumptions we're making on erosion for HUMIRA can have a fairly significant impact. So we're right in the range by about $0.10. and that's reflected in this guidance. And so I would say that as we have in historically, we have a high level of confidence we're going to deliver on this guidance. As it relates to 2024, we have provided as part of this guidance, what we are projecting to be a floor because we've gotten a lot of requests from investors about when will we hit the trough and will it be '23 or will it be '24? So maybe to give you a little color around how we think about that. One, the $10.70 is a floor. That doesn't mean that we will go down to $10.70 but it means that we would say to investors that, that's what you should assume is the absolute floor. Now when will that or if it were to occur, when we occur? Will we see the drop in 2023? Or will we see the trough in 2024. And I would tell you that our expectations would be based on this plan, the trough should occur in 2023. But what I would tell you is if we significantly overachieved this plan into 2023 and there's obviously somewhat greater risk it could move into '24. The reason why it is in '23 versus '24 based on our current planning assumptions, is because the strength of the growth platform has the ability between where it will grow in '23 and where we're growing 24% to offset what will obviously be further erosion of HUMIRA in 2024. 2024, you will basically have to impacts on HUMIRA. You will have the annualization of this year. And as Rob said in his remarks, we expect more of an impact in the second half of '23. So when you annualize that, you're going to have an impact that flows through to '24. And then we would expect further erosion of HUMIRA, both price and probably to a greater extent, volume in 2024. But the growth platform has the ability to grow through that based on those assumptions. And so that's the philosophy that we operate with on the guidance. Rob, anything you'd add? Chris, this is Rick. Let me talk a little bit about HUMIRA and the trough. We're 2 weeks into the biosimilar activity. So it's a little difficult to give you precise predictions or 2024. I think the way to think about HUMIRA going forward is what we would expect is the most significant impact on HUMIRA is going to be price. And obviously, we're trying to predict going forward what that price will look like. Certainly, as we look at this year, the most significant impact is clearly price. So that's more predictable because we obviously know what the pricing is in the contracts that we've put together. And so I think that's something that we have a high level of confidence. There will be further pressure on price as we move into '24 and there'll probably be further pressure on volume in '24d. But I would say, at the end of '24, I would expect HUMIRA to start to develop a more stable tail of revenue. It will still have some pressure as we move in '25 but '25 and '26 is where we should see that more stable tail for HUMIRA emerge. And that's 1 of the things that allows us to be able to see the underlying growth from the growth platform. So a number of things happen between '23 and '24 and then '25 as we move forward. As you mentioned in your second comment, we would certainly expect that the U.S. economy will start to recover in '24. It may recover earlier than that. And if it does, that would be great. We don't want to put a plan together to assume that because obviously, that's difficult for us to predict. But I think we would all expect that 24 will see a recovery in the U.S. economy. And we would fully expect for the aesthetics business to return back to historical growth rates very quickly when that happens. And so that will be another opportunity for that business to be able to grow. And then I would say Imbruvica is the other key issue for us. as we move forward. We would expect the majority of the erosion that we see on Imbruvica will occur this year and there will be less downward pressure as we move to '24. So that's what allows the growth to be able to come up. What I would tell you even though I don't want to make a; prediction in '24 of what HUMIRA will look like. I think we have a high level of confidence that we have the ability if the erosion curve looks like how we've modeled it now between '23 and '24 that we have the ability to be able to have the growth platform and go through that. So we can absorb that impact. And so far, like I said, it's early on but I'd say so far, we're comfortable with how things are playing out. Rob, anything you want to add on the first question and Carrie, maybe you can give a little more color. Okay. Carrie, anything you want to add on aesthetics? And on deal capacity, we obviously look at business development based on what we believe are -- we're trying to accomplish strategically in each of the therapeutic areas that we're operating in. we identify areas that we think would be good opportunities for us and then we look to see if we can find those kinds of assets. As I mentioned before, I think we're in the fortune of a position that we can drive very strong growth. with the assets that we have on the market today as well as what's coming out of our pipeline over the next 3 or 4 years. That gives us the ability to be able to return to growth and then drive that high single-digit growth through the end of the decade. And we're also fortunate that after HUMIRA, we have a -- relative to our peers, we have a very low LOE [ph] exposure. So we don't have a lot of downward pressure on the business. Now having said that, we've done an excellent job of paying down the incremental debt from the Allergan transaction, we put that $2 billion cap in place when we did the Allergan acquisition that allowed us to focus again on some earlier-stage assets. And I'd remind everyone that was about 4x what our historical practice has been for those kinds of assets. So there was plenty of capacity to do that. But we're certainly in a position now that if the right thing were to come along, we could do a transaction that would be much larger. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to be able to do that. And we've certainly shown that we were able to do that and create value in the assets that we bring in. The areas that we typically look at are aligned with our therapeutic growth areas. So immunology, oncology, certain areas of neuroscience and eye care, I would say, are the predominant areas as well as aesthetics. We obviously continue to look for opportunities in the states. They tend to be smaller acquisitions, though. And so at the end of the day, I feel good about where we are and we've been quite active. We have a very active business development group. And we'll continue to look at those. And like I said, we find something that's of interest and it could really help us round out a category that we're in, then you should expect us to act on that. Carrie, why don't you touch on the aesthetics question. Maybe just let me add 1 thing that might help clarify it. I think you should think about HUMIRA in '24. We believe we're going to get to a certain level of price and volume in '24, almost regardless of what happens in 2013 because of the competitive dynamic. And so when we talk about the shift, what we're really talking about is inflating '23. If you anchor '24 is a solid point that we have a high level of confidence of where HUMIRA's tail will be in '24. And the only thing that happens to shift it between '23 and '24 is that we do much better in '23 than we expected, right? So that inflates but it still anchors against the '24 point [ph]. That's the way to think about this. And then on pharma, this is Rick. Obviously, every year, we evaluate any kind of significant investment that we're going to make. And we make a decision as to whether or not we believe that investment is appropriate and is going to have the right level of return at that point in time. And ultimately, we made the decision around pharma based on that. We have a very significant government affairs group that's been active and been in place ever since we came into existence. Back in 2013, we've grown that organization. We did grow it somewhat this year as well in anticipation of not being part of pharma. We plan on being active as we have been in the past to try to appropriately advocate for things that we think are appropriate for patients. And I think that group is quite capable of being able to do that. And I would tell you that at a point in the future, we might decide to go back into pharma. But at this point, we've made the decision that we think that investment could be used elsewhere to be more effective. It's as simple as that. So I think on the HUMIRA tail, just to maybe clarify what I said is I would expect that as we move through 2024 then in 2025 and 2026, we would start to see a more stable tail for HUMIRA. In other words, we're going to see erosion in 2024. I want to make sure I didn't somehow communicate that, that wasn't the case. So if you look at OUS, I think what's probably deceiving to you is you had different countries going biosimilar at different periods in time. So you can't necessarily look at that as an analog because it's so heterogeneous in the year that those countries went biosimilars. So you are correct. Yes, it is still experiencing double-digit decline but it's been driven by the fact that those countries have not -- some of those countries haven't reached stability yet. But typically -- and the U.S. market is a little different because you have all a large number -- you have a small number of large payers who drive the bulk of the activity in this market. So, it's more like some of the countries that did other kinds of government-wide activity, like in Germany as an example. And there, we do see after a couple of years, we've seen stability. So I think what's misleading you is you're looking at the overall number but you're not factoring into that, the fact that these countries went biosimilar across a number of years. I think on your third question, again, what tends to drive our BD strategy is the long-term strategic road map that we put in place across the branch. So if you think about it, you mentioned immunology as an example. I would say in immunology, we have 2 fundamental objectives that we're trying to drive. There are still areas within immunology, where we believe we can significantly raise the effectiveness of the therapies that are used on patients to drive higher levels of remission or higher levels of endoscopic healing. In other words, better clinical outcomes within the areas that we're in. And so we have a tremendous amount of effort in those areas to bring next-generation assets or as Tom mentioned in his comments, there are opportunities to potentially combine 2 mechanisms together to achieve that level of therapeutic benefit. But then we look outside those areas at the adjacencies. And we look for where are the opportunities for us to be able to bring in either an existing mechanism or something we can either develop within our own discovery group or something that we can acquire on the outside as a mechanism that we don't currently have. But we tend to look for where there are areas of large unmet needs and relatively significant patient populations. So, I use 2 examples to illustrate. Vitiligo. Vitiligo is a disease that's very prevalent. There aren't good therapeutic options in it today at all. We do believe there are mechanisms that will allow you to effectively treat vitiligo. If those are effective, that could be a very significant opportunity overtime. Alopecia is another good example of that. So that's how we focus BD in these areas. That's not to say we would never look at a more much opportunity or an orphan opportunity but I wouldn't say orphan is something that is core to our strategy. On vitiligo, maybe Jeff and I will tag team on it. I would certainly say a topical has a place but it is difficult for people that have large areas of their bodies that are impacted by something like vitiligo for a topical to be a manageable therapy for those patients. So an oral for those patients that have more severe disease typically has greater benefit and frankly, better compliance among those patients which ultimately gives you better clinical outcomes. So I think the RINVOQ will stack up against whoever the competitive alternatives are based on the data. Based on how we've seen RINVOQ perform in other areas, I think we feel pretty good about what the potential is. But the data will speak for itself, see what the data looks like Jeff and Tom, would you add anything? She asked about what tumors potentially. Carrie?"

            "name": "Tom Hudson",
            "content": "Thank you, Carrie. We expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline this year. In immunology, we continue to make very good progress with programs in our core diseases as well as in adjacent areas of rheumatology and dermatology, where we are expanding our portfolio. We're nearing completion of SKYRIZI's registrational program in ulcerative colitis which is the last major indication expansion program for SKYRIZI. In the first half of this year, we'll see data from the Phase III induction and maintenance studies for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year. We'll also see data this year from our head-to-head comparison studies evaluating SKYRIZI versus other commonly used agents which we expect will further distinguish its profile from competitive offerings. These studies include our Phase III trial in Crohn's disease versus STELARA and our Phase III trial in psoriasis versus Otezla. Results from these studies will add to the body of evidence supporting SKARIZI as a best-in-category agent in these indications. We're also nearing completion of the core indication expansion programs for RINVOQ. Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ and Crohn's disease are under review and we anticipate approval decisions in the second quarter. RINVOQ demonstrated very strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement in our Phase III induction and maintenance studies and we believe RINVOQ will be an important new treatment option once approved in Crohn's disease. This is a market where approximately 80% of bioexperience patients have used the TNF inhibitor and there remains considerable unmet need for therapies that can deliver high rates of response and long-term remission. Beyond our core immunology indications, we're developing RINVOQ in several diseases where we've seen strong evidence that our JAK inhibitor has the potential to become a highly effective therapy. Our Phase III program is already underway in 1 of these indications, giant cell arteritis. And later this year, we plan to begin Phase III studies for 4 additional diseases, systemic lupus, hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo and alopecia areata. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we expect several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year. In the area of hematology oncology, we'll see data from several Phase III studies, including results from Venclexta's event-driven de novo trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a T114 mutation and Navitoclax' TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. Results from these studies are expected to support regulatory submissions in the second half of the year for Venclexta and navitoclax in their respective indications. We also anticipate regulatory approval this year for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma in several major geographies, including the U.S. in the second quarter and in Europe and Japan in the second half of the year. Based on the very deep and drillable responses demonstrated thus far in our clinical program, we believe that epcoritamab has the potential to significantly improve upon treatment options for these patients. We believe that epcoritamab has the potential to become a core therapy for B-cell malignancies. And we continue to make very good progress, expanding our development programs for epcoritamab across several indications. Over the course of 2023, we expect to begin several new studies, including a Phase III study in frontline DLBCL in combination with R-CHOP and multiple Phase II studies in CLL and MCL. We remain very excited about epcroritumab's potential to become a best-in-class therapy across multiple B-cell malignancies and look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving our solid tumor pipeline. We remain on track to see data later this year from our Phase II study evaluating Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. As a reminder, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for Teliso-V, our c-Met ADC, based on the encouraging results from Stage 1 of this Phase II study and the data we'll see later this year has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Our Phase III confirmatory study in patients with overexpressed c-MET is also ongoing. Treatment options for these cancer patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are very limited and prognosis for these patients is extremely poor. As a targeted therapy for patients with overexpressed cement which represents approximately 25% of the non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer population, we believe Teliso-V has the potential to become an important new treatment option for these patients. We're also making good progress with our next-generation c-MET ADC, ABBV-400 which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload, to potentially drive deeper tumor responses as well as broaden the range of solid tumors where c-MET therapies can be used such as gastroesophageal and colorectal tumors. We expect to see early data from our Phase I program in 2024. Elsewhere in the solid tumor pipeline, we have begun to see encouraging data from several programs which we plan to advance into Phase II studies this year. Our anti-GARP antibody, ABBV-151 is showing strong signals of activity, including deep responses with prolonged durability. Based on this preliminary efficacy, we plan to initiate Phase II studies in several tumor types. We also plan to advance ABBV-647 into Phase II dose optimizing studies this year based on the promising results from our early stage program. This ADC targets PTK7 which is a subset of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and represents approximately 25% of patients and has little overlap with c-MetSo our c-Met ADCs and PTK7 ADC combined will target approximately 45% of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. Now moving to neuroscience, where we recently received FDA approval for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder which marks its fourth indication approval. We're very excited by this approval and pleased with the label which highlights Real or strong benefit risk profile in this indication. Vraylar is an important new treatment option for patients who are currently taking an antidepressant but continue to have unresolved depression symptoms. We also recently received approval in Japan for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. This innovative approach to delivering DUOPA-LIKE efficacy through a subcutaneous delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. With a less invasive, nonsurgical delivery system, it also has the potential to significantly expand the patient population currently addressed by DUOPA or other more invasive therapies for advanced PD patients such as deep brain stimulation. We remain on track for approval decisions this year in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we anticipate approval in the first half of the year, with product launch expected in the second half after we secured reimbursement. And in Europe, we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of this year. And in the area of migraine, we remain on track for an FDA approval decision in the second quarter of this year for QULIPTA as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine. In Europe, we anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. If approved, this would be another differentiating feature for Lipa as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. This is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life and we look forward to make this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. And in our aesthetics pipeline, we expect to see results this year from several toxin programs including data from our Phase III study for Botox in platysma prominence with regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of 2023 as well as data from our Phase III study for BOTOX in masseter muscle prominence, where we expect to submit regulatory applications in certain international markets in the second half of the year, including China and Canada. These 2 novel indications for prominent neck and jaw muscles will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment. We'll also see data from our Phase III trial for Bot-AE or short-acting toxin in glabellar lines near the end of this year with regulatory applications plan for 2024. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2023 financial outlook. Rob? Sure. I mean I think the -- I just want to start saying that with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ really raised the bar in terms of efficacy and you see it in mucosal healing, for example. So the bar is getting higher and we will continue to do that. But even to show that we're raising the bar, we're also going to do -- we're going to read out head-to-head studies this year with STELARA and Otezla. So another way to kind of show that what we have is really very profound in terms of responses we're seeing with patients. And we continue -- I mean, honestly, we look at the field. We look at competitors. We're hearing data of S1P1 inhibitors but the data appears to be less effective based on a number of patients which are discontinuing treatment and the signals that we see cardiovascular and others that are similar to what we've seen with previous ones. So I mean, again, without having seen the data, it's all difficult to kind of predict how they'll be able to do accept that our data with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI are very strong, durable and again, very strong at the level of endoscopy also. So we think we have already a competitive edge. We continue we'll see PMR data later this year. We have talked about our RIPK1 inhibitor, again, from the coal healing that's in the clinic right now. We're looking at additional indications. So over time, obviously, we're going to look at additional mechanisms. But not necessarily just pushing down on the same cytokines as JAKs but looking at other target pathways of things that happen in the scan or in GI, again, mucosal healing being an tool pathway. And this is where we think a combination of our immunomodulators like RINVOQ and SKYRIZI with other mechanisms will combine well to give even more profound responses. This is Tom. I'll just answer about the cystic fibrosis program. Again, this program continues. And just to remind you, we're working on a triplet and where we believe that 2 of the 3 components of -- for this drug, this triplet, we have best-in-class assets. But we were looking for another part of the triple called the C2 corrector, where last year, the previous ones basically didn't give the meaningful improvement we were expecting in FEV1 sweat chloride. So we've actually, in our discovery groups, continue to develop new ones. In the last year, we've moved our ABBV-576 forward. in SAD in Phase I studies. We continue to see these, again, safety, high exposures, good PK, things that with -- if you combine with our preclinical data, makes us think it will, it has a potential to be best-in-class -- and that's triplet again with -- is -- first of all, to being tested, we'll have data this year to actually show how they behave together. And later at this part of this year, I'll be able to give an update. If I can just continue with. I mean, we will have readouts for our Phase II study this year and we've mostly been looking at those cases where there's more extensive body coverage disease -- or the face. So I think it would be a different -- it's a much better to take an oral than a cream when you actually have significant body coverage. Again, we'll see the data, we will report on another quarter call. Thank you, Robin, for the second question. Yes, TGF-beta is a known tumor suppressive pathway and people have tried to drug it to increase the response to immunotherapies. The first-generation TGF-beta because the target is so many parts of the body, you actually have effects, the cardiovascular effects having related to the TGF-beta activity in some of the endothelial cells in the valves and so on of the heart. Here, we're using GARP as our target. GARP is actually a receptor for TGF-beta that's called latent inactive that GARP sound only on Treg cells, a little bit on some fiber some store sales but it's not some in the heart or other tissues. That's what gives us our safety profile and the ability to causing a suppression on Treg cells found in tumor cells as opposed to other places in the body. So that we felt from the beginning was the attribute we needed to go to target this pathway would be something that will be tumor selective and that's what we've been able to see so far. Tumors. So in our -- initially, we focused on tumors. So this pathway is found on almost every solid tumor has some subset tumors which express TGF-beta and GARP. We started off thinking that we'd do a Phase I SAC [ph] study which we did well that we will expand. And we had picked liver and bladder because we saw a lot of TGF-beta pathway in those indications. And we also -- although we knew there was 7 CRC, we saw in patients in our Phase I study which were unselected in terms of tumor type. We saw responses. So we've actually continued expanding studying CRC but we did see responses in liver cancer where we expected to see it based on expression of TGF-beta. We did see it in bladder cancer and we're expanding in those indications at this point. Given the fact that I said earlier that we TGF-beta in all types of tumors, both tumors called hot or cold, we're actually expanding in other tumors to get signals right now. And again, we have we'll have baskets to actually continue to explore its indication space. But right now, we're expanding when we're going to Phase II dose rating studies that's indications where we've actually seen data in our Phase I study."

In our view, there's a lot of things to be worked out with respect to the global minimum tax you mentioned. We have, in the U.S., as you know, a minimum tax we see ultimately this OECD tax being a top-up on that if that does occur but there's a lot of details to be worked out and we wouldn't anticipate any impact there until 2025, if there is an impact."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology which delivered total revenues of more than $7.9 billion, up 19.5% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $2.3 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 70%. SKYRIZI continues to exceed our expectations, outperforming our initial full year guidance by more than $750 million. Global revenues this quarter were nearly $1.6 billion, up 12.8% on a sequential basis. SKYRIZI is achieving strong market share momentum globally with in-play psoriatic disease leadership in 24 countries and total market share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. In psoriasis, SKYRIZI's total prescription share of the U.S. biologic psoriasis market has increased to more than 28%. And there is substantial room for continued growth in psoriasis based on SKYRIZI's leading in-play share of new and switching patients which remains at nearly 50%. Psoriatic arthritis is also providing a nice inflection to SKYRIZI sales, especially in the U.S. Dermatology segment, where we have achieved approximately 10% share of the total biologic market. And we are also seeing encouraging SKYRIZI new patient starts in the U.S. room segment as well which accounts for more than 80% of all PSA treatments. SKYRIZI is being co-positioned with RINVO to rheumatologists where these 2 products combined have already achieved a leading in-play PSA room share of approximately 16%. In Crohn's disease, we are making excellent progress with the U.S. launch. Feedback from gastroenterologists has been very positive, especially as it relates to SKYRIZI's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We recently started DTC promotion for this indication and are already achieving a total in-play patient share of more than 15%. Turning now to invoke which delivered global sales of $770 million, representing double-digit sequential growth. In rheumatology, global prescriptions are ramping nicely across RINVOQ's 4 approved indications, RA, PSA, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We continue to see positive market share momentum in both the U.S. and across key international geographies. In atopic dermatitis, RINVOQ is demonstrating strong uptake in both treatment naive and second-line patients globally. Feedback from the global derm community supports the importance of RINVOQ as a long-term chronic therapy to control atopic dermatitis, especially as it relates to skin clearance and rapid itch relief. RINVOQ AD prescriptions are trending up globally with 20% to 35% in-place shares across our major international markets and a mid-teens in-place share in the U.S. which are both tracking in line with our expectations. In gastroenterology, the launch trends for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis are very strong. Physicians have been pleased with RINVOQ's high rates of endoscopic healing as well as the speed of onset which has quickly resulted in RINVOQ achieving approximately 20% in-play share in the U.S. second line plus setting. Internationally, RINVOQ UC is now approved in 50 countries with reimbursement discussions progressing in line with our expectations. This strong adoption in UC amongst gastroenterologists is very encouraging for RINVOQ's potential in Crohn's disease as well. We are on track for U.S. and EMA regulatory decisions in the second quarter and are preparing for the commercial launch. Global HUMIRA sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 6% on an operational basis with 9.9% growth in the U.S. partially offset by international, where revenues were down 16.9% operationally due to biosimilar competition. In the U.S., we have secured broad formulary access for HUMIRA encompassing more than 90% of all covered lives which enables us to compete for patient volume at parity to biosimilars. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.6 billion, down 11.2% on an operational basis. Imbruvica [ph] global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 19.5%. The U.S. performance continues to be impacted by challenging market and share dynamics attributed to the pace of COVID recovery as well as increasing competition. Venclexta global sales were $56 million, up 12.2% on an operational basis, with continued strong demand in both AML and CLL. We are particularly pleased with the international performance driven by robust share gains in the EU and across Asia. In neuroscience, revenues were $1.7 billion, up 5.1% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Sales of $565 million were up 15.5% on an operational basis, reflecting increasing market share, primarily in bipolar 1 disorder. Vraylar was also recently approved as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, marking its fourth approved indication and adding a new substantial opportunity for long-term growth. We are very pleased with the AMDD label which confirms Vraylar's strong benefit risk profile, dosing flexibility with positive efficacy results for both the 1.5 and 3-milligram dose and the ability to reduce depressive symptoms as an add-on for the partial responders who present and this is important, with or without symptoms of anxiety. The AMDD launch is off to a strong start and we are already seeing a nice inflection in total new prescriptions in the marketplace. Within migraine, our leading oral CGRP portfolio contributed $249 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and QULIPTA. We are also pursuing in the U.S. commercial approval for QULIPTA as a preventative treatment for patients with chronic migraine which would further strengthen our competitive profile and uniquely position QULIPTA as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. Rounding out the migraine portfolio is BOTOX Therapeutic, a unique treatment with a dozen approved therapeutic indications and the clear branded leader in chronic migraine prevention. Total BOTOX Therapeutic sales were $728 million, up 10.7% on an operational basis. And last, we continue to prepare for the launch of ABBV-951 in both the U.S., Europe and Japan later this year. 951 represents a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. So overall, I'm pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? Yes. I'll take the first one, it's Jeff. Thanks for the question. No, we did not see material incremental pressure on the gross to net -- we did see a little softening versus our expectation on the overall preventative marketplace but it was quite modest. So no, fairly consistent trending. I mean if you look at our new prescription capture and the oral market, it's basically a 50-50 shared capture rate between ourselves and the major competitor. In terms of the Vraylar adoption trend, we had discussed previously because we really have very, very strong access for Vraylar that we would anticipate a pretty rapid inflection in adoption for the depression indication, the adjunctive depression indication. As I mentioned in my remarks, that's what we've seen. So we're quite encouraged. I mean we can see a significant trend break on the new prescription adoption versus what was already a very nice growth rate for the bipolar 1 indication. So I think the early dynamics and again, it's only really been a month here in January where our sales force has been out promoting the new indication. We're quite encouraged in terms of the market response, both from the metrics in terms of IQVIA, the scripts we see but also the qualitative feedback from the customers. And Chris, it's Jeff. I'll maybe kick off on your immunology question and then ask Tom to comment on some dynamics as well. So it is very, very clear that certainly in the midterm, the most excitement across these immunology categories are for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. It's quite striking. And I think Tom mentioned there's still incredible interest in a next wave of dermatologic indications that follow on for atopic dermatitis that he highlighted. And really, as I noted in my remarks, I mean, the amount of excitement around the IL-23 and particularly our IL-23 across these indications is really profound. Now having said that, we are watching the competitive landscape for some maybe potentially some novel orals. We don't see them as major players. As we look deeper in the pipeline, we can see that there is the possibility for combination use of novel biologics or biomarker-driven approaches, particularly in IBD. And we monitor those very carefully as we look at our long-range plan. And Tom, I don't know if you want to address some of the things that are back in our pipeline in terms of immunology. Yes, I'll take the one on the immunology marketplace. I think that the impact overall in the category for net price would be modest. And I think a lot of it has to do what Tom and I've discussed before which is the -- just the pure profile of some of these agents particularly SKYRIZI and RINVOQ and either others in the pipeline that are coming. I mean they really are setting different standards of care versus what they've seen in the past. And certainly, the physicians and the payers are recognizing this. I'll give a really quick example on 1 of our major products which is RINVOQ. I mean RINVOQ, based on the label changes that have taken place is already a post-TNF type of dynamic. And so the pricing is going to be the pricing there's no incremental ability to step it, for example. The other thing I would note is on SKYRIZI, we have 4 head-to-head trials against all the major competitors and another one coming with Otezla, as Tom noted. So you start to see that level of performance, whether it's against STELARA, multiple TNFs. Otezla, as I said, that's pending here. And it just becomes very clear that you're just going to achieve much higher levels of clearance and relief. So we feel pretty confident that the pricing impact over time, particularly in the U.S. market will be very modest. And certainly, we can navigate that based on the power of the performance of the portfolio. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first one there in terms of the EU. We do see some movement there, particularly in the, let's say, industry tax and I'll comment on the so-called VPaaS [ph] in the U.K. In some ways, whether or not we were in that voluntary program or outside of the voluntary program, the impact is about the same. And frankly, it was a policy decision because we really think that the U.K. government needs to reform that VPaaS. They didn't plan properly for how things might dynamically evolve in the U.K. and it's a very substantial part of the revenue now that is causing problems, I think, across all of the company. So it was a position of policy position, net neutral. It didn't matter, frankly, whether we were in or not and the U.K. is a relatively modest business for us. We are seeing perhaps more importantly, some changes in the German law, as you're probably aware of. And that is, I think, a modest net pressure that will come in Europe in Germany, in particular, because there's the move, as you may know, from 1 year of free pricing to 6 months. There's a modest increase in rebates, for example. So we do see some austerity impact. But on the bigger scheme, it's -- I wouldn't say it's material to our growth platform that we've been discussing. And if you look at the STELARA dynamic with the biosimilar, I think there's a couple of dynamics that we're watching. And it does go back to my prior comments over the clinical differentiation. The first is that there will be less biosimilar competitive intensity against STELARA. Certainly, we've not seen anything like the 9 that we were -- 9 or 10 [ph] that we're going to see on HUMIRA. And so -- and that price point is quite high actually. If you look at where Stellar is now with the branded program. Now I think maybe more importantly, as we've highlighted before, we've anticipated that entry. And certainly, in Crohn's, we have an ongoing head-to-head trial against STELARA that will read out towards the end of the year. We plan on putting that into promotion if and we believe it will be positive, particularly what we're studying which is that endoscopic endpoint which is really becoming the standard in the gastroenterology space. So we think we can carry quite well with the ultimate arrival of that IL -- the 12/23 [ph] versus our Pure '23. So I hope that helps. Just to build on that. When we look at the valuation of, for example, that indication or HS or alopecia which again are those derm oriented indications that will follow on pretty quickly in the middle of the decade on top of atopic dermatitis. We do exactly what Rick highlighted. We will segment the patients based on the body surface area. We know that the topicals will be important for a certain percentage of population. For example, if it's maybe highly located to the face, that might be more appropriate, at least as the first course of action. But we do believe that in almost all indications that we've looked at for RINVOQ, it just performs exceptionally well in the clinic. And we would anticipate that as well above a base case scenario. Perfect example is Crohn's disease. There will not be another JAK inhibitor in Crohn's disease for the United States just because they just don't work. And you have spectacular results with the selective JAK with RINVOQ. So We take that all into that competitive context all into our calculations as we look forward to return for those future derm indications. And it's Jeff. On your comment on AMGEVITA, the range of pricings that were released were not really a surprise. There's been some external thoughts that this is of interest where there were 2 different AMGEVITAs, 1 high WACC and on low WACC. But again, we've seen this across very different categories and studied it very carefully, as you would expect. So we've seen variably priced WACC products in our own HCV market with authorized generics from competitors. We've seen it in the diabetes space across multiple competitors, including biosimilar competitors. And certainly, with the -- with Amgen and the other segments of their own business. They were often moving around the list prices as well. So all in all, within the range that we would expect from Amgen. Yes."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Full year 2022, global aesthetic sales were approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting growth of 5% on an operational basis. Global Botox cosmetic sales were approximately $2.6 billion, up nearly 21% operationally and global Juvederm sales were approximately $1.4 billion, down roughly 2% operationally. Our global aesthetics portfolio grew in 2022 despite several headwinds, most notably inflationary dynamics in the U.S., COVID-related lockdowns in China and suspension of our operations in Russia. In the U.S. we began to see a slowdown in aesthetic procedures in the second quarter of last year which coincided with the softening in economic metrics. These trends continued through the end of the year with the most significant impact on higher priced more deferrable procedures, including fillers and body contouring. Despite these economic pressures, U.S. Botox cosmetic sales grew approximately 16% in 2022, driven by strong first half sales with growth moderating over the remainder of the year. Similarly, U.S. Juvederm saw strong growth in the first quarter of the year but filler market declines throughout the second half of the year resulted in full year sales being down approximately 17% versus a robust 2021. We continue to track a number of key external economic metrics, including real personal consumption and the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index. While we have not seen major improvements in these metrics, data over the course of the last several months has shown stabilization. It remains difficult to predict the duration of these economic headwinds. But as Rick noted, we have modeled them to persist through the end of 2023. Our international aesthetics portfolio continued to demonstrate robust growth with the strong performance in most major markets, offsetting impacts from China and Russia. International Botox cosmetic sales of nearly $1 billion were up approximately 29% operationally and international Juvederm sales grew approximately 9% on an operational basis. We delivered this performance despite the significant headwinds we faced last year in our 2 largest international filler market, China and Russia. While our aesthetics portfolio in China continues to be impacted by COVID-related headwinds -- the current wave appears to have peaked. We expect the situation to improve through the first half of 2023 with full recovery in China beginning in the third quarter. Despite the transitory challenges we're facing, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio. Consumers continue to be very interested in the aesthetics category and in our brands. We see substantial room for further market penetration across each of our aesthetics categories and are continuing to invest to support long-term growth. Our promotional efforts are focused on driving more consumers into our customers' offices while increasing retention and productivity of existing patients. We have built a best-in-class commercial technology team known for developing our consumer loyalty program, Eli. We have over 5 million consumers who use Eli and more than 20,000 of our customers' offices. We have a series of new technology products launching this year to drive growth in the aesthetics market and support our customers and consumers. Internationally, we are focused on markets with significant growth potential. We have increased investments in injector training and expanded our field force in China which is our second largest market. Latin America which is very aesthetically oriented and Japan which is growing rapidly and is expected to be one of our fastest-growing markets in 2023. Additionally, we are focused on delivering new product innovation. This year, we're launching 2 new fillers in the U.S., VOLUX for improvement of jawline which was approved late last year and Skin Vive for enhanced skin quality attributes, including hydration which is expected to be approved in the first half of 2023. We're also continuing to launch Harmonica, our hybrid bio-stimulatory HA filler in several international markets. The investments we're making to support long-term growth for our aesthetics portfolio, along with the stabilizing economic outlook and improving tobidynamics in China, leave us well positioned for future growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Yes. This is Carrie. The -- in terms of the aesthetics market and how we're thinking about it for 2023, I mean, first, I'd say, yes, this is still a very strong fundamental market with consumers who are very interested in entering the category. And so that remains a strong opportunity the now and in the future. But what we saw as we exited 2022 is as these economic metrics were softening, we also saw that reflected in demand for aesthetic procedures. And in our conversations with customers, we saw that reflected in their practices, market research with consumers, where they said, yes, we're interested in the category but we want to see what's going on with the economy, perhaps before a new patient might want to enter the category. And based on that, we are modeling for those trends to continue in 2023. And what that means for U.S. toxin market is the market growth would be around a mid-single-digit decline for U.S. filler market around a 10% decline. And like we said, those growth rates would be different by quarter as we lap a strong first part of the year. Now of course, if there is a scenario like a deep recession, where unemployment skyrockets, that is not something that we've contemplated. Or on the other hand, if the macroeconomic environment stabilizes or improve that would represent favorability to our plan. Yes. So your question around China and I'd say China is our second largest global business. It has demonstrated significant growth in the past few years and proven to be very responsive to the increased promotion that we're putting into that market. Of course, in 2022, China COVID-related issues did impact the aesthetics market, especially in the second and fourth quarters. Now, as we look at the year beginning in China and as everyone is returning from the Chinese New Year, it does look like the current wave has peaked. And that the situation is beginning to improve and will continue to improve through the first half of 2023 and we're expecting a full recovery in the market in Q3 and for the second half the year. So despite the challenges in 2022, China still posted positive growth and we will definitely be continuing our investments in China in 2023 and beyond. I'll take that first question on aesthetic competition. So in terms of U.S. BOTOX [ph] Cosmetics, this is a product that's around for 20 years and has based increased competition and still commands market-leading market share in the high 60s. And we know though that the competitive market will expand as new entrants are coming and have entered and in terms of a revamped toxin at the end of last year. What we've seen in the aesthetics market is that, of course, customers are going to try these new products. It's highly kind of newness driven and there's a novelty factor and trial and competitive trial is to be expected. And what we see is that these products and past aesthetic launches that we've watched, the share ramps for the first 12 to 18 months and then tends to stabilize. And so, of course, we don't underestimate any of our competitors. And so in 2023, we are modeling what we think is a competitive amount of share erosion in terms of our Botox business. And we'd expect that in '23 and beyond that U.S. BOTOX [ph] cosmetic will continue to be the clear number 1 market leader. And the new toxins that enter the market will be competing for their position number 2, 3 or 4 in our customers' offices."

AbbVie's performance and financial foundation remains strong with our leadership positions across a diverse portfolio, we are well positioned to return to robust growth by 2025. Starting with fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.60 which is $0.07 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.13 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion, up 3.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 52.1% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 86% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.5% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.8% of sales. Net interest expense was $476 million and the adjusted tax rate was 13.4%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2023. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $10.70 and $11.10. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect net revenues of approximately $52 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect immunology sales of $24.8 billion, including SKYRIZI sales of $7.4 billion, reflecting growth of more than $2.2 billion due to strong market share performance across all approved indications. RINVOQ revenue of $3.7 billion, reflecting growth of more than 45% with continued indication expansion and HUMIRA sales of $13.7 billion, including U.S. erosion of 37% and following a loss of exclusivity in late January. With 1 biosimilar currently in the market and potentially 9 more biosimilars available in the middle of the year, we anticipate that sales erosion will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of 2023. In hematologic oncology, we expect VENCLEXTA sales of $2.2 billion and [indiscernible] revenue of $3.5 billion. For aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.2 billion, including $2.5 billion from Botox Cosmetic and $1.4 billion from Juvederm, with growth rates expected to improve when we lap the market slowdown in the middle of the year. For neuroscience, we expect revenue of $7.2 billion representing growth of more than 10%, including Botox Therapeutic sales of $2.8 billion, Vraylar sales of $2.5 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.1 billion, including Ubrelvy growth of approximately 17.5%. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion and we expect Mavyret revenue of $1.4 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2023. We are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of $6.8 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of $12.4 billion. We forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of 47% of sales. This profile includes a 70 basis point benefit that is fully offset in tax expense given the transition of Puerto Rico's excise tax to an income tax effective at the beginning of this year. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $1.8 billion and we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be 15.3%, including an impact of 1.3 points from the Puerto Rico tax transition. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2022. Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate net revenues of $11.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $5.5 billion which includes U.S. HUMIRA erosion of 27%, Oncology revenue of $1.4 billion. Aesthetic sales approaching $1.2 billion; Neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion; and eye care sales approaching $600 million. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 46% of sales and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 13.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.39 and $2.49. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of nearly $19 billion in 2023 which is net of $1.4 billion in SKYRIZI royalty payments. This cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend which we have increased by 270% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down $4 billion in maturities this year bringing our cumulative debt reduction to $34 billion. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong results in 2022. And with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. Mohit, this is Rob. I'll just add that. If you look at this year's guide, it's a great example of our willingness to increase R&D investment where it's needed. So if you look at we're increasing it from $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion. Those increases are focused on epcoritamab as well as midstage assets such as GARP and PTK7. We also have several new Phase III studies for additional RINVOQ indications which could contribute several billion dollars of revenue in the latter half of the decade. So even in the year where we're seeing a decline in the top line, we're increasing R&D investments. We're very committed to increasing innovation investment, whether it's internal or external. I think if you reflect back on the history of AbbVie, we've had a long track record at delivering exceeding our guidance. I think 2022 is an exception. And if you look at on the top line now, we didn't make earnings. So that's important to highlight. If you look at the top line, the 2 biggest factors that drove the miss versus original guidance in 2022 were with Imbruvica and Venclexta, the CLO market, we did not anticipate that, that market would actually not recover. I mean that's -- it's down 20% versus pre-pandemic levels. And then we did see some additional share impact on IMBRUVICA. And then aesthetics, we saw, obviously, in the month of May, we started to see a slowdown in the economy. We had a very strong first quarter. So both of those things really are what drove the top line miss, we made earnings. Now we have factored both those things in the 2023 guidance to give investors confidence that we said it appropriately. But we always look to set the most responsible guidance we can and we feel good about where we set 2023. I think you characterized it well, Rick. I mean the thing to highlight for this year for '23, the way you think about HUMIRA really in the first half of the year, the vast majority of that erosion will be priced. In the second half, you'll see because we've contracted rebates, you'll see a step-up in the price erosion, although you also will see more volume with biosimilars coming in the market in the middle of the year, we would expect more volume erosion. I think as we think about '24, we would expect, based on the contract to see a step up in price but albeit not at the same level as we see in '23 but '24 would be more volume. It's probably the best way to think about it right now. We're not going to give you guidance but if you think about how to model HUMIRA '23, '24, that's the way to think through it. And Carter, this is Rob. I'll try to answer your second question. I think the way to think about '24 -- clearly, as we go through the year, we always look at the trends and contemplate what that could mean for flow through in '24. But the reason we gave you that guidance range, we mentioned the $10.70 [ph] being the way to think about it as a floor for '24 is because of the dynamics around the HUMIRA erosion. So if we do better in '23 and more of it happens in '24, then you can at least anchor back to we're not going to fall below that $10.70 EPS floor in our guidance range. So we always would factor in trends but that's the way to think about it. If it's just the erosion on HUMIRA is better this year than we have in this guidance. We want to make sure you understood that what it means potentially for '24. So that's again, always factor in trends. But as we sit here today, that's the best way to think about it. So Steve, so I think the best way is 1 anchor on the guidance we gave you on U.S. HUMIRA today. So we said for the first quarter, we said it would be 27% erosion. And so -- and that's going to -- the vast majority of that will be priced. And we said because there'll be 9 biosimilars coming to market in the middle of the year, we would expect more of the erosion to come in the second half of the year. So you have to factor that dynamic into the way you look at the quarters that there'll be more erosion in the second half of the year for HUMIRA versus the first half of the year. Then you also have to factor in that you've got things like aesthetics, we haven't quite lapped the economic impact yet, right? So in the first quarter, you have a dynamic where you will see aesthetics still down, right? But when we get into the middle of the year, when we lap it, that also affects your year-over-year growth rates. And then, the underlying performance of the growth platform as we continue to drive those brands, you'll see those growth rates accelerate. So those are all the things that would factor as you look at the quarterly -- really, we've given you Q1 and then full year. We haven't given you Q2, 3 and 4. But that -- those are the variables I would look at. There's not really a whole lot in terms of if you look at investment, for example, that you have to flex. We do tend to see some higher levels typically in the fourth quarter. So, you could -- you could look at historically our investment patterns and use that as a proxy. But those are the variables to consider as you think about the first quarter versus the rest of the year. So Tim, on your question related to price and volume. The way to think about it is in the first half of the year, the 27% in the first quarter, is the vast majority of that is price, right? So there is some volume impact but not very much. it's in the second half, what you'll see is in the second half, the overall erosion will step up and think of it as equivalent between price and volume because you're going to have -- we know we'll have rebate rates in some cases, increasing as well as the biosimilars coming to market, we expect to see more volume erosion. So as you think about -- as you're trying to triangulate the price volume with the guidance you've given, 27% vast majority's price, second half of the year, you'll have some more volume kicking in. That's I think the best way to think about the price volume split. And then your question on '24, is your question in terms of the percentage or the absolute percentage [ph]? So we're not going to give you a 2024 guidance, Tim. I think the way to think about '24 is we would expect to see additional price but albeit not at the same level as '23 and more volume coming through because you're going to have up to 10 biosimilars in the market for the full year. So we would expect to see more of a volume impact in '24 that we would expect to see in '23. Chris, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. I think for modeling purposes, I would expect operating margins stay roughly at this level in '24 and then begin expanding again in with our return to robust sales growth. I think the pace of that expansion will depend on investment needs as we will always prioritize R&D and SG&A investment to drive long-term growth but that's the best way to think through '24 and then what the operating margin will look like in '25 and beyond. And Trung [ph], this is Rob. In terms of international prices, I mean, typically, we see year-over-year decline of low to mid-single digits and that's the way we're modeling it for '23 as well. Jeff, this is Rob. Just to add to that. So if you just look at this year, so about half of the erosion is going to come from newer markets like Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. So that, as Rick mentioned, we have different waves. And so you're still seeing some of those waves come through. You also have some volume going to new agents like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, right? So that's something to keep in mind that that's a dynamic that's also playing out for HUMIRA in those markets. And then you typically see negative price trends in international markets, again, low to mid-single digits. So you're going to see some level of pressure there. So those are all factoring into the year-over-year on international HUMIRA something to make sure you're keeping in mind. Simon, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So when we give guidance, we typically give approximate assumptions and we do use point estimates. We don't typically give product level range. So it has been our practice. So we said approximately 37% erosion for U.S. HUMIRA. We have confidence in that number, obviously. But I think in terms of the pushes and pulls, it's really going to be about volume erosion, right? I think that's -- if you think over the course of the year, we made assumptions around volume erosion. We have good visibility of the price. Now it's a question of what will the volume erosion look like? And obviously, as we go through the year, we'll update you on that. This is Rob. I'll take the question on net leverage. So the 2x is -- think about it as our sustainable target. So as long as there's a path back to net leverage of 2x, could take us in some cases, it could take 2 to 3 years to get back to that. But as long as there's a path, a very clear path to get back to net leverage of 2x, that's the best way to think about how we would evaluate it. It's Roopal. I'll take those. So for the ISV that you referenced, we have that in Europe and I think you're talking about the ASH data, overall survival. There as it clears couple of years is 0.5% or less and the PFS still stays low. At this time, we're not submitting here at the FDA. They would like to see a little more prospective data in another trial setting. So that's the hype. On 951, this is interesting on the competitors you bring up. So the when you run these patients in, you could have discontinuation rates. And if you include them or not include them, it's going to impact what happens post run in. So for example, when you see our data set, we count the run-in discontinuation and post run-in as you get into the main part of the trial. So you see that in the 20 percentile range or so. And that's fairly consistent with what you would see with a subcutaneous infusion. And it's not clear to us how that data, as you're speaking about is reported. Also, we don't know if that's more than 1 injection is that 2 injections and is it rotated daily. I can tell you about 951. We have dosing exposure that gets up to DUOPA unique from DUOPA to 24 hours. It's a single injection and you can leave it in for 72 hours."

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our overall performance then Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our third quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie continues to perform very well, a testament to the strength of our broad, diversified portfolio. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our immunology assets, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenues of $14.8 billion were up 5.4% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. Immunology once again demonstrated impressive results with Skyrizi and Rinvoq now on pace to deliver more than $7.5 billion in combined sales this year, well ahead of our initial expectations. This performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we're in the early launch phase for both assets in IBD and PSA, as well as Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories across existing and new indications, giving us a high degree of confidence in the collective potential of these two assets to ultimately exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira, achieving the strategic objective we had for replacing Humira. We also saw a continued strong double-digit operational sales growth from several additional key products, including Botox Cosmetic, Vraylar, Venclexta and Botox Therapeutic. This strong momentum is helping us offset some of the interim economic pressure we now see in our Aesthetics portfolio. Based on these results, we remain confident in the outlook of our business and are reaffirming the midpoint of our full year 2022 EPS guidance at $13.86, which represents strong double-digit growth. As many of you are aware, we have a leading consumer-facing aesthetics portfolio, which is largely cash pay. We have been monitoring the global economic situation. Based on all the data we have been observing, especially in the U.S. with both the consumer confidence index and real personal consumption expenditures trending down and continued high inflation, these factors are putting pressure on consumers' discretionary spending. This metric correlates with a slowdown in treatment procedures that we're seeing across the aesthetics markets, impacting the growth rates for toxins, fillers and body contouring. While our U.S. aesthetics market share remains stable across both toxins and fillers, we now believe it's prudent to adjust our full year aesthetics forecast to reflect the moderating market growth over the near to medium term, which is expected to predominantly impact Juvederm as well as our body contouring portfolio products, which represent higher price points for consumers. While it's difficult to predict the duration of these economic dynamics, we expect these conditions to persist into 2023. As consumer confidence improves, we would once again expect the market growth to accelerate. Our aesthetics portfolio experienced a rapid and sustained recovery following the 2008-2009 recession, so we anticipate any impact will be transient. Over the long-term, the aesthetics business continues to be an extremely attractive, underpenetrated market with significant growth potential. The current market dynamics do not change our long-term guidance for aesthetics and we remain confident in our ability to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. I also want to provide a brief update on the outlook for 2023. With regards to the status of contracting for Humira, our intent has always been to maintain broad formulary access so that we can compete effectively with forthcoming biosimilars. We are making very good progress consistent with this objective, and are currently projecting formulary access for at least 80% of all U.S. covered lives. We expect this percentage to increase further as we conclude additional contract discussions between now and the end of the year. As a result, we anticipate strong access for U.S. Humira throughout 2023, and project biosimilars will share access as they become available. We will provide sales guidance for Humira on our fourth quarter call. While we're not issuing 2023 guidance today, it is important to note that when we issue our EPS outlook, we expect the lower end of the range to represent for earnings. So while it's possible 2023 could outperform our guidance regardless of the shape of the erosion curve, we don't anticipate 2024 earnings will be lower than the initial 2023 EPS guidance given the momentum and growth from another year of our ex-Humira portfolio, which is expected to more than offset any incremental Humira erosion in 2024. We know that many investors have an interest in the timing of AbbVie's trough earnings, whether that would be 2023 or 2024. The guidance range will provide and give investors additional clarity regarding our expectations for the company's core EPS.  In summary, we continue to deliver strong results and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. To that end, as noted in our news release, today we're announcing a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.41 per share to $1.48 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2023. Since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 270%. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. We once again demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. I'll start with Immunology, where we are well positioned for sustained leadership in this extremely attractive market. Total Immunology revenues were more than $7.6 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. We remain very excited about the long-term potential for Skyrizi and Rinvoq which are already having a significant impact on AbbVie's growth and performance, contributing approximately $2.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, representing nearly 15% of total company net revenues. Skyrizi continues to exceed our expectations. Global revenues were $1.4 billion, up 12% on a sequential basis. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is capturing nearly one out of every two new and switching patients in the U.S. biologic market, with our leading total prescription share increasing to approximately 27%. We have also achieved total market share leadership in a dozen key international markets, including Japan, Canada and France. Psoriatic arthritis is ramping very nicely, with an expected global sales contribution of approximately $500 million just this year. Our PSA performance is especially strong in the U.S. Dermatology segment, where we have already achieved 10% total market share. Lastly, our launch of Skyrizi for Crohn's disease in the U.S. is progressing very well. Early prescription trends as well as feedback from gastroenterologists has been overwhelmingly positive, especially given Skyrizi's convenient dosing and strong clinical profile. Importantly, commercial access for Skyrizi Crohn's is now equal to psoriasis and PSA with sales in this indication expected to ramp significantly over the next several quarters. Given the momentum we are seeing across the indications; we will be raising our full year sales guidance once again for Skyrizi. Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $695 million, demonstrating more than 17% sequential growth, we continue to see positive momentum in RA, with total market share increasing to more than 6% in both the U.S. and across key international geographies. Global prescriptions are also ramping nicely in PSA ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA, a testament to the strong clinical profile Rinvoq has demonstrated across the broader rheumatology segment. Rinvoq is now the only JAK inhibitor with global approval for all four major Rheum indications. In atopic dermatitis, we continue to see strong demand for Rinvoq, particularly in the second-line setting. U.S. in-play market share is tracking in line with our expectations and we were making excellent progress internationally, with in-place share ranging now from approximately 20% to 35% across our major markets. AD remains a highly underpenetrated market globally and an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Rinvoq. Lastly, in ulcerative colitis, we are very excited by the early prescription trends in the U.S. In the second line plus setting, Rinvoq is already achieving the second highest in-place share, which is now approaching 20% in just a few months\u2019 post launch. Physicians have been pleased with Rinvoq's high rates of endoscopic healing as well as the speed of onset. With over 70% of bioexperience UC patients currently on or having used TNF therapy, the second line plus opportunity for Rinvoq in UC is substantial. This strong adoption in UC among gastroenterologists is also encouraging for Rinvoq's potential in Crohn's disease as well. We are on track for U.S. and EMA regulatory decisions in the first half of 2023. Global Humira sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 3.9% on an operational basis with 7.4% growth in the U.S., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 16.8% operationally due to biosimilar competition. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 9.9% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.4%. The U.S. performance continues to be impacted by an incrementally challenging CLL market, with new patient starts down approximately 20% relative to pre-COVID levels. Given the U.S. CLL market has been consistently lower than our expectation in the past several quarters, we are now reducing our view of the total size of the addressable patient population for this indication going forward. We also anticipate further share erosion following the recent unfavorable change to the NCCN guideline preference for Imbruvica in CLL, as well as increasing existing and new competition. These market and shared dynamics are expected to have a flow through impact on Imbruvica\u2019s 2023 performance.  Venclexta global sales were $550 million up 11.3% on an operational basis. Continued share gains across both approved indications are being partially offset by a softer CLL market in the U.S. and a higher foreign exchange impact on international revenues. As a result, we will be adjusting our full year sales guidance for Venclexta. Longer term, we anticipate our oncology portfolio will return a growth driven by several promising new products and indications such as epcoritamab for DLBCL, and follicular lymphoma, Venclexta new indications for multiple myeloma and high-risk MDs; navitoclax for myelofibrosis; and Teliso-V for nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer. We are beginning launch preparedness activities for several of these important opportunities and look forward to bringing new treatment options to patients. In neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.7 billion, up 8.3% on an operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of 554 million were up 20.2% on an operational basis reflecting continued market share momentum. We continue to anticipate the regulatory approval and the commercial launch of Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder this quarter, which would make Vraylar the only antipsychotic, as a dual partial agonist approved to treat the most common forms of depression, both bipolar I, and adjunctive, and DD. Within migraine, our market leading oral CGRP portfolio contribute $222 million in combined sales this quarter. Ubrelvy prescriptions increased high single digits sequentially while total revenues were unfavorably impacted by a one-time prior period accrual adjustment of $40 million related to patient access program costs. Excluding this one-time adjustment, Ubrelvy sales were up more than 20% versus the prior year. Qulipta revenues nearly doubled sequentially as we continue to make very good progress with commercial access. Potential label expansion in the U.S. as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine and new therapy approvals in Europe represent additional opportunities to support Qulipta's strong momentum. Botox Therapeutic is also performing very well with total sales of $699 million, up 10% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, which accounts for roughly 45% of our therapeutic sales, Botox remains a foundational preventative treatment, and the clear branded leader for existing as well as new patient starts. Lastly, our launch preparations are underway for ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's. We anticipate approval in the first half of next year and believe ABBV-951 has the potential to achieve peak sales in excess of $1 billion. So overall, I'm very pleased with the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D programs. Tom?\nTom Hudson: Thank you, Jeff. In the area of immunology, we had several important regulatory milestones since our last earnings call, receiving FDA approval for Rinvoq in non-radiographic axial SpA and positive CHMP opinion for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease. These developments demonstrate the continued progress we are making with a global indication expansion of our next-generation immunology assets. In the quarter, we also saw longer term data from our Phase 2 study for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, where strong responses and flare reductions continued through 48 weeks of treatment. Based on these results, we plan to advance Rinvoq development in this indication and will be discussing our Phase 3 program with regulatory agencies in the coming months. Now, I would like to provide a few updates on our earlier stage immunology pipeline. We recently began a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis for our RIPK1 inhibitor, ABBV-668. This small molecule inhibitor is designed to address chronic inflammatory diseases by preventing necroptosis and reducing TLR4-driven inflammation. This could be a differentiated approach that has a potential to provide significantly improved efficacy to patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. We look forward to providing updates as data mature. Turning now to ABBV-154, our anti-TNF steroid conjugate, which is being evaluated in multiple indications. We recently completed the primary analysis for the Phase 2 dose-ranging study in RA patients. The hypothesis for this program was that by delivering the steroid directly to the site of inflammation, you could drive higher rates of efficacy with limited or no effects of systemic steroid exposure. In this study, all doses of ABBV-154 met the primary endpoint of ACR50, as well as the majority of secondary endpoints at week 12. At the medium and high doses, ABBV-154 delivered ACR scores that are similar to Rinvoq or slightly better, which validates the platform's ability to drive high levels of efficacy. The safety profile for ABBV-154 was generally consistent with the safety profile for adalimumab. As part of our safety assessment in this study, we analyze metabolic parameters including cortisol levels. The data showed minor decreases in cortisol levels at the higher exposures, which are consistent with evidence of systemic steroid effects. Given the number of effective therapies available in RA and a more limited use of steroids in these patients, we do not plan to move forward in development for the RA indication. However, we continue to believe ABBV-154 has the potential to provide a benefit in other diseases such as PMR and Crohn's disease, where steroid use is part of the typical treatment paradigm. Our exploratory Phase 2 studies in these two indications are ongoing and we expect to see data from the PMR study in 2023 and from the Crohn's study in 2024. Also in the area of immunology, we recently made the decision to stop the clinical studies and discontinue development for ABBV-157, our ROR\u03b3t inverse agonist. This decision was made due to new findings observed in our preclinical chronic toxicology study. Moving now to our oncology portfolio where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline. We recently submitted our regulatory application in Europe and our partner, Genmab, submitted an application in the U.S. for epcoritamab in relapse-refractory large B-cell lymphoma. We're seeking accelerated approval based on the positive Phase 2 study results for epcoritamab in this indication where we saw very deep and durable responses in these highly refractory patients. We expect decisions in both U.S. and Europe in 2023. We are also nearing completion of the registrational studies for two additional key programs in our heme/onc portfolio; Venclexta in multiple myeloma; and navitoclax in myelofibrosis. We remain on track to see results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation near the end of this year. Following the event-driven data readout, we anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the first half of next year. For navitoclax, we remain on track to see data in the first half of next year from both the Phase 2 REFINE and the Phase 3 TRANSFORM-1 trials. Results from both studies will be included in our regulatory submissions, which we expect in the second half of 2023. Moving to neuroscience where we have applications under active review for several key assets. We anticipate a decision from the FDA in December for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. We believe Vraylar has a potential to be an important new therapy in this patient population and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients. We also expect a decision from the FDA in the first half of next year for a ABBV-951, our innovative, subcutaneous level levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. And in the area of migraine, we have regulatory applications under review in both the U.S. and Europe for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine with decisions expected in the first half of next year. If approved, this would be another differentiating future for Qulipta as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. This is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. And in eye care, our partner REGENXBIO recently announced positive interim data from the Phase 2, AAV8 dose escalation trial for RGX-314 using in-office, suprachoroidal delivery for the treatment of wet AMD. RGX-314 continues to be well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events, and a meaningful reduction in treatment burden was observed at six months across all dose levels. Two pivotal trials evaluating RGX-314 for wet AMD using subretinal delivery are active and enrolling patients. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing our programs this year and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the remainder of this year and into 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you, Tom. AbbVie\u2019s third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio. The continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq are helping offset the impact from higher inflation and the stronger U.S. dollar. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.02 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.8 billion, in line with our guidance and up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 53.4% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 85.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.8% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense up 20.9% of sales. Net interest expense was $497 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.9%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are narrowing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $13.84 and $13.88. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $58.2 billion, reflecting growth of 5.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated assumptions. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong market share performance. For Venclexta, we now expect global revenue of approximately $2 billion, based on a lower market outlook in CLL and unfavorable foreign exchange. For Aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, given the impact of higher inflation on near-term market growth and due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Moving to P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of approximately 85% of sales and forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 52% of sales. Turning to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.65 and $3.69. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie\u2019s strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of September was $11.8 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie\u2019s long-term outlook, today we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2023. And we remain on track to achieve $30 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year, bringing our net leverage ratio to 1.8 times. In closing, AbbVie\u2019s strong performance allows us to reaffirm earnings expectations in the face of economic pressure. And with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we\u2019ll take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just my question is really centered around Humira. And I know you \u2013 appreciate some of the access commentary you made at beginning of the call, but are there any surprises so far in these discussions as we think about where either rebates or price is settling out for Humira? And I\u2019m really sure I was trying to get my hands around, I think previously, you\u2019ve commented you expected U.S. Humira erosion to be down roughly 45%, plus or minus 10%. And I just was wondering if that range holds given what you know today about the negotiations? And if I could just do a quick follow up, second question, immunology. There was a European JAK update out this morning, and I just was wondering any impact you expect to the Rinvoq franchise for that? Just maybe some context about how relevant, I guess, Europe was as part of the mix? And does that label update kind of impact your outlook at all? Thanks so much.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay, Chris, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover part of that question, and then I\u2019ll have Jeff fill in on any additional commentary around the contracting. I think first, if we talk about the 45%, plus or minus 10%, that is the range that we gave. We\u2019re obviously working on doing the final forecasting for 2023. As we\u2019ve said in the past, there are two major components, which will play into that forecast. One is how are the biosimilars priced, that will certainly have some impact. We won\u2019t know that until we actually get into the market and start to see some of that activity. But the other big component is obviously our coverage, our access coverage for Humira and the position that Humira has on those formularies. I would say that negotiating by Jeff\u2019s team is going very well. As I mentioned in my comments, we\u2019re at about 80% of all covered lives now, and I would expect that to rise to a level that\u2019s above 90% as we move towards the end of the year. Once we have a final number there, it will allow us to do the final modeling for 2023, and that\u2019s at the point where we\u2019ll be able to refine that 45% plus or minus 10%. I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s going on track. I would say there\u2019s no surprises, and I\u2019d say I feel good about how the negotiations are going with all the major managed care organizations and PBMs. Jeff, anything you\u2019d add there?\nJeff Stewart: No. Just to confirm, Rick, that no real surprises in terms of where we\u2019ve been. And as we\u2019ve communicated before, our principles of co-existing over time with one or more biosimilars seems to be the way that the market will play out. And certainly, like we saw in Europe that we had the principle of \u2013 for patient continuity to concede pricing to maintain that patient access. So Chris, no major surprises that we\u2019ve seen so far.\nRick Gonzalez: And then do you want to talk about PRAC? You and Roopal, can talk about PRAC.\nJeff Stewart: Maybe, Roopal, you could address the procedure and where we are in the procedure, and I\u2019ll cover the commercial.\nRoopal Thakkar: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll give some context. So the next step here after PRAC would be moving to the CHMP here in November, and then the European Commission should finalize this. We expect December or January. So PRAC completed their review, and what we see in the labeling is an update in warnings, and this is related to outcomes of the oral surveillance study. And in particular, in Section 4.4, which is the warnings, there\u2019s a list of subgroups that were found to be at risk based on analysis from oral surveillance. For example, patients greater than equal to the age of 65, those that are at risk for cardiac events, smokers, for example. And in these patients, the use of JAK inhibitors would be after a consideration of other therapies, if I\u2019m paraphrasing, if no suitable alternatives. So this is consistent with the practice of medicine. It provides specific guidance, and we would say pragmatic at this stage.\nJeff Stewart: And Chris, to that point, I mean, this is largely consistent with what we see from oral surveillance and the Xeljanz label, which is widely sort of understood by the European physicians. And so to cut to the quick, we don\u2019t anticipate a material impact as this continues through the process.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. I was under the impression that we\u2019d get more granularity on Humira erosion this quarter, and you\u2019re saying that\u2019s really going to come in Q4. So, I\u2019m wondering did I kind of not hear it right before, or has something changed? And then second question is just on contracting in general, my understanding is that payer contracts, really not rock solid. They can be reopened when there\u2019s a change in the marketplace on things like pricing, in this case of biosimilars. So, when we do kind of get whatever next level of guidance we get from you, isn\u2019t that going to continue to remain fluid? Because market dynamics won\u2019t all play out as of January, we\u2019ll get to mid next year, you\u2019ll get more entrants, you\u2019ll know pricing better and that sort of thing? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Yes, Tim, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover that one. So, I think we\u2019ve talked a number of times on these calls about what we project in the third quarter call, and I believe what we said is that we would ultimately provide you an update on where we were in the process. And so that\u2019s what we attempted to do. I can\u2019t give you a number for 2023 until I know what the total access is, and not all those contracts are done yet. They\u2019re proceeding well, so I feel good about that. But until we actually know that the contract is solid and we know what that access looks like, we can\u2019t give you an accurate projection. And I understand the desire by the investment community. I understand what that number is, but I think you probably also understand that we want to give you the most accurate number that we can give you, and we don\u2019t want to give you a number that\u2019s not accurate. And so it is going to require us until we get to the fourth quarter call to provide that for you. You are correct, in a sense, about the way you describe how these contracts work. They can be reopened at some point in time. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s all that common usually, and in particular, I\u2019d say around this kind of a situation, you\u2019re going to anticipate what you think is going to happen in the second half of the year and try to position the contract in a way that it can ultimately deal with those changes going forward. But you are correct to say that they could reopen a contract if they chose to do that. There are various kinds of contracts that we use. In some cases, there are penalties or repercussions that would have to come into consideration if a contract got reopened at some point in time. They\u2019re not all like that, but many are like that. So it varies. And I\u2019d say generally speaking, your concept is valid. But I would say it\u2019s probably a little less fluid than the way you necessarily described it, particularly in this environment where we know there will be a number of biosimilars coming in. So you anticipate that we\u2019ve built the contracts around that set of assumptions. Jeff, anything you\u2019d add?\nJeff Stewart: No, I think, Tim, Rick described it in the right way. While there are typically, there are typically out clauses based on timing or other dynamics I think one of the considerations is obviously, as we\u2019ve highlighted before, most of the biosimilars are going to be coming in the second half of the year. So to some degree, that actually limits if it was a rare case. And they typically are rare where a contract is blown up or renegotiated in the middle of the year. That length of time that\u2019s left in 2023 for some of those payers to let\u2019s take a negative action puts some natural constraint on them in terms of when they would time that out. But Rick highlighted it very nicely in terms of the dynamics.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Great, thanks for taking my question. And maybe one more question on the contracting side. Could you help us understand if the pricing part of the contracts is something that you have a good handle on at this point? And then a follow-up question is that how do you think about the cadence of BD activity once you hit the mark of less than two times leveraged by end of the year? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Jeff, do you want to cover that?\nJeff Stewart: Yes, so look, in terms of what Rick had highlighted in terms of our confidence in projecting the 80%. Obviously, there\u2019s a couple components to that. So we have \u2013 while all the contracts aren\u2019t fully complete with the ones that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve done some significant modeling work to understand if we\u2019re retaining the ability to stay on the formulary. We would model our volume like how much would we retain versus would go to one or more biosimilars. That\u2019s something that we can understand. And we have made base case, both first half and second half pricing assumptions based on those contracts. Now what\u2019s been highlighted in the last couple of questions is there\u2019s still uncertainty on the rest of the contracts that are yet to been secured and also a bid on that second half price dynamic. So those are the elements that are going to give us more confidence as we go to the fourth quarter call to give everyone a secure number for next year.\nRick Gonzalez: This is Rick. I\u2019ll cover your business development question. I think if I step back and I look at where are we today. We have been for the last several years operating with an approach of roughly $2 billion to add incremental pieces to the business. We\u2019ve effectively used that over the last several years to be able to build some additional, particularly, I\u2019d say early stage pipeline assets to the company. We\u2019re continuing on that same approach right now. Now having said that, we obviously have paid down debt very rapidly. We will be in a position where if we chose to do something, we could do something. I\u2019d say if I look at the business today and I look at how it\u2019s performing around the expectations that we had for the business going forward, I would say there\u2019s no need for us to be able to do anything in that area. And I\u2019d go back to the original premise of what we described to the investment community of what we believed would happen when biosimilars entered the U.S. market for Humira. What we said was that we believe the bulk of the erosion would occur in 2023, some additional erosion in 2024, in 2025 and beyond. We would return to significant growth. We\u2019d be able to deliver high single digit growth from that point forward through the end of the decade. That\u2019s what we said. Everything I know about the business today would suggest to me that we are able to do just that. And we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re able to do that with the portfolio we have and the late-stage pipeline and additional indications that we have coming forward. Having said that, I can also tell you that, over the last 10 years, we\u2019ve demonstrated to ourselves and hopefully to you that we can acquire businesses and assets and we can integrate those and we can successfully drive those. And so if we found something that we thought was very important to add to the business, we certainly have the financial wherewithal and this business has tremendous cash flow. We could do that. I can tell you we don\u2019t see that right now. So I wouldn\u2019t assume that. And the other thing I\u2019d point out is, as an example, the most important thing, and I know everyone is focused on what that erosion curve is going to look like, including us, to be honest, but \u2013 and I know why. But probably the single most important thing for us going forward to hit what I described to you a moment ago is that underlying non Humira business growing at a rate that it can drive those expectations. And that\u2019s key and I\u2019d say there\u2019s two factors that are most important around that. The first is that Skyrizi and Rinvoq grow fast enough that they can more than offset that they can essentially grow through all of the erosion that occurs on Humira and deliver incremental performance of above and beyond that. And I feel highly confident in that. I mean, when you can look at the trajectories of those assets now in the early phase we\u2019re in right now in IBD and PSA. I would say, I have a very high level of confidence that they will perform at that level or well above that level. Then the second thing is all the other growth assets they have to be growing fast enough that they can get us to be able to grow at that rate that I described. And if you take this quarter as an example, and you look at the business without Humira, the underlying growth is about 6.5%. And remember that 6.5% is absorbing the economic impact we see in the aesthetics business and the market and competitive dynamics that we see in Imbruvica. So that\u2019s \u2013 that tells you that underlying growth is pretty strong. And so I think those are the important things that investors have to focus on. And the erosion curve is certainly one of those. And I\u2019m sensitive to the fact that you want to know when you\u2019re going to hit trough earnings, and I recognize that. And that\u2019s why we wanted to provide you some assurance of what that trough earnings is going to look like.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Rick, I appreciate your comments on 2023 and the aesthetics business. No, you don\u2019t want to give guidance. But I guess at a high level, do you think you can grow that franchise next year versus this year? And then on epcoritamab, congratulations on the filing there. Just wondering what you\u2019re expecting regarding the requirement for inpatient administration. J&J recently got approval of their bispecific and myeloma and looks like there\u2019s a requirement there for inpatient administration of the drug during the step up period. So just wondering how we should think about inpatient versus outpatient dosing of epco? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay, excellent. Thanks, Terence. I\u2019ll cover the first one. So if I look at the aesthetics business, we\u2019re clearly seeing this economic pressure in the U.S. And I would expect that we will see that to continue into 2023. Certainly, it\u2019s difficult to predict what will happen in the U.S., will it get worse? Will we go into a recession? Will it stay about the same? I\u2019d say, we\u2019re looking at this extremely carefully. But good news right now I would say is that the factors that we\u2019re looking at that seem to be driving this consumer confidence and behavior the most in the U.S., appeared to have stabilized at the levels that they\u2019re at. And so I would say that\u2019s a positive thing. Now it\u2019s fluid because obviously if the economic situation got worse in the U.S., my guess is they would trend down again. And so \u2013 but at least it appears right now that they\u2019ve stabilized and maybe even ticked up just a little bit, moved in a positive direction just a little bit. I think it\u2019s very difficult to predict. Here\u2019s what I would assume. I would assume that a significant part of 2023 we will have an impact on it. Now also recognize that we saw this phenomena as we said in the last call start in May. We weren\u2019t sure at the time whether it was the summer season starting a month early or it was the economic impact, because we had been watching the indicators and they trend down several months ahead of that. But we didn\u2019t see an impact until the month of May. So the point is, when we hit May and beyond, we\u2019re going to be lapping the impact. So the negative impact will be softened on the business. So we\u2019ll return to better growth rates no matter what just mathematically, right. So \u2013 but I think the best prediction we can have is it\u2019s going to have an impact in a good part of 2023. I think it\u2019s the best way for us to think about it. Now again, the rest of the business has an opportunity to be able to offset that as we saw in this quarter.\nRob Michael: And this is Rob. I would just add that if you think about more long term. If you think about what happened in 2008 and 2009, the business declined high single digits and then we saw, after that very robust growth in the mid-teen to the next decade. So given that penetration rates are still very low today. There\u2019s clearly ample opportunity to grow this market. I think once you get on the other side of the economic impact which we expect to be transient. We still expect as business to deliver long-term growth as Rick highlighted earlier, we\u2019re still on track for that. Long-term high single digit growth getting to greater than $9 billion by 2029. So we\u2019ll have to navigate, obviously, the short-term economic impact. But we still have tremendous confidence in the long-term outlook for aesthetics.\nRick Gonzalez: Epco?\nNeil Gallagher: Hey, this is Neil Gallagher. I will take the epco question. So the first thing I just want to caution, put a word of caution before I answer your question directly around inpatient stay, which is that the patient population that our competitors studied with the BCMA, CD3 is quite different in terms of overall benefit risk. So the indication that was granted was in fifth line plus multiple myeloma, which is very heavily pretreated and frail population. So to extrapolate any interpretation of benefit risk from that population into the relapsed/refractory DLBCL population that we have studied and filed for with epcoritamab would not be valid, so just a word of caution there. That said the study that we have filed had required for a 24-hour patient stay overnight \u2013 one overnight stay. However, in subsequent studies we are aiming to remove that requirements so patients would not require \u2013 be required to remain overnight. And we do believe because of the emergent and stable overall benefit risk for epcoritamab, a couple of things that we believe that it has the potential to be best-in-class, and we also believe that our strategy to remove overnight stays is a very valid one and reasonable one to pursue. Hope that answered your question.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Terence. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citigroup Global.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. A couple of questions please. First on in Imbruvica, I'm assuming that Imbruvica is going to be included in the Top 10 CMS lists for price negotiation under Medicare next year. Assuming that's correct what do you think about the impact on net pricing from Imbruvica. Do you anticipate pricing \u2013 net pricing coming under pressure prior to 2026, given the contracting that's expecting to take place among your competitors to secure favorable positions given their catastrophic coverage burden on PBMs post the IRA implementation? So is the impact going to get brought forward for the class including for Imbruvica before you actually get the price cut coming? And then then seconds with epcoritamab, there's been some interesting data on the importance of profound B-cell depletion in lupus using CAR T assets, as CD20 bispecific could get to a similar level. I'm wondering whether you have interest in pivoting epcoritamab and exploring it in refractory lupus as one of your competitors already is particularly given you have a subcu administration, which obviously has some advantages? Thank you.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Hi Andrew, it's Jeff. I'll take your \u2013 I'll take your first question. So when we \u2013 obviously we're still studying very carefully the IRA and we're also discussing directly with CMS not just through pharma, but our own company in terms of how they're going to basically select the different drugs that will be negotiated. That's a little bit unclear at this point. It's not unreasonable based on the size of Imbruvica to suspect it will be one of the earlier drugs that could potentially be negotiated, so just to clear that. In terms of what may take place before that potential negotiation in 2026, I would expect to see some modest changes in rebate. We see very small levels at this point now but we do have a third competitor coming. So that would be something that we would continue to plan \u2013 to plan for as we move into that potential event.\nTom Hudson: Yes. This is Tom. Maybe I'll answer the lupus question. First, I'll say it's actually was very exciting to see that paper showing that B-cell depletion can actually put patients with very severe lupus in remission. It's a very small study. Some five patients, but everyone's looking at this as a, even with is a surprise because we used to think we had to affect many mechanisms themselves in lupus. So that was one of the reasons it's so difficult. I used to be part of a lupus clinic in Montreal, so I know the challenges with patients. So what we're looking at right now is we're asking yes, the answer to your question is can we use our existing assets and collaborations to see if we can do B-cell depletion, for as a treatment for lupus? The answer is yes. And the type of questions we're asking ourselves is, do we have to have as deeper depletion as we have with in heme malignancies? Nobody knows the answer. That might be important because if you have to have a very deep depletion it might be restricted more to more of the severe patients and again that would be an advantage. But if we want to go to all lupus patients because not all lupus patients are, are flaring all the time. The majority have a normal life. Go to the clinic once a year and just see their physicians when they have flares. So going to a very deep regimen for B-cell depletion might be deemed to too severe. So the questions is yes we're looking at it and trying to figure out what's the right regimen and how to approach that in lupus is very exciting questions, which we're obviously looking into.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Andrew. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. What is your level of confidence in a positive outcome for Vraylar in MDD at the end of the year? I imagine the review is well along, so you probably have good visibility. So for instance our labeling discussions underway, is the sales force being trained, et cetera. This is a very large opportunity that does not seem to be a point of external focus as far as I could tell. So I'm wondering what you could tell us about how things are going? Thank you,\nRoopal Thakkar: Hi, it's Roopal. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll go and then Jeff can talk about the opportunity. You're correct, the review is proceeding per our expectations. We have two positive studies in the space. I mean, recall, we also have the same endpoint \u2013 the depression endpoint that's read out in three other bipolar depression studies that are already within label. So there's quite a bit of evidence that's already been generated, that's in front of the agency now. So I would say it's proceeding well and we still anticipate a decision by year end. And I'll pass it to Jeff.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Steve, and just in terms of your salesforce question, I mean, we are very encouraged and excited about this potential approval. I mean, obviously we continue to gain share week-by-week sequentially for our base indication \u2013 the bipolar indications. And we know that based on the profile that we have with Vraylar. So very, very strong efficacy \u2013 proven efficacy of a very good tolerability profile for an antipsychotic, no material weight gain, low metabolic effects, and I think importantly maybe not as appreciated it's, there's no titration. You have a very simple starting dose of 1.5 milligrams. So as we do our research, we see that that profile is very strong as this potential add-on therapy and depression. In the last decade there's been only one drug that's been approved for this indication and that's Rexulti, and we think that's a branded drug, obviously, and we think we can compete very, very well. So we have a big existing sales force and infrastructure. We are gearing up in terms of training. We have the established relationships across the big primary care doctors as well as the psychiatrist. So we are \u2013 we agree with your approach. That's a meaningful commercial opportunity that could evolve very quickly here once we get the approval.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets.\nGary Nachman: Thanks. Good morning. First could you just provide some more color on how much of a benefit you're seeing for Skyrizi and Rinvoq and IBD? As you've been spending more time with the GIs, and have your outlooks changed on a potential there as major contributors to the long-term growth for those franchises? So were both of those being used in the treatment paradigms for the respective indications in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis? So that's one. And then secondly, just OpEx came in much lower than we expected, so you seem to be getting better operating leverage than what you originally guided. Are there areas where you've scaled back in spending, whether in Aesthetics or heme/onc if there's pressures there? And how will you be thinking about that into the Humira LOE next year? So how much additional flexibility might you have on the spending side? Thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Yes. I'll take the IBD question. I think we've mentioned before that the IBD has been a very important part of our long range plan and when we gave the 2025 guidance, it looks relatively small because they're just ramping down. I would say that as AbbVie we are very, very encouraged. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks on the launch, and maybe I'll start with what we're hearing from the gastroenterologists. I think first is they, they look at both assets and the global guidelines, the impressions and the clinical approach that we hear from the top leaders and also the community gastros is this idea over \u2013 I have to start to think about endoscopic healing, higher basically rates of efficacy and more significant clarity on what it's doing in the bowel versus just symptoms. And that seems straightforward, but we see the market moving very, very fast there in terms of understanding and that's what we can deliver, whether it's the Skyrizi data on the endoscopic healing rates with a very, very convenient and strong safety profile, or similar on the Rinvoq side in second line in the U.S. second line for patients that aren't doing well in UC. So we see rapid adoption already as I mentioned, that in the Rinvoq in the United States will be a second line plus based on the label. And we see very, very fast adoption. I'll give you some color on it. Xeljanz had been approved and is approved in UC in the United States, but basically it had very low adoption. We're seeing now in the community that 70% of the prescriptions are coming from physicians that have never written a JAK before. So it shows you that the clinical profile of Rinvoq in terms of its speed and the depth of the response is being viewed very, very well. So not only is that encouraging for Rinvoq, you see as I mentioned we're going to have the approval for Crohn's for Rinvoq in later lines next year as well. Skyrizi continues to surprise us to the upside, as you've heard from the call today. This is viewed increasingly as the preferred frontline drug coming straight out of the gate for Crohn's in the U.S. And the qualitative data that we're starting to see, and we are seeing some quantitative data that looks very strong, too, is that this is viewed as a already as a best-in-class product for Crohn\u2019s, which is a very, very substantial market. So we are very encouraged. We continue to say that the IBD is probably underappreciated, and we\u2019ll continue to give updates as these launches progress.\nRob Michael: So Gary, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take your question on OpEx. If you look at the benefit we\u2019re seeing, about half of it is actually coming from the stronger U.S. dollar, so it\u2019s more of an FX impact. The other half is spend productivity. We always look for opportunities to drive more productivity in our spend. It\u2019s not so much about scaling back in parts of the business, we always look for ways to spend better, buy better. And ultimately, that helps us. In many cases also, over the long-term, redeploy that investment to drive growth. If you think about 2023, I\u2019ve said \u2013 given that 46% to 47% operating margin directional input. I\u2019ve also said we\u2019re not going to cut back investment. We\u2019ll obviously be prudent given that you will see a decline in gross margins next year, but we\u2019re not going to be cutting back investment because we expect to return to growth quickly. So you\u2019ll see us not necessarily cut back, but certainly put more behind this business to drive that long-term growth that we expect to be industry-leading over the long term.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Gary. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS.\nColin Bristow: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So first on CF, you recently posted an updated clinical trials for your new C2 corrector-based regimen. I just wondered if you could walk us through what gives you confidence that this has a higher probability of success versus your last deterioration? And then second one for Rick, I just wanted to touch base on your succession plan. It\u2019s been an increasingly sort of important or a frequent topic with investors. You\u2019ve been the architect of AbbVie\u2019s success inception, and so just wanted to confirm specifically how long you expect to stay in the seat? And then how should we think about the time lines around the process of identifying your successor? Thank you.\nTom Hudson: Well, this is Tom, I\u2019ll answer the CF question. Again, this is very challenging to actually make that abnormal CF protein get to the membrane and act as a chloride channel, and it takes three different drugs to make it effectively to get it to the cell membrane and open up in the right way. And so we all felt that we had \u2013 intakes we call them Corrector 1, Corrector 2 and Potentiator, these three different compounds. We always see good results with double our C1 corrector. We think it\u2019s best-in-class. Our potentiator is very good. What we had difficulty is to get a good C2 corrector, and what I presented earlier this year was that it wasn\u2019t good enough. But what we\u2019ve done since then, we will continue to look at better ones and we came out with a differentiated product, 576 [ph], which is structurally different and the data supports higher safety margin, higher exposures, good PK. Hopefully, a single pill. And then we\u2019d be able to get to this \u2013 to be able to have this triplet which is really important to be competitive. So again, our doublet, the data we had was very strong. But we need that third piece, and that third piece seems to be coming along really well. That\u2019s what you really saw on the website at ct.gov is moving to evaluate this triple combo with our new C2 corrector.\nRick Gonzalez: And this is Rick on the succession question. I\u2019d say that, we obviously have a very experienced Board, and we\u2019ve had an active approach on succession going back to about 2016, 2017. And that process has proceeded extremely well in developing internal candidates to ultimately assume the role when I do retire. I can tell you that there are no plans at all for me to retire in 2023. The most important thing to me and to the Board is to make sure that the business is performing exactly as we expect going forward, and we\u2019re not going to make any transition until we\u2019ve gone through the biosimilar event, and we\u2019re confident in the performance of the overall business. That would be the appropriate time once we\u2019re confident to make a transition at that point. We\u2019ve also had discussions with the Board of what that transition would look like. And assuming it\u2019s an internal candidate, the transition will essentially work where we will name a new CEO. And at that point, I will assume the role of Executive Chair for a period of time thereafter. So I think we have a well-thought-out succession approach. I feel very comfortable with the approach, I feel comfortable with the work we\u2019re doing to develop the internal candidates. And I think the transition when it occurs, I think, will go smoothly and be successful. So hopefully, that answers your question.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Colin. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.\nLiz Shea: Chris, are you there? We can\u2019t hear you.\nOperator: Please check your mute feature, Chris?\nChris Shibutani: Yes, apologies. Two questions, if I may. On Rinvoq, you had previously commented that you were seeing some use in the first-line setting. Can you update us at all with any color there? Secondly, for Skyrizi, obviously, a very attractive market and an opportunity in Crohn\u2019s disease. Can you show us how you\u2019re thinking about the potential impact given the LOE in 2023 of a major branded players, STELARA? Thank you.\nJeff Stewart: Chris, it\u2019s Jeff. Just to clarify in terms of your Rinvoq question, was there a specific question related to a certain indication on the front line? Or I\u2019m not sure I fully appreciate that one.\nChris Shibutani: Yes, no. In AD.\nJeff Stewart: In AD, okay, right. So yes, we do see frontline use across the globe and even in the U.S. And what we\u2019re seeing is now, as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re seeing in-line in-play share, which is in the high mid-teens right now in the U.S., and it\u2019s higher in the international markets. So there seems to be, as we look to the research and we look to our market \u2013 end market performance, there\u2019s really two segments of dermatologists. There\u2019s very cautious dermatologists that are slow to adopt JAKs, and typically, they\u2019ll start in the later line, a second line plus. There is an emerging cohort of a significant group of dermatologists as well that basically are looking at the underlying high efficacy parameters, so basically like the EZ90 skin clearance and almost no discernible itch for the product. They typically are starting to use more and more in the frontline. So the overall balance is leaning towards the second line, but we do see increasing frontline utilization based on the profile of the drug in atopic dermatitis. In terms of the Skyrizi for Crohn\u2019s, we think we\u2019re very, very well positioned for a couple of reasons. One is the overall profile of the medicine is really exceptional, as I\u2019ve highlighted, and we\u2019re going to see very, very rapid adoption both in the U.S. and the external market. In addition, we have anticipated the STELARA LOE. We see that we have an ongoing head-to-head trial versus STELARA to make sure that we can continue to differentiate with direct data that will come over the next year or so, so we\u2019re anticipating that. And we think we\u2019re going to have a good setup to maintain the early momentum that we\u2019re seeing with Skyrizi.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just have one quick one. Rick, lots of questions on Humira for next year, but I wanted to ask at a high level environment beyond that. I know there are formal treatment guidelines in I&I, but what\u2019s the risk that payers mandate cycling through one or more biosimilars? And what\u2019s the risk \u2013 the pricing environment doesn\u2019t really recover in 2024 and beyond? Just obviously thinking about the Skyrizi and Rinvoq franchises over the long term? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: So I\u2019m actually going to have Jeff walk you through that. He\u2019s probably the closest to that environment.\nJeff Stewart: Yes, so thank you for the question. I mean, one of the things that we see certainly in the near term is that the formularies in I&I are actually expanding. So many years ago, you might have six or seven preferred agents. The payers are now requesting sometimes up to 11 or 12 preferred agents, so you\u2019re seeing an expansive nature in the short term. Now as you go forward, maybe middle of the decade or later where you have more and more biosimilars, could the U.S. environment move towards sort of a step through? I mean, it\u2019s possible. But we have, again, as I mentioned in my last statement, we have anticipated that with the right types of data, the trials. We have five head-to-head studies in Skyrizi in psoriasis; we have more coming in Crohn\u2019s. And so we think that basically, we have a data-driven approach that\u2019s going to continue to allow us to significantly differentiate our products. The other dynamic that we watch very carefully, and we talked about this during the Immunology Investor Day, is the lines of therapy as there\u2019s more and more high efficacy products that get introduced, continue to expand. So in the middle of the decade or longer, the second plus and the third line markets are going to be very, very significant at that point. So when we put all of that into the calculus we feel again, we have a pretty set up for the middle of the decade and longer.\nRick Gonzalez: And this is Rick. I agree with everything Jeff said. The one thing I would add that as you think about even under a scenario where if we did get to some kind of a step at it, you have to go back and remember that most of these mechanisms, most patients fail, and they fail at a relatively high level and over a relatively short period of time. So even if you had to rotate through you\u2019re going to get to second line relatively quickly, and recycling somebody back through another TNF typically doesn\u2019t work very well for those patients. And I\u2019d say the domain now with the kind of agents that we have in the market now and the level of remission that they can create, the demand among physicians is much higher to get patients into remission as rapidly as they possibly can. And so I think all those dynamics tell us that this model should continue to work over the long-haul.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. I believe we have taken all the questions in the queue, so that concludes today\u2019s conference call. If you\u2019d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our overall performance then Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our third quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie continues to perform very well, a testament to the strength of our broad, diversified portfolio. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our immunology assets, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenues of $14.8 billion were up 5.4% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. Immunology once again demonstrated impressive results with Skyrizi and Rinvoq now on pace to deliver more than $7.5 billion in combined sales this year, well ahead of our initial expectations. This performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we're in the early launch phase for both assets in IBD and PSA, as well as Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories across existing and new indications, giving us a high degree of confidence in the collective potential of these two assets to ultimately exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira, achieving the strategic objective we had for replacing Humira. We also saw a continued strong double-digit operational sales growth from several additional key products, including Botox Cosmetic, Vraylar, Venclexta and Botox Therapeutic. This strong momentum is helping us offset some of the interim economic pressure we now see in our Aesthetics portfolio. Based on these results, we remain confident in the outlook of our business and are reaffirming the midpoint of our full year 2022 EPS guidance at $13.86, which represents strong double-digit growth. As many of you are aware, we have a leading consumer-facing aesthetics portfolio, which is largely cash pay. We have been monitoring the global economic situation. Based on all the data we have been observing, especially in the U.S. with both the consumer confidence index and real personal consumption expenditures trending down and continued high inflation, these factors are putting pressure on consumers' discretionary spending. This metric correlates with a slowdown in treatment procedures that we're seeing across the aesthetics markets, impacting the growth rates for toxins, fillers and body contouring. While our U.S. aesthetics market share remains stable across both toxins and fillers, we now believe it's prudent to adjust our full year aesthetics forecast to reflect the moderating market growth over the near to medium term, which is expected to predominantly impact Juvederm as well as our body contouring portfolio products, which represent higher price points for consumers. While it's difficult to predict the duration of these economic dynamics, we expect these conditions to persist into 2023. As consumer confidence improves, we would once again expect the market growth to accelerate. Our aesthetics portfolio experienced a rapid and sustained recovery following the 2008-2009 recession, so we anticipate any impact will be transient. Over the long-term, the aesthetics business continues to be an extremely attractive, underpenetrated market with significant growth potential. The current market dynamics do not change our long-term guidance for aesthetics and we remain confident in our ability to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. I also want to provide a brief update on the outlook for 2023. With regards to the status of contracting for Humira, our intent has always been to maintain broad formulary access so that we can compete effectively with forthcoming biosimilars. We are making very good progress consistent with this objective, and are currently projecting formulary access for at least 80% of all U.S. covered lives. We expect this percentage to increase further as we conclude additional contract discussions between now and the end of the year. As a result, we anticipate strong access for U.S. Humira throughout 2023, and project biosimilars will share access as they become available. We will provide sales guidance for Humira on our fourth quarter call. While we're not issuing 2023 guidance today, it is important to note that when we issue our EPS outlook, we expect the lower end of the range to represent for earnings. So while it's possible 2023 could outperform our guidance regardless of the shape of the erosion curve, we don't anticipate 2024 earnings will be lower than the initial 2023 EPS guidance given the momentum and growth from another year of our ex-Humira portfolio, which is expected to more than offset any incremental Humira erosion in 2024. We know that many investors have an interest in the timing of AbbVie's trough earnings, whether that would be 2023 or 2024. The guidance range will provide and give investors additional clarity regarding our expectations for the company's core EPS.  In summary, we continue to deliver strong results and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. To that end, as noted in our news release, today we're announcing a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.41 per share to $1.48 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2023. Since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 270%. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Okay, Chris, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover part of that question, and then I\u2019ll have Jeff fill in on any additional commentary around the contracting. I think first, if we talk about the 45%, plus or minus 10%, that is the range that we gave. We\u2019re obviously working on doing the final forecasting for 2023. As we\u2019ve said in the past, there are two major components, which will play into that forecast. One is how are the biosimilars priced, that will certainly have some impact. We won\u2019t know that until we actually get into the market and start to see some of that activity. But the other big component is obviously our coverage, our access coverage for Humira and the position that Humira has on those formularies. I would say that negotiating by Jeff\u2019s team is going very well. As I mentioned in my comments, we\u2019re at about 80% of all covered lives now, and I would expect that to rise to a level that\u2019s above 90% as we move towards the end of the year. Once we have a final number there, it will allow us to do the final modeling for 2023, and that\u2019s at the point where we\u2019ll be able to refine that 45% plus or minus 10%. I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s going on track. I would say there\u2019s no surprises, and I\u2019d say I feel good about how the negotiations are going with all the major managed care organizations and PBMs. Jeff, anything you\u2019d add there? And then do you want to talk about PRAC? You and Roopal, can talk about PRAC. Yes, Tim, this is Rick. I\u2019ll cover that one. So, I think we\u2019ve talked a number of times on these calls about what we project in the third quarter call, and I believe what we said is that we would ultimately provide you an update on where we were in the process. And so that\u2019s what we attempted to do. I can\u2019t give you a number for 2023 until I know what the total access is, and not all those contracts are done yet. They\u2019re proceeding well, so I feel good about that. But until we actually know that the contract is solid and we know what that access looks like, we can\u2019t give you an accurate projection. And I understand the desire by the investment community. I understand what that number is, but I think you probably also understand that we want to give you the most accurate number that we can give you, and we don\u2019t want to give you a number that\u2019s not accurate. And so it is going to require us until we get to the fourth quarter call to provide that for you. You are correct, in a sense, about the way you describe how these contracts work. They can be reopened at some point in time. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s all that common usually, and in particular, I\u2019d say around this kind of a situation, you\u2019re going to anticipate what you think is going to happen in the second half of the year and try to position the contract in a way that it can ultimately deal with those changes going forward. But you are correct to say that they could reopen a contract if they chose to do that. There are various kinds of contracts that we use. In some cases, there are penalties or repercussions that would have to come into consideration if a contract got reopened at some point in time. They\u2019re not all like that, but many are like that. So it varies. And I\u2019d say generally speaking, your concept is valid. But I would say it\u2019s probably a little less fluid than the way you necessarily described it, particularly in this environment where we know there will be a number of biosimilars coming in. So you anticipate that we\u2019ve built the contracts around that set of assumptions. Jeff, anything you\u2019d add? Jeff, do you want to cover that? This is Rick. I\u2019ll cover your business development question. I think if I step back and I look at where are we today. We have been for the last several years operating with an approach of roughly $2 billion to add incremental pieces to the business. We\u2019ve effectively used that over the last several years to be able to build some additional, particularly, I\u2019d say early stage pipeline assets to the company. We\u2019re continuing on that same approach right now. Now having said that, we obviously have paid down debt very rapidly. We will be in a position where if we chose to do something, we could do something. I\u2019d say if I look at the business today and I look at how it\u2019s performing around the expectations that we had for the business going forward, I would say there\u2019s no need for us to be able to do anything in that area. And I\u2019d go back to the original premise of what we described to the investment community of what we believed would happen when biosimilars entered the U.S. market for Humira. What we said was that we believe the bulk of the erosion would occur in 2023, some additional erosion in 2024, in 2025 and beyond. We would return to significant growth. We\u2019d be able to deliver high single digit growth from that point forward through the end of the decade. That\u2019s what we said. Everything I know about the business today would suggest to me that we are able to do just that. And we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re able to do that with the portfolio we have and the late-stage pipeline and additional indications that we have coming forward. Having said that, I can also tell you that, over the last 10 years, we\u2019ve demonstrated to ourselves and hopefully to you that we can acquire businesses and assets and we can integrate those and we can successfully drive those. And so if we found something that we thought was very important to add to the business, we certainly have the financial wherewithal and this business has tremendous cash flow. We could do that. I can tell you we don\u2019t see that right now. So I wouldn\u2019t assume that. And the other thing I\u2019d point out is, as an example, the most important thing, and I know everyone is focused on what that erosion curve is going to look like, including us, to be honest, but \u2013 and I know why. But probably the single most important thing for us going forward to hit what I described to you a moment ago is that underlying non Humira business growing at a rate that it can drive those expectations. And that\u2019s key and I\u2019d say there\u2019s two factors that are most important around that. The first is that Skyrizi and Rinvoq grow fast enough that they can more than offset that they can essentially grow through all of the erosion that occurs on Humira and deliver incremental performance of above and beyond that. And I feel highly confident in that. I mean, when you can look at the trajectories of those assets now in the early phase we\u2019re in right now in IBD and PSA. I would say, I have a very high level of confidence that they will perform at that level or well above that level. Then the second thing is all the other growth assets they have to be growing fast enough that they can get us to be able to grow at that rate that I described. And if you take this quarter as an example, and you look at the business without Humira, the underlying growth is about 6.5%. And remember that 6.5% is absorbing the economic impact we see in the aesthetics business and the market and competitive dynamics that we see in Imbruvica. So that\u2019s \u2013 that tells you that underlying growth is pretty strong. And so I think those are the important things that investors have to focus on. And the erosion curve is certainly one of those. And I\u2019m sensitive to the fact that you want to know when you\u2019re going to hit trough earnings, and I recognize that. And that\u2019s why we wanted to provide you some assurance of what that trough earnings is going to look like. Okay, excellent. Thanks, Terence. I\u2019ll cover the first one. So if I look at the aesthetics business, we\u2019re clearly seeing this economic pressure in the U.S. And I would expect that we will see that to continue into 2023. Certainly, it\u2019s difficult to predict what will happen in the U.S., will it get worse? Will we go into a recession? Will it stay about the same? I\u2019d say, we\u2019re looking at this extremely carefully. But good news right now I would say is that the factors that we\u2019re looking at that seem to be driving this consumer confidence and behavior the most in the U.S., appeared to have stabilized at the levels that they\u2019re at. And so I would say that\u2019s a positive thing. Now it\u2019s fluid because obviously if the economic situation got worse in the U.S., my guess is they would trend down again. And so \u2013 but at least it appears right now that they\u2019ve stabilized and maybe even ticked up just a little bit, moved in a positive direction just a little bit. I think it\u2019s very difficult to predict. Here\u2019s what I would assume. I would assume that a significant part of 2023 we will have an impact on it. Now also recognize that we saw this phenomena as we said in the last call start in May. We weren\u2019t sure at the time whether it was the summer season starting a month early or it was the economic impact, because we had been watching the indicators and they trend down several months ahead of that. But we didn\u2019t see an impact until the month of May. So the point is, when we hit May and beyond, we\u2019re going to be lapping the impact. So the negative impact will be softened on the business. So we\u2019ll return to better growth rates no matter what just mathematically, right. So \u2013 but I think the best prediction we can have is it\u2019s going to have an impact in a good part of 2023. I think it\u2019s the best way for us to think about it. Now again, the rest of the business has an opportunity to be able to offset that as we saw in this quarter. Epco? Jeff? And this is Rick on the succession question. I\u2019d say that, we obviously have a very experienced Board, and we\u2019ve had an active approach on succession going back to about 2016, 2017. And that process has proceeded extremely well in developing internal candidates to ultimately assume the role when I do retire. I can tell you that there are no plans at all for me to retire in 2023. The most important thing to me and to the Board is to make sure that the business is performing exactly as we expect going forward, and we\u2019re not going to make any transition until we\u2019ve gone through the biosimilar event, and we\u2019re confident in the performance of the overall business. That would be the appropriate time once we\u2019re confident to make a transition at that point. We\u2019ve also had discussions with the Board of what that transition would look like. And assuming it\u2019s an internal candidate, the transition will essentially work where we will name a new CEO. And at that point, I will assume the role of Executive Chair for a period of time thereafter. So I think we have a well-thought-out succession approach. I feel very comfortable with the approach, I feel comfortable with the work we\u2019re doing to develop the internal candidates. And I think the transition when it occurs, I think, will go smoothly and be successful. So hopefully, that answers your question. So I\u2019m actually going to have Jeff walk you through that. He\u2019s probably the closest to that environment. And this is Rick. I agree with everything Jeff said. The one thing I would add that as you think about even under a scenario where if we did get to some kind of a step at it, you have to go back and remember that most of these mechanisms, most patients fail, and they fail at a relatively high level and over a relatively short period of time.

And so I think all those dynamics tell us that this model should continue to work over the long-haul."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll give some context. So the next step here after PRAC would be moving to the CHMP here in November, and then the European Commission should finalize this. We expect December or January. So PRAC completed their review, and what we see in the labeling is an update in warnings, and this is related to outcomes of the oral surveillance study. And in particular, in Section 4.4, which is the warnings, there\u2019s a list of subgroups that were found to be at risk based on analysis from oral surveillance. For example, patients greater than equal to the age of 65, those that are at risk for cardiac events, smokers, for example. And in these patients, the use of JAK inhibitors would be after a consideration of other therapies, if I\u2019m paraphrasing, if no suitable alternatives. So this is consistent with the practice of medicine. It provides specific guidance, and we would say pragmatic at this stage. Hi, it's Roopal. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll go and then Jeff can talk about the opportunity. You're correct, the review is proceeding per our expectations. We have two positive studies in the space. I mean, recall, we also have the same endpoint \u2013 the depression endpoint that's read out in three other bipolar depression studies that are already within label. So there's quite a bit of evidence that's already been generated, that's in front of the agency now. So I would say it's proceeding well and we still anticipate a decision by year end. And I'll pass it to Jeff."

So the first thing I just want to caution, put a word of caution before I answer your question directly around inpatient stay, which is that the patient population that our competitors studied with the BCMA, CD3 is quite different in terms of overall benefit risk. So the indication that was granted was in fifth line plus multiple myeloma, which is very heavily pretreated and frail population. So to extrapolate any interpretation of benefit risk from that population into the relapsed/refractory DLBCL population that we have studied and filed for with epcoritamab would not be valid, so just a word of caution there. That said the study that we have filed had required for a 24-hour patient stay overnight \u2013 one overnight stay. However, in subsequent studies we are aiming to remove that requirements so patients would not require \u2013 be required to remain overnight. And we do believe because of the emergent and stable overall benefit risk for epcoritamab, a couple of things that we believe that it has the potential to be best-in-class, and we also believe that our strategy to remove overnight stays is a very valid one and reasonable one to pursue. Hope that answered your question."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. In the area of immunology, we had several important regulatory milestones since our last earnings call, receiving FDA approval for Rinvoq in non-radiographic axial SpA and positive CHMP opinion for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease. These developments demonstrate the continued progress we are making with a global indication expansion of our next-generation immunology assets. In the quarter, we also saw longer term data from our Phase 2 study for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, where strong responses and flare reductions continued through 48 weeks of treatment. Based on these results, we plan to advance Rinvoq development in this indication and will be discussing our Phase 3 program with regulatory agencies in the coming months. Now, I would like to provide a few updates on our earlier stage immunology pipeline. We recently began a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis for our RIPK1 inhibitor, ABBV-668. This small molecule inhibitor is designed to address chronic inflammatory diseases by preventing necroptosis and reducing TLR4-driven inflammation. This could be a differentiated approach that has a potential to provide significantly improved efficacy to patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. We look forward to providing updates as data mature. Turning now to ABBV-154, our anti-TNF steroid conjugate, which is being evaluated in multiple indications. We recently completed the primary analysis for the Phase 2 dose-ranging study in RA patients. The hypothesis for this program was that by delivering the steroid directly to the site of inflammation, you could drive higher rates of efficacy with limited or no effects of systemic steroid exposure. In this study, all doses of ABBV-154 met the primary endpoint of ACR50, as well as the majority of secondary endpoints at week 12. At the medium and high doses, ABBV-154 delivered ACR scores that are similar to Rinvoq or slightly better, which validates the platform's ability to drive high levels of efficacy. The safety profile for ABBV-154 was generally consistent with the safety profile for adalimumab. As part of our safety assessment in this study, we analyze metabolic parameters including cortisol levels. The data showed minor decreases in cortisol levels at the higher exposures, which are consistent with evidence of systemic steroid effects. Given the number of effective therapies available in RA and a more limited use of steroids in these patients, we do not plan to move forward in development for the RA indication. However, we continue to believe ABBV-154 has the potential to provide a benefit in other diseases such as PMR and Crohn's disease, where steroid use is part of the typical treatment paradigm. Our exploratory Phase 2 studies in these two indications are ongoing and we expect to see data from the PMR study in 2023 and from the Crohn's study in 2024. Also in the area of immunology, we recently made the decision to stop the clinical studies and discontinue development for ABBV-157, our ROR\u03b3t inverse agonist. This decision was made due to new findings observed in our preclinical chronic toxicology study. Moving now to our oncology portfolio where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline. We recently submitted our regulatory application in Europe and our partner, Genmab, submitted an application in the U.S. for epcoritamab in relapse-refractory large B-cell lymphoma. We're seeking accelerated approval based on the positive Phase 2 study results for epcoritamab in this indication where we saw very deep and durable responses in these highly refractory patients. We expect decisions in both U.S. and Europe in 2023. We are also nearing completion of the registrational studies for two additional key programs in our heme/onc portfolio; Venclexta in multiple myeloma; and navitoclax in myelofibrosis. We remain on track to see results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation near the end of this year. Following the event-driven data readout, we anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the first half of next year. For navitoclax, we remain on track to see data in the first half of next year from both the Phase 2 REFINE and the Phase 3 TRANSFORM-1 trials. Results from both studies will be included in our regulatory submissions, which we expect in the second half of 2023. Moving to neuroscience where we have applications under active review for several key assets. We anticipate a decision from the FDA in December for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. We believe Vraylar has a potential to be an important new therapy in this patient population and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients. We also expect a decision from the FDA in the first half of next year for a ABBV-951, our innovative, subcutaneous level levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. And in the area of migraine, we have regulatory applications under review in both the U.S. and Europe for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine with decisions expected in the first half of next year. If approved, this would be another differentiating future for Qulipta as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. This is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. And in eye care, our partner REGENXBIO recently announced positive interim data from the Phase 2, AAV8 dose escalation trial for RGX-314 using in-office, suprachoroidal delivery for the treatment of wet AMD. RGX-314 continues to be well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events, and a meaningful reduction in treatment burden was observed at six months across all dose levels. Two pivotal trials evaluating RGX-314 for wet AMD using subretinal delivery are active and enrolling patients. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing our programs this year and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the remainder of this year and into 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? Yes. This is Tom. Maybe I'll answer the lupus question. First, I'll say it's actually was very exciting to see that paper showing that B-cell depletion can actually put patients with very severe lupus in remission. It's a very small study. Some five patients, but everyone's looking at this as a, even with is a surprise because we used to think we had to affect many mechanisms themselves in lupus. So that was one of the reasons it's so difficult. I used to be part of a lupus clinic in Montreal, so I know the challenges with patients. So what we're looking at right now is we're asking yes, the answer to your question is can we use our existing assets and collaborations to see if we can do B-cell depletion, for as a treatment for lupus? The answer is yes. And the type of questions we're asking ourselves is, do we have to have as deeper depletion as we have with in heme malignancies? Nobody knows the answer. That might be important because if you have to have a very deep depletion it might be restricted more to more of the severe patients and again that would be an advantage. But if we want to go to all lupus patients because not all lupus patients are, are flaring all the time. The majority have a normal life. Go to the clinic once a year and just see their physicians when they have flares. So going to a very deep regimen for B-cell depletion might be deemed to too severe. So the questions is yes we're looking at it and trying to figure out what's the right regimen and how to approach that in lupus is very exciting questions, which we're obviously looking into. Well, this is Tom, I\u2019ll answer the CF question. Again, this is very challenging to actually make that abnormal CF protein get to the membrane and act as a chloride channel, and it takes three different drugs to make it effectively to get it to the cell membrane and open up in the right way. And so we all felt that we had \u2013 intakes we call them Corrector 1, Corrector 2 and Potentiator, these three different compounds. We always see good results with double our C1 corrector. We think it\u2019s best-in-class. Our potentiator is very good. What we had difficulty is to get a good C2 corrector, and what I presented earlier this year was that it wasn\u2019t good enough. But what we\u2019ve done since then, we will continue to look at better ones and we came out with a differentiated product, 576 [ph], which is structurally different and the data supports higher safety margin, higher exposures, good PK. Hopefully, a single pill. And then we\u2019d be able to get to this \u2013 to be able to have this triplet which is really important to be competitive. So again, our doublet, the data we had was very strong. But we need that third piece, and that third piece seems to be coming along really well. That\u2019s what you really saw on the website at ct.gov is moving to evaluate this triple combo with our new C2 corrector."

            "name": "Jeff Stewart",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. We once again demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. I'll start with Immunology, where we are well positioned for sustained leadership in this extremely attractive market. Total Immunology revenues were more than $7.6 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. We remain very excited about the long-term potential for Skyrizi and Rinvoq which are already having a significant impact on AbbVie's growth and performance, contributing approximately $2.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, representing nearly 15% of total company net revenues. Skyrizi continues to exceed our expectations. Global revenues were $1.4 billion, up 12% on a sequential basis. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is capturing nearly one out of every two new and switching patients in the U.S. biologic market, with our leading total prescription share increasing to approximately 27%. We have also achieved total market share leadership in a dozen key international markets, including Japan, Canada and France. Psoriatic arthritis is ramping very nicely, with an expected global sales contribution of approximately $500 million just this year. Our PSA performance is especially strong in the U.S. Dermatology segment, where we have already achieved 10% total market share. Lastly, our launch of Skyrizi for Crohn's disease in the U.S. is progressing very well. Early prescription trends as well as feedback from gastroenterologists has been overwhelmingly positive, especially given Skyrizi's convenient dosing and strong clinical profile. Importantly, commercial access for Skyrizi Crohn's is now equal to psoriasis and PSA with sales in this indication expected to ramp significantly over the next several quarters. Given the momentum we are seeing across the indications; we will be raising our full year sales guidance once again for Skyrizi. Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $695 million, demonstrating more than 17% sequential growth, we continue to see positive momentum in RA, with total market share increasing to more than 6% in both the U.S. and across key international geographies. Global prescriptions are also ramping nicely in PSA ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA, a testament to the strong clinical profile Rinvoq has demonstrated across the broader rheumatology segment. Rinvoq is now the only JAK inhibitor with global approval for all four major Rheum indications. In atopic dermatitis, we continue to see strong demand for Rinvoq, particularly in the second-line setting. U.S. in-play market share is tracking in line with our expectations and we were making excellent progress internationally, with in-place share ranging now from approximately 20% to 35% across our major markets. AD remains a highly underpenetrated market globally and an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Rinvoq. Lastly, in ulcerative colitis, we are very excited by the early prescription trends in the U.S. In the second line plus setting, Rinvoq is already achieving the second highest in-place share, which is now approaching 20% in just a few months\u2019 post launch. Physicians have been pleased with Rinvoq's high rates of endoscopic healing as well as the speed of onset. With over 70% of bioexperience UC patients currently on or having used TNF therapy, the second line plus opportunity for Rinvoq in UC is substantial. This strong adoption in UC among gastroenterologists is also encouraging for Rinvoq's potential in Crohn's disease as well. We are on track for U.S. and EMA regulatory decisions in the first half of 2023. Global Humira sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 3.9% on an operational basis with 7.4% growth in the U.S., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 16.8% operationally due to biosimilar competition. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 9.9% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.4%. The U.S. performance continues to be impacted by an incrementally challenging CLL market, with new patient starts down approximately 20% relative to pre-COVID levels. Given the U.S. CLL market has been consistently lower than our expectation in the past several quarters, we are now reducing our view of the total size of the addressable patient population for this indication going forward. We also anticipate further share erosion following the recent unfavorable change to the NCCN guideline preference for Imbruvica in CLL, as well as increasing existing and new competition. These market and shared dynamics are expected to have a flow through impact on Imbruvica\u2019s 2023 performance.  Venclexta global sales were $550 million up 11.3% on an operational basis. Continued share gains across both approved indications are being partially offset by a softer CLL market in the U.S. and a higher foreign exchange impact on international revenues. As a result, we will be adjusting our full year sales guidance for Venclexta. Longer term, we anticipate our oncology portfolio will return a growth driven by several promising new products and indications such as epcoritamab for DLBCL, and follicular lymphoma, Venclexta new indications for multiple myeloma and high-risk MDs; navitoclax for myelofibrosis; and Teliso-V for nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer. We are beginning launch preparedness activities for several of these important opportunities and look forward to bringing new treatment options to patients. In neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.7 billion, up 8.3% on an operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of 554 million were up 20.2% on an operational basis reflecting continued market share momentum. We continue to anticipate the regulatory approval and the commercial launch of Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder this quarter, which would make Vraylar the only antipsychotic, as a dual partial agonist approved to treat the most common forms of depression, both bipolar I, and adjunctive, and DD. Within migraine, our market leading oral CGRP portfolio contribute $222 million in combined sales this quarter. Ubrelvy prescriptions increased high single digits sequentially while total revenues were unfavorably impacted by a one-time prior period accrual adjustment of $40 million related to patient access program costs. Excluding this one-time adjustment, Ubrelvy sales were up more than 20% versus the prior year. Qulipta revenues nearly doubled sequentially as we continue to make very good progress with commercial access. Potential label expansion in the U.S. as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine and new therapy approvals in Europe represent additional opportunities to support Qulipta's strong momentum. Botox Therapeutic is also performing very well with total sales of $699 million, up 10% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, which accounts for roughly 45% of our therapeutic sales, Botox remains a foundational preventative treatment, and the clear branded leader for existing as well as new patient starts. Lastly, our launch preparations are underway for ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's. We anticipate approval in the first half of next year and believe ABBV-951 has the potential to achieve peak sales in excess of $1 billion. So overall, I'm very pleased with the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D programs. Tom? No. Just to confirm, Rick, that no real surprises in terms of where we\u2019ve been. And as we\u2019ve communicated before, our principles of co-existing over time with one or more biosimilars seems to be the way that the market will play out. And certainly, like we saw in Europe that we had the principle of \u2013 for patient continuity to concede pricing to maintain that patient access. So Chris, no major surprises that we\u2019ve seen so far. Maybe, Roopal, you could address the procedure and where we are in the procedure, and I\u2019ll cover the commercial. And Chris, to that point, I mean, this is largely consistent with what we see from oral surveillance and the Xeljanz label, which is widely sort of understood by the European physicians. And so to cut to the quick, we don\u2019t anticipate a material impact as this continues through the process. No, I think, Tim, Rick described it in the right way. While there are typically, there are typically out clauses based on timing or other dynamics I think one of the considerations is obviously, as we\u2019ve highlighted before, most of the biosimilars are going to be coming in the second half of the year. So to some degree, that actually limits if it was a rare case. And they typically are rare where a contract is blown up or renegotiated in the middle of the year. That length of time that\u2019s left in 2023 for some of those payers to let\u2019s take a negative action puts some natural constraint on them in terms of when they would time that out. But Rick highlighted it very nicely in terms of the dynamics. Yes, so look, in terms of what Rick had highlighted in terms of our confidence in projecting the 80%. Obviously, there\u2019s a couple components to that. So we have \u2013 while all the contracts aren\u2019t fully complete with the ones that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve done some significant modeling work to understand if we\u2019re retaining the ability to stay on the formulary. We would model our volume like how much would we retain versus would go to one or more biosimilars. That\u2019s something that we can understand. And we have made base case, both first half and second half pricing assumptions based on those contracts. Now what\u2019s been highlighted in the last couple of questions is there\u2019s still uncertainty on the rest of the contracts that are yet to been secured and also a bid on that second half price dynamic. So those are the elements that are going to give us more confidence as we go to the fourth quarter call to give everyone a secure number for next year. Yes. Hi Andrew, it's Jeff. I'll take your \u2013 I'll take your first question. So when we \u2013 obviously we're still studying very carefully the IRA and we're also discussing directly with CMS not just through pharma, but our own company in terms of how they're going to basically select the different drugs that will be negotiated. That's a little bit unclear at this point. It's not unreasonable based on the size of Imbruvica to suspect it will be one of the earlier drugs that could potentially be negotiated, so just to clear that. In terms of what may take place before that potential negotiation in 2026, I would expect to see some modest changes in rebate. We see very small levels at this point now but we do have a third competitor coming. So that would be something that we would continue to plan \u2013 to plan for as we move into that potential event. Yes. Steve, and just in terms of your salesforce question, I mean, we are very encouraged and excited about this potential approval. I mean, obviously we continue to gain share week-by-week sequentially for our base indication \u2013 the bipolar indications. And we know that based on the profile that we have with Vraylar. So very, very strong efficacy \u2013 proven efficacy of a very good tolerability profile for an antipsychotic, no material weight gain, low metabolic effects, and I think importantly maybe not as appreciated it's, there's no titration. You have a very simple starting dose of 1.5 milligrams. So as we do our research, we see that that profile is very strong as this potential add-on therapy and depression. In the last decade there's been only one drug that's been approved for this indication and that's Rexulti, and we think that's a branded drug, obviously, and we think we can compete very, very well. So we have a big existing sales force and infrastructure. We are gearing up in terms of training. We have the established relationships across the big primary care doctors as well as the psychiatrist. So we are \u2013 we agree with your approach. That's a meaningful commercial opportunity that could evolve very quickly here once we get the approval. Yes. I'll take the IBD question. I think we've mentioned before that the IBD has been a very important part of our long range plan and when we gave the 2025 guidance, it looks relatively small because they're just ramping down. I would say that as AbbVie we are very, very encouraged. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks on the launch, and maybe I'll start with what we're hearing from the gastroenterologists. I think first is they, they look at both assets and the global guidelines, the impressions and the clinical approach that we hear from the top leaders and also the community gastros is this idea over \u2013 I have to start to think about endoscopic healing, higher basically rates of efficacy and more significant clarity on what it's doing in the bowel versus just symptoms. And that seems straightforward, but we see the market moving very, very fast there in terms of understanding and that's what we can deliver, whether it's the Skyrizi data on the endoscopic healing rates with a very, very convenient and strong safety profile, or similar on the Rinvoq side in second line in the U.S. second line for patients that aren't doing well in UC. So we see rapid adoption already as I mentioned, that in the Rinvoq in the United States will be a second line plus based on the label. And we see very, very fast adoption. I'll give you some color on it. Xeljanz had been approved and is approved in UC in the United States, but basically it had very low adoption. We're seeing now in the community that 70% of the prescriptions are coming from physicians that have never written a JAK before. So it shows you that the clinical profile of Rinvoq in terms of its speed and the depth of the response is being viewed very, very well. So not only is that encouraging for Rinvoq, you see as I mentioned we're going to have the approval for Crohn's for Rinvoq in later lines next year as well. Skyrizi continues to surprise us to the upside, as you've heard from the call today. This is viewed increasingly as the preferred frontline drug coming straight out of the gate for Crohn's in the U.S. And the qualitative data that we're starting to see, and we are seeing some quantitative data that looks very strong, too, is that this is viewed as a already as a best-in-class product for Crohn\u2019s, which is a very, very substantial market. So we are very encouraged. We continue to say that the IBD is probably underappreciated, and we\u2019ll continue to give updates as these launches progress. Chris, it\u2019s Jeff. Just to clarify in terms of your Rinvoq question, was there a specific question related to a certain indication on the front line? Or I\u2019m not sure I fully appreciate that one. In AD, okay, right. So yes, we do see frontline use across the globe and even in the U.S. And what we\u2019re seeing is now, as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re seeing in-line in-play share, which is in the high mid-teens right now in the U.S., and it\u2019s higher in the international markets. So there seems to be, as we look to the research and we look to our market \u2013 end market performance, there\u2019s really two segments of dermatologists. There\u2019s very cautious dermatologists that are slow to adopt JAKs, and typically, they\u2019ll start in the later line, a second line plus. There is an emerging cohort of a significant group of dermatologists as well that basically are looking at the underlying high efficacy parameters, so basically like the EZ90 skin clearance and almost no discernible itch for the product. They typically are starting to use more and more in the frontline. So the overall balance is leaning towards the second line, but we do see increasing frontline utilization based on the profile of the drug in atopic dermatitis. In terms of the Skyrizi for Crohn\u2019s, we think we\u2019re very, very well positioned for a couple of reasons. One is the overall profile of the medicine is really exceptional, as I\u2019ve highlighted, and we\u2019re going to see very, very rapid adoption both in the U.S. and the external market. In addition, we have anticipated the STELARA LOE. We see that we have an ongoing head-to-head trial versus STELARA to make sure that we can continue to differentiate with direct data that will come over the next year or so, so we\u2019re anticipating that. And we think we\u2019re going to have a good setup to maintain the early momentum that we\u2019re seeing with Skyrizi. Yes, so thank you for the question. I mean, one of the things that we see certainly in the near term is that the formularies in I&I are actually expanding. So many years ago, you might have six or seven preferred agents. The payers are now requesting sometimes up to 11 or 12 preferred agents, so you\u2019re seeing an expansive nature in the short term. Now as you go forward, maybe middle of the decade or later where you have more and more biosimilars, could the U.S. environment move towards sort of a step through? I mean, it\u2019s possible. But we have, again, as I mentioned in my last statement, we have anticipated that with the right types of data, the trials. We have five head-to-head studies in Skyrizi in psoriasis; we have more coming in Crohn\u2019s. And so we think that basically, we have a data-driven approach that\u2019s going to continue to allow us to significantly differentiate our products. The other dynamic that we watch very carefully, and we talked about this during the Immunology Investor Day, is the lines of therapy as there\u2019s more and more high efficacy products that get introduced, continue to expand. So in the middle of the decade or longer, the second plus and the third line markets are going to be very, very significant at that point. So when we put all of that into the calculus we feel again, we have a pretty set up for the middle of the decade and longer."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom. AbbVie\u2019s third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio. The continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq are helping offset the impact from higher inflation and the stronger U.S. dollar. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.02 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.8 billion, in line with our guidance and up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 53.4% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 85.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.8% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense up 20.9% of sales. Net interest expense was $497 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.9%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are narrowing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $13.84 and $13.88. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $58.2 billion, reflecting growth of 5.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated assumptions. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong market share performance. For Venclexta, we now expect global revenue of approximately $2 billion, based on a lower market outlook in CLL and unfavorable foreign exchange. For Aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, given the impact of higher inflation on near-term market growth and due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Moving to P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of approximately 85% of sales and forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 52% of sales. Turning to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.65 and $3.69. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie\u2019s strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of September was $11.8 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie\u2019s long-term outlook, today we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2023. And we remain on track to achieve $30 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year, bringing our net leverage ratio to 1.8 times. In closing, AbbVie\u2019s strong performance allows us to reaffirm earnings expectations in the face of economic pressure. And with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz. And this is Rob. I would just add that if you think about more long term. If you think about what happened in 2008 and 2009, the business declined high single digits and then we saw, after that very robust growth in the mid-teen to the next decade. So given that penetration rates are still very low today. There\u2019s clearly ample opportunity to grow this market. I think once you get on the other side of the economic impact which we expect to be transient. We still expect as business to deliver long-term growth as Rick highlighted earlier, we\u2019re still on track for that. Long-term high single digit growth getting to greater than $9 billion by 2029. So we\u2019ll have to navigate, obviously, the short-term economic impact. But we still have tremendous confidence in the long-term outlook for aesthetics. So Gary, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take your question on OpEx. If you look at the benefit we\u2019re seeing, about half of it is actually coming from the stronger U.S. dollar, so it\u2019s more of an FX impact. The other half is spend productivity. We always look for opportunities to drive more productivity in our spend. It\u2019s not so much about scaling back in parts of the business, we always look for ways to spend better, buy better. And ultimately, that helps us. In many cases also, over the long-term, redeploy that investment to drive growth. If you think about 2023, I\u2019ve said \u2013 given that 46% to 47% operating margin directional input. I\u2019ve also said we\u2019re not going to cut back investment. We\u2019ll obviously be prudent given that you will see a decline in gross margins next year, but we\u2019re not going to be cutting back investment because we expect to return to growth quickly. So you\u2019ll see us not necessarily cut back, but certainly put more behind this business to drive that long-term growth that we expect to be industry-leading over the long term."

On today\u2019s conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions. So with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll briefly comment on our overall performance. Then Jeff, Tom, and Rob will review our second quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion was up 6.1% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. This performance reflects robust double-digit operational sales growth from immunology, where Skyrizi is exceeding our expectations with impressive market share gains in both psoriasis and PSA. Skyrizi\u2019s recent U.S. approval in Crohn\u2019s disease will add yet another source of long-term growth. As a result of the strong performance we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for Skyrizi. Rinvoq is also demonstrating strong growth. RA continues to perform in line with our expectations, following the label update, and we\u2019re making very good progress with all of the newly launched indications, including PSA, AS, atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis, which collectively represent a significant long-term growth opportunity. Neuroscience is another area with outstanding performance Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and Ubrelvy and Qulipta each demonstrated double-digit sequential sales growth. Pending regulatory approvals for Vraylar in major depressive disorder, Qulipta in chronic migraine and 951 for the treatment of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease represent additional near-term growth opportunities for our neuroscience portfolio. Turning now to aesthetics, Botox Cosmetics once again performed very well with sales up more than 20% on an operational basis. Demand for toxins remains strong with high teens growth in the U.S., despite inflation dynamics. As expected, Juvederm performance was negatively impacted by COVID-related lockdowns in China, as well as the suspension of our operations in Russia. Additionally, in the U.S., we had a difficult prior year comparison with a promotional event that we ran last year. We also saw a modest impact in the quarter due to economic pressures. We continue to expect positive full year growth for Juvederm driven by the lessening COVID impact in China and two new filler launches in the U.S. which will benefit growth in the second half of the year. In hematological oncology, Imbruvica continues to be unfavorably impacted by a delayed market recovery for new patients starting therapy in CLL and increasing competition. These ongoing dynamics will have an impact on Imbruvica\u2019s projected 2022 revenues. As a result, we will be adjusting our full-year guidance to reflect these impacts. Venclexta to continues to demonstrate robust share performance in both CLL and AML, with sales up double digits on an operational basis. Venclexta also has registrational studies ongoing in additional attractive indication, such as multiple myeloma in the t(11;14) patient population with Phase 3 data forthcoming, as well as high risk MDS. Additionally, we have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both, blood cancers and solid tumors, which are expected to support the next wave of AbbVie\u2019s growth in oncology. In summary, the diversity of our portfolio, once again allowed us to deliver another strong performance, despite the challenges we see in the CLL market and increasing Imbruvica competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well and are on pace to deliver approximately $7.5 billion in combined sales this year. Neuroscience demonstrated balanced double-digit growth driven by migraine and Vraylar and continued robust Botox cosmetic growth offset some of the U.S. inflationary impact to our filler and body contouring portfolios. As a result, we are confirming our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $13.78 to $13.98, representing growth of more than 17% at the midpoint. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on commercial highlights. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. I\u2019m very pleased with the momentum across our therapeutic portfolio, including the continued progress we\u2019re making with new product and recent indication launches. I\u2019ll start with our immunology portfolio, which delivered total revenues of $7.2 billion, reflecting growth of 19.2% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were approximately $5.4 billion, up 6.8% on an operational basis with 9.6% growth in the U.S., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 7.3% operationally due to biosimilar competition. Skyrizi is performing extremely well, well ahead of our expectations. Global revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 33% on a sequential basis. We continue to advance our leadership position in psoriasis where Skyrizi\u2019s total prescription share of the U.S. biological market has increased to approximately 26%, driven by an in-play share of new and switching patients that is now approaching 50%. We have also achieved in-play market share leadership in 23 key international markets, including Japan, Germany, France, Canada, and Australia.  Psoriatic arthritis is also adding significantly to Skyrizi\u2019s momentum, where we are now approved in 54 countries. In the U.S. dermatology segment, where approximately 30% of patients exhibit both skin and joint involvement, Skyrizi is already achieving an in-play patient share of nearly 20%. We have also launched Skyrizi for PSA in rheumatology, where we\u2019re seeing strong utilization, which is driving accelerated share growth. Our recent launch of Skyrizi for Crohn\u2019s disease in the U.S. represents the first new biologic approval in six years for an area where there continues to be considerable unmet need. We believe Skyrizi represents a highly effective and differentiated treatment option for Crohn\u2019s patients, including the potential to provide meaningful levels of endoscopic improvement with novel and infrequent dosing. Managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for this indication in the coming months. Turning now to Rinvoq, where we\u2019re seeing good momentum across each of the approved indications. Global sales of $592 million were up more than 27% on a sequential basis. Prescriptions in RA remained strong with a total market share of 5.8% in the U.S. and approximately 6% across key international markets. Rinvoq is now achieving an in-play RA share of approximately 13% in the U.S. In PSA, Rinvoq continues to see nice uptake, especially in the room segment with commercial access now equal to RA. We also recently received FDA approval for ankylosing spondylitis and European approval for non-radiographic Axial SpA, further expanding Rinvoq\u2019s potential across rheumatology. In atopic dermatitis, new patient starts are tracking in line with our expectations with Rinvoq\u2019s in-play patient share in the mid-teens. Strong commercial access in AD, which is also now equal to RA and PSA, is expected to considerably increase paid prescription volume in this highly underpenetrated market over the remainder of the year. Lastly, our recent launch of Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis in the U.S. is progressing well. And we recently just received European approval for the same indication. Commercial access in the U.S. is ramping strongly, and we are seeing encouraging new patient starts. Physician feedback regarding Rinvoq\u2019s approved profile in UC has been favorable, especially given the very high rates of remission and endoscopic improvement demonstrated across our UC development program. The addressable patient population for Rinvoq in UC is substantial, with nearly 50% of patients currently on or having used TNF therapy. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 7.9% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.1% and below our expectations. The CLO market continues to remain challenging in the U.S. with new patient starts down double digits relative to pre-pandemic levels. Now, as you may recall, our initial 2022 Imbruvica sales guidance contemplated a partial market recovery, which, unfortunately, we have not yet observed. In fact, the latest data reflects new patient starts in the U.S. were actually down high single digits versus last year. So, based on recent trends, we no longer believe it\u2019s prudent to anticipate a meaningful market recovery in CLL over the second half of this year. Therefore, we will be removing this assumption from our 2022 guidance. In addition, increasing competition from newer therapies, including other BTK inhibitors as well as our own Venclexta also continue to lower Imbruvica\u2019s share of new patient starts, especially in frontline CLL. Despite this increasing competitive pressure, Imbruvica continues to be the total market share leader across all lines of therapy in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $505 million, up 21.2% on an operational basis. In CLL, we continue to see share gains in the U.S. and across all major international markets. We\u2019re also seeing continued strong performance in AML. Venclexta is now approved in 80 countries and in many markets is already considered the new standard of care for frontline AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. As a result, we are seeing ramping market share throughout the countries where we have launched. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of $492 million were up 13.9% on an operational basis, reflecting continued share gains in the U.S. atypical antipsychotic market. Our launch preparations remain well underway in anticipation of our MDD approval in the fourth quarter. This is a potentially large indication that would represent incremental upside to our current projections for Vraylar. Within migraine, Ubrelvy remains the market-leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine with revenue of $185 million, up 34% on a sequential basis. Qulipta continues to increase its leading new-to-brand share in the U.S. preventative CGRP class when we consider both, paid and bridge volume. We continue to make good progress with expanded commercial access, which will support strong Qulipta sales growth over the remainder of this year. We are also pursuing the commercial approval for Qulipta as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine in the U.S. as well as a new therapy for Europe, potentially further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well in chronic migraine as well as its other indications with total sales of $678 million, up 14.5% on an operational basis. So overall, I\u2019m pleased with the commercial execution across the therapeutic business. Our broad portfolio of differentiated therapies and new launches is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D programs. Tom?\nTom Hudson: Thank you, Jeff. I\u2019ll start with immunology where we had several notable pipeline updates in our inflammatory bowel disease programs for both, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We recently received FDA approval for Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s disease, and we\u2019re very pleased with the label which reflects a strong benefit risk profile that Skyrizi demonstrated as an induction and maintenance treatment for this condition. Based on its profile, we believe Skyrizi will be a highly effective and differentiated treatment option for patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. Our regulatory application for Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s disease remains under review in Europe with an approval decision expected near the end of this year. Also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. And we\u2019re excited to bring this new, highly efficacious oral option to patients suffering from this often debilitating disease. In the quarter, we also completed a registrational program for Rinvoq in Crohn\u2019s disease, reporting positive top line results from our Phase 3 maintenance study. We recently submitted our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in this indication and expect approval decisions next year. Once approved for Crohn\u2019s disease, Rinvoq will have completed development programs for all the major rheum and gastro indications covered by Humira plus atopic dermatitis. The strength of the data generated in our clinical programs should position Rinvoq as a highly differentiated treatment across this broad indication set and enable Rinvoq to deliver significant value to AbbVie over the long term. And just this morning, we announced that we received European approval for Rinvoq in non-radiographic Axial SpA, which rounds out Rinvoq\u2019s label in rheumatology. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline. At the recent EHA meeting, we presented results from the large B-cell lymphoma expansion cohort in the Phase 2 study evaluating epcoritamab in patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. In this study, epcoritamab was well tolerated and drove very deep and durable responses in challenging to treat highly refractory patients with large B-cell lymphoma. We recently discussed these results with regulatory agencies and based on the strength of the data, we intend to submit regulatory applications later this year for accelerated approval of epcoritamab in patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. We expect approval decisions in 2023. We continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on track to see results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. As a reminder, we\u2019ve seen very promising results in this population in prior clinical studies with Venclexta showing high overall response rates and meaningful trends towards prolonged progression-free survival. The level of efficacy we\u2019ve seen suggests that t(11;14) patients may be particularly responsive to Venclexta and this agent has the potential to become an important biomarker-driven treatment option in the multiple myeloma market. In neuroscience, following successful completion of our Phase 3 chronic migraine prevention study, we submitted our regulatory application to the FDA for Qulipta in chronic migraine. Chronic migraine is defined as 15 or more headache days per month with at least 8 of those days associated with migraines. This is a debilitating disease that affects nearly 10% of people suffering from migraine, significantly impacting their quality of life. If approved, this would be another differentiating feature for Qulipta as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. We also submitted data from our Phase 3 prevention studies in both, chronic and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the U.S. We expect approval decisions in the U.S. and in Europe in 2023. In the quarter, we submitted our regulatory application in the U.S. for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. This innovative delivery system has the potential to become a transformative treatment option for patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease by providing DUOPA-like efficacy with less invasive nonsurgical administration. We also expect to submit our regulatory application in Europe later this year with approval decisions anticipated in both, the U.S. and Europe in 2023. Now, I\u2019d like to provide a few updates on some earlier-stage programs where we have new data and are advancing programs in development. In immunology, we recently obtained encouraging data in a Phase 2 study evaluating Rinvoq in systemic lupus, an autoimmune multisystem disease. In our study, Rinvoq demonstrated greater response rates as well as a reduction in flares compared with placebo. We\u2019ll see longer-term data in the coming months, which will allow us to make a decision on moving Rinvoq into Phase 3 for lupus. In oncology, where we have a pipeline of promising early-stage programs aimed at solid tumors, we are beginning to see very exciting data from several programs. Our anti-GARP antibody, ABBV-151 is designed to block the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory T cells, which leads to increased T cell effector functions in the tumor microenvironment. This reactivates the immune system against tumors, enhancing the antitumor immune response triggered by a PD-1 inhibitor. In our Phase 1 program, we\u2019re combining 151 with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in cancer patients who are refractory to or relapsed after PD-1 as well as evaluating this combination in PD-1 nonresponsive tumors. Based on the preliminary efficacy we\u2019ve seen in the dose expansion cohorts for multiple solid tumors, including a deepening of responses over time and prolonged durability, we recently declared proof-of-concept for 151. We plan to advance to Phase 2 in several solid tumors, starting with urothelial cancer. We\u2019re also expecting additional data readouts later this year in other solid tumor indications, including colorectal cancer, which may enable further expansion studies in this hard-to-treat cancer type. We will also begin new studies to explore a broader set of solid tumors where GARP is implicated as a critical immunosuppressive pathway, based on tumor tissue analyses. We\u2019re also making excellent progress with our next-generation c-Met ABBV-400, where the emerging clinical data is very promising in several solid tumors. This asset is similar to Teliso-V as c-MET ADC that uses a microtubulin inhibitor payload. Teliso-V received breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with a subtype of lung cancer with high levels of c-Met overexpression. The toxin warhead for 400 uses a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload, which is similar to irinotecan, a chemotherapy that is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. By targeting c-MET positive tumors with ADCs bearing different warheads we believe we can broaden the range of solid tumors where c-MET therapies can be used. In our Phase 1 program, we are seeing good responses in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and remain encouraged by these early efficacy signals. So in summary, we\u2019ve seen tremendous progress across all stages of our pipeline in the first half of the year, and we remain on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2022. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you, Tom. AbbVie\u2019s second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diversified portfolio. Momentum from new products and recently launched indications allows us to maintain our earnings outlook despite market dynamics for Imbruvica, higher inflation and the stronger U.S. dollar. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, reflecting growth of 11.2% compared to prior year and $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.14 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.6 billion, up 6.1% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 220 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.8% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.8% of sales. Net interest expense was $532 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 13.4%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are confirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance between $13.78 and $13.98. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $58.9 billion, reflecting growth of 6.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.7% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated assumptions. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $4.8 billion, an increase of $400 million due to strong market share performance. For Imbruvica, we now expect global revenue of approximately $4.7 billion, given the lack of recovery in the CLL market and increasing competition. Moving to the P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales and continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. Turning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.1% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.55 and $3.59. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, we delivered strong performance again this quarter, including meaningful contributions from new products and recently launched indications. Given the momentum of our business as well as our pipeline advancements, we are well positioned for the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we\u2019ll take the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is Andrew Baum, Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Baum: First question is on the guidance range you\u2019ve given for anticipated trajectory of Humira in the U.S., presumably you\u2019re finishing contracting, both with Medicare and commercial. Could you provide any guidance further on \u201823 and even \u201824 [indiscernible] contracts? And then second, a pipeline question in relation to your anti-GARP monoclonal, which you\u2019ve taken a long time to sort of optimize or move forward. I\u2019m just curious whether you\u2019re using any molecular markers in order to minimize risk given the failures of other TGF-beta targeted agents, particularly in colorectal using CMS 4 or a subgroup of the total population, or are you putting it in all comers, the suggestion that what\u2019s an all comers or is this again informed biomarkers? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Andrew, this is Rick. Thank you for the questions. I\u2019ll cover the first one, and then Tom can cover the second one. So, we are in the process now, as we\u2019ve indicated before, of negotiating with the managed care organizations and the PBMs to establish our contract position for Humira in 2023. This is a normal time that you would go through that. It is progressing as we would expect. I would say we\u2019re midway through that process right now. I would expect it to conclude near the end of the third quarter, early the fourth quarter. At that point, that\u2019s an important part of refining our model for 2023 in particular. And what that will tell us is that the positions that we have formulary status for 2023 in for Humira, and that will help us define clearly the volume aspect of it. And so, that\u2019s going well, and that\u2019s going to be an important part of us being able to refine that model. And so, as we get further along in that process, that will give us the ability to be able to potentially refine the model that we have. Now, the one thing that\u2019s important to remember in all of this is price is the other key aspect here. And there, we won\u2019t know real pricing until the actual event starts to occur. So, we will make assumptions around what that price looks like. And I think those will be informed assumptions, but they are just that they\u2019re assumptions. And so, that\u2019s the one piece that will still be somewhat of an unknown until we see the landscape start to play out in 2023, and particularly in midway through 2023 when more biosimilars enter the market. So, as we get more information and we can provide more clarity, we\u2019ll certainly try to do that, but I think that\u2019s where we are right now. Tom?\nTom Hudson: Thank you. Andrew, I\u2019ll try to break down the question in different parts because you\u2019re right, there are many TGF-beta assets. This one is unique, GARP. Most of the TGF-beta assets work either antibodies against receptors to be active for TGF-beta or TGF-beta itself that\u2019s in circulation on cells. But GARP blocks the inactive form of TGF-beta before it\u2019s released from TGF-beta. And we believe that actually is a differentiated mechanism, also allows that specificity to what\u2019s happening in TGF-beta in the tumor as opposed to other systems in the body. At the beginning of this, we thought -- we had already had people that published that they are very good TGF-beta signatures that exist. And I can tell you that GARP signature follows tracks with TGF-beta signatures. And that\u2019s often seen in all solid tumors as susceptive tumors that express these pathways. It\u2019s a very common immunosuppressive mechanism. That\u2019s why people and us are interested in it. We learned -- initially, from data, we kind of suspected that people who actually had a nice hot tumors but were not responding to PD-1, often had, at least from published work -- actually had a higher TGF-beta signature. So, we thought that was a reason to mechanism why these patients with hot tumors were not responding. And a lot of our initial clinical strategy there was actually to go after hot tumors where PD-1s had relapsed or refractory. And we thought we could augment the PD-1 checkpoint response by doing this combination. We did not see monotherapy activity, but in combination, we did. And that\u2019s why our first data sets and expansions like I\u2019ve just discussed in urothelial cancer, this project started earlier, we\u2019re seeing data that\u2019s suggesting that this is correct that you need to reflect both the pathway of TGF-beta and PD-1, to get a response. And those, again, in multiple tumor types we\u2019re seeing these responses and we\u2019re moving forward. At the same time, to bring it to colon, we could also see the same signatures of TGF-beta and GARP in cold tumors, but we weren\u2019t sure that since they\u2019re not IO responsive, whether we\u2019d get a response, we would get a clinical response. So, we did start some investigations. And yes, we did see some responses in cold tumors. They happen over time, sometimes they appear, the tumors are stable for 3 months, maybe 6 months, and then you see these responses appear. They\u2019re very durable, 1 year, 2 year, very unusual. These are patients with advanced disease that have very poor prognosis in Phase 1 studies. So, we saw some, I would say -- we sometimes say in academic column exceptional responders. And so, we decided to expand. So, those data sets are newer, are happening right now. I probably will have the data at the end of this year. But yes, we\u2019ve seen responses to this combination. And to answer your question, so the signatures we\u2019re looking at are not the CMS or kind of histology-based signatures on the tumor. It\u2019s more signatures of the inflammatory response that we can measure in the tumor, and it has to do with both, inflammatory T cells, which are there for the killing, but also the inhibitory TGF-beta signatures. And of course, we\u2019re going to continue to investigate this. I don\u2019t have all the answers for you today, but it certainly has been exciting to see how this program has evolved.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: Maybe two for me. Just wanted to make sure that you are maintaining your 2022 aesthetics guidance of $5.9 billion. Rob, I didn\u2019t hear you call it out, so I\u2019m assuming that was a reiteration, just given what you\u2019re seeing with Juvederm in the U.S. And then the second question I had relates more of a, I guess, strategic one, Rick. I know you\u2019re still going through the conversations with 2023 for Humira. But, as you think about providing an update to guidance, whether that happens with the 3Q results or with the 4Q results, do you think you\u2019ll be able to provide some outlook on 2024 because I think something investors are discussing now is just if the possibility of the impact is more in \u201824, how we should think about revenue margins in \u201824 versus \u201823. So, just wondering strategically how you\u2019re thinking about that at this point, not asking for guidance, more just thought process.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. So, Terence, I\u2019ll take both of those questions, and then Rob can certainly jump in here if he has something he wants to add. We are maintaining the aesthetic guidance as we\u2019ve indicated. Certainly, we have seen good, strong performance on the toxin side of the business, and we would expect it to continue. As we look at the filler side of the business, as you\u2019ve noted, it was lighter this quarter than we\u2019ve seen historically. And I\u2019d say that was driven by a couple of issues. It was certainly driven by the China- Russia issue outside the U.S. In the U.S., we did have a very successful promotional program that we ran last year. So, it was a tough comparison versus last year. But I\u2019d also say, we have seen some glimpses of what could be inflationary pressure on that business or it could be pent-up demand for vacations. And Carrie can certainly go through more detail if there\u2019s a follow-up question. But I think as we look at the business overall, we\u2019re comfortable maintaining the guidance now. We believe that Botox will continue to perform very well. And obviously, we\u2019re doing more things to be able to drive the toxin side of the business. It\u2019s at a price point where it should be less sensitive to inflationary pressures. The price point for toxin is about $500, I think, right, Gary? And where fillers are almost twice that or maybe even a little more than twice that. So clearly, from a disposable income standpoint, fillers are more challenging for people than toxins are. And so that\u2019s the rationale behind it. And certainly, as we look at the overall performance of the AbbVie business, we have plenty of opportunities with the diversity of our portfolio to cover any potential shortfall if we ended up having an issue. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable maintaining the guidance. And I think we need to see more time play out here to see exactly where we are from a U.S. inflationary impact. On the second question, as it relates to an update on \u201823 and potentially something on \u201824. I think the way you\u2019ve described it is accurate. When we have more information, we\u2019ll try to provide that. And when we\u2019ve gotten to a point that certainly by the fourth quarter call, we\u2019re going to provide you guidance on what we think will happen in 2023. But if we can provide something on the third quarter call, I wouldn\u2019t be looking for guidance. I think that\u2019s not a good expectation. But certainly, potentially a little more clarification on what our contracting status looks like at that point and how that will translate into what we think. And if we can refine the model to a greater degree, we would certainly provide that. As it relates to 2024, certainly, I\u2019m not going to -- we\u2019re not in a position we\u2019re going to talk about 2024 right now. And I think that would be a little bit unlikely because not all these contracts will be two-year contracts. And so, you really won\u2019t know what your volume position is at that point. And as I said, you won\u2019t know what the pricing is going to be, particularly midway through the year. And so, I think those will be important things to be able to dial in to where the forecast is going. I\u2019d say, overall, we feel good about the contracting position that we\u2019re in. And then, I\u2019d say, the other thing is, I know investors really want to try to model this between \u201823 and \u201824. I understand why you want to do that. Certainly, we obviously would like to do that to the greatest degree possible. But, when you step back and you actually look at the performance of AbbVie and how you will value AbbVie and what AbbVie means going forward, it has relatively little to do with Humira, and that shape of that curve between \u201823 and \u201824. And certainly, by the end of \u201824, we should reach a point where we\u2019ve achieved some level of stability on the tail of Humira. What AbbVie is all about is these other products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq and Vraylar and Ubrelvy, the aesthetics business, Qulipta. Those are going to be the things that drive it. So, if you want to focus on something and it\u2019s what we focus on internally is that underlying growth engine that will emerge on the other side of whatever erosion Humira ends up suffering before it hit some level of stability and tail is those assets and then what comes out of the pipeline. Those are the key things that are going to create that growth between 25% and 30%. And that\u2019s the part that we -- I would say, we\u2019re obviously managing Humira to the greatest extent we can. But that\u2019s the part that we as a team are focusing on. And I think that\u2019s the most important part because that is the AbbVie going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Maybe dwelling a little bit more on the Humira question for Rick and Jeff. So, you said that pricing from the competition will be key unknown for next year. As you get into contracts this year, for the next year, how rigid or flexible these contracts are from the pricing point of view when PBMs realize that the biosimilar is giving an X or Y pricing, or would that be more of a 2024 issue rather than 2023? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Well, let me take a shot at that, and certainly, Jeff is closer to it. So, Jeff, if you want to add anything in, feel free to jump in and add. Typically, when you contract for an asset like Humira, you\u2019re contracting for a formulary position. And there aren\u2019t volume requirements or other kinds of requirements. I think it\u2019s also -- it would be prudent to assume that biosimilars will be on these contracts, whether it\u2019s one or more than one that will coexist with Humira. So, price plays an important role in that because they will coexist. And so, I\u2019d say -- and as that becomes fluid, you would have to make decisions around how you try to deal with that to maintain the kinds of volumes that you want to maintain. And we\u2019ve said all along, the strategy that we\u2019ll have in the U.S. is similar to the strategy that we had internationally, and that is maintain as much volume as we can at the highest level of profit that we can maintain it at. And that is the logic that we will employ. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have to be somewhat responsive to prices in the marketplace on Humira. Jeff, anything you\u2019d add?\nJeff Stewart: No, I think that\u2019s -- Rick, that\u2019s a very reasonable way to look at it in terms of how these negotiations are going and how we see \u201823 playing out. I mean, the real big ones in terms of how we look at it is the two big scenarios are you are likely coexisting with one or more biosimilars or if the negotiations don\u2019t go the way that we anticipate that were excluded in favor of biosimilars. And that\u2019s basically where price and volume -- in terms of refining our model, for \u201823. That\u2019s the work that we\u2019re doing over the summer and then into the fall.\nOperator: Next question is Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets.\nGary Nachman: So, Skyrizi was very strong in the second quarter, and you raised guidance nicely. How much of a benefit are you getting from the psoriatic arthritis indication thus far? What are you expecting Crohn\u2019s to contribute this year? How much are those playing into the raised guidance? And are you revisiting the long-term guidance on Skyrizi at this point, given the strong performance? And then just on the hem/onc franchise. Are you keeping the infrastructure intact preparing for new products to contribute? And maybe you could talk about the near-term opportunities you see for products like epcoritamab and navitoclax, how much of those could contribute and potentially offset some of the pressure you\u2019ve been seeing from Imbruvica? Thanks.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you. It\u2019s Jeff. Thanks for the question. So, your instinct and observation is right. The big dynamic change for Skyrizi here, largely what you\u2019re seeing is from the psoriatic arthritis indication. And obviously saw very, very large sequential moves. And let me give you some sense of what we\u2019re looking at. So, we\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re putting more and more basically headroom into the overall share position, first in psoriatic disease, so that\u2019s psoriasis plus PSA. So, we\u2019re at 26% in terms of total TRx share and moving very, very nicely up. So, that\u2019s being driven by this PSA acceleration. So first, remember that the PSA indication, we were the -- really the last large product that didn\u2019t have that indication. So first, what happens is it starts to interact very positively in the dermatology segment. So, as I mentioned, about 30% of patients both have skin and joint involvement. And so we actually had a lower despite the fact that we had the leading psoriasis share, we had a lower psoriasis share because we weren\u2019t covered with the joints with that indication. So, you see an immediate, very rapid acceleration of our overall derm business that I highlighted. Secondly, strategically important to the performance is that we\u2019re able to launch the PSA indication for Skyrizi in rheumatology. So, it starts to work together with the Rinvoq PSA indication, and the rheum segment is 3 times as large as the derm segment. So, it\u2019s a very, very good dynamic in terms of our momentum in two large segments, even before we get to Crohn\u2019s. Now, I would say that as we\u2019ve talked about before, I mean, Skyrizi is a very special product, very unique dosing, very stable, incredible efficacy. And so, we are encouraged on the early results of Crohn\u2019s. It\u2019s too early to start to see numbers or et cetera. But all of that is playing into the raise that Rob talked about.\nRob Michael: And Gary, this is Rob. Just on the guidance. So, if you recall, earlier in the year, we got asked the question, I said PSA for Skyrizi was going to contribute about $200 million this year. It\u2019s probably closer to $400 million now with the guidance range, given the very nice uptick we\u2019ve seen in PSA. But part of that guidance raise is also the strong share performance in psoriasis. So, it includes both. In terms of Crohn\u2019s, that hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019ve set approximately $100 million this year as we ramp access for Crohn\u2019s. But obviously, the long-term potential for it is tremendous, and we\u2019re very excited about that.\nJeff Stewart: And maybe I can also then chime in on the second question. Certainly, that is a -- the new assets are a very important part of our growth story for hem/onc. Certainly, as I mentioned, we\u2019re still continuing to ramp around the world with CLL. We have more and more impressive data, particularly in the unfit frontline population. We have five years of data in the fit population for frontline for Venclexta. We\u2019re encouraged with the myeloma data, which is very unique in terms of biomarker driven approach for the (11;14). Navitoclax would be really one of the first new entrants for myelofibrosis, where there\u2019s really only been rocks in terms of that market. Epcoritamab, increasingly encouraging data in terms of the simple subcu, very rapid ways to get this medication in later lines and then building into frontline. So we are very, very encouraged while we see some pressure on Imbruvica, the new indications in base for Venclexta helps to offset that. And then we start to build with those near-term hem assets and super encouraged in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the probability that we can get there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Schott J.P. Morgan.\nChris Schott: First one, I just wanted to come back to dynamics on the U.S. dermal filler market. I guess specifically, can you just quantify how much of the weakness we saw this -- or the decline year-over-year was due to the promotion events last year versus the impact from the economic pressures that you\u2019re seeing? And I guess, in the same context, are you seeing any signs of weakness in the European business? I\u2019m just -- and what I was just trying get your hands around, what type of magnitude of impact you\u2019re talking about here in terms of either of its inflation or economic sensitivity to that business. My second question was just thinking about Rinvoq and Skyrizi formulary and pricing dynamics going forward as biosimilar Humira enters the market. I guess, are you expecting or are you hearing through discussions, any major shifts in the way payers are thinking about those products as we think about pricing coming down and obviously the largest kind of product in the space there.\nCarrie Strom: Hi. This is Carrie. I\u2019ll take your first question around Juvederm. And as Rick said, there was a onetime promotional event that we ran in the U.S. for Juvederm in Q2 of last year, and it was highly successful, and it increased sales in the sales space, which created the challenging prior year comparison. So, that was the key driver. But as you noted, there is also this impact -- economic impact that is suggestive of some early changes in consumer behavior. And that really isn\u2019t surprising in light of the inflationary pressures that we\u2019re seeing on discretionary income. And as Rick said, the filler market is likely more sensitive to that than toxins for a few reasons. We mentioned the price point. So a price point of closer to $1,000 versus $500 for toxin, also the nature of the filler business is different than toxin from a patient dynamic and treatment dynamic and that there are more -- there\u2019s a longer interval between treatments for fillers versus toxin, which is sort of like a more regular treatment paradigm a few times a year. Also, the patient bases are different. When you think about the toxin patient base and Botox Cosmetic, the majority of the patient base is continuing patients versus more of a reliance on new patient acquisition. And so, those are some of the factors we\u2019re thinking about when we think about the deceleration of the filler market in Q2 but while the market has slowed and despite the performance in Q2, we do continue to expect a positive second half growth for U.S. Juvederm, really weighted more in the fourth quarter as we\u2019re going to launch two new fillers in the fourth quarter. And those two new fillers will get us into incremental categories for HA fillers, including jawline and skin quality, which will help to drive some incremental demand at the end of the year. And in terms of your question around economic impact outside of the U.S., we are watching that very closely, and we really have not seen that yet outside of the U.S.\nJeff Stewart: In terms of your second question, again, it\u2019s Jeff. Thanks for that. We\u2019re -- we don\u2019t see some significant pressures on Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Now, we always have discussions with the payers, we look at our contracting strategy. But I think we fall back on our clinical evidence that we have on these two major assets. I mean, we have four head-to-head trials against other major competitors with Skyrizi, where we have just really growth superiority versus whether it\u2019s an IL-17, whether it\u2019s Humira, which one day will be biosimilar, STELARA, et cetera. So just the pure performance there and the momentum, it\u2019s clearly a distinguished asset. We\u2019re going to be first in terms of Crohn\u2019s to start to establish that new area and build the market there. And I think on Rinvoq to some degree, there\u2019s only one other JAK inhibitor that is not going to have the scope of indications and it\u2019s Xeljanz. And Xeljanz has been significantly wounded based on the oral surveillance data. So, in terms of our ability to build and protect and grow Skyrizi and Rinvoq into the next stage of development, we\u2019re quite confident that we have the assets to be able to do that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Scala, Cowen.\nSteve Scala: Two questions. First, Rick, in the past, you have laid out four factors that will dictate Humira\u2019s trajectory in 2023. The first two were Humira access and biosimilar price, and it\u2019s clear it\u2019s too early for any news on either of those points. But the second two were competitiveness of biosimilars, which you said in part was interchangeability and also the biosimilar ability to supply the market. So, those two factors, three and four are things that won\u2019t fluctuate and presumably, you have some visibility on that now. So, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything unusual occurring there. And in discussions, how important is interchangeability with payers. The second question is, and I apologize if I missed it, but are there any updates on the TNF steroid conjugate and is Phase 2 RA data still expected this year? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: All right. Thanks, Steve. This is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the first one. And Roopal can cover the second one. So, you are correct. That is what I described a meeting or two ago as the four variables. I would say, when you think about interchangeability, I think you have to think about it in the backdrop of not just interchangeability, but also what is the profile that is the closest to Humira today? And we can look at all the biosimilars and have -- we have pretty good visibility as to what that profile looks like. And what I would say is, to get a profile that is interchangeable and is consistent with the current Humira that\u2019s predominantly in the marketplace today, that\u2019s probably going to occur in the summer of 2023. There should be one or two biosimilars that have a profile that looks like that. And that would make it somewhat easier for an organization to make a switch. So, I think that will play an important variable. Nothing has changed in the last few months in what that profile looks like. And then obviously, supply is an important aspect that certainly anyone that we\u2019re looking at making a significant change in their position with Humira is going to want to make sure that they\u2019re going with a company that has the ability to be able to produce at volume, at significant volumes, Humira, and they can do it sustainably. So, there are certain players that I would say clearly have that ability to be able to do it, similar to us. Certainly, no one does it at the scale of us or anywhere close to the scale of us. But there are also a lot of small players that I think supply is going to be an important aspect and going to somewhat limit the ability to be able to have broad market impact. And so, those are going to be important dynamics as we negotiate with the various managed care organizations. I can tell you that we\u2019re talking through those kinds of things with them. Roopal?\nRoopal Thakkar: Yes. Thanks. Yes. So, 154 is our anti-TNF conjugated steroid, as you mentioned, and it\u2019s enabled to target delivery of steroid directly to inflammatory cells. So, we do have that Phase 2 running several hundred patients, and we still anticipate getting read later this year and then further data to follow next year.\nOperator: Our next question is Chris Raymond, Piper Sadler.\nChris Raymond: Two questions. Maybe one that\u2019s more broad policy and then another one that\u2019s maybe a little bit more detailed. So, maybe first for Rick. I know you guys keep pretty close tabs on healthcare policy. Just on the most recent Senate Democrat drug pricing language in the reconciliation bill. The provisions on the face of it seemed pretty manageable in terms of direct impact from pricing controls, but there\u2019s been some concern around this being just the start of something larger in terms of price controls. Any thoughts from you guys on this would be appreciated. And then, maybe a more detailed question on ABBV-951. I know you guys haven\u2019t provided specific guidance on this or on Duodopa, but there seems to be a lot of recognition of 951 among movement disorder KOLs as a real improvement in terms of overcoming reticence around Duodopa. Just how should we be thinking about 951 vis-\u00e0-vis Duodopa, if approved? Thanks.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. So, I\u2019ll take the first question. I mean, I think if you look at the drug pricing proposal that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s certainly an important issue for us, and I think it\u2019s an important issue for patients. I think if I look at that bill, and I\u2019m assuming that if there were something that were to pass, it would be somewhat consistent with what was in the build back better for the Senate Finance text. And so far, it looks like that, but obviously evolving a bit here as we go along. And if I look at it in total, what I\u2019d say is there\u2019s a couple of positive things in there. Certainly, most notably, the $2,000 cap out-of-pocket costs for patients and the ability to be able to smooth, I think that\u2019s an important step in increasing affordability, especially for patients in Medicare Part D. And so, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been supportive of. We\u2019ve been vocal that we think that\u2019s an important step forward. What I\u2019d say on balance, this is a bill that has far more negatives than it has positives in it. And I think although it may not be short term that challenging from a financial standpoint, I think the long-term implications of this bill are pretty significant. And they really hinge around this so-called negotiation clause that\u2019s in there and how that\u2019s being implemented, particularly for small molecules. And if you\u2019re familiar with it, essentially what it says is that CMS or we\u2019re assuming it will be CMS, has the ability at a certain point in time to be able to negotiate a price on a set of drugs. And by the time you get there, it will be a big set of drugs that they\u2019ll have the ability to be able to negotiate on. And the key issue is this. Essentially, they have full latitude to basically decide whatever price they want the drug to be. And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it a negotiation because the only alternative that the manufacturer has is to accept a 95% penalty on their revenues or, in essence, take a 95% discount. So, it\u2019s not a negotiation. We should just call it what it is. It\u2019s price controls is what they\u2019re basically putting in place if the language stays the same. And ultimately, I think the real challenge is how we invest in this as an industry in innovation. If you take small molecules as an example, I\u2019ll walk you through an example that illustrates the point that I\u2019m going to raise here. If you take a small molecule, it says at year nine after the first approval, CMS has the right to be able to negotiate the price on that drug. So, if you take an oncology drug as an example, how do we develop oncology drugs in this industry? And what do the regulatory authorities typically require us to do, to be able to develop an oncology drug. Well, they typically require you to do and what we typically do is we go to patients who have failed on all the existing therapies, fourth-line patients, fifth-line patients. And we take whatever drug we have and we determine, do we have a positive benefit risk in that patient population. If we find that we do, then we seek approval for that drug in that patient population, so that those patients will get the benefit of that drug. And then, we start to work our way up towards front line. Those who refractory patients are typically very small populations of patients, right? And you can never get a return on a drug just on that patient population. And then, you work your way up to front line, or second line, or wherever you end up. That process typically takes 7 to 9 years because of the length of the trials. So essentially, with this, by the time you got to the larger populations, you\u2019d be within a year or two of when CMS could change the price. But one, it\u2019s impossible to figure out what the return is going to be, so how do you invest? Two, it really puts negative pressure on you not to continue to develop new indications. But the most detrimental part of it is to patients who need these drugs or small indications or in later stage. Because you\u2019re faced with the dilemma -- and this is a horrible dilemma, right, as a company and for patients. You\u2019re faced with a dilemma of do I choose not to seek approval in those late-stage patients, so I don\u2019t start the clock and wait until I\u2019m closer to frontline before I start the clock. That is not the right policy. And I would say, on balance, this bill will have a couple of things that are good for patients that I\u2019m fully supportive of. But unless Congress wants to harm patients and harm innovation in this industry, they need to change that part of it. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s shortsighted. Now, they can change it in a couple of different ways. They can determine, okay, what is a floor price or a maximum discount by year and then you can calculate the return on investment that you\u2019re going to have on the drug or they can at least make it consistent with biologics that are out 13 years. Otherwise, the investment in small molecule oncology drugs or neuroscience drugs, which Medicare patient populations are highly dependent on new innovative drugs in those areas because they\u2019re elderly patients, are going to suffer. And the CBO report that was published back in April of last year clearly pointed that out. So, this isn\u2019t something I\u2019m just saying or industry is just saying. And in fact, if anything, I\u2019d say, they probably undercall the magnitude of the impact. So, this is an important issue. We all know the affordability and access for Medicare patients is important. But you don\u2019t need to destroy the innovation model in the process in order to provide that. And so, I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll see some movement here and some rationality will play out.\nJeff Stewart: Okay. And to address your 951 -- hi, it\u2019s Jeff. Thanks for the question. So, I think some perspective is globally, DUOPA is about $0.5 billion brand. And certainly, we\u2019ve said that we believe that 951 could certainly double that up or more. I\u2019ll give you the perspective of why we think that way. So, if you look at the advanced Parkinson\u2019s patients, about 85% sort of cycle when they stay on these generic orals that become less and less and less effective. And the only thing they can really do, and that\u2019s about 15% of the market, the advanced Parkinson market, is they can move to either deep brain stimulation or DUOPA. But you got to go through a surgical barrier. So, the families and the patients are forced to think if I need to get improvement in my symptoms and my quality of life, I\u2019m forced to basically think about do I get a hole in my head or a hole in my stomach with a gastric surgery. This is going to be a subcu. And so, we see in our market research that at least 40% to 60% of people never want to move towards DBS or DUOPA. So, we think this is a way where we can start to expand and create a new market segment, in essence, a subcutaneous segment where you don\u2019t have to take that risk on the surgery. And like you mentioned in the movement disorder centers, there\u2019s a significant amount of experts that are excited about this new option, and we believe that it\u2019s going to be a real innovation for patients without having the surgery.\nRob Michael: And Chris, this is Rob. As Jeff said, I mean, we expect this to be market expanding. At the JPMorgan conference earlier this year, we did give peak revenue guidance for 951 greater than $1 billion. Obviously, DUOPA is $0.5 billion now. If you\u2019re modeling it, obviously, there\u2019ll be some level of cannibalization, I\u2019d say, minor level of cannibalization on Duodopa. But when you think about the combination between 951 and Duodopa, obviously, it\u2019s going to grow the revenue for the Company and expand the market.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. It\u2019s Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Hi. If I could just go back to the whole \u201823 versus \u201824 thing, am I -- I thought that in the past, you guys have said earnings would trough in 2023 and then return to growth in 2024. Is that still the case, or is that off the table? And then, second question goes back to the 154 compound, your antibody drug conjugate. We understand that the timing is still on track, but I just -- it feels like to me there\u2019s a distinct lack of enthusiasm towards this program, you don\u2019t seem to mention that much or at all really, despite its novelty and despite it being in your most critical franchise of immunology. So, has the enthusiasm waned over, let\u2019s say, the last couple of years?\nRob Michael: So Tim, this is Rob. On your first question, what we\u2019ve said -- we\u2019ve talked about this 45% with a range around that plus or minus 10% and using, obviously, the Europe analog as an example. And in that case, with the steep erosion year one and \u201823, you would expect then the trough to be in \u201823 and return to growth in \u201824. As this plays out, we\u2019ll see how that shakes out. Ultimately, if more of it happens in \u201824, you obviously have another year of growth for all your growth brands. And so, you have a different floor in that scenario. But most importantly, it\u2019s what happens in \u201825 and beyond. When you look at this company with the growth drivers we have, we\u2019ll be delivering high-single-digit growth in \u201825 and beyond, which is industry-leading. We\u2019ll have the lowest LOE exposure in the industry in the second half of this decade. And so, we\u2019re focused on the long term, we feel very good about the prospects of this business. But as it stands now, the most recent direction we\u2019ve given is expect that first year erosion, so that 45% plus or minus 10%, which then play out to a return to growth in \u201824. We\u2019ll obviously update the market as we see it play out next year.\nTom Hudson: Maybe I\u2019ll take this one. This is Tom Hudson. I\u2019m a clinical immunologist, and I know how we\u2019ve been using steroids, they can give very profound and deep immunosuppression, decrease inflammation, and that\u2019s often used in severe cases when patient shows up. So, we know that the response is very strong, but there are a lot of side effects. And, when our problem is always weaning, the steroid\u2019s out in the clinic. So here, again, the combination of immunomodulator like TNF and steroid have that potential of giving us that deep, deep response very quickly to remove the immunosuppression. And based on the data we\u2019ve seen preclinically in our Phase 1 studies, we\u2019re not seeing those biomarkers or side effects in the bone or brain, a cortisol or others. So we\u2019ve already demonstrated that, and we have nice data. The other -- so that\u2019s my enthusiasm. We expect to see deep responses, durable responses with much well better tolerated than steroids. Our program -- and we\u2019ve shown this also is that we\u2019ve actually believed in the platform and we\u2019re developing steroid ADCs for other targets to target other immune systems -- other immune cells, more specifically around some T cells or some B cells or some fibroblasts. These programs are coming forward. We think this is a profound platform in immunology to go after different biologies -- in very targeted steroid suppression of different specific immune cell types, and that\u2019s going to play out over the next couple of years. So, based on the data we saw, we expanded the platform to other biomarkers getting into other specific immune cell types. Of course, we\u2019re quiet because we need to see the data, all -- the study has been fully recruited, actually moved faster than we expected. And the day was randomized. We\u2019re just going to see the data in the fall because it\u2019s a blinded study. But the enthusiasm is there. And we\u2019re also, of course, seeing that data, and then we have PMR because we also started studies there in Crohn\u2019s disease. We\u2019ll see that data later, but the more data we have, the more likely we\u2019re going to expand this program to other indications where we believe that deep steroid suppression with TNF might actually bring new solutions for patients.\nOperator: Our next question is Geoff Meacham, Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Great. Thank you so much for the question. Not to belabor the point on Humira, but I wanted to ask you, is the long-term, meaning the four-year kind of trend that we saw this quarter for Humira in Europe, is that still a good proxy for how you guys are thinking about the tail for Humira, just given we\u2019re coming up on four years in Europe and we\u2019re talking about high single-digit erosion still. So, I wanted to kind of ask you about the tail piece of what you expect in the U.S. And the second question, just on Rinvoq, I wanted to ask you also on the -- since the FDA labeling change, you just seen any changes with regard to persistent rates or new starts just on your feedback from the field and how docs view the safety of the JAK class. Thank you.\nRob Michael: Jeff, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take your first question. So, the way we\u2019ve talked about Humira erosion, it\u2019s played out in Europe as we saw that steep erosion in year one, more moderate erosion years beyond. In our modeling now, that\u2019s probably the best way to think about it is deep erosion year one, more moderate. You\u2019ll have an annualization impact in year two, but more moderate beyond that. And specifically within the Wave 1 countries, when we look at Europe, and the level of revenue we have this year relative to pre-LOE, we still have about 30% of the revenue footprint. So, it gives you a sense of where Europe is after four years. Obviously, as we model the U.S. out, and it will be more specific in the future, but right now, we\u2019re using Europe as an analog.\nJeff Stewart: And regarding Rinvoq in terms of perceptions from the field or what we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s largely developing as we predicted. So, we do see segments of physicians that are more wary of the JAKs after the label change. However, we anticipated that. So, we are starting to see a recovery in second line plus in RA as we anticipated. And the new indications because really we\u2019ll be the only JAK inhibitor with the four big indications of RA, PSA, AS and then non-radiographic ultimately in the fall. That just builds upon the confidence level of the physician. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re feeling from the field. I\u2019ll mention maybe some color on ulcerative colitis. I mentioned that we\u2019re encouraged on the ulcerative colitis start. So, we saw in the quarter because we launched in early April. We saw 600 unique gastroenterologists start to write prescriptions, which is quite interesting and good, a positive. And about half of those customers had never written a JAK inhibitor. So, Xeljanz was approved. And so, we\u2019re seeing, obviously, the ability of these customers to understand the overall risk benefit of Rinvoq relative to, let\u2019s say, another JAK inhibitor. So I feel that our communication is on track, and we\u2019re seeing positive feedback as we build the indications that we\u2019ve highlighted in the call.\nOperator: Our next question is Colin Bristow with UBS.\nColin Bristow: Another one on the \u201823 Humira guidance. Could you just walk us through -- at the point at the end of 3Q, what percentage of contracts or volume will you have confirmed at that point? And then, it sounds like that by the -- by the time you have the full year results, you\u2019re still anticipating that there could be a meaningful change. Could you just confirm that\u2019s a fair characterization? And then just on ABBV-154, what are you hoping to see with the Phase 2 data that we\u2019re going to get at year-end? And what\u2019s the threshold here that you need to surpass to move forward? Thanks.\nTom Hudson: Yes. So, if we look at the discussions that we\u2019ve highlighted and Rick highlighted, I think and they\u2019re progressing as we would expect. So typically, they start in the late spring. And look, these are complex negotiations. They go on for many, many months. In many years, we would have completed the -- at least the large PBM negotiations, which is the vast majority of the volume by that October time frame. In some cases, as you probably know, the payers would publish this information. But very often, not always, the immunology an inflammatory segment, those negotiations can go on longer, and they\u2019re very often published as a TBD in what used to be called the exclusionary formulary. So, we would -- as Rick mentioned, we would have visibility to sort of the status on the volume in that October time frame. That\u2019s a reasonable assumption. Again, I don\u2019t know for sure, given the complexity of biosimilar negotiation, which has never taken place before. But that\u2019s a reasonable way to think about when we\u2019d start to have the visibility to the volume component, as Rick highlighted.\nRoopal Thakkar: Yes. And it\u2019s Roopal on the 154 question. Dovetailing on what Tom just walked through, things that we want to see are consistent with how we develop in immunology, certainly raising standard of care. So, the way this was designed was to have that anti-TNF and then that direct delivery to avoid systemic side effects of the steroids. So, you\u2019d see sort of that one-two punch as Tom was describing and see that depth of response. So, once we see that type of information along with how it looks from a steroid standpoint, metabolic effects, bone effects taken together will give us a great sense of where it could fit before anti-TNFs, even after we\u2019re studying patients that have failed anti-TNFs in this Phase 2 study. So, taken together, that will give us a really good sense of where to go. And then remember, we\u2019re also going to get data in polymyalgia rheumatic. It\u2019s not an uncommon disease, and these patients are -- many of them are steroid-dependent, 50% or so three years and going and they can\u2019t withdraw from steroids and maybe a third can be 5 plus 6 years. They\u2019re stuck on steroids. So we\u2019ll see that data where we\u2019re able to prevent them from flaring and to be able to reduce their systemic steroid dose. So, there\u2019s multiple facets to this and potentially a number of opportunities and then later on in Crohn\u2019s disease as well.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Colin.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Two questions, if I could. For Skyrizi, if I could just return to this question of how you\u2019re thinking about the long-term guidance. I think on Skyrizi, recalling that you said $7.5 billion, consisting of about 6 from the psoriatic complex. And yet you\u2019re almost already approaching something close to $5 billion. So, can you tell us how you\u2019re thinking about how that could factor in any long-term thinking? And then, for epcoritamab, positioning of that treatment in the overall treatment paradigm. How are you thinking about that in relation to, for instance, CAR-T therapy treatment options before, after? Thank you.\nRob Michael: Chris, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take that question. So look, we\u2019re very encouraged by Skyrizi\u2019s continued strong performance. We remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed that 2025 guidance. Now, keep in mind, I mean, the Street also reflects that too. Street is about $400 million higher than that $7.5 billion. That said, we don\u2019t intend on frequently updating that guidance. Obviously, we\u2019ll provide that guidance update every few years or if there\u2019s an event or there\u2019s a major disconnect. So obviously, if the Street was way off, we want to point that out. But overall, we\u2019re very encouraged about the uptake for Skyrizi. It\u2019s clearly demonstrating its ability to drive long-term growth for AbbVie, and we\u2019ll provide an update for long-term guidance at the appropriate time.\nNeil Gallagher: Thanks. And on the epcoritamab question. So I\u2019m not going to go through all of the data points again, we\u2019ve described them several times in the public domain. What I would remind you of is that we\u2019ve observed extremely robust efficacy in a heavily pretreated population. Now it\u2019s true to say that 40% of those patients have sailed CAR-Ts, but 60% of those patients didn\u2019t sail CAR-T. Therefore, our expectation, our intention, rather, and as we\u2019ve mentioned earlier on in Tom\u2019s prepared remarks, we are anticipating filing for accelerated approval during the second half of this year. And I think that what you can expect is that we believe that the total population, the total relapsed/refractory population, whether or not they sail CAR-Ts should have access to epcoritamab because of the strength of the data overall. In terms of future positioning, we\u2019ve also discussed in the past our intention of initiating multiple phase -- additional Phase 3, the confirmatory study for the DLBCL application what would be the confirmatory study, the Phase 3 study is ongoing. That\u2019s in the relapsed/refractory setting. And our anticipation is that we will initiate multiple additional Phase 3s, both in DLBCL and other indications over the coming 12 to 18 months.\nJeff Stewart: Maybe I could just build on that. Chris, it\u2019s Jeff. So, we\u2019ve started to talk to different types of physicians, whether they\u2019re in the CAR-T centers or certainly the community centers. We\u2019re increasingly believing that this lymphoma is treated in the community centers. And so, what we hear, at least at a high level from our research so far is wow, that efficacy is incredibly impressive, even after CAR-T. But where they go is this simple subcu of epcoritamab may be the fastest way to deliver T cells to my patients I\u2019m dealing with. So to build on Neil\u2019s point, that data doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s niching the drug. In fact, it looks like it\u2019s sort of contributing to the idea of like this is a democratized type of medication for the lymphoma. So, it\u2019s very encouraging from our initial work that we\u2019re doing with physicians.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, we have time for one final question.\nOperator: And that question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much, and thanks for all the details on today\u2019s call. Rick, I was hoping that you could help us to understand the current M&A landscape, how would you characterize it broadly? And then, if you could also comment more specifically on AbbVie with respect to the transaction opportunity set for AbbVie. Thanks very much.\nRick Gonzalez: I think, if you look at the M&A environment, I think many players are trying to add to their portfolios. I think there\u2019s less of an appetite for larger transactions right now in general across the industry. Some of that\u2019s probably predicated on the fact that the FTC has been pretty tough in their language around larger kinds of transactions and your ability to be able to get those through. And I think as it relates to us, I mean, we have continued to execute the strategy that we put in place after the Allergan transaction. Allergan, obviously brought us a tremendous amount of diversity. That transaction has been highly successful and has really changed the look and the shape of AbbVie and it has clearly enhanced our performance, and we\u2019ve done quite well. Our focus is continuing to look for opportunities to be able to fill out our portfolio in areas that we believe there are opportunities to bring in strategic assets. We\u2019re probably working more on earlier-stage assets add to our R&D pipeline. Epcoritamab is a good example of the kinds of things that we\u2019re out looking for and finding, to supplement the overall pipeline. I think that strategy has worked well, and it\u2019s a strategy that we\u2019ll continue to do going forward.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, David. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. If you\u2019d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: And thank you. This does conclude the call. You may disconnect your line. And thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll briefly comment on our overall performance. Then Jeff, Tom, and Rob will review our second quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion was up 6.1% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. This performance reflects robust double-digit operational sales growth from immunology, where Skyrizi is exceeding our expectations with impressive market share gains in both psoriasis and PSA. Skyrizi\u2019s recent U.S. approval in Crohn\u2019s disease will add yet another source of long-term growth. As a result of the strong performance we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for Skyrizi. Rinvoq is also demonstrating strong growth. RA continues to perform in line with our expectations, following the label update, and we\u2019re making very good progress with all of the newly launched indications, including PSA, AS, atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis, which collectively represent a significant long-term growth opportunity. Neuroscience is another area with outstanding performance Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and Ubrelvy and Qulipta each demonstrated double-digit sequential sales growth. Pending regulatory approvals for Vraylar in major depressive disorder, Qulipta in chronic migraine and 951 for the treatment of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease represent additional near-term growth opportunities for our neuroscience portfolio. Turning now to aesthetics, Botox Cosmetics once again performed very well with sales up more than 20% on an operational basis. Demand for toxins remains strong with high teens growth in the U.S., despite inflation dynamics. As expected, Juvederm performance was negatively impacted by COVID-related lockdowns in China, as well as the suspension of our operations in Russia. Additionally, in the U.S., we had a difficult prior year comparison with a promotional event that we ran last year. We also saw a modest impact in the quarter due to economic pressures. We continue to expect positive full year growth for Juvederm driven by the lessening COVID impact in China and two new filler launches in the U.S. which will benefit growth in the second half of the year. In hematological oncology, Imbruvica continues to be unfavorably impacted by a delayed market recovery for new patients starting therapy in CLL and increasing competition. These ongoing dynamics will have an impact on Imbruvica\u2019s projected 2022 revenues. As a result, we will be adjusting our full-year guidance to reflect these impacts. Venclexta to continues to demonstrate robust share performance in both CLL and AML, with sales up double digits on an operational basis. Venclexta also has registrational studies ongoing in additional attractive indication, such as multiple myeloma in the t(11;14) patient population with Phase 3 data forthcoming, as well as high risk MDS. Additionally, we have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both, blood cancers and solid tumors, which are expected to support the next wave of AbbVie\u2019s growth in oncology. In summary, the diversity of our portfolio, once again allowed us to deliver another strong performance, despite the challenges we see in the CLL market and increasing Imbruvica competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well and are on pace to deliver approximately $7.5 billion in combined sales this year. Neuroscience demonstrated balanced double-digit growth driven by migraine and Vraylar and continued robust Botox cosmetic growth offset some of the U.S. inflationary impact to our filler and body contouring portfolios. As a result, we are confirming our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $13.78 to $13.98, representing growth of more than 17% at the midpoint. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on commercial highlights. Jeff? Okay. Andrew, this is Rick. Thank you for the questions. I\u2019ll cover the first one, and then Tom can cover the second one. So, we are in the process now, as we\u2019ve indicated before, of negotiating with the managed care organizations and the PBMs to establish our contract position for Humira in 2023. This is a normal time that you would go through that. It is progressing as we would expect. I would say we\u2019re midway through that process right now. I would expect it to conclude near the end of the third quarter, early the fourth quarter. At that point, that\u2019s an important part of refining our model for 2023 in particular. And what that will tell us is that the positions that we have formulary status for 2023 in for Humira, and that will help us define clearly the volume aspect of it. And so, that\u2019s going well, and that\u2019s going to be an important part of us being able to refine that model. And so, as we get further along in that process, that will give us the ability to be able to potentially refine the model that we have. Now, the one thing that\u2019s important to remember in all of this is price is the other key aspect here. And there, we won\u2019t know real pricing until the actual event starts to occur. So, we will make assumptions around what that price looks like. And I think those will be informed assumptions, but they are just that they\u2019re assumptions. And so, that\u2019s the one piece that will still be somewhat of an unknown until we see the landscape start to play out in 2023, and particularly in midway through 2023 when more biosimilars enter the market. So, as we get more information and we can provide more clarity, we\u2019ll certainly try to do that, but I think that\u2019s where we are right now. Tom? Okay. So, Terence, I\u2019ll take both of those questions, and then Rob can certainly jump in here if he has something he wants to add. We are maintaining the aesthetic guidance as we\u2019ve indicated. Certainly, we have seen good, strong performance on the toxin side of the business, and we would expect it to continue. As we look at the filler side of the business, as you\u2019ve noted, it was lighter this quarter than we\u2019ve seen historically. And I\u2019d say that was driven by a couple of issues. It was certainly driven by the China- Russia issue outside the U.S. In the U.S., we did have a very successful promotional program that we ran last year. So, it was a tough comparison versus last year. But I\u2019d also say, we have seen some glimpses of what could be inflationary pressure on that business or it could be pent-up demand for vacations. And Carrie can certainly go through more detail if there\u2019s a follow-up question. But I think as we look at the business overall, we\u2019re comfortable maintaining the guidance now. We believe that Botox will continue to perform very well. And obviously, we\u2019re doing more things to be able to drive the toxin side of the business. It\u2019s at a price point where it should be less sensitive to inflationary pressures. The price point for toxin is about $500, I think, right, Gary? And where fillers are almost twice that or maybe even a little more than twice that. So clearly, from a disposable income standpoint, fillers are more challenging for people than toxins are. And so that\u2019s the rationale behind it. And certainly, as we look at the overall performance of the AbbVie business, we have plenty of opportunities with the diversity of our portfolio to cover any potential shortfall if we ended up having an issue. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable maintaining the guidance. And I think we need to see more time play out here to see exactly where we are from a U.S. inflationary impact. On the second question, as it relates to an update on \u201823 and potentially something on \u201824. I think the way you\u2019ve described it is accurate. When we have more information, we\u2019ll try to provide that. And when we\u2019ve gotten to a point that certainly by the fourth quarter call, we\u2019re going to provide you guidance on what we think will happen in 2023. But if we can provide something on the third quarter call, I wouldn\u2019t be looking for guidance. I think that\u2019s not a good expectation. But certainly, potentially a little more clarification on what our contracting status looks like at that point and how that will translate into what we think. And if we can refine the model to a greater degree, we would certainly provide that. As it relates to 2024, certainly, I\u2019m not going to -- we\u2019re not in a position we\u2019re going to talk about 2024 right now. And I think that would be a little bit unlikely because not all these contracts will be two-year contracts. And so, you really won\u2019t know what your volume position is at that point. And as I said, you won\u2019t know what the pricing is going to be, particularly midway through the year. And so, I think those will be important things to be able to dial in to where the forecast is going. I\u2019d say, overall, we feel good about the contracting position that we\u2019re in. And then, I\u2019d say, the other thing is, I know investors really want to try to model this between \u201823 and \u201824. I understand why you want to do that. Certainly, we obviously would like to do that to the greatest degree possible. But, when you step back and you actually look at the performance of AbbVie and how you will value AbbVie and what AbbVie means going forward, it has relatively little to do with Humira, and that shape of that curve between \u201823 and \u201824. And certainly, by the end of \u201824, we should reach a point where we\u2019ve achieved some level of stability on the tail of Humira. What AbbVie is all about is these other products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq and Vraylar and Ubrelvy, the aesthetics business, Qulipta. Those are going to be the things that drive it. So, if you want to focus on something and it\u2019s what we focus on internally is that underlying growth engine that will emerge on the other side of whatever erosion Humira ends up suffering before it hit some level of stability and tail is those assets and then what comes out of the pipeline. Those are the key things that are going to create that growth between 25% and 30%. And that\u2019s the part that we -- I would say, we\u2019re obviously managing Humira to the greatest extent we can. But that\u2019s the part that we as a team are focusing on. And I think that\u2019s the most important part because that is the AbbVie going forward. Well, let me take a shot at that, and certainly, Jeff is closer to it. So, Jeff, if you want to add anything in, feel free to jump in and add. Typically, when you contract for an asset like Humira, you\u2019re contracting for a formulary position. And there aren\u2019t volume requirements or other kinds of requirements. I think it\u2019s also -- it would be prudent to assume that biosimilars will be on these contracts, whether it\u2019s one or more than one that will coexist with Humira. So, price plays an important role in that because they will coexist. And so, I\u2019d say -- and as that becomes fluid, you would have to make decisions around how you try to deal with that to maintain the kinds of volumes that you want to maintain. And we\u2019ve said all along, the strategy that we\u2019ll have in the U.S. is similar to the strategy that we had internationally, and that is maintain as much volume as we can at the highest level of profit that we can maintain it at. And that is the logic that we will employ. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have to be somewhat responsive to prices in the marketplace on Humira. Jeff, anything you\u2019d add? All right. Thanks, Steve. This is Rick. I\u2019ll cover the first one. And Roopal can cover the second one. So, you are correct. That is what I described a meeting or two ago as the four variables. I would say, when you think about interchangeability, I think you have to think about it in the backdrop of not just interchangeability, but also what is the profile that is the closest to Humira today? And we can look at all the biosimilars and have -- we have pretty good visibility as to what that profile looks like. And what I would say is, to get a profile that is interchangeable and is consistent with the current Humira that\u2019s predominantly in the marketplace today, that\u2019s probably going to occur in the summer of 2023. There should be one or two biosimilars that have a profile that looks like that. And that would make it somewhat easier for an organization to make a switch. So, I think that will play an important variable. Nothing has changed in the last few months in what that profile looks like. And then obviously, supply is an important aspect that certainly anyone that we\u2019re looking at making a significant change in their position with Humira is going to want to make sure that they\u2019re going with a company that has the ability to be able to produce at volume, at significant volumes, Humira, and they can do it sustainably. So, there are certain players that I would say clearly have that ability to be able to do it, similar to us. Certainly, no one does it at the scale of us or anywhere close to the scale of us. But there are also a lot of small players that I think supply is going to be an important aspect and going to somewhat limit the ability to be able to have broad market impact. And so, those are going to be important dynamics as we negotiate with the various managed care organizations. I can tell you that we\u2019re talking through those kinds of things with them. Roopal? Okay. So, I\u2019ll take the first question. I mean, I think if you look at the drug pricing proposal that\u2019s out there, it\u2019s certainly an important issue for us, and I think it\u2019s an important issue for patients. I think if I look at that bill, and I\u2019m assuming that if there were something that were to pass, it would be somewhat consistent with what was in the build back better for the Senate Finance text. And so far, it looks like that, but obviously evolving a bit here as we go along. And if I look at it in total, what I\u2019d say is there\u2019s a couple of positive things in there. Certainly, most notably, the $2,000 cap out-of-pocket costs for patients and the ability to be able to smooth, I think that\u2019s an important step in increasing affordability, especially for patients in Medicare Part D. And so, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been supportive of. We\u2019ve been vocal that we think that\u2019s an important step forward. What I\u2019d say on balance, this is a bill that has far more negatives than it has positives in it. And I think although it may not be short term that challenging from a financial standpoint, I think the long-term implications of this bill are pretty significant. And they really hinge around this so-called negotiation clause that\u2019s in there and how that\u2019s being implemented, particularly for small molecules. And if you\u2019re familiar with it, essentially what it says is that CMS or we\u2019re assuming it will be CMS, has the ability at a certain point in time to be able to negotiate a price on a set of drugs. And by the time you get there, it will be a big set of drugs that they\u2019ll have the ability to be able to negotiate on. And the key issue is this. Essentially, they have full latitude to basically decide whatever price they want the drug to be. And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it a negotiation because the only alternative that the manufacturer has is to accept a 95% penalty on their revenues or, in essence, take a 95% discount. So, it\u2019s not a negotiation. We should just call it what it is. It\u2019s price controls is what they\u2019re basically putting in place if the language stays the same. And ultimately, I think the real challenge is how we invest in this as an industry in innovation. If you take small molecules as an example, I\u2019ll walk you through an example that illustrates the point that I\u2019m going to raise here. If you take a small molecule, it says at year nine after the first approval, CMS has the right to be able to negotiate the price on that drug. So, if you take an oncology drug as an example, how do we develop oncology drugs in this industry? And what do the regulatory authorities typically require us to do, to be able to develop an oncology drug. Well, they typically require you to do and what we typically do is we go to patients who have failed on all the existing therapies, fourth-line patients, fifth-line patients. And we take whatever drug we have and we determine, do we have a positive benefit risk in that patient population. If we find that we do, then we seek approval for that drug in that patient population, so that those patients will get the benefit of that drug. And then, we start to work our way up towards front line. Those who refractory patients are typically very small populations of patients, right? And you can never get a return on a drug just on that patient population. And then, you work your way up to front line, or second line, or wherever you end up. That process typically takes 7 to 9 years because of the length of the trials. So essentially, with this, by the time you got to the larger populations, you\u2019d be within a year or two of when CMS could change the price. But one, it\u2019s impossible to figure out what the return is going to be, so how do you invest? Two, it really puts negative pressure on you not to continue to develop new indications. But the most detrimental part of it is to patients who need these drugs or small indications or in later stage. Because you\u2019re faced with the dilemma -- and this is a horrible dilemma, right, as a company and for patients. You\u2019re faced with a dilemma of do I choose not to seek approval in those late-stage patients, so I don\u2019t start the clock and wait until I\u2019m closer to frontline before I start the clock. That is not the right policy. And I would say, on balance, this bill will have a couple of things that are good for patients that I\u2019m fully supportive of. But unless Congress wants to harm patients and harm innovation in this industry, they need to change that part of it. It doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s shortsighted. Now, they can change it in a couple of different ways. They can determine, okay, what is a floor price or a maximum discount by year and then you can calculate the return on investment that you\u2019re going to have on the drug or they can at least make it consistent with biologics that are out 13 years. Otherwise, the investment in small molecule oncology drugs or neuroscience drugs, which Medicare patient populations are highly dependent on new innovative drugs in those areas because they\u2019re elderly patients, are going to suffer. And the CBO report that was published back in April of last year clearly pointed that out. So, this isn\u2019t something I\u2019m just saying or industry is just saying. And in fact, if anything, I\u2019d say, they probably undercall the magnitude of the impact. So, this is an important issue. We all know the affordability and access for Medicare patients is important. But you don\u2019t need to destroy the innovation model in the process in order to provide that. And so, I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019ll see some movement here and some rationality will play out. I think, if you look at the M&A environment, I think many players are trying to add to their portfolios. I think there\u2019s less of an appetite for larger transactions right now in general across the industry. Some of that\u2019s probably predicated on the fact that the FTC has been pretty tough in their language around larger kinds of transactions and your ability to be able to get those through. And I think as it relates to us, I mean, we have continued to execute the strategy that we put in place after the Allergan transaction. Allergan, obviously brought us a tremendous amount of diversity. That transaction has been highly successful and has really changed the look and the shape of AbbVie and it has clearly enhanced our performance, and we\u2019ve done quite well. Our focus is continuing to look for opportunities to be able to fill out our portfolio in areas that we believe there are opportunities to bring in strategic assets. We\u2019re probably working more on earlier-stage assets add to our R&D pipeline. Epcoritamab is a good example of the kinds of things that we\u2019re out looking for and finding, to supplement the overall pipeline. I think that strategy has worked well, and it\u2019s a strategy that we\u2019ll continue to do going forward."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks. Yes. So, 154 is our anti-TNF conjugated steroid, as you mentioned, and it\u2019s enabled to target delivery of steroid directly to inflammatory cells. So, we do have that Phase 2 running several hundred patients, and we still anticipate getting read later this year and then further data to follow next year. Yes. And it\u2019s Roopal on the 154 question. Dovetailing on what Tom just walked through, things that we want to see are consistent with how we develop in immunology, certainly raising standard of care. So, the way this was designed was to have that anti-TNF and then that direct delivery to avoid systemic side effects of the steroids. So, you\u2019d see sort of that one-two punch as Tom was describing and see that depth of response. So, once we see that type of information along with how it looks from a steroid standpoint, metabolic effects, bone effects taken together will give us a great sense of where it could fit before anti-TNFs, even after we\u2019re studying patients that have failed anti-TNFs in this Phase 2 study. So, taken together, that will give us a really good sense of where to go. And then remember, we\u2019re also going to get data in polymyalgia rheumatic. It\u2019s not an uncommon disease, and these patients are -- many of them are steroid-dependent, 50% or so three years and going and they can\u2019t withdraw from steroids and maybe a third can be 5 plus 6 years. They\u2019re stuck on steroids. So we\u2019ll see that data where we\u2019re able to prevent them from flaring and to be able to reduce their systemic steroid dose. So, there\u2019s multiple facets to this and potentially a number of opportunities and then later on in Crohn\u2019s disease as well."

What I would remind you of is that we\u2019ve observed extremely robust efficacy in a heavily pretreated population. Now it\u2019s true to say that 40% of those patients have sailed CAR-Ts, but 60% of those patients didn\u2019t sail CAR-T. Therefore, our expectation, our intention, rather, and as we\u2019ve mentioned earlier on in Tom\u2019s prepared remarks, we are anticipating filing for accelerated approval during the second half of this year. And I think that what you can expect is that we believe that the total population, the total relapsed/refractory population, whether or not they sail CAR-Ts should have access to epcoritamab because of the strength of the data overall. In terms of future positioning, we\u2019ve also discussed in the past our intention of initiating multiple phase -- additional Phase 3, the confirmatory study for the DLBCL application what would be the confirmatory study, the Phase 3 study is ongoing. That\u2019s in the relapsed/refractory setting. And our anticipation is that we will initiate multiple additional Phase 3s, both in DLBCL and other indications over the coming 12 to 18 months."

            "name": "Tom Hudson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. I\u2019ll start with immunology where we had several notable pipeline updates in our inflammatory bowel disease programs for both, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We recently received FDA approval for Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s disease, and we\u2019re very pleased with the label which reflects a strong benefit risk profile that Skyrizi demonstrated as an induction and maintenance treatment for this condition. Based on its profile, we believe Skyrizi will be a highly effective and differentiated treatment option for patients with Crohn\u2019s disease. Our regulatory application for Skyrizi in Crohn\u2019s disease remains under review in Europe with an approval decision expected near the end of this year. Also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. And we\u2019re excited to bring this new, highly efficacious oral option to patients suffering from this often debilitating disease. In the quarter, we also completed a registrational program for Rinvoq in Crohn\u2019s disease, reporting positive top line results from our Phase 3 maintenance study. We recently submitted our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in this indication and expect approval decisions next year. Once approved for Crohn\u2019s disease, Rinvoq will have completed development programs for all the major rheum and gastro indications covered by Humira plus atopic dermatitis. The strength of the data generated in our clinical programs should position Rinvoq as a highly differentiated treatment across this broad indication set and enable Rinvoq to deliver significant value to AbbVie over the long term. And just this morning, we announced that we received European approval for Rinvoq in non-radiographic Axial SpA, which rounds out Rinvoq\u2019s label in rheumatology. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline. At the recent EHA meeting, we presented results from the large B-cell lymphoma expansion cohort in the Phase 2 study evaluating epcoritamab in patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. In this study, epcoritamab was well tolerated and drove very deep and durable responses in challenging to treat highly refractory patients with large B-cell lymphoma. We recently discussed these results with regulatory agencies and based on the strength of the data, we intend to submit regulatory applications later this year for accelerated approval of epcoritamab in patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. We expect approval decisions in 2023. We continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on track to see results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. As a reminder, we\u2019ve seen very promising results in this population in prior clinical studies with Venclexta showing high overall response rates and meaningful trends towards prolonged progression-free survival. The level of efficacy we\u2019ve seen suggests that t(11;14) patients may be particularly responsive to Venclexta and this agent has the potential to become an important biomarker-driven treatment option in the multiple myeloma market. In neuroscience, following successful completion of our Phase 3 chronic migraine prevention study, we submitted our regulatory application to the FDA for Qulipta in chronic migraine. Chronic migraine is defined as 15 or more headache days per month with at least 8 of those days associated with migraines. This is a debilitating disease that affects nearly 10% of people suffering from migraine, significantly impacting their quality of life. If approved, this would be another differentiating feature for Qulipta as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. We also submitted data from our Phase 3 prevention studies in both, chronic and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the U.S. We expect approval decisions in the U.S. and in Europe in 2023. In the quarter, we submitted our regulatory application in the U.S. for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. This innovative delivery system has the potential to become a transformative treatment option for patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease by providing DUOPA-like efficacy with less invasive nonsurgical administration. We also expect to submit our regulatory application in Europe later this year with approval decisions anticipated in both, the U.S. and Europe in 2023. Now, I\u2019d like to provide a few updates on some earlier-stage programs where we have new data and are advancing programs in development. In immunology, we recently obtained encouraging data in a Phase 2 study evaluating Rinvoq in systemic lupus, an autoimmune multisystem disease. In our study, Rinvoq demonstrated greater response rates as well as a reduction in flares compared with placebo. We\u2019ll see longer-term data in the coming months, which will allow us to make a decision on moving Rinvoq into Phase 3 for lupus. In oncology, where we have a pipeline of promising early-stage programs aimed at solid tumors, we are beginning to see very exciting data from several programs. Our anti-GARP antibody, ABBV-151 is designed to block the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory T cells, which leads to increased T cell effector functions in the tumor microenvironment. This reactivates the immune system against tumors, enhancing the antitumor immune response triggered by a PD-1 inhibitor. In our Phase 1 program, we\u2019re combining 151 with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in cancer patients who are refractory to or relapsed after PD-1 as well as evaluating this combination in PD-1 nonresponsive tumors. Based on the preliminary efficacy we\u2019ve seen in the dose expansion cohorts for multiple solid tumors, including a deepening of responses over time and prolonged durability, we recently declared proof-of-concept for 151. We plan to advance to Phase 2 in several solid tumors, starting with urothelial cancer. We\u2019re also expecting additional data readouts later this year in other solid tumor indications, including colorectal cancer, which may enable further expansion studies in this hard-to-treat cancer type. We will also begin new studies to explore a broader set of solid tumors where GARP is implicated as a critical immunosuppressive pathway, based on tumor tissue analyses. We\u2019re also making excellent progress with our next-generation c-Met ABBV-400, where the emerging clinical data is very promising in several solid tumors. This asset is similar to Teliso-V as c-MET ADC that uses a microtubulin inhibitor payload. Teliso-V received breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with a subtype of lung cancer with high levels of c-Met overexpression. The toxin warhead for 400 uses a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload, which is similar to irinotecan, a chemotherapy that is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. By targeting c-MET positive tumors with ADCs bearing different warheads we believe we can broaden the range of solid tumors where c-MET therapies can be used. In our Phase 1 program, we are seeing good responses in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and remain encouraged by these early efficacy signals. So in summary, we\u2019ve seen tremendous progress across all stages of our pipeline in the first half of the year, and we remain on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2022. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? Thank you. Andrew, I\u2019ll try to break down the question in different parts because you\u2019re right, there are many TGF-beta assets. This one is unique, GARP. Most of the TGF-beta assets work either antibodies against receptors to be active for TGF-beta or TGF-beta itself that\u2019s in circulation on cells. But GARP blocks the inactive form of TGF-beta before it\u2019s released from TGF-beta. And we believe that actually is a differentiated mechanism, also allows that specificity to what\u2019s happening in TGF-beta in the tumor as opposed to other systems in the body. At the beginning of this, we thought -- we had already had people that published that they are very good TGF-beta signatures that exist. And I can tell you that GARP signature follows tracks with TGF-beta signatures. And that\u2019s often seen in all solid tumors as susceptive tumors that express these pathways. It\u2019s a very common immunosuppressive mechanism. That\u2019s why people and us are interested in it. We learned -- initially, from data, we kind of suspected that people who actually had a nice hot tumors but were not responding to PD-1, often had, at least from published work -- actually had a higher TGF-beta signature. So, we thought that was a reason to mechanism why these patients with hot tumors were not responding. And a lot of our initial clinical strategy there was actually to go after hot tumors where PD-1s had relapsed or refractory. And we thought we could augment the PD-1 checkpoint response by doing this combination. We did not see monotherapy activity, but in combination, we did. And that\u2019s why our first data sets and expansions like I\u2019ve just discussed in urothelial cancer, this project started earlier, we\u2019re seeing data that\u2019s suggesting that this is correct that you need to reflect both the pathway of TGF-beta and PD-1, to get a response. And those, again, in multiple tumor types we\u2019re seeing these responses and we\u2019re moving forward. At the same time, to bring it to colon, we could also see the same signatures of TGF-beta and GARP in cold tumors, but we weren\u2019t sure that since they\u2019re not IO responsive, whether we\u2019d get a response, we would get a clinical response. So, we did start some investigations. And yes, we did see some responses in cold tumors. They happen over time, sometimes they appear, the tumors are stable for 3 months, maybe 6 months, and then you see these responses appear. They\u2019re very durable, 1 year, 2 year, very unusual. These are patients with advanced disease that have very poor prognosis in Phase 1 studies. So, we saw some, I would say -- we sometimes say in academic column exceptional responders. And so, we decided to expand. So, those data sets are newer, are happening right now. I probably will have the data at the end of this year. But yes, we\u2019ve seen responses to this combination. And to answer your question, so the signatures we\u2019re looking at are not the CMS or kind of histology-based signatures on the tumor. It\u2019s more signatures of the inflammatory response that we can measure in the tumor, and it has to do with both, inflammatory T cells, which are there for the killing, but also the inhibitory TGF-beta signatures. And of course, we\u2019re going to continue to investigate this. I don\u2019t have all the answers for you today, but it certainly has been exciting to see how this program has evolved. Maybe I\u2019ll take this one. This is Tom Hudson. I\u2019m a clinical immunologist, and I know how we\u2019ve been using steroids, they can give very profound and deep immunosuppression, decrease inflammation, and that\u2019s often used in severe cases when patient shows up. So, we know that the response is very strong, but there are a lot of side effects. And, when our problem is always weaning, the steroid\u2019s out in the clinic. So here, again, the combination of immunomodulator like TNF and steroid have that potential of giving us that deep, deep response very quickly to remove the immunosuppression. And based on the data we\u2019ve seen preclinically in our Phase 1 studies, we\u2019re not seeing those biomarkers or side effects in the bone or brain, a cortisol or others. So we\u2019ve already demonstrated that, and we have nice data. The other -- so that\u2019s my enthusiasm. We expect to see deep responses, durable responses with much well better tolerated than steroids. Our program -- and we\u2019ve shown this also is that we\u2019ve actually believed in the platform and we\u2019re developing steroid ADCs for other targets to target other immune systems -- other immune cells, more specifically around some T cells or some B cells or some fibroblasts. These programs are coming forward. We think this is a profound platform in immunology to go after different biologies -- in very targeted steroid suppression of different specific immune cell types, and that\u2019s going to play out over the next couple of years. So, based on the data we saw, we expanded the platform to other biomarkers getting into other specific immune cell types. Of course, we\u2019re quiet because we need to see the data, all -- the study has been fully recruited, actually moved faster than we expected. And the day was randomized. We\u2019re just going to see the data in the fall because it\u2019s a blinded study. But the enthusiasm is there. And we\u2019re also, of course, seeing that data, and then we have PMR because we also started studies there in Crohn\u2019s disease. We\u2019ll see that data later, but the more data we have, the more likely we\u2019re going to expand this program to other indications where we believe that deep steroid suppression with TNF might actually bring new solutions for patients. Yes. So, if we look at the discussions that we\u2019ve highlighted and Rick highlighted, I think and they\u2019re progressing as we would expect. So typically, they start in the late spring. And look, these are complex negotiations. They go on for many, many months. In many years, we would have completed the -- at least the large PBM negotiations, which is the vast majority of the volume by that October time frame. In some cases, as you probably know, the payers would publish this information. But very often, not always, the immunology an inflammatory segment, those negotiations can go on longer, and they\u2019re very often published as a TBD in what used to be called the exclusionary formulary. So, we would -- as Rick mentioned, we would have visibility to sort of the status on the volume in that October time frame. That\u2019s a reasonable assumption. Again, I don\u2019t know for sure, given the complexity of biosimilar negotiation, which has never taken place before. But that\u2019s a reasonable way to think about when we\u2019d start to have the visibility to the volume component, as Rick highlighted."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. I\u2019m very pleased with the momentum across our therapeutic portfolio, including the continued progress we\u2019re making with new product and recent indication launches. I\u2019ll start with our immunology portfolio, which delivered total revenues of $7.2 billion, reflecting growth of 19.2% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were approximately $5.4 billion, up 6.8% on an operational basis with 9.6% growth in the U.S., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 7.3% operationally due to biosimilar competition. Skyrizi is performing extremely well, well ahead of our expectations. Global revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 33% on a sequential basis. We continue to advance our leadership position in psoriasis where Skyrizi\u2019s total prescription share of the U.S. biological market has increased to approximately 26%, driven by an in-play share of new and switching patients that is now approaching 50%. We have also achieved in-play market share leadership in 23 key international markets, including Japan, Germany, France, Canada, and Australia.  Psoriatic arthritis is also adding significantly to Skyrizi\u2019s momentum, where we are now approved in 54 countries. In the U.S. dermatology segment, where approximately 30% of patients exhibit both skin and joint involvement, Skyrizi is already achieving an in-play patient share of nearly 20%. We have also launched Skyrizi for PSA in rheumatology, where we\u2019re seeing strong utilization, which is driving accelerated share growth. Our recent launch of Skyrizi for Crohn\u2019s disease in the U.S. represents the first new biologic approval in six years for an area where there continues to be considerable unmet need. We believe Skyrizi represents a highly effective and differentiated treatment option for Crohn\u2019s patients, including the potential to provide meaningful levels of endoscopic improvement with novel and infrequent dosing. Managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for this indication in the coming months. Turning now to Rinvoq, where we\u2019re seeing good momentum across each of the approved indications. Global sales of $592 million were up more than 27% on a sequential basis. Prescriptions in RA remained strong with a total market share of 5.8% in the U.S. and approximately 6% across key international markets. Rinvoq is now achieving an in-play RA share of approximately 13% in the U.S. In PSA, Rinvoq continues to see nice uptake, especially in the room segment with commercial access now equal to RA. We also recently received FDA approval for ankylosing spondylitis and European approval for non-radiographic Axial SpA, further expanding Rinvoq\u2019s potential across rheumatology. In atopic dermatitis, new patient starts are tracking in line with our expectations with Rinvoq\u2019s in-play patient share in the mid-teens. Strong commercial access in AD, which is also now equal to RA and PSA, is expected to considerably increase paid prescription volume in this highly underpenetrated market over the remainder of the year. Lastly, our recent launch of Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis in the U.S. is progressing well. And we recently just received European approval for the same indication. Commercial access in the U.S. is ramping strongly, and we are seeing encouraging new patient starts. Physician feedback regarding Rinvoq\u2019s approved profile in UC has been favorable, especially given the very high rates of remission and endoscopic improvement demonstrated across our UC development program. The addressable patient population for Rinvoq in UC is substantial, with nearly 50% of patients currently on or having used TNF therapy. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 7.9% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.1% and below our expectations. The CLO market continues to remain challenging in the U.S. with new patient starts down double digits relative to pre-pandemic levels. Now, as you may recall, our initial 2022 Imbruvica sales guidance contemplated a partial market recovery, which, unfortunately, we have not yet observed. In fact, the latest data reflects new patient starts in the U.S. were actually down high single digits versus last year. So, based on recent trends, we no longer believe it\u2019s prudent to anticipate a meaningful market recovery in CLL over the second half of this year. Therefore, we will be removing this assumption from our 2022 guidance. In addition, increasing competition from newer therapies, including other BTK inhibitors as well as our own Venclexta also continue to lower Imbruvica\u2019s share of new patient starts, especially in frontline CLL. Despite this increasing competitive pressure, Imbruvica continues to be the total market share leader across all lines of therapy in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $505 million, up 21.2% on an operational basis. In CLL, we continue to see share gains in the U.S. and across all major international markets. We\u2019re also seeing continued strong performance in AML. Venclexta is now approved in 80 countries and in many markets is already considered the new standard of care for frontline AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. As a result, we are seeing ramping market share throughout the countries where we have launched. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of $492 million were up 13.9% on an operational basis, reflecting continued share gains in the U.S. atypical antipsychotic market. Our launch preparations remain well underway in anticipation of our MDD approval in the fourth quarter. This is a potentially large indication that would represent incremental upside to our current projections for Vraylar. Within migraine, Ubrelvy remains the market-leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine with revenue of $185 million, up 34% on a sequential basis. Qulipta continues to increase its leading new-to-brand share in the U.S. preventative CGRP class when we consider both, paid and bridge volume. We continue to make good progress with expanded commercial access, which will support strong Qulipta sales growth over the remainder of this year. We are also pursuing the commercial approval for Qulipta as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine in the U.S. as well as a new therapy for Europe, potentially further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well in chronic migraine as well as its other indications with total sales of $678 million, up 14.5% on an operational basis. So overall, I\u2019m pleased with the commercial execution across the therapeutic business. Our broad portfolio of differentiated therapies and new launches is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D programs. Tom? No, I think that\u2019s -- Rick, that\u2019s a very reasonable way to look at it in terms of how these negotiations are going and how we see \u201823 playing out. I mean, the real big ones in terms of how we look at it is the two big scenarios are you are likely coexisting with one or more biosimilars or if the negotiations don\u2019t go the way that we anticipate that were excluded in favor of biosimilars. And that\u2019s basically where price and volume -- in terms of refining our model, for \u201823. That\u2019s the work that we\u2019re doing over the summer and then into the fall. Yes. Thank you. It\u2019s Jeff. Thanks for the question. So, your instinct and observation is right. The big dynamic change for Skyrizi here, largely what you\u2019re seeing is from the psoriatic arthritis indication. And obviously saw very, very large sequential moves. And let me give you some sense of what we\u2019re looking at. So, we\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re putting more and more basically headroom into the overall share position, first in psoriatic disease, so that\u2019s psoriasis plus PSA. So, we\u2019re at 26% in terms of total TRx share and moving very, very nicely up. So, that\u2019s being driven by this PSA acceleration. So first, remember that the PSA indication, we were the -- really the last large product that didn\u2019t have that indication. So first, what happens is it starts to interact very positively in the dermatology segment. So, as I mentioned, about 30% of patients both have skin and joint involvement. And so we actually had a lower despite the fact that we had the leading psoriasis share, we had a lower psoriasis share because we weren\u2019t covered with the joints with that indication. So, you see an immediate, very rapid acceleration of our overall derm business that I highlighted. Secondly, strategically important to the performance is that we\u2019re able to launch the PSA indication for Skyrizi in rheumatology. So, it starts to work together with the Rinvoq PSA indication, and the rheum segment is 3 times as large as the derm segment. So, it\u2019s a very, very good dynamic in terms of our momentum in two large segments, even before we get to Crohn\u2019s. Now, I would say that as we\u2019ve talked about before, I mean, Skyrizi is a very special product, very unique dosing, very stable, incredible efficacy. And so, we are encouraged on the early results of Crohn\u2019s. It\u2019s too early to start to see numbers or et cetera. But all of that is playing into the raise that Rob talked about. And maybe I can also then chime in on the second question. Certainly, that is a -- the new assets are a very important part of our growth story for hem/onc. Certainly, as I mentioned, we\u2019re still continuing to ramp around the world with CLL. We have more and more impressive data, particularly in the unfit frontline population. We have five years of data in the fit population for frontline for Venclexta. We\u2019re encouraged with the myeloma data, which is very unique in terms of biomarker driven approach for the (11;14). Navitoclax would be really one of the first new entrants for myelofibrosis, where there\u2019s really only been rocks in terms of that market. Epcoritamab, increasingly encouraging data in terms of the simple subcu, very rapid ways to get this medication in later lines and then building into frontline. So we are very, very encouraged while we see some pressure on Imbruvica, the new indications in base for Venclexta helps to offset that. And then we start to build with those near-term hem assets and super encouraged in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the probability that we can get there. In terms of your second question, again, it\u2019s Jeff. Thanks for that. We\u2019re -- we don\u2019t see some significant pressures on Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Now, we always have discussions with the payers, we look at our contracting strategy. But I think we fall back on our clinical evidence that we have on these two major assets. I mean, we have four head-to-head trials against other major competitors with Skyrizi, where we have just really growth superiority versus whether it\u2019s an IL-17, whether it\u2019s Humira, which one day will be biosimilar, STELARA, et cetera. So just the pure performance there and the momentum, it\u2019s clearly a distinguished asset. We\u2019re going to be first in terms of Crohn\u2019s to start to establish that new area and build the market there. And I think on Rinvoq to some degree, there\u2019s only one other JAK inhibitor that is not going to have the scope of indications and it\u2019s Xeljanz. And Xeljanz has been significantly wounded based on the oral surveillance data. So, in terms of our ability to build and protect and grow Skyrizi and Rinvoq into the next stage of development, we\u2019re quite confident that we have the assets to be able to do that. Okay. And to address your 951 -- hi, it\u2019s Jeff. Thanks for the question. So, I think some perspective is globally, DUOPA is about $0.5 billion brand. And certainly, we\u2019ve said that we believe that 951 could certainly double that up or more. I\u2019ll give you the perspective of why we think that way. So, if you look at the advanced Parkinson\u2019s patients, about 85% sort of cycle when they stay on these generic orals that become less and less and less effective. And the only thing they can really do, and that\u2019s about 15% of the market, the advanced Parkinson market, is they can move to either deep brain stimulation or DUOPA. But you got to go through a surgical barrier. So, the families and the patients are forced to think if I need to get improvement in my symptoms and my quality of life, I\u2019m forced to basically think about do I get a hole in my head or a hole in my stomach with a gastric surgery. This is going to be a subcu. And so, we see in our market research that at least 40% to 60% of people never want to move towards DBS or DUOPA. So, we think this is a way where we can start to expand and create a new market segment, in essence, a subcutaneous segment where you don\u2019t have to take that risk on the surgery. And like you mentioned in the movement disorder centers, there\u2019s a significant amount of experts that are excited about this new option, and we believe that it\u2019s going to be a real innovation for patients without having the surgery. And regarding Rinvoq in terms of perceptions from the field or what we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s largely developing as we predicted. So, we do see segments of physicians that are more wary of the JAKs after the label change. However, we anticipated that. So, we are starting to see a recovery in second line plus in RA as we anticipated. And the new indications because really we\u2019ll be the only JAK inhibitor with the four big indications of RA, PSA, AS and then non-radiographic ultimately in the fall. That just builds upon the confidence level of the physician. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re feeling from the field. I\u2019ll mention maybe some color on ulcerative colitis. I mentioned that we\u2019re encouraged on the ulcerative colitis start. So, we saw in the quarter because we launched in early April. We saw 600 unique gastroenterologists start to write prescriptions, which is quite interesting and good, a positive. And about half of those customers had never written a JAK inhibitor. So, Xeljanz was approved. And so, we\u2019re seeing, obviously, the ability of these customers to understand the overall risk benefit of Rinvoq relative to, let\u2019s say, another JAK inhibitor. So I feel that our communication is on track, and we\u2019re seeing positive feedback as we build the indications that we\u2019ve highlighted in the call. Maybe I could just build on that. Chris, it\u2019s Jeff. So, we\u2019ve started to talk to different types of physicians, whether they\u2019re in the CAR-T centers or certainly the community centers. We\u2019re increasingly believing that this lymphoma is treated in the community centers. And so, what we hear, at least at a high level from our research so far is wow, that efficacy is incredibly impressive, even after CAR-T. But where they go is this simple subcu of epcoritamab may be the fastest way to deliver T cells to my patients I\u2019m dealing with. So to build on Neil\u2019s point, that data doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s niching the drug. In fact, it looks like it\u2019s sort of contributing to the idea of like this is a democratized type of medication for the lymphoma. So, it\u2019s very encouraging from our initial work that we\u2019re doing with physicians."

            "name": "Carrie Strom",
            "content": "Hi. This is Carrie. I\u2019ll take your first question around Juvederm. And as Rick said, there was a onetime promotional event that we ran in the U.S. for Juvederm in Q2 of last year, and it was highly successful, and it increased sales in the sales space, which created the challenging prior year comparison. So, that was the key driver. But as you noted, there is also this impact -- economic impact that is suggestive of some early changes in consumer behavior. And that really isn\u2019t surprising in light of the inflationary pressures that we\u2019re seeing on discretionary income. And as Rick said, the filler market is likely more sensitive to that than toxins for a few reasons. We mentioned the price point. So a price point of closer to $1,000 versus $500 for toxin, also the nature of the filler business is different than toxin from a patient dynamic and treatment dynamic and that there are more -- there\u2019s a longer interval between treatments for fillers versus toxin, which is sort of like a more regular treatment paradigm a few times a year. Also, the patient bases are different. When you think about the toxin patient base and Botox Cosmetic, the majority of the patient base is continuing patients versus more of a reliance on new patient acquisition. And so, those are some of the factors we\u2019re thinking about when we think about the deceleration of the filler market in Q2 but while the market has slowed and despite the performance in Q2, we do continue to expect a positive second half growth for U.S. Juvederm, really weighted more in the fourth quarter as we\u2019re going to launch two new fillers in the fourth quarter. And those two new fillers will get us into incremental categories for HA fillers, including jawline and skin quality, which will help to drive some incremental demand at the end of the year. And in terms of your question around economic impact outside of the U.S., we are watching that very closely, and we really have not seen that yet outside of the U.S."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom. AbbVie\u2019s second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diversified portfolio. Momentum from new products and recently launched indications allows us to maintain our earnings outlook despite market dynamics for Imbruvica, higher inflation and the stronger U.S. dollar. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, reflecting growth of 11.2% compared to prior year and $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.14 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.6 billion, up 6.1% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 220 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.8% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.8% of sales. Net interest expense was $532 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 13.4%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are confirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance between $13.78 and $13.98. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $58.9 billion, reflecting growth of 6.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.7% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated assumptions. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $4.8 billion, an increase of $400 million due to strong market share performance. For Imbruvica, we now expect global revenue of approximately $4.7 billion, given the lack of recovery in the CLL market and increasing competition. Moving to the P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales and continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. Turning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.1% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.55 and $3.59. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, we delivered strong performance again this quarter, including meaningful contributions from new products and recently launched indications. Given the momentum of our business as well as our pipeline advancements, we are well positioned for the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz. And Gary, this is Rob. Just on the guidance. So, if you recall, earlier in the year, we got asked the question, I said PSA for Skyrizi was going to contribute about $200 million this year. It\u2019s probably closer to $400 million now with the guidance range, given the very nice uptick we\u2019ve seen in PSA. But part of that guidance raise is also the strong share performance in psoriasis. So, it includes both. In terms of Crohn\u2019s, that hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019ve set approximately $100 million this year as we ramp access for Crohn\u2019s. But obviously, the long-term potential for it is tremendous, and we\u2019re very excited about that. And Chris, this is Rob. As Jeff said, I mean, we expect this to be market expanding. At the JPMorgan conference earlier this year, we did give peak revenue guidance for 951 greater than $1 billion. Obviously, DUOPA is $0.5 billion now. If you\u2019re modeling it, obviously, there\u2019ll be some level of cannibalization, I\u2019d say, minor level of cannibalization on Duodopa. But when you think about the combination between 951 and Duodopa, obviously, it\u2019s going to grow the revenue for the Company and expand the market. So Tim, this is Rob. On your first question, what we\u2019ve said -- we\u2019ve talked about this 45% with a range around that plus or minus 10% and using, obviously, the Europe analog as an example. And in that case, with the steep erosion year one and \u201823, you would expect then the trough to be in \u201823 and return to growth in \u201824. As this plays out, we\u2019ll see how that shakes out. Ultimately, if more of it happens in \u201824, you obviously have another year of growth for all your growth brands. And so, you have a different floor in that scenario. But most importantly, it\u2019s what happens in \u201825 and beyond. When you look at this company with the growth drivers we have, we\u2019ll be delivering high-single-digit growth in \u201825 and beyond, which is industry-leading. We\u2019ll have the lowest LOE exposure in the industry in the second half of this decade. And so, we\u2019re focused on the long term, we feel very good about the prospects of this business. But as it stands now, the most recent direction we\u2019ve given is expect that first year erosion, so that 45% plus or minus 10%, which then play out to a return to growth in \u201824. We\u2019ll obviously update the market as we see it play out next year. Jeff, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take your first question. So, the way we\u2019ve talked about Humira erosion, it\u2019s played out in Europe as we saw that steep erosion in year one, more moderate erosion years beyond. In our modeling now, that\u2019s probably the best way to think about it is deep erosion year one, more moderate. You\u2019ll have an annualization impact in year two, but more moderate beyond that. And specifically within the Wave 1 countries, when we look at Europe, and the level of revenue we have this year relative to pre-LOE, we still have about 30% of the revenue footprint. So, it gives you a sense of where Europe is after four years. Obviously, as we model the U.S. out, and it will be more specific in the future, but right now, we\u2019re using Europe as an analog. Chris, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take that question. So look, we\u2019re very encouraged by Skyrizi\u2019s continued strong performance. We remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed that 2025 guidance. Now, keep in mind, I mean, the Street also reflects that too. Street is about $400 million higher than that $7.5 billion. That said, we don\u2019t intend on frequently updating that guidance. Obviously, we\u2019ll provide that guidance update every few years or if there\u2019s an event or there\u2019s a major disconnect. So obviously, if the Street was way off, we want to point that out. But overall, we\u2019re very encouraged about the uptake for Skyrizi. It\u2019s clearly demonstrating its ability to drive long-term growth for AbbVie, and we\u2019ll provide an update for long-term guidance at the appropriate time."

Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our overall performance, then Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our first quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. I'm pleased with the excellent start to 2022. It further reinforces our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the business. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenue of more than $13.5 billion was up 5.4% on an operational basis, also above our expectations. These results demonstrate strong momentum across several key products and portfolios, including robust double-digit operational revenue growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well. We are achieving impressive market share gains in psoriasis, which remains a significant market opportunity. Skyrizi's recent launch in psoriatic arthritis as well as the anticipated regulatory approval in Crohn's disease should also serve as important growth drivers over the long-term. Rinvoq is also contributing compelling sales growth. Subscription trends in RA have recently stabilized as we expected and we are making excellent progress repositioning the brand as the leading second-line agent based on the robust data generated across our broad development programs. The early launch trends for Rinvoq in both atopic dermatitis and psoriatic arthritis are highly encouraging, with commercial access and paid prescriptions expected to ramp significantly over the coming months. We anticipate that these two new indications, along with the recent U.S. approval in ulcerative colitis, should add substantial revenue growth for Rinvoq over the long-term. Neuroscience remains an exciting opportunity for our company. Vraylar continues to have strong momentum across our currently approved indications and the pending regulatory approval in major depressive disorder represents a significant upside to current projections. In migraine, our portfolio of distinct therapies with Ubrelvy, Qulipta and Botox Therapeutic is demonstrating robust double-digit sales growth. With the migraine market anticipated to roughly double in size over the next several years, there is significant headroom for continued revenue growth with these compelling therapies. Aesthetics is once again exceeding expectations. The category continues to grow robust double digits, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial opportunity for further market penetration. Our commercial team is executing at a high level with targeted promotion and enhanced digital services, including our Alle loyalty program driving strong market share performance across our major brands. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie, and I'm extremely pleased with the evolution and momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're making excellent progress with the launches of several new products and indications, which will collectively add meaningful revenue for AbbVie as commercial access ramps for each of these opportunities over the remainder of this year. We're off to another exceptional start, and our long-term growth prospects remain strong. I'd now like to take a brief moment to thank Mike Severino for his contributions to the success of AbbVie over the last eight years. As you know, Mike has decided to leave AbbVie at the end of May to pursue another career opportunity, and we wish him all the best. I'd also like to take this opportunity to formally introduce to you Tom Hudson. Tom joined AbbVie back in 2016 as the Head of Discovery and Early Development. In 2018, Tom undertook responsibilities for AbbVie's entire discovery organization. Then in 2019, was promoted to the Head of AbbVie R&D and Chief Scientific Officer, where he assumed responsibility for all of AbbVie's R&D. Tom has an impressive background as a clinical scientist. His medical specialty is in clinical immunology and allergy. Tom played a critical role in the human genome project while working at both the Whitehead Institute and MIT, where Tom led the team that mapped the human genome. Tom was also instrumental in the international half map project to refine the genetic architecture of the human genome. Tom went on to further lead the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, which included discovery and translational cancer research with a clinical network of more than 1,000 investigators. Tom will be providing an update on our continued pipeline progress to you later in the call. But first, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with Immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 8.1% on an operational basis. Humira global sales were approximately $4.7 billion, down 1.8% on an operational basis with low single-digit revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across international markets, where revenues were down 17.9% operationally.  Skyrizi global revenues were $940 million, reflecting positive momentum in both approved indications. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is demonstrating impressive market share gains globally. Skyrizi now accounts for approximately 23% of the total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market. Skyrizi's in-play psoriasis share, which includes both new and switching patients, also remains very, very strong and now reflects roughly 40% patient share in the U.S. and a clear number one leadership position.  Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well internationally, where we have now achieved approximately 10% psoriasis share across our top 12 markets, as well as in-play share leadership in more than 20 key countries. While we were early in our launch in psoriatic arthritis, we are encouraged by the uptake in this indication. In the dermatology segment, Skyrizi has already achieved in-play patient share of more than 10% in the U.S.  Internationally, Skyrizi PSA is now approved in 45 countries, with reimbursement expected to increase throughout the year. Importantly, we are also preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in Crohn's disease, which represents another important long-term growth driver with approval decisions anticipated this year.  Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $465 million, demonstrating continued strong growth. As anticipated, we have seen an impact on new patient starts following the label update and Rinvoq prescriptions have now stabilized in the U.S., with in-play market share currently 12% in RA. We expect growth in the second line plus RA setting going forward where our field force is now focused on leveraging compelling data from two important Phase III trials. First, SELECT-CHOICE, which demonstrated Rinvoq's superiority versus ORENCIA across key efficacy parameters, including clinical remission in previously treated RA patients. And second, the open-label extension of SELECT-COMPARE which demonstrated that many RA patients with an inadequate response to Humira are able to achieve remission after switching to Rinvoq.  Early feedback suggests this updated Rinvoq RA messaging is resonating very well with healthcare practitioners. Internationally, Rinvoq share continues to ramp in RA with a total market share of approximately 5.5% across key geographies. We are also making excellent progress with Rinvoq's newly launched indications, including atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis.  Managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for each of these indications over the coming months. As we build access, initial prescriptions are covered by our BRIDGE program. which provides free patients or free goods to patients until formulary coverage is established. As a reminder, the volume from our BRIDGE program is not captured in third-party prescription data.  I'll start with atopic dermatitis. We are seeing new patient starts accelerating as we build access. When you include prescriptions from our Bridge program, Rinvoq total in-play AD share is already in the mid-teens. So, we are pleased with the early adoption and repeating prescribers. As an oral option that provides significant skin clearance and itch relief, we believe Rinvoq has a strong differentiated position in this highly underpenetrated AD market. In PSA, we are seeing a nice uptake in Rinvoq's in-play share, especially in the rheum segment, where the severity of joint or skin manifestations of the disease can vary significantly by patients. And importantly, we have also launched Skyrizi in the rheum-PSA segment this quarter, giving us two very compelling therapies to address the wide range of PSA patient types, regardless of how their symptoms present. We have also launched our first indication in the IBD segment, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, where we are seeing a significant long-term opportunity in the second-line plus setting. Nearly 50% of UC patients are currently on or have used TNF therapy, so the addressable patient population is substantial. Given the strong benefit risk in this indication, we believe Rinvoq will be a welcome therapeutic option for UC patients and physicians. Turning now to hematologic oncology. Global revenues were more than $1.6 billion, down 0.6% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.2 billion, down 7.4%. There are two factors impacting our Imbruvica results. First, we are seeing greater market share erosion in new patient starts than originally anticipated from newer therapy, including other BTK inhibitors, as well as our own Venclexta. Second, we continue to see higher-than-expected COVID suppression on new patient starts in CLL, which as a treat-to-progression therapy, has impacted the total BTK treated patient market. Our guidance assumes a market recovery over the course of this year, but it's too early to determine exactly how this may play out, given the continued impact from recent COVID variant. Despite these dynamics, Imbruvica remains the market-leading therapy for total patients across CLL and several other major blood cancers. Based on the magnitude of clinical data and real-world evidence generated for Imbruvica, showing sustained disease control as well as overall patient survival, we are confident it will continue to be a meaningful product for AbbVie over the long term. Venclexta, however, is helping to offset some of the headwinds facing Imbruvica. Global sales were $473 million, up 21.1% on an operational basis. In the US, Venclexta's the clear market share leader in frontline AML, among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy and recently achieved leading new patient share in second line plus PLL. We are also seeing robust momentum internationally, with strong performance across all approved indications. Additionally, we continue to make excellent progress building out our hem/onc portfolio, with several compelling late-stage assets, such as epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, Navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-383 for multiple myeloma, expected support -- expected to support sustainable long-term growth. Turning now to neuroscience, where revenues were approximately $1.5 billion, up more than 20% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth from Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and Ubrelvy. Ubrelvy is performing very well and continues to be the market-leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine, with sequential demand growth observed. Qulipta is also demonstrating exceptional uptake in migraine prevention, with recent total prescriptions performing ahead of comparable branded launches. Qulipta is now capturing nearly 25% on of the new-to-brand share in the US preventative CGRP class when we consider both paid and bridge volume. We expect commercial access to continue to ramp strongly over the remainder of the year. Qulipta has also recently demonstrated positive results from a registration-enabling study for the preventative treatment of chronic migraine, which we plan to submit to the agency for potential expanded use in the US as well as to support regulatory applications across the international market. This indication, if approved, will provided added differentiation for Qulipta as the only oral CGRP therapy for the preventative treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our other notable therapeutic, eye care revenues of $771 million were down 2.8% on an operational basis with recent generic competition for Restasis unfavorably impacting our results. Mavyret sales were $380 million, down 4.6% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels. So, overall, I'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on-track to deliver strong revenue growth once again in 2022. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D program. Tom?\nTom Hudson: Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology. We recently received FDA approval for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, a disease where there continues to be a significant unmet need for therapies that can provide high response rates and durable remission. In our UC development program, Rinvoq demonstrated some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in Phase 3 studies. Importantly, Rinvoq also provided durable responses sustained through one year of treatment. Given the strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients. Our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in UC remain under review in Europe and Japan, with approval decisions expected in the second half of this year. Also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently reported positive topline results from the second Phase 3 induction study for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the first induction trial, in this induction study, Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission and endoscopic response. We expect to see results from the Phase 3 maintenance study later in the quarter with our regulatory submissions for Rinvoq and Crohn's disease expected in the third quarter and approval decisions anticipated in 2023. Rounding out Rinvoq's development programs in rheumatology, we also have regulatory applications under review in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision in the second quarter for AS and decisions in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. Moving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced an update regarding our regulatory application for Crohn's disease in the US. Following an FDA request for additional information, primarily related to the on-body injection device used for maintenance dosing, we provided additional data for the device from an ongoing real-life use study, which showed that patients can safely and effectively use the on-body device to self-administer Skyrizi. After responding to the agency's request, we received a 3-month extension of our Skyrizi submission in Crohn's disease. We remain confident in a strong benefit risk profile for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease and we now expect a decision in June. Moving now to our Oncology Portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. We recently announced positive top line results from the first expansion cohort of the Phase II study, evaluating epcoritamab in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy.  Epcoritamab performed extremely well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated and high-risk patients, demonstrating an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. These results are particularly encouraging, given that nearly 40% of patients had failed CAR-T therapy. We plan to discuss these results with regulatory agencies about the potential to support submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on-track to see results from the Phase III CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. In our Venclexta MDS program, based on feedback from the FDA, we have recently modified our regulatory strategy and now intend to submit data from our ongoing Phase III program. Venclexta remains under Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MDS and we continue to have a high degree of enthusiasm for Venclexta in this indication. We expect data readout from the Phase III study and our regulatory submission for MDS in 2024. In Neuroscience, the FDA recently accepted our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar will be an important new therapy in this patient population, and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients suffering from major depressive disorders.  In the area of migraine, we recently reported positive topline results from a Phase III study evaluating Qulipta for the prevention of chronic migraine. Qulipta performed very well in this study with both doses meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints, demonstrating Qulipta's ability to significantly reduce migraine days for patients suffering from chronic migraine.  This summer, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA for Qulipta in chronic migraine and also plan to submit data from our Phase III studies in both chronic migraine and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the US. In our cystic fibrosis program, we recently completed an interim analysis of a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results \u2013 the efficacy results from this interim analysis did not meet our prespecified criteria for advancing this triple therapy in development. This study was designed with a 28-day run-in treatment period, with a dual combination therapy containing our C1 corrector and potentiator, followed by a 28-day treatment period, with a triple combination, which included the addition of our C2 corrector, ABBV-119. This allowed us to independently assess the therapeutic potential of our C2 corrector. The results showed that the addition of 119 did not provide a meaningful improvement in FEV1 or reduction in sweat chloride concentration over our dual combination therapy. During the run-in treatment period, we were able to again assess the efficacy of our dual therapy, which performed well, providing efficacy consistent with results for the existing dual accommodation therapy. So based on the performance of our dual therapy, we plan to continue our CF program. We have an additional C2 corrector, ABBV-576 in Phase 1 studies that we plan to advance into a new triple therapy with our existing C1 corrector and potentiator. 576 is structurally distinct from our previous C2 corrector 119 and has a better PK profile and provides higher drug exposure, which has the potential to deliver better efficacy. Our plan is to begin a Phase 2 study for this new triple combo by early next year. And in Aesthetics, we recently began the Phase 3 program for our short-acting toxin in Glabellar Lines. This novel toxin is designed to provide rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect, which would lower the barrier for adoption for certain segment of consumers. We expect to see data from this program next year with regulatory applications also anticipated in 2023. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year, and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2022. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you, Tom. AbbVie's first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio, including double-digit growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. We also continue to deliver strong P&L performance, with another quarter of robust operating margin expansion, while fully funding the business for long-term growth. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, reflecting growth of 9.3% compared to prior year and $0.04 above our guidance midpoint. This includes an $0.08 unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense that was not factored into our original guidance. Total net revenues were more than $13.5 billion, up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Net revenues came in above our guidance despite the entry of generic competition for Restasis. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.4% of sales, an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.9% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.1% of sales. Net interest expense was $539 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.1%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to include the $0.08 for acquired IPR&D expense that was incurred during the first quarter. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $13.92 and $14.12. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $59.4 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.4% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue guidance includes updated Restasis sales of approximately $400 million. Moving to the P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of $12.5 billion, and an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.38 and $3.42. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across multiple areas. We are making significant progress with new product launches and the pipeline, underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we'll take the first question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is open\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And maybe to begin with on Imbruvica. So, I mean, the script trends are down, and you mentioned that we are -- for new starts, you are losing some share to the competition. When you think -- can you please characterize how much share you are losing? And do you think it will stabilize over time? And when you look at Imbruvica and Venclexta combined, do you think the franchise can grow going forward from here? Thank you.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you for the question. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we are seeing greater share erosion. Imbruvica continues to be the leading share in the later lines, although we have lost our frontline share position to Calquence. And obviously, Venclexta is also moving there. So we see a couple of things that are taking place. So, we have that share erosion that's putting some pressure on the brand. And then clearly, we see the continued suppression of the market. So, it's kind of like a double hit. If we think of this over the short, mid and longer-term, what I would say would be this. So, in the short-term, meaning this year, we projected the share decline and that includes some stabilization, but we still think the brand is under some pressure from other BTKs and Venclexta. And basically, we have flat guidance this year. And some of that includes a recovery of the market back to sort of more normal levels and we'll have to see how that progresses over the year. If I think more about the midterm, I think what's important context there is, new patient starts essentially make up roughly 13% to 15% of Imbruvica. So it's got a very, very large installed base, about 85%, maybe a little bit more in terms of what that's going to happen. We're not seeing any changes in persistency or items like that. So we think that we have a very good sense of stability for the brand over time in terms of what this may mean. And so that's basically how we think about it. To answer your other question, if you look at the combined share, AbbVie has quite a strong position. We have roughly 33% of total share in the front line and we have between 42% and 46% of second-line plus. So clearly, Venclexta is able to offset as I commented in my remarks some of those pressures. So it's very important for AbbVie. It's going to be a very big brand over the long-term. In the short-term here in midterm, the growth is going to be more challenged moving forward.\nMohit Bansal: Thank you. \nLiz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, obviously, you guys have been speaking with payers about the Humira positioning for 2023. Are you willing to give us any update in terms of how you're thinking about that guidance figure that you put out a couple of years ago? Any change in thinking there? And then are you able to disclose the CR rate for the recent epcoritamab Phase II trial? Just wondering how that factors into the decision about whether to seek accelerated approval here? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: So Terence, this is Rick. I'll take the first question for you. And I'm probably going to answer a little broader because I think it is important. I understand the interest in trying to understand how to model 2023, it's obviously important to us to model 2023 as accurately as possible. And I think if you step back, obviously, contracting is one portion of a variable that will impact the speed at which biosimilars are able to adopt \u2013 be adopted in the market.  If you step back and look, there's probably four key variables that will impact, what that adoption rate looks like. One of them is obviously, what will Humira's access be post biosimilars entering the marketplace? And this is the period where you would normally be doing the contracting around that. I think we'll do well in being able to be co-positioned versus biosimilars in the vast majority of covered lives here in the United States. But that process isn't done, and we're not in a position to be able to ultimately, give you any further update until we're a little further along in that process.  The second variable that will impact what 2023 looks like is, how will the biosimilars price? We don't know that. Obviously, we have seen how they price in markets outside the U.S., but there's no market exactly like the U.S. internationally. And so that's a variable. We're making some projections of what we believe that pricing will look like. But that's ultimately something we're going to have to see how it plays out.  I'd say the third variable is, how competitive will these biosimilars be? It's going to be by the summer of 2023, there's going to be a lot of biosimilars in the U.S. market, but they're not all the same. And how competitive will they be against what is Humira today? And what are the bulk of patients use as it relates to Humira. And what I mean by that is interchangeability and a number of other factors are going to play into the competitiveness of those biosimilars. And I'd say the fourth variable, and it's not something that people think about that much, and that is the ability of a biosimilar to be able to supply the U.S. market. There's no market like the United States for Humira anywhere around the world. In the United States, it's significantly larger than any other market around the world. There are certainly biosimilar players that are like an AbbVie, and I would expect them to have manufacturing capacity. There are generic players that could have sufficient manufacturing capacity, and then there are very small companies. But I think anybody -- any payer that's going to want to convert in any significant way to a biosimilar, they're going to want confidence that they can have a reliability of supply of that biosimilar and we've spent years building the network that we have. We have full redundancy of every aspect of the manufacturing process on Humira. And we've never had a problem supplying the U.S. market. So, I think we can be viewed as kind of the gold standard. So, those are the variables that are going to impact what this transition looks like. The guidance we've given so far is this 45%, plus or minus 10%. I think at this point, that's still the best information that we can provide. Later this year, I think some of these variables will be clearer to it. And we may be in a position to be able to provide some more information to investors, and we would do that. Some will not. Pricing will not be clear at that point. We're not going to know how they're going to price until we actually get into -- they actually get into the marketplace. So, I think that's the way to think about these variables. Rob, anything you'd add?\nRob Michael: Yes. So, this is Rob. I would just add that we've been trying to give investors some directional guidance on how to think about 2023 beyond just the Humira, 45% plus or minus 10%. We've talked about Aesthetics growing high single digits annually over the next decade. You can get a sense based on Jeff's response today and the way to think about Imbruvica. In terms of operating margin, I've talked about that pulling back to the 46% to 47% range with no cuts to investment because we're going to return to growth very quickly. So, we're going to continue to invest in this business. And as I look at Street consensus, I see modeling of cuts in SG&A not necessarily reflecting the appropriate operating margin levels. So, it's something just to keep in mind. And then even -- we've talked about the tax rate growing one point per year on average. Obviously, you saw this year, it only grew 0.2 points. Other years, it may go higher. So, we've tried to give the Street some ideas of the way to think about 2023 model in advance of our formal guidance.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. Number two, Neil?\nNeil Gallagher: Hi, this is Neil Gallagher. I'll take the question regarding epcoritamab. So, we recently reported data from the expansion cohort of relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients. We reported an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. One thing that's really important to bear in mind is that this is a pretty refractory patient population with a median number of prior therapies of 3.5 in a range up to 11 in at the upper end. And importantly, just under 40% of these patients have failed prior therapy with the CAR-T. Overall, the safety profile remains manageable with the vast majority of the cases of CRS at class effect with these agents being Grade 1 and 2. To directly address your question, we are not yet ready to reveal additional detail about the data. They will be revealed at a forthcoming medical meeting. And in fact, I was just in contact with the team yesterday and I know that they're working very diligently to get those data on a podium in a meeting in the very near future.\nLiz Shea: Thank you. Terrence. Operator we\u2019ll take the next please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hello, thanks for taking our question. This is Alice Nicholson [ph] on for Tim Anderson. A question on Rinvoq. Where could in-play market share in atopic eventually get in your view? And are you seeing any switching away from Dupixent at all? Thank you. \nJeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you for the question. I'll give you some context. I mentioned that we see roughly in the mid-teens now after about three months, which we're very pleased in and some more flavor on that. If you think about the HCPs and the doctors that prescribe in the US now, you've got about 9, 000. Those are the dermatologists and some allergists. There's about 3,000 of those physicians that are the big prescribers. They're very productive. Those 3,000 are the ones that are driving Skyrizi, for example, or other big brands in psoriasis.  So we see, after just about three months, we see almost 1,000 doctors that have prescribed Rinvoq. And so that's driving that 15%. Some of it depends in terms of where the in-play share ends up, how many of the competitors come in. We're not really sure that baricitinib will come into the market. We'll have to see. We haven't seen much Pfizer activity yet. To give you some sort of international perspective in the Canadian market, we're seeing where there's really just Dupi and Rinvoq at this point after a couple of quarters, we're seeing a 30% in-play share in Canada.  So we are, as I mentioned, very, very encouraged with the early adoption. In particular, my comment around, how fast once you see the first prescription take place with some of those productive doctors, how fast they go to the second or third. To give you some flavor of what we see in the US, and again, the data is early, we see, as expected, the majority of our use so far in that dynamic market are not switches necessarily. We see about, let's say, 1/3, believe it or not, that are not even exposed to Dupi. And the doctors are saying, look, I've already given another oral systemic, for example, but the itch and the skin is so severe that they're going to go -- I'm going to go right and get the relief with Rinvoq.  And then maybe the other two-third, you see Dupi partial responders, particularly related to the itch, just isn't suppressed as much, and they still have some skin involvement. Or there is, as we've highlighted before, a warehouse of Dupi non-responders that has been built up over the last four years. So that's the behavior that we see. Again, I'm very encouraged on the early results, not just in the US but around the world. Rinvoq is going to be a real player in this underserved market.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Alice. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Your line is open. \nQ \u2013 Steve Scala: Thank you. Two questions. First on epcoritamab, the data looks great. Could this molecule immediately start taking share from CAR-T, or do you think physicians will want to see durability data before selecting a bispecific ahead of a cell therapy? So that's the first question. The second question is, I'm trying to sift through the answer to the Humira question just a moment ago. On the one hand, it seems we need to consider that Humira could be more resilient in 2023 than expected. On the other hand, the Street needs to raise spending assumptions. So, would you object to either of those conclusions based on what was stated? Thank you.\nNeil Gallagher: Thanks Steve. This is Neil. I'll take the first question on epcoritamab. The fact that we saw such remarkable activity in a patient population that had failed CAR-T does not imply that the medicine should be positioned after failure of CAR-T. I think they are two very different classes of medicines, as you know. CAR-T has significant challenges with respect to the need for -- to be prior to administration. Whereas the safety profile with epcoritamab is extremely manageable. And again, I don't want to repeat what I said earlier on around CRS. So, overall, we see a very strong benefit risk profile emerging for the medicine. And therefore, our intention is to move the medicine into earlier lines of therapy initially gain an approval with respect to -- gain approval in refractory DLBCL and after that move the medicine into earlier lines of therapy.\nRick Gonzalez: Steve, this is Rick. I think Rob and I will handle the second question for you. Yes, look, I think it's a great question, and we've gotten that question a lot. What's the erosion going to be in 2023? And is it going to be lighter in 2023 and therefore, spill more into 2024. And I think that's a reasonable question to start to think through. I'd say as I step back and look at it, I would tell you this. Look, at the end of the day, it could be lighter in 2023. That would force more of it out into 2024. If I look at the business, that's a good thing. We give us higher cash flows in 2023 than what we would be projecting now. Ultimately, I think there will be a settling out between 2023 and 2024. We'll still get to the levels that we have described or at least that we are modeling. And I think the important thing is, look, Humira is going to play out over these two-year period of time. What's important to AbbVie, though, is what's that underlying growth that's driving the business and is going to sustain the growth on the other side of the LOE. That's the critical aspect of it. The Skyrizi, the Rinvoqs, our Neuroscience pipeline, Aesthetics, it's all of those major growth drivers that we have because that growth is going to be suppressed in 2023 and somewhat maybe in 2024. But as soon as that pressure is off, that's when it reemerge and be able to deliver growth on the other side of it. And so what we're focused on is, obviously, we're going to try to manage the 2023-2024 dynamic to the extent that we're able to. But that's not the most critical part for the business. The most critical part is driving these growth brands and delivering on the pipeline.\nRob Michael: This is Rob. What I would add, Steve, just to clarify, I mean, we have a business that's going to deliver high single-digit growth during 2025. It doesn't make sense to be cutting investment in 2023. And that's what the Street consensus is modeling currently. So, we expect to invest in this business, invest in R&D, invest in SG&A to drive that long-term growth. And given how quickly we'll return to that growth, I wouldn't expect us to be cutting investment in 2023.\nSteve Scala: Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Steve. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. Question for Jeff. Perhaps you could comment on the impact of IL-31 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis where we're expecting additional Phase 2 data, which obviously don't have the JAK labeling associated with how you think it's going to impact the market in terms of delaying the onset of JAK therapy? And then second for Neil, could you talk to how large the commercial potential for Venclexta in t(11;14) myeloma, which is due to reported Phase III this year anytime?\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So important question. So the way that we see the market for the other ILs, I do think that there will be a segment of conservative dermatologists that will attempt to sequence. And I think that largely that they'll be disappointed because it seems the newer agents are very, very difficult to distinguish from Dupixent. I think certainly, there could be market access dynamics that start to appear with subsequent ILs, I think that's something that we will watch and you would want to watch.  I think what's, again, maybe not appreciated as we watch the early quarters of performance in Europe and the first quarter of performance here in the US, is that there's significant amount of early adopters and dermatologists that will go right to a JAK inhibitor, as I mentioned. They're not always sequencing through Dupi. And it's because the severity of some of these patients and the level of the clinical involvement is very, very significant.  And so, we do see what you would call a significant amount of naive use based on the profile of the JAK inhibitor. Now these are early adopters. These are people that have already contemplated the risk benefit and I think that's important. And so, the way that we see the market developing is that, when physicians would start with Dupi, which will be in a significant proportion of patients, it's not clear at all that their next step will be another IL that has been approved or will be approved.  In fact, we think it's more likely that they will move towards the best JAK that can get to these high levels of skin clearance, the EZ 90 plus almost no perceived itch. And I think that's the endpoint that this market is going to move towards and Rinvoq is the drug that clearly can deliver on that promise. And so that's how we see the market developing, and that's why we remain encouraged on the early results around the world from what we're seeing with the agent.\nNeil Gallagher: This is Neil. With respect to the question on Venclexta, venetoclax CANOVA. So the CANOVA study is a study of venetoclax in multiple myeloma patients with a particular translocation, t(11;14). We're making extremely good progress with the study, and we fully anticipate having a Phase III data from the study during the course of 2022. We know from this particular patient population that were included in earlier studies with Venclexta that they are explicitly sensitive to treatment with the medicines in various combinations. The prevalence of this population is around 20% of multiple myeloma and multiple myeloma, as you know, is the common of [indiscernible] malignancy. So, this is a very significant proportion of the multiple myeloma population that could gain benefit from Venclexta. And as mentioned, we're looking forward to being able to communicate the Phase III data during the course of 2022. Thanks for the question.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Andrew. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nChris Schott: Great. Thanks very much for the question. First one for me is just can you elaborate a bit more on Rinvoq coverage, both in AD and UC. I guess just trying to get a sense of where we are today and what's the outlook for the next few quarters? And maybe as part of that, it seems like you're seeing some nice uptake in your BRIDGE programs. Can you just comment when you expect we should start to think about those translating over to third-party Rxs and that would be maybe more visible to the outside world in terms of how that uptick you're seeing? And then my second question was just on Q1 itself. Were there any notable either payer adjustments or gross to net issues? I guess Humira, for example, it seems like the low single-digit growth was a departure from recent trends. I'm just trying understand a little bit better what happened in the quarter. Is there anything we should just be kind of keeping in mind as we consider the Q1 results? Thanks.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you, Chris. It's Jeff. So, with your first question is -- we're very confident that we are going to get to high levels of paid access for Rinvoq and Skyrizi's new indications. So, typically, what we'll see based on the approval timeline, we'll be ramping up into the -- by the middle of the year up in the high 90s in terms of our access -- for commercial access. So, I think that everyone should be confident that, that's where you're going to start to see this bridge program start to fully convert as the months go by into the paid prescription. So, typically, that's the timing we're looking at. You're going to see very strong momentum on paid access by -- towards the end of next quarter is what we've guided towards. So, that's the answer to your first question. I think if you think about -- and maybe just to frame the Humira question. The Humira fundamentals are -- and the market fundamentals are quite strong. You see the markets are performing nicely. Our market share growth trends, we haven't seen any trend shift. They've been largely stable. There's some sequential decline based on the size of the market and actually our own brand, Skyrizi and Rinvoq that are playing very strongly into these markets. What I would say is that, in some cases, Q1 can be quite unique over the years. You've got the issue with the plans resetting their deductibles, you've got issues with doctors that have to put in another prior authorization for the year. And so you do see some co-pay and sort of deductible dynamic. But we think that's really a first quarter type of event, and it's largely been very consistent with what we expected. So, maybe I don't know, Rob, if you want to build on that a little bit.\nRob Michael: Yes, I would just add that if you look back to our guidance for the quarter and we gave guidance to the therapeutic area level, we pretty much came in line with that guidance. And so we expected this dynamic, and we're also we're not changing our full year outlook for US Humira, 8% growth. And that, again, will be driven by market driving volume growth. And so -- it's in line with our expectations. I understand Street consensus had a different point of view, but we weren't surprised by that.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Chris. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. Good morning. If I could ask on Vraylar, the product, I think you comment expectations for an MDD approval and yet they'll frame it as potential for upside. Can you help us understand perhaps some of the potential there? Just thinking back to some of the scale of the peak sales opportunity that, that drug was characterized previously, MDD certainly seems as if it's a potential significant opportunity. Thanks.\nJeff Stewart: Yes, Thank you for the question. And it is a significant opportunity. So, as we highlighted and Tom highlighted, the NDA has been accepted, and we're confident in the approval. I think what we said in the past is that just with the base indication. So, before we get that approval, I mean, the FDA has to still approve it towards the end of the year. We believe that we can ramp towards a $4 billion opportunity. So, that would mean our share just in the base indications of a unique profile with the mania, the mix manian depression, the bipolar depression, we moved somewhere up sort of doubling our share penetration. So right now, we're at about 2.7% TRx share. So we we'd really get close to doubling that based on the momentum.  And then MDD would build on top of that. And so it's significant. I mean, the physicians that we've talked to when we show them the profile are very pleased. First, they know Vraylar, they like Vraylar, they like the strong efficacy, they highlight nonsedating, they highlight at least verbally a brightening effect of the agent, minimal weight gain, metabolic effects. And so as they think about that, how that would translate to adjunctive MDD, they like that profile. The other piece that we hear is they like the starting dose. They like that starting dose of the 1.5 milligram dose, which is what we believe that ultimately will be approved. We'll have to see. So easy to start, easy to take, well tolerated. And so to your point, we believe that MDD will offer some upside and acceleration to the brand's momentum when we achieve it.\nA \u2013 Liz Shea: Thanks Chris. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. \nVamil Divan: Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. So just maybe get back to some of what we were just talking about around the pricing in 1Q. But I had a couple of questions regarding the migraine franchise. So, the Ubrelvy scripts from a legacy publicly out third-party data, it looks like the gross to net \u2013 some net pricing is back to where we were in 1Q '21. And just trying to understand if this is just a seasonality of things or 4Q to 1Q dynamic or maybe there might be something broader where net pricing for these products is going down.  And then tied to that, with Qulipta, as you mentioned, look, the prescription numbers are pretty good as it builds up here. I'm curious now that you have sort of two products in that market, does that impact how you're thinking about the opportunity, especially from a pricing side or sort of payer negotiation side? Is there any thoughts on sort of bundling the two other in any way to present to get even better active than what you have right now? So, any thoughts you could share there would be helpful as well? Thank you.\nRob Michael: So Vamil, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So when you look at that there is seasonality in this market in the US, and so you do see a shift from Q4 to Q1. If you look at year-over-year, you'd see that in Q4, as you mentioned, Q1 year-over-year is relatively flat. I would think about it that way for the full year as well. So, you do tend to see a suppression in Q1 because of plans resetting that dynamic we see in the US market. But then over the course of the rest of the year, you do see higher pricing. So, on average, the way to think about it is price is relatively stable.\nJeff Stewart: And Vamil, it's Jeff now. So I think -- look, we are pleased with the Ubrelvy momentum. I mean, actually, since we launched Qulipta, Ubrelvy has accelerated. So, we have to -- because we can't see the competitor because you can see the whole thing. But when we factor Nurtec by 8 versus 16, and we try to understand the acute dynamic, we can see that we're clearly the market-leading acute CGRP and that's nice to see. The physicians really like Ubrelvy, the markets are robust. I think what you're seeing is what Rob highlighted in terms of the overall performance. I didn't really fully appreciate your second question in terms of the access. I can give you a broad overview. Obviously, we're seeing great momentum with the brand. Much of the brand is still because the access is ramping is still bridged, just like we discussed there with the immunology agent.  So we think, again, by the middle of the year, we're going to see commercial access really start to ramp, and you'll see the conversion start to take place. What's nice is that we're confident in that. We think that our price points and net price or negotiations are going well. And because of its unique profile, as an agent, basically, the strength of the drug is really significant in terms of its performance against episodic migraine. We feel like we're in good shape. And we're going to build on top of that basically 25% in-play share, which is right now at the top of the league table. So, that's how we see it. We're confident in the access ramp.\nVamil Divan: Maybe just to clarify the second question then just -- thank you for all that. Is there any advantage of another strategy you might have now because you have two approved migraine oral therapies, or is it pretty much similar it would be if you had one or the other?\nJeff Stewart: Yes. It's pretty similar based on the way that the pricing and the different dynamics work on the other CGRP. It's not -- it's just sort of a straight -- it's a straight play on the access there.\nVamil Divan: Okay. Thank you so much.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Vamil. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey guys. Morning. Thanks for the question. I just had another one on the INI landscape. Rick, when you look at the market disruption that you'll see in 2023 and 2024, presumably, that's going to have an indirect effect on Skyrizi and Rinvoq when you think pricing and share. What would you guys view as a win over this period from a new start or switch perspective or a growth perspective is the first question. And the second part of it is, what gives you guys confidence in the market really normalizing after a 2024 period? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: I think as we look at our long-range plan, we don't see or anticipate a dramatic impact. We've provided that 2025 guidance and I think it's reflective of significant growth of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. If you look at those assets and you look at their clinical performance, they really stand out. And that's what's driving the kind of volume and growth that we're seeing. And I think you will see obvious price disruption in the Humira market from biosimilars. But I don't anticipate that you're going to see that bleed over in a significant way to those other assets. Jeff, do you see any differently?\nJeff Stewart: Yes, I don't see, Geoff, much difference. I mean if you think of it in some ways, even on -- let's take Rinvoq, for example. I mean, you could say, wow, in prior viewpoints, maybe everyone will step behind a biosimilar at some point in the future. Well, one, we didn't think that, that would happen wide scale as the market develops anyway. But even if it did, our label is already behind a TNF. And so when you look at the level of efficacy that Rinvoq's bringing in those later lines, I mean it's -- we're really quite insulated from that, I would put forth. And second Skyrizi is just -- is a phenomenal asset. I mean the level of performance and what it's doing to transform certainly psoriasis today, PSA right now and what we think will happen with Crohn's and ultimately, IBD, when you look at the level of healing and sort of restating that standard of care, we think the assets themselves are quite well positioned for the middle part of the decade, and that sort of goes to the elements of the planning that Rick talked about.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Geoff. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGary Nachman: Hi thanks. First, just following on that last response. Can you talk more broadly about how you see the expansion of Rinvoq and Skyrizi into the IBD indication? So how is the initial launch for Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis going? I know it's early days, but what's the outlook there given physician receptivity around the product? Are physicians saying they're excited to have Rinvoq for Crohn's as well? And also, how do you see Skyrizi fitting in with Crohn's versus Rinvoq? And then secondly, on Aesthetics, it was strong in the first quarter, but did you see any impact in the early part of 1Q from Omicron? And what have the trends been more recently in March and April in the Aesthetics business?\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you for the question. It's Jeff again. So we are very, very encouraged by the IBD momentum that we can build. And we're right on the cusp of it. And to give some sense is basically this market -- the market of Crohn's and you see that \u2013 it actually has fairly high biologic penetration.  When we do our research and our engagement with the physicians, what they typically have done for more than a decade since the availability of Remicade and then Humira, they really hang on as much as possible to their first-line use. They try to intensify, they do all sorts of things because it's quite scary for the physicians and the patients because no one set a different standard of care. So when you start to look at the healing rates that we start to see with Rinvoq in UC, the healing of the bowel, the remission rate, the combination of what we can see, this market looks very, very good to have both of those assets come in with higher standards of care. So we're very, very encouraged and we think that the IBD market is probably underappreciated in terms of what that looks like. And the patients are so challenged with their disease because it's quite severe with the bowel preparations, the hospitalizations, all of these things, having two assets is a great thing to bring to the market. Certainly, in the US, it's likely we see that with UC today that you're going to have later line use based on the labeling.  Skyrizi is not going to have that limitation. So, you can imagine that you have an ability to co-position to sequence appropriately to think about how you bring that whole portfolio around the world and that's how we see it. We're quite encouraged that we would have both Rinvoq for Crohn's and Rinvoq for Skyrizi in the market. And it's kind of very similar to my comments I made on what's happening with PSA today in rheumatology, where both of those assets Rinvoq for PSA and Skyrizi PSA are in the market together working as a portfolio. To get to your first point, it's been only a month or so with our UC launch, but the physicians, gastros are very encouraged with the profile. They've not seen the level of remission or the level of healing before in any asset. So, there's quite a wow reaction to the efficacy profile. They realize that they have to think about, I've got to think through my patients that are not doing well on TNF or have cycled through a TNF and are struggling. And I mentioned that's a pretty large addressable population. It's at least 50% of the market today. So early qualitative results are quite strong. And the BRIDGE results are also quite strong. So, we're pleased with the gastro launches thus far.\nRick Gonzalez: Carrie?\nCarrie Strom: Gary, this is Carrie Strom, President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, and I'll take your question about the aesthetics market. And in Q1, we did see US toxin and filler markets, both growing in the mid-20s percent. And we expect that sort of growth to continue for the rest of 2022.  And the way to think about it is similar amount of absolute volume growth as 2021, but of course, off of a larger base. And in terms of what's driving that market growth, we're seeing very strong demand trends supported by our increased commercial investments, for example, increased consumer activation for acquisition and retention, field force expansions in key markets. And we see these trends also supported just by fundamentals and aesthetics that will continue in the long-term. People think about aesthetics more like health and wellness. It's been much more destigmatized, and we see factors like social media and word of mouth continuing to drive aesthetics in the future. Your question around the pandemic, I would say that we are seeing an impact right now in China, and we anticipate that this recent surge of COVID cases in China which has resulted in lockdowns across several major cities, has reduced patient traffic into aesthetic offices in China. And China is a top market for aesthetics. So, we expect this to impact our near-term international performance for both toxins and fillers. I should also mention that Russia is a key market for fillers globally. And as the tragic events in the Ukraine have unfolded, we have suspended operations for our Aesthetics business in Russia. So, although absolute aesthetic sales in Russia are modest, like I said, Russia is among one of the largest filler markets in the world. So, we expect to see an impact on our filler performance in coming quarters. But despite these dynamics, we do not need to change our total guidance for Aesthetics. So, we see our continued robust toxin performance in the US to offset this anticipated transitory impact in both China and Russia.\nGary Nachman: Great. Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Gary. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, for epcoritamab, I just have a question on approval. Given the recent FDA discussion around the PI3 kinase class and sort of hinting that they want controlled data for accelerated approval, how do you view that in light of that panel, the likelihood of accelerated approval? And then second. Just a little bit more questions around the Bridge program. I think you said that you're going to expect more payment reimbursement coming online in the middle of the year. Just talk to me how long people stay in the Bridge program and how you expect that Bridge program to continue? And what -- how many people might continue to use it after payers and online? Thanks.\nNeil Gallagher: Hey Robyn, it's Neil, I'll start off with the question around epcoritamab, but maybe just a comment -- a general comment on accelerated approval overall. I think as we're all aware, it prompted your question that the agencies in the course of -- in the process of updating its guidance with respect to accelerated approval. We haven't seen the totality of that guidance, but we anticipate hearing more from them during the course of 2022. As I alluded to, and I'm not going to repeat what I said earlier on about the epco data, but we are extremely pleased with how the molecule is performing, and it is our intent to engage with the agency based on the data that we've toplined recently. It is our intent to engage with the agency in a conversation to explore a path to accelerated approval. And likewise, with some of our other programs, we recently got a BTD designation for Teliso-V, for example, earlier this year with a 54% response rate in c-Met high non-small-cell lung cancer. Again, it is our intent when we have data that are these strong to continue to engage with the agency on those programs to explore potential costs to accelerated approval. So thanks for the question.\nJeff Stewart: Okay. It's Jeff. Just to comment on your BRIDGE question. Thank you for that. So the BRIDGE transition will be very efficient. So, what I mean by that is because of the connections that we have with the payers and our specialty pharmacy network, we're able to \u2013 once access is achieved rapidly and appropriately transition patients from the BRIDGE to basically their paid pharmacy in their prescription.  So, there's not going to be lingering bridge effects, particularly in the immunology space. So, once it starts to move and that access ramps, the BRIDGE transition is quite fast. And that can be within weeks or a month. And we know that that's the case because we have the model from our earlier launches from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So ultimately, once you start to achieve those high levels of access, BRIDGE programs drop very, very fast, and the vast majority, the very vast majority is paid prescriptions. So it's very efficient, and I hope that helps.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Robyn. Operator, we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. \nJosh Schimmer: Thanks for putting me in and congrats to both Mike and Tom. For Skyrizi, did your long-term outlook improve again, or am I misunderstanding the contingent consideration line item? Thanks so much.\nRob Michael: So Josh, it's Rob. If you look at the continued consideration, actually, it's a fair value liability, it went down this quarter because of discount rate. So we always have to pay attention to discount rate movement. So we saw the average discount rate increase by about 130 basis points. You're seeing, obviously, as rising interest rates are taking hold of the market. That's something we have to take into account because we had to mark this to market every quarter.  If you look at our release, we had a similar \u2013 we had a decrease last year as well. Again, we had discount rates increase in Q1 of last year, albeit to a lesser extent. So that's what you're seeing is just really the discount rate movement. No other real fundamental changes to the valuation of that liability.\nJosh Schimmer: Got it. Thanks for clarifying.\nLiz Shea: Well, thank you, Josh. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our overall performance, then Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our first quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. I'm pleased with the excellent start to 2022. It further reinforces our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the business. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenue of more than $13.5 billion was up 5.4% on an operational basis, also above our expectations. These results demonstrate strong momentum across several key products and portfolios, including robust double-digit operational revenue growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well. We are achieving impressive market share gains in psoriasis, which remains a significant market opportunity. Skyrizi's recent launch in psoriatic arthritis as well as the anticipated regulatory approval in Crohn's disease should also serve as important growth drivers over the long-term. Rinvoq is also contributing compelling sales growth. Subscription trends in RA have recently stabilized as we expected and we are making excellent progress repositioning the brand as the leading second-line agent based on the robust data generated across our broad development programs. The early launch trends for Rinvoq in both atopic dermatitis and psoriatic arthritis are highly encouraging, with commercial access and paid prescriptions expected to ramp significantly over the coming months. We anticipate that these two new indications, along with the recent U.S. approval in ulcerative colitis, should add substantial revenue growth for Rinvoq over the long-term. Neuroscience remains an exciting opportunity for our company. Vraylar continues to have strong momentum across our currently approved indications and the pending regulatory approval in major depressive disorder represents a significant upside to current projections. In migraine, our portfolio of distinct therapies with Ubrelvy, Qulipta and Botox Therapeutic is demonstrating robust double-digit sales growth. With the migraine market anticipated to roughly double in size over the next several years, there is significant headroom for continued revenue growth with these compelling therapies. Aesthetics is once again exceeding expectations. The category continues to grow robust double digits, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial opportunity for further market penetration. Our commercial team is executing at a high level with targeted promotion and enhanced digital services, including our Alle loyalty program driving strong market share performance across our major brands. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie, and I'm extremely pleased with the evolution and momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're making excellent progress with the launches of several new products and indications, which will collectively add meaningful revenue for AbbVie as commercial access ramps for each of these opportunities over the remainder of this year. We're off to another exceptional start, and our long-term growth prospects remain strong. I'd now like to take a brief moment to thank Mike Severino for his contributions to the success of AbbVie over the last eight years. As you know, Mike has decided to leave AbbVie at the end of May to pursue another career opportunity, and we wish him all the best. I'd also like to take this opportunity to formally introduce to you Tom Hudson. Tom joined AbbVie back in 2016 as the Head of Discovery and Early Development. In 2018, Tom undertook responsibilities for AbbVie's entire discovery organization. Then in 2019, was promoted to the Head of AbbVie R&D and Chief Scientific Officer, where he assumed responsibility for all of AbbVie's R&D. Tom has an impressive background as a clinical scientist. His medical specialty is in clinical immunology and allergy. Tom played a critical role in the human genome project while working at both the Whitehead Institute and MIT, where Tom led the team that mapped the human genome. Tom was also instrumental in the international half map project to refine the genetic architecture of the human genome. Tom went on to further lead the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, which included discovery and translational cancer research with a clinical network of more than 1,000 investigators. Tom will be providing an update on our continued pipeline progress to you later in the call. But first, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? So Terence, this is Rick. I'll take the first question for you. And I'm probably going to answer a little broader because I think it is important. I understand the interest in trying to understand how to model 2023, it's obviously important to us to model 2023 as accurately as possible. And I think if you step back, obviously, contracting is one portion of a variable that will impact the speed at which biosimilars are able to adopt \u2013 be adopted in the market.  If you step back and look, there's probably four key variables that will impact, what that adoption rate looks like. One of them is obviously, what will Humira's access be post biosimilars entering the marketplace? And this is the period where you would normally be doing the contracting around that. I think we'll do well in being able to be co-positioned versus biosimilars in the vast majority of covered lives here in the United States. But that process isn't done, and we're not in a position to be able to ultimately, give you any further update until we're a little further along in that process.  The second variable that will impact what 2023 looks like is, how will the biosimilars price? We don't know that. Obviously, we have seen how they price in markets outside the U.S., but there's no market exactly like the U.S. internationally. And so that's a variable. We're making some projections of what we believe that pricing will look like. But that's ultimately something we're going to have to see how it plays out.  I'd say the third variable is, how competitive will these biosimilars be? It's going to be by the summer of 2023, there's going to be a lot of biosimilars in the U.S. market, but they're not all the same. And how competitive will they be against what is Humira today? And what are the bulk of patients use as it relates to Humira. And what I mean by that is interchangeability and a number of other factors are going to play into the competitiveness of those biosimilars. And I'd say the fourth variable, and it's not something that people think about that much, and that is the ability of a biosimilar to be able to supply the U.S. market. There's no market like the United States for Humira anywhere around the world. In the United States, it's significantly larger than any other market around the world. There are certainly biosimilar players that are like an AbbVie, and I would expect them to have manufacturing capacity. There are generic players that could have sufficient manufacturing capacity, and then there are very small companies. But I think anybody -- any payer that's going to want to convert in any significant way to a biosimilar, they're going to want confidence that they can have a reliability of supply of that biosimilar and we've spent years building the network that we have. We have full redundancy of every aspect of the manufacturing process on Humira. And we've never had a problem supplying the U.S. market. So, I think we can be viewed as kind of the gold standard. So, those are the variables that are going to impact what this transition looks like. The guidance we've given so far is this 45%, plus or minus 10%. I think at this point, that's still the best information that we can provide. Later this year, I think some of these variables will be clearer to it. And we may be in a position to be able to provide some more information to investors, and we would do that. Some will not. Pricing will not be clear at that point. We're not going to know how they're going to price until we actually get into -- they actually get into the marketplace. So, I think that's the way to think about these variables. Rob, anything you'd add? Okay. Number two, Neil? Steve, this is Rick. I think Rob and I will handle the second question for you. Yes, look, I think it's a great question, and we've gotten that question a lot. What's the erosion going to be in 2023? And is it going to be lighter in 2023 and therefore, spill more into 2024. And I think that's a reasonable question to start to think through. I'd say as I step back and look at it, I would tell you this. Look, at the end of the day, it could be lighter in 2023. That would force more of it out into 2024. If I look at the business, that's a good thing. We give us higher cash flows in 2023 than what we would be projecting now. Ultimately, I think there will be a settling out between 2023 and 2024. We'll still get to the levels that we have described or at least that we are modeling. And I think the important thing is, look, Humira is going to play out over these two-year period of time. What's important to AbbVie, though, is what's that underlying growth that's driving the business and is going to sustain the growth on the other side of the LOE. That's the critical aspect of it. The Skyrizi, the Rinvoqs, our Neuroscience pipeline, Aesthetics, it's all of those major growth drivers that we have because that growth is going to be suppressed in 2023 and somewhat maybe in 2024. But as soon as that pressure is off, that's when it reemerge and be able to deliver growth on the other side of it. And so what we're focused on is, obviously, we're going to try to manage the 2023-2024 dynamic to the extent that we're able to. But that's not the most critical part for the business. The most critical part is driving these growth brands and delivering on the pipeline. I think as we look at our long-range plan, we don't see or anticipate a dramatic impact. We've provided that 2025 guidance and I think it's reflective of significant growth of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. If you look at those assets and you look at their clinical performance, they really stand out. And that's what's driving the kind of volume and growth that we're seeing. And I think you will see obvious price disruption in the Humira market from biosimilars. But I don't anticipate that you're going to see that bleed over in a significant way to those other assets. Jeff, do you see any differently? Carrie?"

            "name": "Neil Gallagher",
            "content": "Hi, this is Neil Gallagher. I'll take the question regarding epcoritamab. So, we recently reported data from the expansion cohort of relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients. We reported an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. One thing that's really important to bear in mind is that this is a pretty refractory patient population with a median number of prior therapies of 3.5 in a range up to 11 in at the upper end. And importantly, just under 40% of these patients have failed prior therapy with the CAR-T. Overall, the safety profile remains manageable with the vast majority of the cases of CRS at class effect with these agents being Grade 1 and 2. To directly address your question, we are not yet ready to reveal additional detail about the data. They will be revealed at a forthcoming medical meeting. And in fact, I was just in contact with the team yesterday and I know that they're working very diligently to get those data on a podium in a meeting in the very near future. Thanks Steve. This is Neil. I'll take the first question on epcoritamab. The fact that we saw such remarkable activity in a patient population that had failed CAR-T does not imply that the medicine should be positioned after failure of CAR-T. I think they are two very different classes of medicines, as you know. CAR-T has significant challenges with respect to the need for -- to be prior to administration. Whereas the safety profile with epcoritamab is extremely manageable. And again, I don't want to repeat what I said earlier on around CRS. So, overall, we see a very strong benefit risk profile emerging for the medicine. And therefore, our intention is to move the medicine into earlier lines of therapy initially gain an approval with respect to -- gain approval in refractory DLBCL and after that move the medicine into earlier lines of therapy. This is Neil. With respect to the question on Venclexta, venetoclax CANOVA. So the CANOVA study is a study of venetoclax in multiple myeloma patients with a particular translocation, t(11;14). We're making extremely good progress with the study, and we fully anticipate having a Phase III data from the study during the course of 2022. We know from this particular patient population that were included in earlier studies with Venclexta that they are explicitly sensitive to treatment with the medicines in various combinations. The prevalence of this population is around 20% of multiple myeloma and multiple myeloma, as you know, is the common of [indiscernible] malignancy. So, this is a very significant proportion of the multiple myeloma population that could gain benefit from Venclexta. And as mentioned, we're looking forward to being able to communicate the Phase III data during the course of 2022. Thanks for the question. Hey Robyn, it's Neil, I'll start off with the question around epcoritamab, but maybe just a comment -- a general comment on accelerated approval overall. I think as we're all aware, it prompted your question that the agencies in the course of -- in the process of updating its guidance with respect to accelerated approval. We haven't seen the totality of that guidance, but we anticipate hearing more from them during the course of 2022. As I alluded to, and I'm not going to repeat what I said earlier on about the epco data, but we are extremely pleased with how the molecule is performing, and it is our intent to engage with the agency based on the data that we've toplined recently. It is our intent to engage with the agency in a conversation to explore a path to accelerated approval.

So thanks for the question."

            "name": "Tom Hudson",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology. We recently received FDA approval for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, a disease where there continues to be a significant unmet need for therapies that can provide high response rates and durable remission. In our UC development program, Rinvoq demonstrated some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in Phase 3 studies. Importantly, Rinvoq also provided durable responses sustained through one year of treatment. Given the strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients. Our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in UC remain under review in Europe and Japan, with approval decisions expected in the second half of this year. Also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently reported positive topline results from the second Phase 3 induction study for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the first induction trial, in this induction study, Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission and endoscopic response. We expect to see results from the Phase 3 maintenance study later in the quarter with our regulatory submissions for Rinvoq and Crohn's disease expected in the third quarter and approval decisions anticipated in 2023. Rounding out Rinvoq's development programs in rheumatology, we also have regulatory applications under review in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision in the second quarter for AS and decisions in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. Moving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced an update regarding our regulatory application for Crohn's disease in the US. Following an FDA request for additional information, primarily related to the on-body injection device used for maintenance dosing, we provided additional data for the device from an ongoing real-life use study, which showed that patients can safely and effectively use the on-body device to self-administer Skyrizi. After responding to the agency's request, we received a 3-month extension of our Skyrizi submission in Crohn's disease. We remain confident in a strong benefit risk profile for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease and we now expect a decision in June. Moving now to our Oncology Portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. We recently announced positive top line results from the first expansion cohort of the Phase II study, evaluating epcoritamab in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy.  Epcoritamab performed extremely well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated and high-risk patients, demonstrating an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. These results are particularly encouraging, given that nearly 40% of patients had failed CAR-T therapy. We plan to discuss these results with regulatory agencies about the potential to support submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on-track to see results from the Phase III CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. In our Venclexta MDS program, based on feedback from the FDA, we have recently modified our regulatory strategy and now intend to submit data from our ongoing Phase III program. Venclexta remains under Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MDS and we continue to have a high degree of enthusiasm for Venclexta in this indication. We expect data readout from the Phase III study and our regulatory submission for MDS in 2024. In Neuroscience, the FDA recently accepted our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar will be an important new therapy in this patient population, and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients suffering from major depressive disorders.  In the area of migraine, we recently reported positive topline results from a Phase III study evaluating Qulipta for the prevention of chronic migraine. Qulipta performed very well in this study with both doses meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints, demonstrating Qulipta's ability to significantly reduce migraine days for patients suffering from chronic migraine.  This summer, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA for Qulipta in chronic migraine and also plan to submit data from our Phase III studies in both chronic migraine and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the US. In our cystic fibrosis program, we recently completed an interim analysis of a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results \u2013 the efficacy results from this interim analysis did not meet our prespecified criteria for advancing this triple therapy in development. This study was designed with a 28-day run-in treatment period, with a dual combination therapy containing our C1 corrector and potentiator, followed by a 28-day treatment period, with a triple combination, which included the addition of our C2 corrector, ABBV-119. This allowed us to independently assess the therapeutic potential of our C2 corrector. The results showed that the addition of 119 did not provide a meaningful improvement in FEV1 or reduction in sweat chloride concentration over our dual combination therapy. During the run-in treatment period, we were able to again assess the efficacy of our dual therapy, which performed well, providing efficacy consistent with results for the existing dual accommodation therapy. So based on the performance of our dual therapy, we plan to continue our CF program. We have an additional C2 corrector, ABBV-576 in Phase 1 studies that we plan to advance into a new triple therapy with our existing C1 corrector and potentiator. 576 is structurally distinct from our previous C2 corrector 119 and has a better PK profile and provides higher drug exposure, which has the potential to deliver better efficacy. Our plan is to begin a Phase 2 study for this new triple combo by early next year. And in Aesthetics, we recently began the Phase 3 program for our short-acting toxin in Glabellar Lines. This novel toxin is designed to provide rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect, which would lower the barrier for adoption for certain segment of consumers. We expect to see data from this program next year with regulatory applications also anticipated in 2023. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year, and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2022. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?"

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with Immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 8.1% on an operational basis. Humira global sales were approximately $4.7 billion, down 1.8% on an operational basis with low single-digit revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across international markets, where revenues were down 17.9% operationally.  Skyrizi global revenues were $940 million, reflecting positive momentum in both approved indications. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is demonstrating impressive market share gains globally. Skyrizi now accounts for approximately 23% of the total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market. Skyrizi's in-play psoriasis share, which includes both new and switching patients, also remains very, very strong and now reflects roughly 40% patient share in the U.S. and a clear number one leadership position.  Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well internationally, where we have now achieved approximately 10% psoriasis share across our top 12 markets, as well as in-play share leadership in more than 20 key countries. While we were early in our launch in psoriatic arthritis, we are encouraged by the uptake in this indication. In the dermatology segment, Skyrizi has already achieved in-play patient share of more than 10% in the U.S.  Internationally, Skyrizi PSA is now approved in 45 countries, with reimbursement expected to increase throughout the year. Importantly, we are also preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in Crohn's disease, which represents another important long-term growth driver with approval decisions anticipated this year.  Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $465 million, demonstrating continued strong growth. As anticipated, we have seen an impact on new patient starts following the label update and Rinvoq prescriptions have now stabilized in the U.S., with in-play market share currently 12% in RA. We expect growth in the second line plus RA setting going forward where our field force is now focused on leveraging compelling data from two important Phase III trials. First, SELECT-CHOICE, which demonstrated Rinvoq's superiority versus ORENCIA across key efficacy parameters, including clinical remission in previously treated RA patients. And second, the open-label extension of SELECT-COMPARE which demonstrated that many RA patients with an inadequate response to Humira are able to achieve remission after switching to Rinvoq.  Early feedback suggests this updated Rinvoq RA messaging is resonating very well with healthcare practitioners. Internationally, Rinvoq share continues to ramp in RA with a total market share of approximately 5.5% across key geographies. We are also making excellent progress with Rinvoq's newly launched indications, including atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis.  Managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for each of these indications over the coming months. As we build access, initial prescriptions are covered by our BRIDGE program. which provides free patients or free goods to patients until formulary coverage is established. As a reminder, the volume from our BRIDGE program is not captured in third-party prescription data.  I'll start with atopic dermatitis. We are seeing new patient starts accelerating as we build access. When you include prescriptions from our Bridge program, Rinvoq total in-play AD share is already in the mid-teens. So, we are pleased with the early adoption and repeating prescribers. As an oral option that provides significant skin clearance and itch relief, we believe Rinvoq has a strong differentiated position in this highly underpenetrated AD market. In PSA, we are seeing a nice uptake in Rinvoq's in-play share, especially in the rheum segment, where the severity of joint or skin manifestations of the disease can vary significantly by patients. And importantly, we have also launched Skyrizi in the rheum-PSA segment this quarter, giving us two very compelling therapies to address the wide range of PSA patient types, regardless of how their symptoms present. We have also launched our first indication in the IBD segment, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, where we are seeing a significant long-term opportunity in the second-line plus setting. Nearly 50% of UC patients are currently on or have used TNF therapy, so the addressable patient population is substantial. Given the strong benefit risk in this indication, we believe Rinvoq will be a welcome therapeutic option for UC patients and physicians. Turning now to hematologic oncology. Global revenues were more than $1.6 billion, down 0.6% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.2 billion, down 7.4%. There are two factors impacting our Imbruvica results. First, we are seeing greater market share erosion in new patient starts than originally anticipated from newer therapy, including other BTK inhibitors, as well as our own Venclexta. Second, we continue to see higher-than-expected COVID suppression on new patient starts in CLL, which as a treat-to-progression therapy, has impacted the total BTK treated patient market. Our guidance assumes a market recovery over the course of this year, but it's too early to determine exactly how this may play out, given the continued impact from recent COVID variant. Despite these dynamics, Imbruvica remains the market-leading therapy for total patients across CLL and several other major blood cancers. Based on the magnitude of clinical data and real-world evidence generated for Imbruvica, showing sustained disease control as well as overall patient survival, we are confident it will continue to be a meaningful product for AbbVie over the long term. Venclexta, however, is helping to offset some of the headwinds facing Imbruvica. Global sales were $473 million, up 21.1% on an operational basis. In the US, Venclexta's the clear market share leader in frontline AML, among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy and recently achieved leading new patient share in second line plus PLL. We are also seeing robust momentum internationally, with strong performance across all approved indications. Additionally, we continue to make excellent progress building out our hem/onc portfolio, with several compelling late-stage assets, such as epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, Navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-383 for multiple myeloma, expected support -- expected to support sustainable long-term growth. Turning now to neuroscience, where revenues were approximately $1.5 billion, up more than 20% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth from Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and Ubrelvy. Ubrelvy is performing very well and continues to be the market-leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine, with sequential demand growth observed. Qulipta is also demonstrating exceptional uptake in migraine prevention, with recent total prescriptions performing ahead of comparable branded launches. Qulipta is now capturing nearly 25% on of the new-to-brand share in the US preventative CGRP class when we consider both paid and bridge volume. We expect commercial access to continue to ramp strongly over the remainder of the year. Qulipta has also recently demonstrated positive results from a registration-enabling study for the preventative treatment of chronic migraine, which we plan to submit to the agency for potential expanded use in the US as well as to support regulatory applications across the international market. This indication, if approved, will provided added differentiation for Qulipta as the only oral CGRP therapy for the preventative treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our other notable therapeutic, eye care revenues of $771 million were down 2.8% on an operational basis with recent generic competition for Restasis unfavorably impacting our results. Mavyret sales were $380 million, down 4.6% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels. So, overall, I'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on-track to deliver strong revenue growth once again in 2022. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D program. Tom? Yes. Thank you for the question. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we are seeing greater share erosion. Imbruvica continues to be the leading share in the later lines, although we have lost our frontline share position to Calquence. And obviously, Venclexta is also moving there. So we see a couple of things that are taking place. So, we have that share erosion that's putting some pressure on the brand. And then clearly, we see the continued suppression of the market. So, it's kind of like a double hit. If we think of this over the short, mid and longer-term, what I would say would be this. So, in the short-term, meaning this year, we projected the share decline and that includes some stabilization, but we still think the brand is under some pressure from other BTKs and Venclexta. And basically, we have flat guidance this year. And some of that includes a recovery of the market back to sort of more normal levels and we'll have to see how that progresses over the year. If I think more about the midterm, I think what's important context there is, new patient starts essentially make up roughly 13% to 15% of Imbruvica. So it's got a very, very large installed base, about 85%, maybe a little bit more in terms of what that's going to happen. We're not seeing any changes in persistency or items like that. So we think that we have a very good sense of stability for the brand over time in terms of what this may mean. And so that's basically how we think about it. To answer your other question, if you look at the combined share, AbbVie has quite a strong position. We have roughly 33% of total share in the front line and we have between 42% and 46% of second-line plus. So clearly, Venclexta is able to offset as I commented in my remarks some of those pressures. So it's very important for AbbVie. It's going to be a very big brand over the long-term. In the short-term here in midterm, the growth is going to be more challenged moving forward. Yes. Thank you for the question. I'll give you some context. I mentioned that we see roughly in the mid-teens now after about three months, which we're very pleased in and some more flavor on that. If you think about the HCPs and the doctors that prescribe in the US now, you've got about 9, 000. Those are the dermatologists and some allergists. There's about 3,000 of those physicians that are the big prescribers. They're very productive. Those 3,000 are the ones that are driving Skyrizi, for example, or other big brands in psoriasis.  So we see, after just about three months, we see almost 1,000 doctors that have prescribed Rinvoq. And so that's driving that 15%. Some of it depends in terms of where the in-play share ends up, how many of the competitors come in. We're not really sure that baricitinib will come into the market. We'll have to see. We haven't seen much Pfizer activity yet. To give you some sort of international perspective in the Canadian market, we're seeing where there's really just Dupi and Rinvoq at this point after a couple of quarters, we're seeing a 30% in-play share in Canada.  So we are, as I mentioned, very, very encouraged with the early adoption. In particular, my comment around, how fast once you see the first prescription take place with some of those productive doctors, how fast they go to the second or third. To give you some flavor of what we see in the US, and again, the data is early, we see, as expected, the majority of our use so far in that dynamic market are not switches necessarily. We see about, let's say, 1/3, believe it or not, that are not even exposed to Dupi. And the doctors are saying, look, I've already given another oral systemic, for example, but the itch and the skin is so severe that they're going to go -- I'm going to go right and get the relief with Rinvoq.  And then maybe the other two-third, you see Dupi partial responders, particularly related to the itch, just isn't suppressed as much, and they still have some skin involvement. Or there is, as we've highlighted before, a warehouse of Dupi non-responders that has been built up over the last four years. So that's the behavior that we see. Again, I'm very encouraged on the early results, not just in the US but around the world. Rinvoq is going to be a real player in this underserved market. Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So important question. So the way that we see the market for the other ILs, I do think that there will be a segment of conservative dermatologists that will attempt to sequence. And I think that largely that they'll be disappointed because it seems the newer agents are very, very difficult to distinguish from Dupixent. I think certainly, there could be market access dynamics that start to appear with subsequent ILs, I think that's something that we will watch and you would want to watch.  I think what's, again, maybe not appreciated as we watch the early quarters of performance in Europe and the first quarter of performance here in the US, is that there's significant amount of early adopters and dermatologists that will go right to a JAK inhibitor, as I mentioned. They're not always sequencing through Dupi. And it's because the severity of some of these patients and the level of the clinical involvement is very, very significant.  And so, we do see what you would call a significant amount of naive use based on the profile of the JAK inhibitor. Now these are early adopters. These are people that have already contemplated the risk benefit and I think that's important. And so, the way that we see the market developing is that, when physicians would start with Dupi, which will be in a significant proportion of patients, it's not clear at all that their next step will be another IL that has been approved or will be approved.  In fact, we think it's more likely that they will move towards the best JAK that can get to these high levels of skin clearance, the EZ 90 plus almost no perceived itch. And I think that's the endpoint that this market is going to move towards and Rinvoq is the drug that clearly can deliver on that promise. And so that's how we see the market developing, and that's why we remain encouraged on the early results around the world from what we're seeing with the agent. Yes. Thank you, Chris. It's Jeff. So, with your first question is -- we're very confident that we are going to get to high levels of paid access for Rinvoq and Skyrizi's new indications. So, typically, what we'll see based on the approval timeline, we'll be ramping up into the -- by the middle of the year up in the high 90s in terms of our access -- for commercial access. So, I think that everyone should be confident that, that's where you're going to start to see this bridge program start to fully convert as the months go by into the paid prescription. So, typically, that's the timing we're looking at. You're going to see very strong momentum on paid access by -- towards the end of next quarter is what we've guided towards. So, that's the answer to your first question. I think if you think about -- and maybe just to frame the Humira question. The Humira fundamentals are -- and the market fundamentals are quite strong. You see the markets are performing nicely. Our market share growth trends, we haven't seen any trend shift. They've been largely stable. There's some sequential decline based on the size of the market and actually our own brand, Skyrizi and Rinvoq that are playing very strongly into these markets. What I would say is that, in some cases, Q1 can be quite unique over the years. You've got the issue with the plans resetting their deductibles, you've got issues with doctors that have to put in another prior authorization for the year. And so you do see some co-pay and sort of deductible dynamic. But we think that's really a first quarter type of event, and it's largely been very consistent with what we expected. So, maybe I don't know, Rob, if you want to build on that a little bit. Yes, Thank you for the question. And it is a significant opportunity. So, as we highlighted and Tom highlighted, the NDA has been accepted, and we're confident in the approval. I think what we said in the past is that just with the base indication. So, before we get that approval, I mean, the FDA has to still approve it towards the end of the year. We believe that we can ramp towards a $4 billion opportunity. So, that would mean our share just in the base indications of a unique profile with the mania, the mix manian depression, the bipolar depression, we moved somewhere up sort of doubling our share penetration. So right now, we're at about 2.7% TRx share. So we we'd really get close to doubling that based on the momentum.  And then MDD would build on top of that. And so it's significant. I mean, the physicians that we've talked to when we show them the profile are very pleased. First, they know Vraylar, they like Vraylar, they like the strong efficacy, they highlight nonsedating, they highlight at least verbally a brightening effect of the agent, minimal weight gain, metabolic effects. And so as they think about that, how that would translate to adjunctive MDD, they like that profile. The other piece that we hear is they like the starting dose. They like that starting dose of the 1.5 milligram dose, which is what we believe that ultimately will be approved. We'll have to see. So easy to start, easy to take, well tolerated. And so to your point, we believe that MDD will offer some upside and acceleration to the brand's momentum when we achieve it.\nA \u2013 Liz Shea: Thanks Chris. Operator, next question please. And Vamil, it's Jeff now. So I think -- look, we are pleased with the Ubrelvy momentum. I mean, actually, since we launched Qulipta, Ubrelvy has accelerated. So, we have to -- because we can't see the competitor because you can see the whole thing. But when we factor Nurtec by 8 versus 16, and we try to understand the acute dynamic, we can see that we're clearly the market-leading acute CGRP and that's nice to see. The physicians really like Ubrelvy, the markets are robust. I think what you're seeing is what Rob highlighted in terms of the overall performance. I didn't really fully appreciate your second question in terms of the access. I can give you a broad overview. Obviously, we're seeing great momentum with the brand. Much of the brand is still because the access is ramping is still bridged, just like we discussed there with the immunology agent.  So we think, again, by the middle of the year, we're going to see commercial access really start to ramp, and you'll see the conversion start to take place. What's nice is that we're confident in that. We think that our price points and net price or negotiations are going well. And because of its unique profile, as an agent, basically, the strength of the drug is really significant in terms of its performance against episodic migraine. We feel like we're in good shape. And we're going to build on top of that basically 25% in-play share, which is right now at the top of the league table. So, that's how we see it. We're confident in the access ramp. Yes. It's pretty similar based on the way that the pricing and the different dynamics work on the other CGRP. It's not -- it's just sort of a straight -- it's a straight play on the access there. Yes, I don't see, Geoff, much difference. I mean if you think of it in some ways, even on -- let's take Rinvoq, for example. I mean, you could say, wow, in prior viewpoints, maybe everyone will step behind a biosimilar at some point in the future. Well, one, we didn't think that, that would happen wide scale as the market develops anyway. But even if it did, our label is already behind a TNF. And so when you look at the level of efficacy that Rinvoq's bringing in those later lines, I mean it's -- we're really quite insulated from that, I would put forth. And second Skyrizi is just -- is a phenomenal asset. I mean the level of performance and what it's doing to transform certainly psoriasis today, PSA right now and what we think will happen with Crohn's and ultimately, IBD, when you look at the level of healing and sort of restating that standard of care, we think the assets themselves are quite well positioned for the middle part of the decade, and that sort of goes to the elements of the planning that Rick talked about. Yes. Thank you for the question. It's Jeff again. So we are very, very encouraged by the IBD momentum that we can build. And we're right on the cusp of it. And to give some sense is basically this market -- the market of Crohn's and you see that \u2013 it actually has fairly high biologic penetration.  When we do our research and our engagement with the physicians, what they typically have done for more than a decade since the availability of Remicade and then Humira, they really hang on as much as possible to their first-line use. They try to intensify, they do all sorts of things because it's quite scary for the physicians and the patients because no one set a different standard of care. So when you start to look at the healing rates that we start to see with Rinvoq in UC, the healing of the bowel, the remission rate, the combination of what we can see, this market looks very, very good to have both of those assets come in with higher standards of care. So we're very, very encouraged and we think that the IBD market is probably underappreciated in terms of what that looks like. And the patients are so challenged with their disease because it's quite severe with the bowel preparations, the hospitalizations, all of these things, having two assets is a great thing to bring to the market. Certainly, in the US, it's likely we see that with UC today that you're going to have later line use based on the labeling.  Skyrizi is not going to have that limitation. So, you can imagine that you have an ability to co-position to sequence appropriately to think about how you bring that whole portfolio around the world and that's how we see it. We're quite encouraged that we would have both Rinvoq for Crohn's and Rinvoq for Skyrizi in the market. And it's kind of very similar to my comments I made on what's happening with PSA today in rheumatology, where both of those assets Rinvoq for PSA and Skyrizi PSA are in the market together working as a portfolio. To get to your first point, it's been only a month or so with our UC launch, but the physicians, gastros are very encouraged with the profile. They've not seen the level of remission or the level of healing before in any asset. So, there's quite a wow reaction to the efficacy profile. They realize that they have to think about, I've got to think through my patients that are not doing well on TNF or have cycled through a TNF and are struggling. And I mentioned that's a pretty large addressable population. It's at least 50% of the market today. So early qualitative results are quite strong. And the BRIDGE results are also quite strong. So, we're pleased with the gastro launches thus far. Okay. It's Jeff. Just to comment on your BRIDGE question. Thank you for that. So the BRIDGE transition will be very efficient. So, what I mean by that is because of the connections that we have with the payers and our specialty pharmacy network, we're able to \u2013 once access is achieved rapidly and appropriately transition patients from the BRIDGE to basically their paid pharmacy in their prescription.  So, there's not going to be lingering bridge effects, particularly in the immunology space. So, once it starts to move and that access ramps, the BRIDGE transition is quite fast. And that can be within weeks or a month. And we know that that's the case because we have the model from our earlier launches from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So ultimately, once you start to achieve those high levels of access, BRIDGE programs drop very, very fast, and the vast majority, the very vast majority is paid prescriptions. So it's very efficient, and I hope that helps."

            "name": "Carrie Strom",
            "content": "Gary, this is Carrie Strom, President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, and I'll take your question about the aesthetics market. And in Q1, we did see US toxin and filler markets, both growing in the mid-20s percent. And we expect that sort of growth to continue for the rest of 2022.  And the way to think about it is similar amount of absolute volume growth as 2021, but of course, off of a larger base. And in terms of what's driving that market growth, we're seeing very strong demand trends supported by our increased commercial investments, for example, increased consumer activation for acquisition and retention, field force expansions in key markets. And we see these trends also supported just by fundamentals and aesthetics that will continue in the long-term. People think about aesthetics more like health and wellness. It's been much more destigmatized, and we see factors like social media and word of mouth continuing to drive aesthetics in the future. Your question around the pandemic, I would say that we are seeing an impact right now in China, and we anticipate that this recent surge of COVID cases in China which has resulted in lockdowns across several major cities, has reduced patient traffic into aesthetic offices in China. And China is a top market for aesthetics. So, we expect this to impact our near-term international performance for both toxins and fillers. I should also mention that Russia is a key market for fillers globally. And as the tragic events in the Ukraine have unfolded, we have suspended operations for our Aesthetics business in Russia. So, although absolute aesthetic sales in Russia are modest, like I said, Russia is among one of the largest filler markets in the world. So, we expect to see an impact on our filler performance in coming quarters. But despite these dynamics, we do not need to change our total guidance for Aesthetics. So, we see our continued robust toxin performance in the US to offset this anticipated transitory impact in both China and Russia."

            "name": "Rob Michael",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom. AbbVie's first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio, including double-digit growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. We also continue to deliver strong P&L performance, with another quarter of robust operating margin expansion, while fully funding the business for long-term growth. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, reflecting growth of 9.3% compared to prior year and $0.04 above our guidance midpoint. This includes an $0.08 unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense that was not factored into our original guidance. Total net revenues were more than $13.5 billion, up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Net revenues came in above our guidance despite the entry of generic competition for Restasis. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.4% of sales, an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.9% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.1% of sales. Net interest expense was $539 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.1%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to include the $0.08 for acquired IPR&D expense that was incurred during the first quarter. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $13.92 and $14.12. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $59.4 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.4% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue guidance includes updated Restasis sales of approximately $400 million. Moving to the P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of $12.5 billion, and an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.38 and $3.42. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across multiple areas. We are making significant progress with new product launches and the pipeline, underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. Yes. So, this is Rob. I would just add that we've been trying to give investors some directional guidance on how to think about 2023 beyond just the Humira, 45% plus or minus 10%. We've talked about Aesthetics growing high single digits annually over the next decade. You can get a sense based on Jeff's response today and the way to think about Imbruvica. In terms of operating margin, I've talked about that pulling back to the 46% to 47% range with no cuts to investment because we're going to return to growth very quickly. So, we're going to continue to invest in this business. And as I look at Street consensus, I see modeling of cuts in SG&A not necessarily reflecting the appropriate operating margin levels. So, it's something just to keep in mind. And then even -- we've talked about the tax rate growing one point per year on average. Obviously, you saw this year, it only grew 0.2 points. Other years, it may go higher. So, we've tried to give the Street some ideas of the way to think about 2023 model in advance of our formal guidance. This is Rob. What I would add, Steve, just to clarify, I mean, we have a business that's going to deliver high single-digit growth during 2025. It doesn't make sense to be cutting investment in 2023. And that's what the Street consensus is modeling currently. So, we expect to invest in this business, invest in R&D, invest in SG&A to drive that long-term growth. And given how quickly we'll return to that growth, I wouldn't expect us to be cutting investment in 2023. Yes, I would just add that if you look back to our guidance for the quarter and we gave guidance to the therapeutic area level, we pretty much came in line with that guidance. And so we expected this dynamic, and we're also we're not changing our full year outlook for US Humira, 8% growth. And that, again, will be driven by market driving volume growth. And so -- it's in line with our expectations. I understand Street consensus had a different point of view, but we weren't surprised by that. So Vamil, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So when you look at that there is seasonality in this market in the US, and so you do see a shift from Q4 to Q1. If you look at year-over-year, you'd see that in Q4, as you mentioned, Q1 year-over-year is relatively flat. I would think about it that way for the full year as well. So, you do tend to see a suppression in Q1 because of plans resetting that dynamic we see in the US market. But then over the course of the rest of the year, you do see higher pricing. So, on average, the way to think about it is price is relatively stable. So Josh, it's Rob. If you look at the continued consideration, actually, it's a fair value liability, it went down this quarter because of discount rate. So we always have to pay attention to discount rate movement. So we saw the average discount rate increase by about 130 basis points. You're seeing, obviously, as rising interest rates are taking hold of the market. That's something we have to take into account because we had to mark this to market every quarter.  If you look at our release, we had a similar \u2013 we had a decrease last year as well. Again, we had discount rates increase in Q1 of last year, albeit to a lesser extent. So that's what you're seeing is just really the discount rate movement. No other real fundamental changes to the valuation of that liability."

Our performance this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie, with results well above our initial expectations. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our growth platform, the base business excluding Humira, which delivered full year sales growth of more than 8%, with revenue growth accelerating to more than 15% in the fourth quarter. The strength of our diversified growth platform has not only enabled us to successfully absorb the largest loss of exclusivity event to date across our industry, but it's also supported continued investment in our business for long term growth. These investments include: higher adjusted R&D expense, which was increased by nearly $600 million in 2023 and will be ranged substantially again in 2024 to support several promising pipeline programs like 383 in multiple myeloma. 400, our next-generation ADC for several solid tumor types and [Moodi] for HS, as well as inflammatory bowel disease. The proposed acquisition of ImmunoGen and their portfolio of ADCs accelerating our entry into the solid tumor space and strengthening our oncology pipeline, as well as the proposed acquisition of Cerevel, a unique opportunity to augment our presence in neuroscience with the pipeline of differentiated assets. We also increased our quarterly dividend which we announced in October. Since our inception, we have grown our dividend by more than 285%. In summary, our operational execution has been outstanding and we have considerable momentum heading into 2024, including an expected return to operational sales growth just one year following the US Humira loss of exclusivity, driven by our growth platform. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you, Rick. Today we reported another strong quarter and highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $11.11, which is $0.63 above our initial guidance midpoint, excluding the impact of IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $54.3 billion, roughly $2.3 billion ahead of our initial guidance. Most importantly, each of our five key growth areas outperformed our initial expectations. As it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we are focused on three key priorities. First, driving strong performance of our ex- Humira Growth Platform. This platform is the critical driver of our return to robust growth in 2025 and beyond. In our therapeutic portfolio, we have several key brands including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, Ubrelvy, and Qulipta, which are each expected to contribute double-digit sales growth in 2024. We also expect meaningful growth for aesthetics this year, driven by improving market trends in the US and continued execution across our international business. We are well positioned to drive strong long-term growth in this highly under-penetrated market. Second, we are focused on prioritizing investment in our pipeline, which encompasses numerous opportunities to elevate the standard of care for patients. We anticipate updates this year from several important R&D programs including approvals for Skyrizi in UC, 951 in the U.S., and potentially accelerated approval for Epkinly in third line plus follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate regulatory submissions for BoNT/E, our novel short-acting toxin, and potentially Teliso-V, an advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And third, we are focused on closing and integrating ImmunoGen and Cerevel. These two exciting opportunities represent substantial sources of revenue growth well into the next decade. We remain on track with the anticipated closing of both deals in the middle of the year. Today, we are also reaffirming our long-term sales outlook, which includes a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single digit CAGR through the end of the decade. Included in this outlook is an updated forecast for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Based on the impressive growth of both therapies, which we expect will collectively generate approximately $16 billion of revenue in 2024, we now anticipate Skyrizi and Rinvoq will collectively exceed more than $27 billion in sales by 2027 with robust growth continuing into the next decade. This updated forecast reflects an increase of more than $6 billion in revenue compared to our prior 2027 guidance. We expect global sales for Skyrizi to reach more than $17 billion in 2027, reflecting continued share capture in psoriasis where we are the clear market leader, as well as strong uptake in IBD. And we expect Rinvoq to achieve more than $10 billion of global sales in 2027, reflecting continued market growth and share momentum across each of Rinvoq's approved indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD, and atopic dermatitis. This forecast comprehends modest contributions from several new disease areas for Rinvoq, which we anticipate will be launching in the second half of the decade. These new indications have a collective peak sales potential of several billion dollars. Our updated forecast also includes higher estimates for Ubrelvy and Qulipta. We now expect total oral CGRP peak revenue of more than $3 billion, reflecting an increase of more than $1 billion. Our previously issued long-term forecasts for aesthetics, Vraylar, and 951 remain unchanged. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio and our long-term outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.9 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi total sales were approximately $2.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of 51.6%. Rinvoq total sales were more than $1.2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 62.8%. On a full-year basis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq delivered more than $11.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of $4 billion year-over-year. And as Rob just described, we see substantial room for continued growth across each of their currently approved indications. You can get a good sense for this momentum by looking at the relationship between the current in-place share, which includes new and switching patients, and the total prescription share just today. For example, our performance in IBD has been very strong for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In Crohn\u2019s disease, these two treatments together are already capturing roughly one out of every three in-play patients across all lines of therapy in the United States, while their combined total prescription share is only in the mid-single digits. You see a similar trend happening in ulcerative colitis for Rinvoq, and we anticipate launching Skyrizi for this indication later this year. So significant opportunity remains for revenue inflection in IBD, especially given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. Across some of the other notable indications, Skyrizi is capturing roughly half of the in-place psoriasis patients in the U.S. biologic market relative to a total prescription share, which is in the mid-30s percent. Rinvoq is capturing high teens in-play share in the atopic dermatitis market, while total share is in the high single digits. Similarly, in rheumatoid arthritis, Rinvoq is capturing mid-teens in-play share, while total share is roughly 7%. So, again, we see substantial headroom for share gains in addition to the typical robust market growth across rheum, derm, and gastro. Plus, we are planning to have up to five additional indications for Rinvoq across several sizable markets that will potentially provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $3.3 billion, down 40.8% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the U.S. played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets continues to trend better than expected. In the U.S., we have once again secured broad formulary access for Humira in 2024. While there will be some step down in coverage year-over-year, we will still have parity access to biosimilars for the vast majority of U.S. patient lives. Turning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $903 million, down 19% reflecting continued pressure in new patient starts. Venclexta global sales were $589 million, up 13.7% on an operational basis, with strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. The early prescription trends for Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL have been encouraging with commercialization now underway in the US, Europe and Japan. We also anticipate the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Lastly, we have two new and exciting opportunities in oncology. Pending completion of the transaction, we will add Elahere to our portfolio. Elahere is a first-in-class ADC therapy approved for ovarian cancer, which is already demonstrating impressive uptake in the U.S. market. I look forward to welcoming the ImmunoGen commercial team to AbbVie. And Teliso-V, another novel ADC which has demonstrated very promising data in lung cancer. Teliso-V would further expand our scale and growth potential in solid tumors. In neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, total full year revenues were more than $7.7 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.2 billion. In the quarter, total revenues were approximately $2.1 billion, up 22.4% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $789 million were up nearly 40%. We continue to see significant momentum in new prescriptions across all indications following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder just over a year ago. And our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $348 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 40%. We anticipate continued robust demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta this year, including the expansion of Qulipta, the only once daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine into the international markets. Based on the strong momentum, we have raised the outlook for our CGRP portfolio and now expect total peak sales from Ubrelvy and Qulipta combined to exceed $3 billion. Total Botox therapeutic global sales were $776 million, up 6.7% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine, as well as other approved indications. And lastly, we recently launched 951 in both Japan and Europe, and we are pursuing commercial approval in the U.S. later this year. This treatment represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our diversified portfolio, especially the growth platform, which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\nCarrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Fourth quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, an operational increase of 6.9%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $884 million increased 5.7%, marked by accelerating market growth and strong key product performance. Fourth quarter U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $453 million, an increase of 7.3%. We continue to see sustained momentum in the recovery of the U.S. facial toxin market, which was a primary driver of growth in the fourth quarter. Botox Cosmetic remains the clear market leader with strong and stable share, despite new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $156 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 20% versus the prior year. This robust growth was driven by the strong launches of Volux and SkinVive, which continue to drive new consumers and greater penetration in the dermal filler category. Consistent with our expectations, the U.S. filler market recovery trails out of toxins, but it's continuing to show improvement as year-over-year growth was roughly flat in the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, we are pleased with the momentum of our U.S. aesthetics portfolio. We expect full year sales growth as our market leadership positions us very well from a competitive perspective, and we anticipate continued recovery in both toxin and filler markets. Internationally, fourth quarter aesthetic sales were $487 million, representing an operational increase of 9%. We experienced strong performance in most regions and growth benefited from the impact of China's COVID lockdowns in late 2022. Within China, the softening economic conditions that emerged in the third quarter continued to impact results. Consistent with what we experienced in the US, the economic slowdown has impacted fillers more than toxins, based upon their relatively higher price. We anticipate economic headwinds will continue in China over the near term, balanced against our expectations for continued strong performance in other international regions. Looking to the long-term, Aesthetics remains an area with very low market penetration. And we have demonstrated our ability to drive growth through investments in our customers, consumers, and innovation. As such, we anticipate Aesthetics will be a strong growth portfolio for years to come and remain confident in our ability to deliver more than $9 billion of sales by the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\nRoopal Thakkar: Thank you, Carrie. In 2023, we saw significant evolution of our pipeline with multiple data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals, as well as expansion of our R&D efforts with the announced ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We expect to continue this progress with numerous important clinical and regulatory milestones anticipated this year. In immunology, we recently announced positive topline results for lutikizumab our anti-IL-1 alpha beta bispecific being evaluated in hidradenitis suppurativa. In the Phase 2 study, lutikizumab demonstrated higher, high score of 50 and high score of 75 measures, as well as improvement in skin pain compared to placebo. These are very impressive results considering all patients who were inadequate responders to anti-TNF therapy. And 70% of the patients were early stage three, which is the most advanced stage of the disease. Based on these results, we plan to begin a Phase 3 program in HF later this year. We also plan to evaluate lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, given the role that IL-1 likely plays in these diseases. Patients with UC who have an IL-1 beta signature have shown resistance to anti-TNF and other biologics, providing strong rationale for a potential biomarker approach. Additionally, we believe lutikizumab has the potential to be used in combinations to provide transformational levels of efficacy in IBD. We plan to evaluate combo approaches with lutikizumab and Skyrizi, as well as with other pipeline assets in Crohn's. Our Phase 2 studies in IBD are expected to begin later this year. Our regulatory applications are under review for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis. With approval decisions expected in the US and Europe later this year. Once Skyrizi is approved in UC, along with Rinvoq, we will have two assets with different mechanisms of action in IBD, both offering very high levels of efficacy. AbbVie will be very well-positioned with an industry-leading suite of treatment options for patients suffering from moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We continued to make very good progress with the second wave of development programs for Rinvoq. With Phase 3 studies underway in five new indications, giant cell arteritis, lupus, HF, alopecia areata and vitiligo. We anticipate data readouts for these programs over the next three years, beginning with data from our GCA study this year. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make very good progress across our heme and solid tumor programs. In the area of hematologic oncology, we'll see data in the second half of this year from the Venclexta Phase 3 VERONA trial in treatment-naive higher-risk MDS patients, with regulatory submissions and approvals, anticipated in 2025. For Epkinly, we anticipate regulatory approvals in third-line or greater follicular lymphoma later this year in both the US and Europe. We also expect to begin several new Phase 3 studies in 2024, including studies in second-line DLBCL and frontline follicular lymphoma. At the recent ASH Meeting, we presented new data for our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma. 383 is engineered for high-affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells, and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T-Cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T-Cell engaging BCMA-based therapies, while preserving high levels of efficacy. We're very encouraged by the data emerging from our Phase 1b study, which show treatment with 383 is yielding deep and durable responses. With a lower incidence and severity of CRS. With this profile, we believe 383 can be a highly effective and tolerable treatment for multiple myeloma. While potentially allowing for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. All attributes, which would make it very appealing to both patients and physicians. We remain on track to begin a Phase 3 monotherapy study in third-line multiple myeloma this year. And we plan to begin combination trials in earlier lines of therapy in 2025. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive topline results from the Teliso-V Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. Teliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints, including, overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival, with a tolerable safety profile. We believe these results have the potential to support accelerated approval. And we plan to discuss the data with regulators in the coming months. Pending alignment with the FDA, our submission is planned for the second half of this year. We're also making good progress with our next-generation c-Met ADC ABBV-400, which utilizes the same c-Met blocking antibody as Teliso-V, but has a proprietary Topo-1 warhead to afford deeper and more durable responses with an improved therapeutic index. We remain on track to see data this year from the non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cohorts from our Phase 1 study. And based on the progress we're making in our colorectal program, we plan to begin a Phase 3 study later this year in third-line CRC. We also continue to make very good progress with our anti-GARP antibody ABBV-151. Our Phase 2 study in second-line hepatocellular carcinoma is underway, and we plan to begin several additional Phase 2 studies this year, including frontline HCC, frontline lung cancer and metastatic urothelial cancer. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving to Neuroscience where we recently announced the European launch of ABBV-951 for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We also recently provided our complete response submission to the FDA for 951 with an approval decision anticipated in the second quarter. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery system has the potential to offer meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development. 951 delivers significant improvements in off-time and on-time with a less invasive non-surgical system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by DUOPA. And it doesn't require combination with oral drugs to achieve high efficacy. 951 also provides a full 24-hour benefit, which should result in less morning akinesia. We're extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in Europe and the US once approved. In our Aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application in the US for Botox in platysma prominence. We anticipate an approval decision in the second half of this year. And we remain on track to complete the remaining CMC work this year for BoNT/E, our rapid onset short-acting novel toxin. Following completion of the remaining work, we plan to submit our regulatory application in the second half of the year, with approval anticipated near the end of 2025. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2024. I also look forward to integrating the ImmunoGen and Cerevel teams and pipeline assets into our R&D organization once those transactions close this year. These two transactions significantly strengthened our oncology and neuroscience pipelines with the addition of several novel assets that have the potential to become innovative new therapies for many patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Reents: Thank you, Roopal. I'm very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2023. We have substantial momentum across the portfolio to support our long-term growth outlook. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, which is $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.3 billion, $300 million ahead of our guidance, and down 5.4%. Most notably, these results reflect 15.3% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 43.8% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of 13.4% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.7% of sales. Adjusted net interest expense was $363 million, the adjusted tax-rate was 17.2%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $11.05 and $11.25. This earnings per share guidance includes dilution related to the ImmunoGen and Cerevel acquisitions of $0.32, which assumes closing in the middle of the year. Please note this guidance does not include an estimate for required IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect total net revenues of approximately $54.2 billion, reflecting a return to modest operational growth. At current rates, we expect foreign-exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for our key products in therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $25.6 billion, including Humira sales of $9.6 billion, including US erosion of roughly 36%. Skyrizi revenue of $10.5 billion, reflecting growth of more than $2.7 billion due to strong market-share performance in psoriasis, as well as robust uptake in IBD. And Rinvoq sales of $5.5 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 40% with continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications. On a full-year basis, we anticipate that our strong volume growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq will be modestly offset by low-single digit negative net price. In oncology, we expect sales of $5.7 billion, including Imbruvica revenue of $2.9 billion and Venclexta sales of $2.4 billion. As well as contributions from Epkinly, and partial year sales from Elahere. For Aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.7 billion. Including $2.9 billion from Botox Cosmetic and mid-single-digit revenue growth from Juvederm. For Neuroscience, we expect revenue of $8.9 billion, representing growth of more than 15%, including Vraylar sales of $3.4 billion, Botox Therapeutic sales of $3.2 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.6 billion. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2024, we are forecasting full-year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment of 14% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% of sales, and adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.1 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.7%. Finally, we expect share count to be roughly flat to 2023. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $11.9 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $5.1 billion, including Skyrizi sales of $1.9 billion, and Rinvoq revenue of $1 billion. These estimates reflect typical first quarter seasonality as well as low single digit unfavorable net price. We expect Humira global revenue of $2.2 billion, including US sales of $1.7 billion. We also anticipate oncology revenue just above $1.3 billion, Aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, Neuroscience revenue of $1.9 billion, and eye care sales of $600 million. We are forecasting an adjusted gross margin of approximately 83.5% of sales and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales. We also model a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.30 and $2.34. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $12.8 billion. And we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $18 billion in 2024, which includes roughly $1.9 billion in Skyrizi royalty payments. The strong free cash flow will fully support a strong growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 285% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down the approximately $7 billion of maturities this year, and also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong. We'll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: Yes, the first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just I was looking for a little bit more color on the longer-term immunology outlook. You're targeting $27 billion plus by 2027 and highlighting growth from there. So, I guess my question was just can you elaborate on how mature the existing indications, these products are going to be by 2027? And what type of growth can we anticipate longer-term? And maybe as part of that, it seems like from the comments that the growth beyond 2027 is more skewed towards Rinvoq given the new indications, but [indiscernible] like is it balanced Rinvoq and Skyrizi, or has it become more of a Rinvoq driven franchise in terms of the growth drivers over time? Thanks so much.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, Chris. It's Jeff. Maybe I'll walk through a little bit of the process there and answer your questions. So we can see historically actuals and sort of fast forward in terms of the first thing we look at is the bio penetration of these big indications. And there still remain significant headroom in terms of the ability for moderate to severe patients with these diseases to continue to be exposed to these biologics and these advanced orals, absolutely. And we can see for sure that psoriasis still in -- even in the US is about 15%, it's relatively modest, atopic dermatitis, the penetration rate is only about 7%. And then you have higher penetrated markets like IBD and I'll talk about what's interesting about IBD, that\u2019s somewhere in the 40% or 50% range across those. And then we can see clearly as these markets develop and I've highlighted this before that you see line of therapy expansion. So first-line becomes less and less important, as you move towards second and third-line over time. And right now, IBD is a big story about that, that we calculate into our long-term estimates, because it's still largely despite the severity a frontline oriented market, because physicians, just kind of hang on to their frontline agents, that's going to change quite dramatically believe over this mid-term and even in the long-term perspective. We have a good peg on the market growth rates. Many of these market growth rates are very significant, very stable. And we'll have good growth rates going into the next decade because of these dynamics around bio penetration and line of therapy expansion. I highlighted in my remarks around share, share we -- we have a very good competitive position, very high capture rates. And we're really in the sort of low end of the range in terms of the total prescription share, that will feed up and catch up to that. Pricing, I think we talked a little bit. We're not going to give detailed pricing. But certainly, you can see based on Scott's comments that, the idea of a high CAGR on high single-digit pricing is not something we've contemplated. So, we believe that there is significant room for growth even past 2027. Especially, as we'll have more Rinvoq indications coming that we've talked through. So we think that we're going to see robust growth based on our share capture and also how dynamic these markets are into the next decade.\nRob Michael: And Chris, this is Rob. I'll just add, you think about the markets, the rheum market is growing low-single digits, atopic dermatitis is growing mid-teens and IBD is growing high-single-digits. So they're very strong market, they will continue to be strong markets for us. And we're also seeing, as Jeff mentioned, there's a lot of headroom in terms of share capture. So we do expect that robust growth to continue beyond 2027 into early part of the next decade. I think your observation is correct. Given that we would expect up to five new indications for Rinvoq. If you look at the rate of growth, Rinvoq versus Skyrizi, I think it's reasonable to assume that Rinvoq would have a higher rate of growth given the new indications, but both will grow very nicely. So, I would certainly encourage you to look at more robust expectations for both therapies with Rinvoq a little bit higher because of the new indications.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, the next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Rick, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on succession planning and timing, we've been fielding that question from a number of investors recently, given you're now pass the Humira LOE. And positioned the company very well here given Skyrizi and Rinvoq commercial success and also some of the recent pipeline build-out. And then the second question I have was on our pipeline on lutikizumab. I know you guys have highlighted this, not a lot of focus from the investor side yet. Maybe if you could just talk about the size of the commercial opportunity in HS. And then why you're confident that, that Phase 2 HS data will translate into success in the IBD side. Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: All right, Terence. This is Rick. So I'll cover the first one. I guess what I would say is, I have nothing new to report today, but what I'd indicate is, we've talked about the criteria that we're going to use to make the decision when we're going to make the transition. That criteria is the same, when we believe that we are comfortable, we've navigated the LOE, and the rest of the business is performing at high level. That's the point at which we want to make the transition, because we think that's the best time to be able to transition the CEO position. So I understand there's a lot of interest from investors here, that's logical and clear. Maybe what I can do is, give you a little better perspective on the process that we're going to use in order to make the decision with the Board. I would say, the Board has been actively involved for the last four or five years with a lot of emphasis around ensuring that our internal candidate would get the experiences that we thought were needed prior to making the transition. I can tell you from my perspective, that's gone extremely well. We have regularly scheduled Board meetings several times a year where we specifically talk about succession and the progress that we're making. At the point at which the business has achieved that criteria that I described before, at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting, then I would make a recommendation to the Board that this is the proper time to be able to make the transition. The Board would vote on that recommendation. At the end of that vote, we would send out an announcement to investors. And what you can expect when you get that announcement is that, we would make an announcement that we were going to make the transition out at some point in the future, in all likelihood four months to six months in the future. And the purpose of that is to make the final transition between myself and that person. And that'll take four months to five months in order to be able to do that. I would say it's also very likely at that time, based on the discussions I've been having with the Board, is that, I will be named the Executive Chair for a period of time, and the purpose of that will be to make the transition of the full position over a period of time. So I think it's a very well thought out, I think very well managed process. And I think that's what you can expect going forward.\nJeff Stewart: And Terence, this is Jeff, I'll start-off and have Roopal will address the second part of your second question. So we established many years ago now this HS market with the approval of Humira. And we thought it was a relatively small market, and it turned out to be quite a surprise. There is a significant amount of patients around the world that suffer from HS, it's already a multi-billion dollar category. And we think it's going to continue to expand. And I say that, because we can see that like IBD, there's just some new approvals just coming. So, everyone sort of holds on Humira as long as they can if they're exposed to a biologic. And so we see the same dynamic as you start to see IL-17s come into this space, and certainly, we're very excited about lutikizumab because of the profile that we're seeing emerge in the clinic. So it's a significant commercial opportunity. And I would say that when we look back over all the Humira indications, over the last decade or more, HS was one of the most rapid indications that moved to $1 billion plus business. So it's an exciting opportunity, both commercially and certainly for patients. And Roopal can address your comment on IBD.\nRoopal Thakkar: Yes. Hi, Terence. Part of it starts, I would say, almost 15 years ago with our insights in Crohn's disease with Humira, as Jeff was discussing, where we started to see efficacy in patients that had HS. We saw a good amount of overlap between Crohn's and HS. So that's part of it. Now that doesn't really pan out for IL-17, but what we've observed with IL-1 beta in particular is that, our internal data and external data do show elevated expression signals with one beta. So we think we have that opportunity with luti, because it also covers 1 beta and we have two shots at this, right. One is, to go specifically and look at a biomarker-driven targeted profile where we would be able to distinguish which patients actually have that higher expression. And the other approach, which we maybe weren't talking about years ago because we didn't have a product like Skyrizi which have high efficacy and very strong safety profile in Crohn's. What we have now is the opportunity to also look at in combination. So a biomarker approach and a combo approach, our insights from Humira and preclinical or biopsy-based insights that we have externally and internally.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, the next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Baum: Hi, many thanks. Couple of questions. One, given AbbVie's strength in market access in managed market, I'd be curious the extensive future contagion from RNA IRA-mediated price cuts on the Medicare book spending over onto the commercial book of business. How much of concern do you think this is, given that has basically the same. And then second question on lutikizumab, if I remember from the canakinumab trials secondary to neutropenia, there was an increase in fatal infections. If you lay on this on top of another immunosuppressive, how are you thinking about the safety concerns in these IBD patients?\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, Andrew. Thanks for your question. It's Jeff. We think that the, particularly the negotiation aspects of the IRA will be very contained on the Medicare side. And as you can imagine with government programs over the years -- when we had discussion with payers, they'll often say things over, well we know what the FSS price is for the VA or demand mandated discounts and supplemental discounts in the Medicaid channel. But we think those are really government actions and government rules. And so, we see that the market we believe will play out largely like it has with the other government channels, that it's a unique dynamic in terms of essentially a forced negotiation that we think will be contained largely in the Medicare space. So that's how we view the world.\nRoopal Thakkar: Hi it's Roopal, I'll talk about luti and your question around neutrophils. Yes, we do see impact on neutrophils, it's dose-driven. However, I think we think about inflammatory bowel disease, probably lupus, others to have a different tolerance for benefit-risk, because today in those disease states despite the success that we've seen with Skyrizi and Rinvoq, there's still substantial headroom to lead to more transformational efficacy, not every patient is getting into remission, though high levels, not every patient. So we still believe that a combo can get to that and break that efficacy threshold. The other opportunity there is what we'll do with the combination is obviously optimize the dose to assure safety. And thus far in the HS trial, even at the highest dose we saw very little infections.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Andrew. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, the next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Congrats on all the progress. I just want to go back to the ImmunoGen acquisition and the comments you made before. Can you talk a little bit about the plans to move the drug into earlier lines of ovarian cancer. You talked about maintenance setting, but more we are reading it, I mean, in first-line maintenance, the PFS and OS tends to be really long. So could you talk a little bit about the strategy there and how do you overcome the existing OS benefit that these drugs provide? Thank you.\nRoopal Thakkar: Hi, Mohit. It's Roopal, I'll take that. So, I think as you've seen in resistance we've seen that overall survival benefit, a very substantial one, unprecedented thus far. And to your point, the plan is to move into earlier lines of therapy. Secondly, it's also part of the strategy to move into sensitive populations, which is around 55% of the population, resistance is around 45%. And then the third aspect is, we've seen encouraging data in medium expressers of FR alpha. And those are approximately 30% of the patients, high is around 35%. So those are the three strategies to go forward. Now how do we get into earlier lines of therapy? Well, a couple of things, insights that we've seen. One is, we've seen Elahere been able to combine at full dose with carbo-platinum. So that's encouraging, that gives you an opportunity to upfront combine. And then as you stated, maintain on Elahere or with Elahere plus BEV. So the other approaches that we would do getting to earlier line of maintenance is have that upfront therapy and then we see patients that go onto BEV, we can combine with BEV at that time point. And we'll be looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors, which is about the other half of the patient populations, which are HRD deficient. So, taken altogether, we see there is an opportunity. Now, the PFS is going to be a little bit longer, along with OS. So that is something that we're planning for, we'll start these studies as soon as possible, but they will read out in the later part of the decade and into 2030.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is (inaudible) on for Vamil. Thanks for taking my question. So my question is on Humira. I was curious, given the recent performance of company has had with the erosion since the introduction of biosimilars. I was wondering if you can now provide maybe a better sense around the company's expectations on Humira's longer-term tail revenues in both the US and ex-US markets. Thank you.\nRob Michael: Hi, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So we do expect that in the US tail will start to emerge in 2025 or 2026 timeframe. Keep in mind 2024 is the first full year for US biosimilars. We'll have to see what happens with volume uptake this year and also where interchangeability lands. And ultimately, what does contracting look like next year. So, I wouldn't expect us to quantify the tail this year. But it's certainly possible, something we would do either in 2025 or 2026. As it relates to international, you're seeing, I think this year, it's a step-down of about $400 million. Half of that is really the last wave of markets like Canada, Puerto Rico where we're seeing, I'd say, some incremental erosion we would expect this year. And then the other half would be your typical international price erosion you see across therapeutic areas. So not really specific to biosimilars. And then the other quarter of it would be what we're seeing is just the strength of Skyrizi and Rinvoq as these newer agents elevate standard-of-care, you see some share go to those newer agents. And so, probably the best way to think about international would be, if you want to adjust for half of the erosion this year as being more of the final waves, and then you get a sense of what could potentially be the ongoing beyond that. But we'll be more specific, I think we need to see really how the US plays out with this being the first full year for biosimilars, before we can really give you more color. But we're very, very pleased with the progress we've made so far.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Dan. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Two on the neuroscience portfolio. I guess first on 951. How should we think about that? Is that more sort of on growing the overall pie of device data therapies versus taking share from apomorphine and gels. And then, maybe looking a little bit longer-term, AbbVie has sort of three Phase 2 Alzheimer's studies that are going to readout later this year or by early next year. Fully acknowledging the commercial challenges by the players in the market today and that's some of these targets are now validated. How should investors think about these assets either individually or collectively and your level of excitement? Thank you.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So what we look at when we see this market at a macro -- at a macro-level, you have a significant number of patients, 85% of patients are just on these oral medication. So, oral [indiscernible]. Okay. And they essentially need to consume more and more and more orals, and sometimes at the end of it they're taken 12 pills a day, it's very, very difficult to manage. But then they're faced with a very difficult decision, which we kind of call like a surgical barrier. And that surgical barrier is to get any sort of more advanced relief, you either have to think about deep brain stimulation, which is a brain surgery or our own DUOPA, which is a GI surgery. So the way we see this market developing is we see that 951 starts to establish a very nice transition zone, because you don't have -- it's a subcu. So a new market segment that starts to emerge before bigger interventions like DBS or DUOPA. And obviously, the ability to basically move quicker to more relief from these chronic oral basically over treatment. So that's how we see it. And as Roopal highlighted, we're seeing some very nice uptake in Japan, where we launched late last year, and also in Germany and some of the first European launches. So that's how the market is exactly playing out. We're establishing essentially a new high efficacy category here with 24 hours of ongoing relief. You can do super specific dosing titration and the pump is much smaller and again, it's a subcu injection that you move around every three days. So it's a nice -- it's a nice opportunity for the company.\nRoopal Thakkar: And maybe I'll talk about the other assets that you mentioned in Alzheimers. First, 916, that's our A beta antibody. What we like about that one thus far, the profile we've seen is a long half-life, which would be good to space out dosing. Potentially higher potency if that holds, and we see robust reductions in beta amyloid that could allow for subcutaneous dosing that's spaced apart. And the other thing we are looking at is potentially lower ARIA. So if we see those three things over the course, I would say, end of this year, early next year, I think that, that would be quite exciting, because it would be a differentiated profile, again a better convenience and potentially better benefit-risk profile. So that's 916. 552 is our SV2A that's our oral medication in cognition that's currently in Phase 2. And we anticipate readout at the end of this year, early next year. Now, that one is being studied in a setting where patient can be on a therapy already like an [Aricept] (ph), or nothing. And we would use the typical ADAS-Cog assessments along with a variety of others including other neuropsychiatric symptoms, like depression. So that's another nice one that could combine with a variety of different assets in Alzheimers. The third one I'll mention is around Emraclidine, which comes from Cerevel. They are at early stages right now in elderly patients. And the goal there would be an Alzheimer's disease psychosis of the six million or so diagnoses, I would say around 40% of these patients present with symptoms of psychosis. So with all the therapies that are in the clinic, we think we have a very nice complementary suite of options that could address numerous symptoms of Alzheimers, because it won't be just one therapy that's going to solve this. But more to come end of this year and into next year.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from [Technical Difficulty]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for the question. Just on the reaffirmed long-term guide, can I clarify if the Cerevel and ImmunoGen deals are in this 2029 guide given you included them in the 2024 guide? And you up Skyrizi and Rinvoq by $6 billion, migraine by $1 billion. If these are the pushes, what are the pulls in reaffirming that long-term guidance?\nRob Michael: So, this is Rob. I'll take that question. Yes, we did include ImmunoGen and Cerevel in our long-term guide. The thing to keep in mind is, high-single-digits, when you think about the range that could represent, that's around $10 billion between the low-end of the high-single-digits and the high-end of the high-single-digits. And so, there aren't any pulls, what we've updated as we walk you through it is, we've increased the oral CGRP peak revenue, we've increased Skyrizi, Rinvoq and we've reaffirmed the others. So there's nothing that we took down. But just keep in mind that you've got a pretty, pretty wide range. If you look at Street consensus, we're encouraged that it continues to move up. It has moved up over the course of the last quarter, about $3 billion in 2029. It's nice to see that upward movement. But it's still below what we expect. If you think that, that growth rate for the Street is just under 5%, we expect high-single-digits. And so, even with this update, as well as ImmunoGen and Cerevel, we're still high-single-digits. But keep in mind, it's a pretty wide range. And it would be, regardless industry-leading growth and we're set up very well to continue delivering a very strong growth, and we're setting ourselves very well to grow very nicely in the next decade as well.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, [indiscernible]. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGary Nachman: Thanks and good morning. First on Aesthetics, could you talk a bit more why you're confident in what seems to be a pretty decent return to growth in 2024. So how much of a headwind could China be offsetting the US growth. And what are other regions will you be getting some somewhat of a lift this year. Just talk about the dynamics on that front. And then secondly, just -- as you return to more robust revenue growth in 2025, what are reasonable expectations for operating margins directionally in 2025. Can that expand at all or is it more likely to be depressed from the ImmunoGen and Cerevel deals? Just give us some directional way to think about that for next year. Thank you.\nCarrie Strom: Hi, this is Carrie, I'll take your first question on Aesthetics and the Aesthetics market recovery. So I'll start with the US and we have started to see the US toxin market recover the end of 2023. We expect that recovery to continue. And for the market growth for toxins to continue to improve in 2024. For fillers, in the US, in Q4, after multiple quarters of decline, the filler market in the US was somewhat flat. And so, that dynamic of the filler market recovery lagging the toxin market recovery is playing out. And we do expect that recovery on fillers to also continue -- to a lesser degree than toxins, more of a modest growth, positive growth for 2024. And as we look at the beginning of the year here in 2024, we are seeing our patient demand metrics and Google metrics really supporting our expectations here. In terms of China, we do expect the economic headwinds that we saw beginning mid-year 2023 to continue in the near-term with China. And we expect the China Aesthetics market to be flat overall in 2024. That would look like negative market in the first half of the year until the China market starts to recover in the second half of 2024. And we expect that China performance to be balanced against expectations for strong performance in other international regions, including Japan, which has become an important market for Aesthetics and areas of Latin America, like Brazil, which is a highly aesthetically oriented market. It's also important to know in terms of Q1 of 2024, in terms of our guidance there that the growth in the US will be offset by that international decline, specifically in China. So not only the China economic headwinds, but also a difficult year-over-year comp in Q1, because recall, in Q1 of 2023, there was the post-pandemic reopening in China. So that's really how we see the market growth factors in US, China and other parts of the world playing out in 2024.\nRob Michael: And Gary, this is Rob. To build on the Aesthetics story, I said in the past to get to our guidance of greater than $9 billion, we need to deliver annual growth of high-single-digits on average. And as Carrie just walked you through, we haven't quite seen the recovery for the fillers market yet this year. And we will, but it's not going to be a normal year, we'll see a ramping. And we also had a slowdown in China. But despite that we're still delivering high single digit growth. And given how under penetrated these markets are, we can drive that market growth that's required to achieve the long-term guidance. And then on top of that, we have several innovations that will further support that growth. I've said this before, but the masseter and platysma indications for Botox will add a few $100 million each. Our novel short-acting toxin BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients who have not started toxin due to fear of an unnatural look. So that could drive an inflection in market growth and market share. And then our region, our fillers pipeline is really aimed at providing both short and long-term treatment benefits for consumers. So we have several avenues to get to our greater than $9 billion guide. I have seen consensus estimates at $8 billion for 2029, but we're very confident in our guidance of greater than $9 billion by that period.\nScott Reents: Gary, this is Scott. I'll take your question regarding operating margin expansion. So for 2024, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've guided to 46.5%. When we do return to robust growth in 2025, we do see that operating margin will expand, and will continue to expand as we grow through the decade. I think that when we think about the pace of that expansion, it will be a relatively steady over several years. I would though, if you're modeling that, I would kind of peak it out at around 50%. I think that's where we'll hit a peak at the operating margin. But we do see expansion both in 2025 on that return to robust growth, including the impact of the two transactions ImmunoGen and Cerevel, which should presumably be a full-year at that point in time. But at the full year impact, we see that expansion. And I do think it's worth noting, even at our current levels, we have industry-leading operating margin. And certainly with the future expansion we will continue to have that and only grow that position.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Gary. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nSteve Scala: Thank you very much. Two questions. Is the current tax rate fully reflecting likely tax changes in the US and outside the US? So, it represents a high watermark for the foreseeable future. Previously the company spoke to a 16% tax rate. And we're pretty much there. So I am wondering if the increases are kind of behind us? And then Rick, a slightly different kind of question, but there are clear, obvious reasons such as the success of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, but I'm curious if you would share with us a few of the externally less visible factors that are leading to AbbVie's success traversing the Humira patent expiration that your pharma peers missed when dealing with their own pressures. I would assume contracting formulary management, allocation of overhead are all part of it. But what would you be willing to share with us? Thank you.\nScott Reents: Steve, this is Scott. I'll start with your tax rate question. So with respect to the tax rate, we were essentially flat between this year and last year at 15.7%. We do see that tax rate over the three year period including this year increasing about 1% on average. Now that's not going to be a 1% per year. What you'll see is a step up in a couple of years when the US tax rates do increase the GILTI rate in particular, will increase. So we see that over a three year period about 1% per year on average. That does include all the impacts of a number of things going on globally with the OECD and some of these -- OECD minimum taxes and other things. I would say the one thing it does not include, you saw just this week, the House passed a tax bill that includes the provision regarding the R&D expensing. So if that bill were to pass, as it's written, we would see a slight step down in our tax rate, about 80 basis points from the impact of that on an ongoing basis.\nRick Gonzalez: Steve, this is Rick. I think if you step back and you look over the last, I'd say, 10 years, we were trying to develop a strategy that we fundamentally believed will allow us to be able to offset the Humira LOE and continue to deliver top-tier financial performance as we have for the past 10 years. That was the whole objective. And we knew we had to build a very diversified growth platform in order to be able to do that, to be able to absorb that impact and return to growth as rapidly as possible. And so, we as an executive team focused a lot of energy around how do we do that, how do we build it, how do we do it in the right markets. I think AbbVie, I'm obviously biased, I guess, but I would say our commercial execution has always been exceptional in my opinion. We understand the markets we're in extremely well. We understand the competitive environment that we compete in those markets extremely well. We understand the patient journey and how that patient journey is affected by access to medicines to ensure that patients can get their medicines routinely and be able to get the benefit of those medicines. It takes all of those things I think to end up with kind of success that we see with assets like Skyrizi and Rinvoq. But it also takes I think a company that is very good at what I describe as read and react. There are always challenges in businesses as big and as complex as this. And I think the difference between companies that can continue to perform at the top tier, year in and year out is they're good at seeing issues, and then quickly reacting to how they're going to either offset those, or deal with those. We had many of those examples. I'd say the label change on Rinvoq was a great example. But look at where Rinvoq is growing now. And despite that label change many would not have predicted that. Migraine, was a very challenging market for a period of time. We look at how we've operated with Ubrelvy and Qulipta. And the kind of success we've seen against the competitors in those markets. Neuroscience, very different kind of market with Vraylar. That's all about trying to grow market-share and expand your position there with a very good asset. And so, we're good at that, and I think that is the real differentiator. The other thing I'd say is, I think we have been very efficient at our R&D investment. We obviously don't have the largest R&D investment in the industry. But we produced a tremendous amount of return against that R&D investment. Now having said that, as we go forward, we know we need to increase R&D as I've said in my comments. We did a fairly significant increase last year despite dealing with the Humira LOE. And we're going to do another fairly significant increase this year because we had some assets that had very, very significant opportunities like 383 and like 400 and several others. They are going to require a large Phase 3 -- multiple large Phase 3 studies to be able to get the kind of label that we need, and that's another thing, I'd say, we're good at. Understanding how you have a competitive label and building your clinical programs to get that. So, I think it requires all of those things. I don't think there is one magic formula. I think those are the kinds of things that we have honed here at AbbVie an executive team. And we execute very well against those.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. It\u2019s [Nachman] (ph) for Evan. I wanted to ask -- thinking about the upcoming approval for Skyrizi, and you see how is management thinking about how that may or may not impact Rinvoq sales, obviously combined AbbVie offers some immpresive suite of inflammatory assets. But what is the expectation of cannibalism across these assets potentially? Thanks.\nJeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. I'll take that one. We've learned a lot from watching Skyrizi and Rinvoq in Crohn's. And to Rick's points, look, we're very careful about how we position these assets, you know how we basically represent them with our medical teams and our commercial teams. And so what we see certainly in our biggest markets, we see that they are actually complementary positioning. So, Rick highlighted the label change, right. So Rinvoq, in the US, is basically indicated for use after a TNF. So it's basically a later-line therapy. Skyrizi, if you look at the Skyrizi, you see results, it's very, very impressive. We've studied some very, very tough patients there. The bio-naive patients, the efficacy is just outstanding. I would say it's best-in-class. So we can see that based on the profile of the agents for many of our representatives, we're able to talk to physicians about the consideration for Skyrizi frontline. And then in later lines Rinvoq. So the cannibalization or the overlap is very manageable and minimal. And what happens is you start to see this, this very significant build for total AbbVie share because of that complementary positioning. So we're quite confident that we'll be able to navigate this very well just as we see in the larger Crohn's market.\nLiz Shea: Thanks for the question. Operator next call -- next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson: Hi, I have a question on obesity drug impact on AbbVie's Aesthetics business. So the uptake for obesity drugs could be a headwind or a tailwind. That's a potential headwind if patients only have so many dollars to spend on Aesthetics and they reallocate their out-of-pocket spending away from dermal fillers and toxins towards obesity drugs? Or it's a tailwind if patients using obesity drugs get things like the so-called Ozempic face and they end up using more toxins and fillers. So, what's been the experience thus far. And what do you expect going forward over the next handful of years? Thank you.\nCarrie Strom: Hi, this is Carrie. So the short answer is, we have not seen an impact on our Aesthetics business positive or negative so far. That said, absolutely, our customers and our consumers are participating in this market. We are seeing it integrated into some of these Aesthetics practices. And to your point, there are instances where a patient will make a trade-off in terms of her share of wallet. But that said, we do see it as a long-term tailwind anytime people are getting more engaged in their appearance, that's a positive thing for Aesthetics. And as we ask our consumers and our customers about it, really that -- what we've learned is that it does reinforce its long-term tailwind because the majority of people who engage in these medical weight-loss products are more interested in Aesthetics afterwards than they never before. So, that's really how we see it in terms of the that dynamic impacting Aesthetics.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Tim Lugo with William Blair. Your line is open.\nTim Lugo: Thanks for taking the question. After the two announced acquisitions in December, what are the team's thoughts on M&A in 2024. Some of your peers have given guidance on expected deal sizes. Is that something you can provide the Street or at least talk about your capacity at this point?\nRob Michael: Hi, Tim, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on identifying assets, really that can drive growth in the next decade across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. But we have what we need in our current portfolio to deliver on growth expectations in this decade. So our external efforts are really aimed at early-stage opportunities, which are typically smaller-sized deals. As we look across the growth areas, if you think about immunology Skyrizi and Rinvoq will drive robust growth into the next decade. So our focus in immunology in terms of BD is really looking for new mechanisms of action that can elevate standard-of-care whether monotherapy or in combination. I'd say there's a lot of interest in combination. In oncology, ImmunoGen really nicely complements our efforts with ADCs, it gives us a head start, an entry in the solid tumor space, that we're not in today. But in addition to ADCs, we're focused on bispecific, multi- specifics immuno onc agents. We also recently announced a collaboration with Umoja studying insight to CAR-T therapy. So a lot of focus in oncology, but these again would be earlier-stage smaller-sized deals. In Neuroscience, Cerevel adds depth to our neuropsych pipeline, but we also have a focus on migraine and neurodegeneration. In eye care, we're extremely excited about the REGENXBIO program in wet-AMD and diabetic retinopathy. But we continue to look for innovation in glaucoma and retinal disease. So we certainly have an interest there. And then in Aesthetics, it's always about looking for innovation that can drive new consumers into our providers practices. So our BD group is still very active. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities to further bolster our pipeline. But those are the areas that we're most interested in.\nLiz Shea: Thanks Tim. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, the next question comes from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nJames Shin: Hi. Good morning. I had a question on ovarian cancer and it's going to be more competitive with [indiscernible]. How do you feel about [indiscernible] interacting? And how do you feel that market landscape looks going forward?\nLiz Shea: Unfortunately. Your line is not very clear. Can you maybe try to repeat the question one time.\nJames Shin: Sorry about that. [indiscernible] better now.\nLiz Shea: It's still little echoey, it's a little bit better, but go ahead.\nJames Shin: Okay, I was asking about [indiscernible] and the competitive dynamics in ovarian cancer.\nLiz Shea: Yes, unfortunately, it's just not coming clear -- coming through clearly. Happy to address the question following the call. Apologies for that. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Yes, the next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on the long term updates. So with respect to the Alzheimers commentary, a product was left out of the TREM2 AL002, which has an estimated primary completion in September. If you could comment on that as well. That would be helpful. And then with respect to the GILTI tax change that's coming, so can you please provide some more color on that, including the timing and the potential impact? Thanks very much.\nTom Hudson: Hi, this is Tom Hudson. I'll answer the question, the first question, yes, we do have a partnered program with Alector on the TREM2 target. TREM2 was identified in Alzheimers disease through genetic studies, several years ago, very strong link. We have a program which -- TREM2 modulates and no inflammatory response in AD. All patients are enrolled in the Phase 2, we will have data later this year. So again it's an early clinical development, but we will expect to see key data later.\nScott Reents: Sure, this is Scott. Regarding the GILTI tax. So this is the US tax, the foreign minimum tax on foreign earnings that the US supplies. That tax rate today is at 10.5%, it's going to move up to 13.1% a little bit more than that. That will occur -- the implementation date is a little bit mixed, because it depends on fiscal year-ends of legal entities, but let's call it 2026 is when we can look at that. And only part of our income is subject to that rate. So, I would say that's approximately a 1.5% impact to our tax rate that you would see. And that's baked into my 1% on average over the next three years.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, David. Operator we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Okay. And our final question is Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nLuisa Hector: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the Part-D restructure an IRA. So you have a number of drugs that are likely to be impacted by this. And obviously, you talk about your strong rebound in 2025. So I'd just love to hear your thoughts on how that restructure will impact. And perhaps to what extent that is already baked into your expectations of the rebound? And maybe just to check, have you now received the initial offer from CMS owned Imbruvica? Thank you.\nJeff Stewart: Yea. Thank you, Luisa. It's Jeff. And we have we have contemplated in our planning and long-term guidance, both the Part-D redesign and of course the IRA impacts based on our projections over when some of our drugs might be negotiated. To give you some color on the Part-D redesign, we have clearly a very good visibility over the pricing dynamics that will take place as you say, many of our brands basically will be under the catastrophic redesign component. Now we've also understood based on one of the policy items, which is the cap and smooth, we've also countered some of that price with volume offsets based on patients having the ability to acquire these. Now that volume does not fully offset the pricing impact. But suffice it to say that, that's been very much contemplated into that. I'll let Rob comment over how that sort of feeds into the growth rates.\nRob Michael: Luisa you asked a very good question. This is Rob. Clearly, and we have contemplated that in the high single digit CAGR, the impacts of IRA. But as you think about the annual progression, it is important to note that Part-D benefit redesign starts in 2025. So that is certainly something you should consider for modeling of annual sales. I mean, that impact by itself, on a net basis could be worth a few points of growth. As Jeff mentioned, the higher cost share with an offset in volume, we have studied the improvement in abandonment rates as we look at the low-income subsidy part of Part-D which doesn't have the out of pocket burden that the standard benefit does. And when we compare the abandonment rates and as you address this issue of out of pocket burden, we would expect the abandonment rates to improve across Medicare Part-D, but not enough to fully offset the higher-cost share. That was something we certainly contemplated. But as you think about the progression of growth, the rate of growth will accelerate starting next year through 2029. So we'll deliver a high-single-digit CAGR. But it's important to note that in 2025, you do have that beginning of Part-D benefit redesign, which adds, I'd say a couple of points of growth headwind that will still allow us to deliver robust growth, but it won't -- you shouldn't think about the same amount of growth every year, it's going to accelerate over the long-range plan.\nRick Gonzalez: And then, this is Rick on the Imbruvica price, yes, we have received the initial offer on Imbruvica recently. As you know, there is a process that CMS is going through here to set pricing. And because none of us have any experience with this, we don't know exactly how that process will proceed. There will be some back and forth between the manufacturer and CMS. CMS has indicated that they'll have the final price by September 1st. It's certainly premature for us to talk about the price now, because it's not the final price. I don't know that we'll know the final price until very close to the point at which they are prepared to publish that price, having not had any experience here. So, I wouldn't anticipate we will get any updates until that date or very close to that date.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Luisa. And that concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our performance this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie, with results well above our initial expectations. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our growth platform, the base business excluding Humira, which delivered full year sales growth of more than 8%, with revenue growth accelerating to more than 15% in the fourth quarter. The strength of our diversified growth platform has not only enabled us to successfully absorb the largest loss of exclusivity event to date across our industry, but it's also supported continued investment in our business for long term growth. These investments include: higher adjusted R&D expense, which was increased by nearly $600 million in 2023 and will be ranged substantially again in 2024 to support several promising pipeline programs like 383 in multiple myeloma. 400, our next-generation ADC for several solid tumor types and [Moodi] for HS, as well as inflammatory bowel disease. The proposed acquisition of ImmunoGen and their portfolio of ADCs accelerating our entry into the solid tumor space and strengthening our oncology pipeline, as well as the proposed acquisition of Cerevel, a unique opportunity to augment our presence in neuroscience with the pipeline of differentiated assets. We also increased our quarterly dividend which we announced in October. Since our inception, we have grown our dividend by more than 285%. In summary, our operational execution has been outstanding and we have considerable momentum heading into 2024, including an expected return to operational sales growth just one year following the US Humira loss of exclusivity, driven by our growth platform. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob? All right, Terence. This is Rick. So I'll cover the first one. I guess what I would say is, I have nothing new to report today, but what I'd indicate is, we've talked about the criteria that we're going to use to make the decision when we're going to make the transition. That criteria is the same, when we believe that we are comfortable, we've navigated the LOE, and the rest of the business is performing at high level. That's the point at which we want to make the transition, because we think that's the best time to be able to transition the CEO position. So I understand there's a lot of interest from investors here, that's logical and clear. Maybe what I can do is, give you a little better perspective on the process that we're going to use in order to make the decision with the Board. I would say, the Board has been actively involved for the last four or five years with a lot of emphasis around ensuring that our internal candidate would get the experiences that we thought were needed prior to making the transition. I can tell you from my perspective, that's gone extremely well. We have regularly scheduled Board meetings several times a year where we specifically talk about succession and the progress that we're making. At the point at which the business has achieved that criteria that I described before, at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting, then I would make a recommendation to the Board that this is the proper time to be able to make the transition. The Board would vote on that recommendation. At the end of that vote, we would send out an announcement to investors. And what you can expect when you get that announcement is that, we would make an announcement that we were going to make the transition out at some point in the future, in all likelihood four months to six months in the future. And the purpose of that is to make the final transition between myself and that person. And that'll take four months to five months in order to be able to do that. I would say it's also very likely at that time, based on the discussions I've been having with the Board, is that, I will be named the Executive Chair for a period of time, and the purpose of that will be to make the transition of the full position over a period of time. So I think it's a very well thought out, I think very well managed process. And I think that's what you can expect going forward. Steve, this is Rick. I think if you step back and you look over the last, I'd say, 10 years, we were trying to develop a strategy that we fundamentally believed will allow us to be able to offset the Humira LOE and continue to deliver top-tier financial performance as we have for the past 10 years. That was the whole objective. And we knew we had to build a very diversified growth platform in order to be able to do that, to be able to absorb that impact and return to growth as rapidly as possible. And so, we as an executive team focused a lot of energy around how do we do that, how do we build it, how do we do it in the right markets. I think AbbVie, I'm obviously biased, I guess, but I would say our commercial execution has always been exceptional in my opinion. We understand the markets we're in extremely well. We understand the competitive environment that we compete in those markets extremely well. We understand the patient journey and how that patient journey is affected by access to medicines to ensure that patients can get their medicines routinely and be able to get the benefit of those medicines. It takes all of those things I think to end up with kind of success that we see with assets like Skyrizi and Rinvoq. But it also takes I think a company that is very good at what I describe as read and react. There are always challenges in businesses as big and as complex as this. And I think the difference between companies that can continue to perform at the top tier, year in and year out is they're good at seeing issues, and then quickly reacting to how they're going to either offset those, or deal with those. We had many of those examples. I'd say the label change on Rinvoq was a great example. But look at where Rinvoq is growing now. And despite that label change many would not have predicted that. Migraine, was a very challenging market for a period of time. We look at how we've operated with Ubrelvy and Qulipta. And the kind of success we've seen against the competitors in those markets. Neuroscience, very different kind of market with Vraylar. That's all about trying to grow market-share and expand your position there with a very good asset. And so, we're good at that, and I think that is the real differentiator. The other thing I'd say is, I think we have been very efficient at our R&D investment. We obviously don't have the largest R&D investment in the industry. But we produced a tremendous amount of return against that R&D investment. Now having said that, as we go forward, we know we need to increase R&D as I've said in my comments. We did a fairly significant increase last year despite dealing with the Humira LOE. And we're going to do another fairly significant increase this year because we had some assets that had very, very significant opportunities like 383 and like 400 and several others. They are going to require a large Phase 3 -- multiple large Phase 3 studies to be able to get the kind of label that we need, and that's another thing, I'd say, we're good at. Understanding how you have a competitive label and building your clinical programs to get that. So, I think it requires all of those things. I don't think there is one magic formula. I think those are the kinds of things that we have honed here at AbbVie an executive team. And we execute very well against those. And then, this is Rick on the Imbruvica price, yes, we have received the initial offer on Imbruvica recently. As you know, there is a process that CMS is going through here to set pricing. And because none of us have any experience with this, we don't know exactly how that process will proceed. There will be some back and forth between the manufacturer and CMS. CMS has indicated that they'll have the final price by September 1st. It's certainly premature for us to talk about the price now, because it's not the final price.

            "name": "Roopal Thakkar",
            "content": "Thank you, Carrie. In 2023, we saw significant evolution of our pipeline with multiple data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals, as well as expansion of our R&D efforts with the announced ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We expect to continue this progress with numerous important clinical and regulatory milestones anticipated this year. In immunology, we recently announced positive topline results for lutikizumab our anti-IL-1 alpha beta bispecific being evaluated in hidradenitis suppurativa. In the Phase 2 study, lutikizumab demonstrated higher, high score of 50 and high score of 75 measures, as well as improvement in skin pain compared to placebo. These are very impressive results considering all patients who were inadequate responders to anti-TNF therapy. And 70% of the patients were early stage three, which is the most advanced stage of the disease. Based on these results, we plan to begin a Phase 3 program in HF later this year. We also plan to evaluate lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, given the role that IL-1 likely plays in these diseases. Patients with UC who have an IL-1 beta signature have shown resistance to anti-TNF and other biologics, providing strong rationale for a potential biomarker approach. Additionally, we believe lutikizumab has the potential to be used in combinations to provide transformational levels of efficacy in IBD. We plan to evaluate combo approaches with lutikizumab and Skyrizi, as well as with other pipeline assets in Crohn's. Our Phase 2 studies in IBD are expected to begin later this year. Our regulatory applications are under review for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis. With approval decisions expected in the US and Europe later this year. Once Skyrizi is approved in UC, along with Rinvoq, we will have two assets with different mechanisms of action in IBD, both offering very high levels of efficacy. AbbVie will be very well-positioned with an industry-leading suite of treatment options for patients suffering from moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We continued to make very good progress with the second wave of development programs for Rinvoq. With Phase 3 studies underway in five new indications, giant cell arteritis, lupus, HF, alopecia areata and vitiligo. We anticipate data readouts for these programs over the next three years, beginning with data from our GCA study this year. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make very good progress across our heme and solid tumor programs. In the area of hematologic oncology, we'll see data in the second half of this year from the Venclexta Phase 3 VERONA trial in treatment-naive higher-risk MDS patients, with regulatory submissions and approvals, anticipated in 2025. For Epkinly, we anticipate regulatory approvals in third-line or greater follicular lymphoma later this year in both the US and Europe. We also expect to begin several new Phase 3 studies in 2024, including studies in second-line DLBCL and frontline follicular lymphoma. At the recent ASH Meeting, we presented new data for our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma. 383 is engineered for high-affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells, and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T-Cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T-Cell engaging BCMA-based therapies, while preserving high levels of efficacy. We're very encouraged by the data emerging from our Phase 1b study, which show treatment with 383 is yielding deep and durable responses. With a lower incidence and severity of CRS. With this profile, we believe 383 can be a highly effective and tolerable treatment for multiple myeloma. While potentially allowing for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. All attributes, which would make it very appealing to both patients and physicians. We remain on track to begin a Phase 3 monotherapy study in third-line multiple myeloma this year. And we plan to begin combination trials in earlier lines of therapy in 2025. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive topline results from the Teliso-V Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. Teliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints, including, overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival, with a tolerable safety profile. We believe these results have the potential to support accelerated approval. And we plan to discuss the data with regulators in the coming months. Pending alignment with the FDA, our submission is planned for the second half of this year. We're also making good progress with our next-generation c-Met ADC ABBV-400, which utilizes the same c-Met blocking antibody as Teliso-V, but has a proprietary Topo-1 warhead to afford deeper and more durable responses with an improved therapeutic index. We remain on track to see data this year from the non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cohorts from our Phase 1 study. And based on the progress we're making in our colorectal program, we plan to begin a Phase 3 study later this year in third-line CRC. We also continue to make very good progress with our anti-GARP antibody ABBV-151. Our Phase 2 study in second-line hepatocellular carcinoma is underway, and we plan to begin several additional Phase 2 studies this year, including frontline HCC, frontline lung cancer and metastatic urothelial cancer. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving to Neuroscience where we recently announced the European launch of ABBV-951 for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We also recently provided our complete response submission to the FDA for 951 with an approval decision anticipated in the second quarter. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery system has the potential to offer meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development. 951 delivers significant improvements in off-time and on-time with a less invasive non-surgical system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by DUOPA. And it doesn't require combination with oral drugs to achieve high efficacy. 951 also provides a full 24-hour benefit, which should result in less morning akinesia. We're extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in Europe and the US once approved. In our Aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application in the US for Botox in platysma prominence. We anticipate an approval decision in the second half of this year. And we remain on track to complete the remaining CMC work this year for BoNT/E, our rapid onset short-acting novel toxin. Following completion of the remaining work, we plan to submit our regulatory application in the second half of the year, with approval anticipated near the end of 2025. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2024. I also look forward to integrating the ImmunoGen and Cerevel teams and pipeline assets into our R&D organization once those transactions close this year. These two transactions significantly strengthened our oncology and neuroscience pipelines with the addition of several novel assets that have the potential to become innovative new therapies for many patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Yes. Hi, Terence. Part of it starts, I would say, almost 15 years ago with our insights in Crohn's disease with Humira, as Jeff was discussing, where we started to see efficacy in patients that had HS. We saw a good amount of overlap between Crohn's and HS. So that's part of it. Now that doesn't really pan out for IL-17, but what we've observed with IL-1 beta in particular is that, our internal data and external data do show elevated expression signals with one beta. So we think we have that opportunity with luti, because it also covers 1 beta and we have two shots at this, right. One is, to go specifically and look at a biomarker-driven targeted profile where we would be able to distinguish which patients actually have that higher expression. And the other approach, which we maybe weren't talking about years ago because we didn't have a product like Skyrizi which have high efficacy and very strong safety profile in Crohn's. What we have now is the opportunity to also look at in combination. So a biomarker approach and a combo approach, our insights from Humira and preclinical or biopsy-based insights that we have externally and internally. Hi it's Roopal, I'll talk about luti and your question around neutrophils. Yes, we do see impact on neutrophils, it's dose-driven. However, I think we think about inflammatory bowel disease, probably lupus, others to have a different tolerance for benefit-risk, because today in those disease states despite the success that we've seen with Skyrizi and Rinvoq, there's still substantial headroom to lead to more transformational efficacy, not every patient is getting into remission, though high levels, not every patient. So we still believe that a combo can get to that and break that efficacy threshold. The other opportunity there is what we'll do with the combination is obviously optimize the dose to assure safety. And thus far in the HS trial, even at the highest dose we saw very little infections. Hi, Mohit. It's Roopal, I'll take that. So, I think as you've seen in resistance we've seen that overall survival benefit, a very substantial one, unprecedented thus far. And to your point, the plan is to move into earlier lines of therapy. Secondly, it's also part of the strategy to move into sensitive populations, which is around 55% of the population, resistance is around 45%. And then the third aspect is, we've seen encouraging data in medium expressers of FR alpha. And those are approximately 30% of the patients, high is around 35%. So those are the three strategies to go forward. Now how do we get into earlier lines of therapy? Well, a couple of things, insights that we've seen. One is, we've seen Elahere been able to combine at full dose with carbo-platinum. So that's encouraging, that gives you an opportunity to upfront combine. And then as you stated, maintain on Elahere or with Elahere plus BEV. So the other approaches that we would do getting to earlier line of maintenance is have that upfront therapy and then we see patients that go onto BEV, we can combine with BEV at that time point. And we'll be looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors, which is about the other half of the patient populations, which are HRD deficient. So, taken altogether, we see there is an opportunity. Now, the PFS is going to be a little bit longer, along with OS. So that is something that we're planning for, we'll start these studies as soon as possible, but they will read out in the later part of the decade and into 2030. And maybe I'll talk about the other assets that you mentioned in Alzheimers. First, 916, that's our A beta antibody. What we like about that one thus far, the profile we've seen is a long half-life, which would be good to space out dosing. Potentially higher potency if that holds, and we see robust reductions in beta amyloid that could allow for subcutaneous dosing that's spaced apart. And the other thing we are looking at is potentially lower ARIA. So if we see those three things over the course, I would say, end of this year, early next year, I think that, that would be quite exciting, because it would be a differentiated profile, again a better convenience and potentially better benefit-risk profile. So that's 916. 552 is our SV2A that's our oral medication in cognition that's currently in Phase 2. And we anticipate readout at the end of this year, early next year. Now, that one is being studied in a setting where patient can be on a therapy already like an [Aricept] (ph), or nothing. And we would use the typical ADAS-Cog assessments along with a variety of others including other neuropsychiatric symptoms, like depression. So that's another nice one that could combine with a variety of different assets in Alzheimers. The third one I'll mention is around Emraclidine, which comes from Cerevel. They are at early stages right now in elderly patients. And the goal there would be an Alzheimer's disease psychosis of the six million or so diagnoses, I would say around 40% of these patients present with symptoms of psychosis. So with all the therapies that are in the clinic, we think we have a very nice complementary suite of options that could address numerous symptoms of Alzheimers, because it won't be just one therapy that's going to solve this. But more to come end of this year and into next year."

            "content": "Thank you, Roopal. I'm very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2023. We have substantial momentum across the portfolio to support our long-term growth outlook. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, which is $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.3 billion, $300 million ahead of our guidance, and down 5.4%. Most notably, these results reflect 15.3% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 43.8% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of 13.4% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.7% of sales. Adjusted net interest expense was $363 million, the adjusted tax-rate was 17.2%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $11.05 and $11.25. This earnings per share guidance includes dilution related to the ImmunoGen and Cerevel acquisitions of $0.32, which assumes closing in the middle of the year. Please note this guidance does not include an estimate for required IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect total net revenues of approximately $54.2 billion, reflecting a return to modest operational growth. At current rates, we expect foreign-exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for our key products in therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $25.6 billion, including Humira sales of $9.6 billion, including US erosion of roughly 36%. Skyrizi revenue of $10.5 billion, reflecting growth of more than $2.7 billion due to strong market-share performance in psoriasis, as well as robust uptake in IBD. And Rinvoq sales of $5.5 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 40% with continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications. On a full-year basis, we anticipate that our strong volume growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq will be modestly offset by low-single digit negative net price. In oncology, we expect sales of $5.7 billion, including Imbruvica revenue of $2.9 billion and Venclexta sales of $2.4 billion. As well as contributions from Epkinly, and partial year sales from Elahere. For Aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.7 billion. Including $2.9 billion from Botox Cosmetic and mid-single-digit revenue growth from Juvederm. For Neuroscience, we expect revenue of $8.9 billion, representing growth of more than 15%, including Vraylar sales of $3.4 billion, Botox Therapeutic sales of $3.2 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.6 billion. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2024, we are forecasting full-year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment of 14% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% of sales, and adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.1 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.7%. Finally, we expect share count to be roughly flat to 2023. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $11.9 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $5.1 billion, including Skyrizi sales of $1.9 billion, and Rinvoq revenue of $1 billion. These estimates reflect typical first quarter seasonality as well as low single digit unfavorable net price. We expect Humira global revenue of $2.2 billion, including US sales of $1.7 billion. We also anticipate oncology revenue just above $1.3 billion, Aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, Neuroscience revenue of $1.9 billion, and eye care sales of $600 million. We are forecasting an adjusted gross margin of approximately 83.5% of sales and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales. We also model a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.30 and $2.34. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $12.8 billion. And we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $18 billion in 2024, which includes roughly $1.9 billion in Skyrizi royalty payments. The strong free cash flow will fully support a strong growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 285% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down the approximately $7 billion of maturities this year, and also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong. We'll turn the call back over to Liz. Gary, this is Scott. I'll take your question regarding operating margin expansion. So for 2024, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've guided to 46.5%. When we do return to robust growth in 2025, we do see that operating margin will expand, and will continue to expand as we grow through the decade. I think that when we think about the pace of that expansion, it will be a relatively steady over several years. I would though, if you're modeling that, I would kind of peak it out at around 50%. I think that's where we'll hit a peak at the operating margin. But we do see expansion both in 2025 on that return to robust growth, including the impact of the two transactions ImmunoGen and Cerevel, which should presumably be a full-year at that point in time. But at the full year impact, we see that expansion. And I do think it's worth noting, even at our current levels, we have industry-leading operating margin. And certainly with the future expansion we will continue to have that and only grow that position. Steve, this is Scott. I'll start with your tax rate question. So with respect to the tax rate, we were essentially flat between this year and last year at 15.7%. We do see that tax rate over the three year period including this year increasing about 1% on average. Now that's not going to be a 1% per year. What you'll see is a step up in a couple of years when the US tax rates do increase the GILTI rate in particular, will increase. So we see that over a three year period about 1% per year on average. That does include all the impacts of a number of things going on globally with the OECD and some of these -- OECD minimum taxes and other things. I would say the one thing it does not include, you saw just this week, the House passed a tax bill that includes the provision regarding the R&D expensing. So if that bill were to pass, as it's written, we would see a slight step down in our tax rate, about 80 basis points from the impact of that on an ongoing basis. Sure, this is Scott. Regarding the GILTI tax. So this is the US tax, the foreign minimum tax on foreign earnings that the US supplies. That tax rate today is at 10.5%, it's going to move up to 13.1% a little bit more than that. That will occur -- the implementation date is a little bit mixed, because it depends on fiscal year-ends of legal entities, but let's call it 2026 is when we can look at that. And only part of our income is subject to that rate. So, I would say that's approximately a 1.5% impact to our tax rate that you would see. And that's baked into my 1% on average over the next three years."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.9 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi total sales were approximately $2.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of 51.6%. Rinvoq total sales were more than $1.2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 62.8%. On a full-year basis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq delivered more than $11.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of $4 billion year-over-year. And as Rob just described, we see substantial room for continued growth across each of their currently approved indications. You can get a good sense for this momentum by looking at the relationship between the current in-place share, which includes new and switching patients, and the total prescription share just today. For example, our performance in IBD has been very strong for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In Crohn\u2019s disease, these two treatments together are already capturing roughly one out of every three in-play patients across all lines of therapy in the United States, while their combined total prescription share is only in the mid-single digits. You see a similar trend happening in ulcerative colitis for Rinvoq, and we anticipate launching Skyrizi for this indication later this year. So significant opportunity remains for revenue inflection in IBD, especially given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. Across some of the other notable indications, Skyrizi is capturing roughly half of the in-place psoriasis patients in the U.S. biologic market relative to a total prescription share, which is in the mid-30s percent. Rinvoq is capturing high teens in-play share in the atopic dermatitis market, while total share is in the high single digits. Similarly, in rheumatoid arthritis, Rinvoq is capturing mid-teens in-play share, while total share is roughly 7%. So, again, we see substantial headroom for share gains in addition to the typical robust market growth across rheum, derm, and gastro. Plus, we are planning to have up to five additional indications for Rinvoq across several sizable markets that will potentially provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $3.3 billion, down 40.8% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the U.S. played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets continues to trend better than expected. In the U.S., we have once again secured broad formulary access for Humira in 2024. While there will be some step down in coverage year-over-year, we will still have parity access to biosimilars for the vast majority of U.S. patient lives. Turning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $903 million, down 19% reflecting continued pressure in new patient starts. Venclexta global sales were $589 million, up 13.7% on an operational basis, with strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. The early prescription trends for Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL have been encouraging with commercialization now underway in the US, Europe and Japan. We also anticipate the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Lastly, we have two new and exciting opportunities in oncology. Pending completion of the transaction, we will add Elahere to our portfolio. Elahere is a first-in-class ADC therapy approved for ovarian cancer, which is already demonstrating impressive uptake in the U.S. market. I look forward to welcoming the ImmunoGen commercial team to AbbVie. And Teliso-V, another novel ADC which has demonstrated very promising data in lung cancer. Teliso-V would further expand our scale and growth potential in solid tumors. In neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, total full year revenues were more than $7.7 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.2 billion. In the quarter, total revenues were approximately $2.1 billion, up 22.4% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $789 million were up nearly 40%. We continue to see significant momentum in new prescriptions across all indications following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder just over a year ago. And our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $348 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 40%. We anticipate continued robust demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta this year, including the expansion of Qulipta, the only once daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine into the international markets. Based on the strong momentum, we have raised the outlook for our CGRP portfolio and now expect total peak sales from Ubrelvy and Qulipta combined to exceed $3 billion. Total Botox therapeutic global sales were $776 million, up 6.7% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine, as well as other approved indications. And lastly, we recently launched 951 in both Japan and Europe, and we are pursuing commercial approval in the U.S. later this year. This treatment represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our diversified portfolio, especially the growth platform, which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? Yes. Hi, Chris. It's Jeff. Maybe I'll walk through a little bit of the process there and answer your questions. So we can see historically actuals and sort of fast forward in terms of the first thing we look at is the bio penetration of these big indications. And there still remain significant headroom in terms of the ability for moderate to severe patients with these diseases to continue to be exposed to these biologics and these advanced orals, absolutely. And we can see for sure that psoriasis still in -- even in the US is about 15%, it's relatively modest, atopic dermatitis, the penetration rate is only about 7%. And then you have higher penetrated markets like IBD and I'll talk about what's interesting about IBD, that\u2019s somewhere in the 40% or 50% range across those. And then we can see clearly as these markets develop and I've highlighted this before that you see line of therapy expansion. So first-line becomes less and less important, as you move towards second and third-line over time. And right now, IBD is a big story about that, that we calculate into our long-term estimates, because it's still largely despite the severity a frontline oriented market, because physicians, just kind of hang on to their frontline agents, that's going to change quite dramatically believe over this mid-term and even in the long-term perspective. We have a good peg on the market growth rates. Many of these market growth rates are very significant, very stable. And we'll have good growth rates going into the next decade because of these dynamics around bio penetration and line of therapy expansion. I highlighted in my remarks around share, share we -- we have a very good competitive position, very high capture rates. And we're really in the sort of low end of the range in terms of the total prescription share, that will feed up and catch up to that. Pricing, I think we talked a little bit. We're not going to give detailed pricing. But certainly, you can see based on Scott's comments that, the idea of a high CAGR on high single-digit pricing is not something we've contemplated. So, we believe that there is significant room for growth even past 2027. Especially, as we'll have more Rinvoq indications coming that we've talked through. So we think that we're going to see robust growth based on our share capture and also how dynamic these markets are into the next decade. And Terence, this is Jeff, I'll start-off and have Roopal will address the second part of your second question. So we established many years ago now this HS market with the approval of Humira. And we thought it was a relatively small market, and it turned out to be quite a surprise. There is a significant amount of patients around the world that suffer from HS, it's already a multi-billion dollar category. And we think it's going to continue to expand. And I say that, because we can see that like IBD, there's just some new approvals just coming. So, everyone sort of holds on Humira as long as they can if they're exposed to a biologic. And so we see the same dynamic as you start to see IL-17s come into this space, and certainly, we're very excited about lutikizumab because of the profile that we're seeing emerge in the clinic. So it's a significant commercial opportunity. And I would say that when we look back over all the Humira indications, over the last decade or more, HS was one of the most rapid indications that moved to $1 billion plus business. So it's an exciting opportunity, both commercially and certainly for patients. And Roopal can address your comment on IBD. Yes. Hi, Andrew. Thanks for your question. It's Jeff. We think that the, particularly the negotiation aspects of the IRA will be very contained on the Medicare side. And as you can imagine with government programs over the years -- when we had discussion with payers, they'll often say things over, well we know what the FSS price is for the VA or demand mandated discounts and supplemental discounts in the Medicaid channel. But we think those are really government actions and government rules. And so, we see that the market we believe will play out largely like it has with the other government channels, that it's a unique dynamic in terms of essentially a forced negotiation that we think will be contained largely in the Medicare space. So that's how we view the world. Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So what we look at when we see this market at a macro -- at a macro-level, you have a significant number of patients, 85% of patients are just on these oral medication. So, oral [indiscernible]. Okay. And they essentially need to consume more and more and more orals, and sometimes at the end of it they're taken 12 pills a day, it's very, very difficult to manage. But then they're faced with a very difficult decision, which we kind of call like a surgical barrier. And that surgical barrier is to get any sort of more advanced relief, you either have to think about deep brain stimulation, which is a brain surgery or our own DUOPA, which is a GI surgery. So the way we see this market developing is we see that 951 starts to establish a very nice transition zone, because you don't have -- it's a subcu. So a new market segment that starts to emerge before bigger interventions like DBS or DUOPA. And obviously, the ability to basically move quicker to more relief from these chronic oral basically over treatment. So that's how we see it. And as Roopal highlighted, we're seeing some very nice uptake in Japan, where we launched late last year, and also in Germany and some of the first European launches. So that's how the market is exactly playing out. We're establishing essentially a new high efficacy category here with 24 hours of ongoing relief. You can do super specific dosing titration and the pump is much smaller and again, it's a subcu injection that you move around every three days. So it's a nice -- it's a nice opportunity for the company. Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. I'll take that one. We've learned a lot from watching Skyrizi and Rinvoq in Crohn's. And to Rick's points, look, we're very careful about how we position these assets, you know how we basically represent them with our medical teams and our commercial teams. And so what we see certainly in our biggest markets, we see that they are actually complementary positioning. So, Rick highlighted the label change, right. So Rinvoq, in the US, is basically indicated for use after a TNF. So it's basically a later-line therapy. Skyrizi, if you look at the Skyrizi, you see results, it's very, very impressive. We've studied some very, very tough patients there. The bio-naive patients, the efficacy is just outstanding. I would say it's best-in-class. So we can see that based on the profile of the agents for many of our representatives, we're able to talk to physicians about the consideration for Skyrizi frontline. And then in later lines Rinvoq. So the cannibalization or the overlap is very manageable and minimal. And what happens is you start to see this, this very significant build for total AbbVie share because of that complementary positioning. So we're quite confident that we'll be able to navigate this very well just as we see in the larger Crohn's market. Yea. Thank you, Luisa. It's Jeff. And we have we have contemplated in our planning and long-term guidance, both the Part-D redesign and of course the IRA impacts based on our projections over when some of our drugs might be negotiated. To give you some color on the Part-D redesign, we have clearly a very good visibility over the pricing dynamics that will take place as you say, many of our brands basically will be under the catastrophic redesign component. Now we've also understood based on one of the policy items, which is the cap and smooth, we've also countered some of that price with volume offsets based on patients having the ability to acquire these. Now that volume does not fully offset the pricing impact. But suffice it to say that, that's been very much contemplated into that. I'll let Rob comment over how that sort of feeds into the growth rates."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Fourth quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, an operational increase of 6.9%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $884 million increased 5.7%, marked by accelerating market growth and strong key product performance. Fourth quarter U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $453 million, an increase of 7.3%. We continue to see sustained momentum in the recovery of the U.S. facial toxin market, which was a primary driver of growth in the fourth quarter. Botox Cosmetic remains the clear market leader with strong and stable share, despite new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $156 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 20% versus the prior year. This robust growth was driven by the strong launches of Volux and SkinVive, which continue to drive new consumers and greater penetration in the dermal filler category. Consistent with our expectations, the U.S. filler market recovery trails out of toxins, but it's continuing to show improvement as year-over-year growth was roughly flat in the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, we are pleased with the momentum of our U.S. aesthetics portfolio. We expect full year sales growth as our market leadership positions us very well from a competitive perspective, and we anticipate continued recovery in both toxin and filler markets. Internationally, fourth quarter aesthetic sales were $487 million, representing an operational increase of 9%. We experienced strong performance in most regions and growth benefited from the impact of China's COVID lockdowns in late 2022. Within China, the softening economic conditions that emerged in the third quarter continued to impact results. Consistent with what we experienced in the US, the economic slowdown has impacted fillers more than toxins, based upon their relatively higher price. We anticipate economic headwinds will continue in China over the near term, balanced against our expectations for continued strong performance in other international regions. Looking to the long-term, Aesthetics remains an area with very low market penetration. And we have demonstrated our ability to drive growth through investments in our customers, consumers, and innovation. As such, we anticipate Aesthetics will be a strong growth portfolio for years to come and remain confident in our ability to deliver more than $9 billion of sales by the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal. Hi, this is Carrie, I'll take your first question on Aesthetics and the Aesthetics market recovery. So I'll start with the US and we have started to see the US toxin market recover the end of 2023. We expect that recovery to continue. And for the market growth for toxins to continue to improve in 2024. For fillers, in the US, in Q4, after multiple quarters of decline, the filler market in the US was somewhat flat. And so, that dynamic of the filler market recovery lagging the toxin market recovery is playing out. And we do expect that recovery on fillers to also continue -- to a lesser degree than toxins, more of a modest growth, positive growth for 2024. And as we look at the beginning of the year here in 2024, we are seeing our patient demand metrics and Google metrics really supporting our expectations here. In terms of China, we do expect the economic headwinds that we saw beginning mid-year 2023 to continue in the near-term with China. And we expect the China Aesthetics market to be flat overall in 2024. That would look like negative market in the first half of the year until the China market starts to recover in the second half of 2024. And we expect that China performance to be balanced against expectations for strong performance in other international regions, including Japan, which has become an important market for Aesthetics and areas of Latin America, like Brazil, which is a highly aesthetically oriented market. It's also important to know in terms of Q1 of 2024, in terms of our guidance there that the growth in the US will be offset by that international decline, specifically in China. So not only the China economic headwinds, but also a difficult year-over-year comp in Q1, because recall, in Q1 of 2023, there was the post-pandemic reopening in China. So that's really how we see the market growth factors in US, China and other parts of the world playing out in 2024. Hi, this is Carrie. So the short answer is, we have not seen an impact on our Aesthetics business positive or negative so far. That said, absolutely, our customers and our consumers are participating in this market. We are seeing it integrated into some of these Aesthetics practices. And to your point, there are instances where a patient will make a trade-off in terms of her share of wallet. But that said, we do see it as a long-term tailwind anytime people are getting more engaged in their appearance, that's a positive thing for Aesthetics. And as we ask our consumers and our customers about it, really that -- what we've learned is that it does reinforce its long-term tailwind because the majority of people who engage in these medical weight-loss products are more interested in Aesthetics afterwards than they never before. So, that's really how we see it in terms of the that dynamic impacting Aesthetics."

            "name": "Rob Michael",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. Today we reported another strong quarter and highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $11.11, which is $0.63 above our initial guidance midpoint, excluding the impact of IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $54.3 billion, roughly $2.3 billion ahead of our initial guidance. Most importantly, each of our five key growth areas outperformed our initial expectations. As it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we are focused on three key priorities. First, driving strong performance of our ex- Humira Growth Platform. This platform is the critical driver of our return to robust growth in 2025 and beyond. In our therapeutic portfolio, we have several key brands including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, Ubrelvy, and Qulipta, which are each expected to contribute double-digit sales growth in 2024. We also expect meaningful growth for aesthetics this year, driven by improving market trends in the US and continued execution across our international business. We are well positioned to drive strong long-term growth in this highly under-penetrated market. Second, we are focused on prioritizing investment in our pipeline, which encompasses numerous opportunities to elevate the standard of care for patients. We anticipate updates this year from several important R&D programs including approvals for Skyrizi in UC, 951 in the U.S., and potentially accelerated approval for Epkinly in third line plus follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate regulatory submissions for BoNT/E, our novel short-acting toxin, and potentially Teliso-V, an advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And third, we are focused on closing and integrating ImmunoGen and Cerevel. These two exciting opportunities represent substantial sources of revenue growth well into the next decade. We remain on track with the anticipated closing of both deals in the middle of the year. Today, we are also reaffirming our long-term sales outlook, which includes a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single digit CAGR through the end of the decade. Included in this outlook is an updated forecast for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Based on the impressive growth of both therapies, which we expect will collectively generate approximately $16 billion of revenue in 2024, we now anticipate Skyrizi and Rinvoq will collectively exceed more than $27 billion in sales by 2027 with robust growth continuing into the next decade. This updated forecast reflects an increase of more than $6 billion in revenue compared to our prior 2027 guidance. We expect global sales for Skyrizi to reach more than $17 billion in 2027, reflecting continued share capture in psoriasis where we are the clear market leader, as well as strong uptake in IBD. And we expect Rinvoq to achieve more than $10 billion of global sales in 2027, reflecting continued market growth and share momentum across each of Rinvoq's approved indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD, and atopic dermatitis. This forecast comprehends modest contributions from several new disease areas for Rinvoq, which we anticipate will be launching in the second half of the decade. These new indications have a collective peak sales potential of several billion dollars. Our updated forecast also includes higher estimates for Ubrelvy and Qulipta. We now expect total oral CGRP peak revenue of more than $3 billion, reflecting an increase of more than $1 billion. Our previously issued long-term forecasts for aesthetics, Vraylar, and 951 remain unchanged. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio and our long-term outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? And Chris, this is Rob. I'll just add, you think about the markets, the rheum market is growing low-single digits, atopic dermatitis is growing mid-teens and IBD is growing high-single-digits. So they're very strong market, they will continue to be strong markets for us. And we're also seeing, as Jeff mentioned, there's a lot of headroom in terms of share capture. So we do expect that robust growth to continue beyond 2027 into early part of the next decade. I think your observation is correct. Given that we would expect up to five new indications for Rinvoq. If you look at the rate of growth, Rinvoq versus Skyrizi, I think it's reasonable to assume that Rinvoq would have a higher rate of growth given the new indications, but both will grow very nicely. So, I would certainly encourage you to look at more robust expectations for both therapies with Rinvoq a little bit higher because of the new indications. Hi, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So we do expect that in the US tail will start to emerge in 2025 or 2026 timeframe. Keep in mind 2024 is the first full year for US biosimilars. We'll have to see what happens with volume uptake this year and also where interchangeability lands. And ultimately, what does contracting look like next year. So, I wouldn't expect us to quantify the tail this year. But it's certainly possible, something we would do either in 2025 or 2026. As it relates to international, you're seeing, I think this year, it's a step-down of about $400 million. Half of that is really the last wave of markets like Canada, Puerto Rico where we're seeing, I'd say, some incremental erosion we would expect this year. And then the other half would be your typical international price erosion you see across therapeutic areas. So not really specific to biosimilars. And then the other quarter of it would be what we're seeing is just the strength of Skyrizi and Rinvoq as these newer agents elevate standard-of-care, you see some share go to those newer agents. And so, probably the best way to think about international would be, if you want to adjust for half of the erosion this year as being more of the final waves, and then you get a sense of what could potentially be the ongoing beyond that. But we'll be more specific, I think we need to see really how the US plays out with this being the first full year for biosimilars, before we can really give you more color. But we're very, very pleased with the progress we've made so far. So, this is Rob. I'll take that question. Yes, we did include ImmunoGen and Cerevel in our long-term guide. The thing to keep in mind is, high-single-digits, when you think about the range that could represent, that's around $10 billion between the low-end of the high-single-digits and the high-end of the high-single-digits. And so, there aren't any pulls, what we've updated as we walk you through it is, we've increased the oral CGRP peak revenue, we've increased Skyrizi, Rinvoq and we've reaffirmed the others. So there's nothing that we took down. But just keep in mind that you've got a pretty, pretty wide range. If you look at Street consensus, we're encouraged that it continues to move up. It has moved up over the course of the last quarter, about $3 billion in 2029. It's nice to see that upward movement. But it's still below what we expect. If you think that, that growth rate for the Street is just under 5%, we expect high-single-digits. And so, even with this update, as well as ImmunoGen and Cerevel, we're still high-single-digits. But keep in mind, it's a pretty wide range. And it would be, regardless industry-leading growth and we're set up very well to continue delivering a very strong growth, and we're setting ourselves very well to grow very nicely in the next decade as well. And Gary, this is Rob. To build on the Aesthetics story, I said in the past to get to our guidance of greater than $9 billion, we need to deliver annual growth of high-single-digits on average. And as Carrie just walked you through, we haven't quite seen the recovery for the fillers market yet this year. And we will, but it's not going to be a normal year, we'll see a ramping. And we also had a slowdown in China. But despite that we're still delivering high single digit growth. And given how under penetrated these markets are, we can drive that market growth that's required to achieve the long-term guidance. And then on top of that, we have several innovations that will further support that growth. I've said this before, but the masseter and platysma indications for Botox will add a few $100 million each. Our novel short-acting toxin BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients who have not started toxin due to fear of an unnatural look. So that could drive an inflection in market growth and market share. And then our region, our fillers pipeline is really aimed at providing both short and long-term treatment benefits for consumers. So we have several avenues to get to our greater than $9 billion guide. I have seen consensus estimates at $8 billion for 2029, but we're very confident in our guidance of greater than $9 billion by that period. Hi, Tim, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on identifying assets, really that can drive growth in the next decade across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. But we have what we need in our current portfolio to deliver on growth expectations in this decade. So our external efforts are really aimed at early-stage opportunities, which are typically smaller-sized deals. As we look across the growth areas, if you think about immunology Skyrizi and Rinvoq will drive robust growth into the next decade. So our focus in immunology in terms of BD is really looking for new mechanisms of action that can elevate standard-of-care whether monotherapy or in combination. I'd say there's a lot of interest in combination. In oncology, ImmunoGen really nicely complements our efforts with ADCs, it gives us a head start, an entry in the solid tumor space, that we're not in today. But in addition to ADCs, we're focused on bispecific, multi- specifics immuno onc agents. We also recently announced a collaboration with Umoja studying insight to CAR-T therapy. So a lot of focus in oncology, but these again would be earlier-stage smaller-sized deals. In Neuroscience, Cerevel adds depth to our neuropsych pipeline, but we also have a focus on migraine and neurodegeneration. In eye care, we're extremely excited about the REGENXBIO program in wet-AMD and diabetic retinopathy. But we continue to look for innovation in glaucoma and retinal disease. So we certainly have an interest there. And then in Aesthetics, it's always about looking for innovation that can drive new consumers into our providers practices. So our BD group is still very active. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities to further bolster our pipeline. But those are the areas that we're most interested in. Luisa you asked a very good question. This is Rob. Clearly, and we have contemplated that in the high single digit CAGR, the impacts of IRA. But as you think about the annual progression, it is important to note that Part-D benefit redesign starts in 2025. So that is certainly something you should consider for modeling of annual sales. I mean, that impact by itself, on a net basis could be worth a few points of growth. As Jeff mentioned, the higher cost share with an offset in volume, we have studied the improvement in abandonment rates as we look at the low-income subsidy part of Part-D which doesn't have the out of pocket burden that the standard benefit does. And when we compare the abandonment rates and as you address this issue of out of pocket burden, we would expect the abandonment rates to improve across Medicare Part-D, but not enough to fully offset the higher-cost share. That was something we certainly contemplated. But as you think about the progression of growth, the rate of growth will accelerate starting next year through 2029. So we'll deliver a high-single-digit CAGR. But it's important to note that in 2025, you do have that beginning of Part-D benefit redesign, which adds, I'd say a couple of points of growth headwind that will still allow us to deliver robust growth, but it won't -- you shouldn't think about the same amount of growth every year, it's going to accelerate over the long-range plan."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \nLiz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer.  Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take your questions.  So with that, I will turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. AbbVie continues to perform exceptionally well. We once again delivered an excellent quarter with results ahead of our expectations. We are now several quarters into the U.S. biosimilar event for Humira and continue to effectively manage erosion. We have been able to maintain significant volume with the majority of the impact to date driven by lower price.  Importantly, our growth platform, the base business excluding Humira, which includes a well-diversified portfolio with multiple leading products in highly attractive markets across immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and aesthetics continues to demonstrate robust performance and outperform expectations. This platform, which is the critical driver in our return to rapid growth in 2025 and beyond, delivered strong double digit revenue growth this quarter, a considerable acceleration from the first half of this year.  We anticipate this platform, which is led by Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, and Botox will continue to drive significant revenue growth going forward. At the same time, we have several promising R&D programs with the potential to contribute meaningfully in the latter part of this decade and into the 2030s. This includes next generation approaches in immunology, a focus on bispecifics, ADCs, and novel I-O in oncology, as well as innovative therapies to potentially treat a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.  In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the continued strong momentum and execution across our business. The growth platform is substantially outperforming our expectations, giving us the confidence to once again raise our financial outlook, including upgraded guidance for floor earnings, which Rob will share momentarily. And further underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today, we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown by more than 285% since our inception.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob? \nRob Michael: Thank you, Rick. Our results once again demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio and support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance. The performance of our ex-Humira growth platform continues to be very strong with revenue growth above 12% this quarter, including more than 50% growth from both Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our best in category immunology medicines. We continue to anticipate that these two products will collectively exceed Humira peak revenues by 2027 with robust growth expected into the next decade. Neuroscience also delivered strong performance with operational sales growth of more than 20% this quarter, driven by our leading portfolio for migraine and psychiatric conditions. And lastly, aesthetics performance was highlighted by the return to growth of the U.S. toxin market.  This outstanding execution across our well-diversified portfolio gives us the confidence to once again raise our near-term financial outlook. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance by $600 million and have now raised total revenue by $2 billion since our initial guidance in February, including more than $1.4 billion from our ex-Humira growth platform. As a result, we are also raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25, and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.19 and $11.23. Given the strong momentum of our growth platform, which is significantly outperforming our expectations this year, we are now raising the floor guidance for 2024 adjusted EPS to $11, which is $0.30 better than our previous expectations. This floor guidance continues to exclude any impact from IPR&D expense. As is our typical practice, we'll provide our formal EPS guidance range for 2024 on the fourth quarter call.  Finally, today, we are announcing a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.48 to $1.55, beginning with a dividend payable in February 2024. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by more than 285%.  In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong execution across our portfolio. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single digit CAGR to the end of the decade.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? \nJeff Stewart : Thank you, Rob. We once again delivered strong results across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of nearly $6.8 billion exceeding our expectations.  Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to demonstrate impressive growth and are now on pace to deliver approximately $11.6 billion in combined sales this year. This performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we are still in the early launch phase for both assets and IBD, an area of high unmet need where we are very competitively positioned with two complementary assets, each having generated strong response rates and durable remission across our development programs.  Skyrizi total sales were $2.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 50%. This robust performance includes further share gains in psoriasis, where we remain the clear market leader, capturing roughly one-third of the total prescriptions in the U.S. biologic market, and approximately 50% of in-play patients who are either new to therapy or switching. Increasing momentum in psoriatic arthritis, where Skyrizi is now the leading in-play biologic therapy in the U.S. dermatology segment, as well as continued rapid uptake in Crohn's disease where we are capturing roughly one out of every four in-play patients.  Importantly, we recently announced positive results from SEQUENCE the ninth and perhaps the most impactful head-to-head study across our development program for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. SEQUENCE is a Phase 3 head-to-head study in Crohn's, which demonstrated Skyrizi's superiority versus Stelara across key efficacy parameters, including impressive, statistically significant differences in both clinical and endoscopic remission. The detailed data from this trial were presented earlier this month, and we plan to share the findings more broadly now via our medical personnel and representatives in the field. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will clearly support Skyrizi as the best in category therapy for Crohn's, which is important for continued rapid share capture. So based on this very positive data as well as our continued momentum, we will be once again raising the full year sales outlook for Skyrizi. Moving now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of nearly 60% with increasing prescriptions across each of the approved indications. In particular, I am very excited about Rinvoq's growth potential in gastroenterology, where uptake is exceeding our expectations. In ulcerative colitis, Rinvoq is now capturing more than 25% total in-play patient share in the U.S. second-line plus setting, nearly at parity to the current market-leading therapy. And in Crohn's disease, Rinvoq is ramping very significantly. The inflection we are seeing is even faster when compared to our time aligned launch in UC just last year. Given this impressive momentum in IBD, we will now be raising our full year sales outlook for Rinvoq. Global Humira sales were more than $3.5 billion, down 36.2% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the U.S. played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets is trending better-than-expected. Turning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $908 million down 20% and consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $590 million, up 14% on an operational basis with strong demand for CLL and AML across our key countries. The U.S. launch of at EPKINLY in third line plus DLBCL is also tracking well with commercialization also now underway in Europe and Japan, following the recent respective approvals. In neuroscience, total revenues were more than $2 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $751 million were up 35.4% and we have seen a significant uplift in new prescriptions across all indications, following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder late last year. Our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $365 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 65%, as we continue to see strong demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Atogepant was also recently approved as a new therapy in Europe branded as Aquipta, where it is the only once-daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine, further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity.  Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic global sales were $748 million, up 7.4% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. So overall, I am extremely pleased with commercial execution across the therapeutic portfolio, especially with our growth platform, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\nCarrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Third quarter global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.2 billion, an operational decline of 4%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $759 million were roughly flat to last year as growth for Botox Cosmetic was offset by declines in other brands that continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures. U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $388 million, an increase of 5%. We are beginning to see a recovery in the U.S. toxin market, which posted positive year-over-year growth in the third quarter following three consecutive quarters of declines due to economic pressures. Botox continues to perform very well despite increasing competition. It remains the clear market leader with a strong and stable share, and we have seen little to no share impact from new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $116 million in the third quarter, a decline of 6.4% versus prior year as recovery in the facial filler market continues to lag the cosmetic toxin market. The filler market is improving, however, as a higher priced, more deferrable procedure relative to toxins. The segment of the aesthetics market continues to be suppressed by lower consumer spending. In the third quarter, the U.S. facial filler market was down low teens percentage compared to the prior year.  Juvederm remains the market-leading facial seller in the U.S. and share was stable in the quarter. While the U.S. facial injectable markets continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending in this inflationary environment, we are seeing signs of stabilization and even a return to growth in the cosmetic toxin segment. This gives us confidence in a stable to improving outlook in the U.S. as we end this year and enter 2024. Internationally, third quarter aesthetic sales were $480 million, representing an operational decline of 9.7%. As anticipated, year-over-year performance in the quarter was impacted by a shipment timing benefit we experienced in the third quarter of last year. Results were also impacted by softening economic conditions across major international aesthetic markets, primarily China. Despite the economic pressures that are currently impacting our aesthetics portfolio, we remain very confident in its long-term growth outlook. In September, we began launching Skin Vive in the U.S. And in the next few years, we plan to launch new indications for Botox in the lower face segment, and our novel fast-onset, short-duration toxin BoNT/E. In addition to our R&D programs, we have a robust Alle technology pipeline, which will bring new tech products into the U.S. market to help our customers acquire, retain and cross-sell more aesthetic patients. Our strong leadership positions in both cosmetic toxins and facial fillers combined with the significant investments we're making to drive market acceleration will position us for strong growth going forward.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. \nTom Hudson : Thank you, Carrie. In immunology, we had two important milestones in the third quarter for Skyrizi in inflammatory bowel disease. Following completion of the Phase 3 maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis. We submitted our regulatory applications for Scares in this indication in the U.S. and Europe with approvals anticipated in 2024. We also recently presented results from the SEQUENCE head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Stelara in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We're extremely pleased with how Skyrizi performed in this study, which enrolled very difficult-to-treat patients who all failed anti-TNF therapy. Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial, demonstrating clear superiority to Stelara on all endpoints at week 48 and with a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission at 32% of Skyrizi versus 16% for Stelara and endoscopic response at 45% versus 22% for Stelara.  Furthermore, steroid-free clinical remission was 61% for Scares versus 40% for Stelara. So these compelling head-to-head Crohn's data combined with the additional indication approval for ulcerative colitis expected next year will further position Skyrizi as a highly effective, durable, safe and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. We continue to make very good progress with the second wave of Rinvoq development programs as well in addition to the ongoing Phase 3 programs in GCA, lupus and HS, we recently began the Phase 3 program for Rinvoq in Alopecia Areata. We also recently announced positive top line results from a Phase 2 study for Rinvoq in vitiligo. In this study, Rinvoq met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 24 and demonstrating a significant improvement in both facial and total body vitiligo scoring measures compared to placebo.  Importantly, these results continued to improve through week 52 of the study illustrating Rinvoq's potential to provide significant skin repigmentation to patients suffering from vitiligo. Based on these results, we're advancing Rinvoq to Phase 3 in this indication with studies expected to begin soon.  Moving to oncology, where in the quarter, we received approval in Europe and Japan for epcoritamab as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, were received two or more systemic therapies. These approvals represent important regulatory milestones for EPCO, and we look forward to bringing this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients in these international markets. We also continue to make good progress with the development programs in earlier lines of DLBCL and follicular lymphoma and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. In our Venclexta multiple myeloma program, we recently announced top line results of a Phase 3 CANOVA trial evaluating Venclexta plus dexamethasone compared to PomDex in relapsed/refractory patients with a T114 mutation. In this study, the primary endpoint of IR CSS PFS was longer with VenDex versus PomDex but did not meet statistical significance. accommodation also resulted in numerically higher response rates and longer overall survival compared to PomDex. While the differences in efficacy measures were not statistically significant, we believe the totality of the data show a benefit with the Venclexta combination and we plan to discuss the results with regulatory agencies. We'll provide updates on the program as they become available.  Behind Venclexta, we have several exciting multiple myeloma programs emerging from our earlier stage pipeline. We continue to make good progress with our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 and where we're nearing completion of the dose optimization work and are on track to begin Phase 3 studies in the first half of next year. At an upcoming medical meeting, we plan to present updated Phase 1 efficacy and safety results as well as monthly administration dose data. We're also making good progress with our next-generation BCL2 inhibitor, ABBV-53, which is currently in Phase 1 studies and we'll provide updates as the data become available.  Now moving to Neuroscience, where in the quarter, we received approval for Aquipta in Europe, which is now the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently announced top line results from a second Phase 3 study evaluating Botox in platysma prominence, similar to results from the first Phase 3 study, all primary and secondary endpoints were met with Botox demonstrating a significant reduction in platysma prominence and vertical neckband. We anticipate a regulatory submission in the U.S. here the end of the year.  In addition to indication expansion for Botox, we continue to advance our novel toxin pipeline. We recently announced positive top line results from two Phase 3 trials evaluating BoNT/E, our rapid onset, short-acting novel toxin in glabellar lines. BoNT/E performed very well in both studies meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints compared to placebo. BoNT/E was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. We're very pleased with these results, which demonstrate this toxin's rapid onset of action and short duration of effect. Patients treated with BoNT/E showed an improvement in glabellar lines as early as 8 hours following injection and a duration of effect of 2 to 3 weeks. This highly differentiated clinical profile could offer patients a novel option compared to currently available neurotoxins. We plan to complete the remaining development work over the course of the next few quarters and anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the second half of next year. So in summary, we continue to make good progress across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to several more important milestones in the remainder of this year, including Phase 2 data for Teliso-V and second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Phase 2 proof-of-concept data for our anti-IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody, lutikizumab in hidradenitis suprativa, and regulatory approval in Europe for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery system for advanced Parkinson's disease. We also plan to submit updated 951 data in the U.S. near the end of the year.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. \nScott Reents : Thank you, Tom. I'm very pleased with the momentum of our business. The strong performance we are demonstrating from our ex Humira growth platform continues to support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook.  Starting with our third quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.04 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance and down 5.8% on an operational basis excluding a 0.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect double-digit sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform.  The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.7% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.4% of sales acquired IP R&D expense of 0.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.9% of sales. Net interest expense was $398 million. The adjusted tax rate was 15.7%.  Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $11.19 and $11.23. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the fourth quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $54 billion, an increase of $600 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% and unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. The updated revenue forecast contemplates a full year sales increase of $300 million roughly split evenly between Skyrizi and Rinvoq, reflecting strong uptake in IBD. The remaining $300 million full year sales increase is primarily attributed to better-than-expected performance of international Humira and Restasis.  Moving to the P&L. We continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of roughly $1.7 billion. And we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.5%, reflecting IP R&D occurred through the third quarter.  Turning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.87 and $2.91. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated more than $16.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow which is net of approximately $1.1 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments in the first 9 months of the year.  And our cash balance at the end of September was approximately $13.3 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we announced a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payment in February of 2024, and we remain on track to achieve by the end of this year, $34 billion of cumulative debt paydown since the Allergan transaction, maintaining a net leverage ratio around 1.8x. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Liz. \nLiz Shea : Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we'll take the first question, please. \nOperator: First question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. \nChris Shibutani : The 2024 earnings guidance, it seems as if you were quite confident heading in that $11 floor. As we await further details from top line and other margin structures, can you maybe identify some of the key push pulls that actually gave you that conviction to go to above and where directionally we should be thinking about the source of further growth on the forward? \nRob Michael : Chris, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So since we provided that guidance in February, recall we gave a $10.70 EPS floor to really help investors model earnings regardless of whether the trough recurred in '23 or '24 we've raised growth platform sales by $1.4 billion covering immunology, neuroscience and aesthetics. We're seeing the IBD indications for Skyrizi and Rinvoq very nicely, and we continue to capture more share in their other indications, both Vraylar and our migraine portfolio have outperformed our share forecast and the strong recovery of Botox has led us to raise guidance for aesthetics twice this year. So given the clear over-performance of the growth platform, we decided to raise the floor to $11 ex IPR&D. We hope this provides investors the view of the low end of the 2024 guidance range and also confirms that '24 will indeed be the trough year. And given that we expect to deliver a high single-digit CAGR from '24 to the end of the decade, it should allow investors to value the company with a better growth multiple. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Banse with Wells Fargo. \nMohit Bansal : And I have a question regarding aesthetic. So it seems like you are keeping the guidance here. So the first part of the question is it seems like across the board, there is a 10% quarter-over-quarter decline on all the products. Can you help us understand what's happening sequentially? And then if you are keeping the guidance, it seems like there would be quite a bump in fourth quarter. So how should we think about that? \nRob Michael : Maybe I'll start -- this is Rob. I'll start with your question. So one thing to keep in mind is that we mentioned in the last call that we had some dynamics in the international market when you look at the growth rates where we had more difficult comparison because of some of the -- some stocking that occurred in the prior year, that's something to keep in mind. We also do have a certain amount of seasonality that occurs in our business in the U.S. in particular. So those are things to keep in mind. I'd say as we look at it, we're very encouraged by the return to growth of the U.S. toxin market.  Botox is performing very well, and we're certainly doing a very nice job maintaining our share position despite competitive pressure. So I'd say we're very pleased there. I'd say on fillers, what we're seeing is probably more of a lag in the recovery. And if we've studied this market historically, we do tend to see a lag and that's really relative to thinking about the price point for fillers versus toxins. It's natural to assume that the recovery will take a little bit longer. So we are seeing that recovery take a little bit longer. We're still very, very encouraged by the trends we're seeing. We're very excited about the new fillers we've launched, both SkinVive and Volux. We're starting to see some nice share momentum come from those new introductions. And so from that standpoint, we feel very good. And then as we've been monitoring the situation in China, as all of you I'm sure have been watching very carefully. We saw, as you recall, a very strong recovery in the first half of the year. We've seen it moderate, and we're keeping a close eye on that. And so that's something we're obviously paying a lot of attention to. Now we look at the rest of the international business, it's growing nicely. And so as I think about the guidance for this year, I'd say we're fairly close. We're not overly concerned. We don't adjust guidance for plus or minus $100 million. If it was greater than that, we would consider it. So that's something to keep in mind. But as we look at this, the long-term outlook for this business, we're very confident. When you think about the U.S. toxin market, it's historically grown in the mid-teens and it's still heavily underpenetrated in the low single digits.  And market growth is really the key to deliver on our long-term outlook. We've seen this market rebound very strongly following a period of economic pressure, and we've demonstrated time and again that we can increase new patient starts for our promotional efforts. And something I think probably isn't appreciated is that we do have several innovations that can accelerate that growth. And when you think about the master and platysma indications for Botox, those can each add a few hundred million dollars. Our novel short-acting toxin BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients that could really drive an inflection in market growth. As you think about one of the biggest barriers for new patients is fear of an unnatural look, and the short-acting toxin opportunity is a great way to unlock that. And then if you look at our regenerative fillers pipeline, those are aimed at providing both short- and long-term treatment benefits for consumers.  And as I mentioned, we're also very excited about the new fillers we've launched both SkinVive and Volux. So with this business, you see us go through some cycles with economic pressure. But over the long term, we feel very confident that we can certainly deliver very robust growth and deliver on that real than $9 billion expectation for 2029. \nRick Gonzalez : Lee, this is Rick. The other thing that you're looking at sequentially, you have to keep in mind is we do Botox today in the fourth quarter. So that elevates revenue in the fourth quarter, and that occurs every year. So if you're looking at third quarter to fourth quarter and trying to understand why is there a big step up, part of that step-up is that. \nLiz Shea : Operator next question please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Schott : Just maybe a two-parter really focused on immunology for 2024. So maybe first on Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I guess, with more of the '24 formula discussions complete, we're seeing some great volume trends. But are you still comfortable that we should expect more normalized price erosion for those two products versus the high single digits we're seeing this year? And then the second one was on Humira for 2024. And I think, Rob, you might have commented last quarter of your comfort with where consensus sits. And again, maybe a similar question with maybe more color about formulary for next year. Is that something you're still comfortable? And just how should we think about dynamics there? \nJeff Stewart : Yes. It's Jeff. I'll take the first question. Yes, we're very comfortable as we see things start to evolve and close here as we move into 2024. I mean if you think about all the indications that we've had 7 over the last 18 months, I highlighted in my remarks, 9 head-to-head trials. We're just a very, very nice position for Skyrizi and Rinvoq as we move into '24 to continue some very strong momentum that we're seeing in the actual. So quite confident in terms of how we're looking at that. And to your key point there on the price, we continue to see that we're not going to have a repeat of what we saw this year. And remember, the background there were those 7 indications that came very fast all on top of each other. And so that was the root cause of that -- of those concessions that won't repeat. Next year, we have really one more big indication, not 7, and that's Skyrizi you see that Tom highlighted. So we'll see the normalized price erosion more in line with industry forms versus what we saw this year. \nRob Michael : And then, Chris, this is Rob. On HUMIRA, I think if you think about the annualization rebates that given the rest increase in the second half of this year, so you have an annualization impact, and the additional rebates to secure parity access next year, really price should be the main driver of the erosion in '24. I mean volume will have an impact, particularly in wax sensitive accounts, but price will make up the vast majority of the erosion next year. And while we're not giving '24 guidance today, as you've mentioned, Chris, I've highlighted the average, it was about $7 billion when I mentioned that was a reasonable expectation for U.S. Humira next year. Now there are a few animals who have forecasted U.S. Humira above $8 billion next year, which is just not a reasonable expectation given the price dynamic. \nOperator: Next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn : Obviously, you guys are very well positioned coming out of the Humira LOE in terms of the growth franchise. But I think there's focus from investors on maybe bolstering the pipeline. So as you guys think about M&A and business development, maybe you could just walk us through your latest thoughts and anything in terms of therapeutic areas of interest and stated development. \nRick Gonzalez : Okay. Terence, this is Rick. I'll cover it. That question for you. Yes, I think as we look at the business, as Rob indicated, we're extremely comfortable with how the growth platform is performing. And I'd say how we're managing the biosimilar erosion, which gives us a lot of confidence that we can deliver this high single-digit going forward. From '25 -- going forward through the end of the decade. So I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at, and we're in a fortunate position from that standpoint. There are many companies in our sector we need to go out and do lots of BD to be able to drive the growth that they're trying to achieve. We're not in that position. But I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at is we're looking to add assets that could give us incremental pipeline and revenue growth towards the end of this decade and into the 30s. That's what our -- the bulk of our focus is on. .  And I'd say if I look at AbbVie's track record, certainly, BD has been a critical part of how we've grown this company over the last 11 years. And I'd say, for the most part, we have done a pretty good job when we acquire assets and bring them in we can make them perform quite well. Skyrizi is a good example of that. Certainly, Allergan was another good example of that, and there are many others. So I'd say we value BD as a very important tool and how we should grow the business and how we should position our leadership positions in these franchises. Our primary focus is within the franchises that we're operating in. So let's take immunology as an example.  I would say our greatest focus in immunology is to continue to add additional mechanisms in particular, that could be used in combination in order to create deeper levels of clinical response in areas like IBD, rheumatology and other areas. So we continue to look for those. We have several already that are in development now, like Luti, like RIPK1 and several others in our pipeline, but we'll continue to look for additional assets that we could add to that. And like I said, especially focused on combination therapy because we think that is the way to get much deeper clinical remission or responses in those patients who aren't responding to things like Skyrizi, Rinvoq, which obviously performed exceptionally well.  So that's a big area. Oncology is another big area. We have a high level of interest in next-generation CAR-T technology. We have a high level of interest in T cell engagers beyond our BCMA product. I think as we look at that asset continue to develop, we are very convinced it has a best-in-class profile. And it shows us that for the right indication, T cell engagers can be extremely effective, and they're much easier to use and can be much more broadly brought to patients and CAR-Ts, at least the current version of CAR-Ts. So I'd say that's an area that we have a high level -- in psychiatry, we're interested in additional assets in anxiety and mood, and a variety of other assets, but that gives you some feel for it. And we obviously have the financial wherewithal to go out and do transactions. We need to make sure we find the right transaction. So it's a value-enhancing asset for the company. And when we find them, we will act on and we will act on quickly. \nOperator: Next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. \nAlice Nettleton : This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. A question on obesity and its interface with I&I and a lot of other drug categories, frankly, are views that payers have to cover OBD medicines. And if that's correct, it's a big expense, and payers will be looking for offsets. One-off that would be for payers to squeeze other therapeutic areas as hard as they can. An example could be I&I, where there's now a really good product, your own HUMIRA at a much lower price. So we're wondering how much payers might start to force a step edit for products like Skyrizi? It's a relevant question because yesterday, one of the issues Bristol noted with its TYK2 product is step edits and they cite biosimilar Humira as the reason. \nJeff Stewart : Thank you for the question. It's Jeff. And I think you've got to take a step back regardless of the obesity issues and think about the overall strategy that we pursued, which was 1 of fundamental distinction. And I'll take your point over some of these head-to-head trials, and there's 9 of them, right? So if you take Skyrizi, just in psoriasis, we have gross superiority versus every mechanism in the category. So a head-to-head of gross superiority versus Humira versus the leading IL-17 COSENTYX versus the oral Otezla, and we also have versus Stelara. So fundamentally, when payers think about stepping or not stepping or how they would think about that, there's a medical dynamic there and that distinctiveness that we have across our program is very, very important to help manage maybe the urge of the payers to think of formulary structures like that. If you think about your comments that you have -- that you heard yesterday or the day before, that's a very different dynamic.  I mean, if you're not that different or you have the same efficacy as a Humira, it's not going to go that well on some of these formularies. And so I think you got to take a step back and look at the fundamental distinctiveness that we have on both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And I think my last comment would be, let's take Reno, which is growing very fast, 60%, okay? All of that is in the second-line plus setting. So from a strategic standpoint, it's already stepped. And so when you take a look at those dynamics, we remain quite confident that as we rely on the power of raising the standard of care, that will help us navigate any of these scenarios, whether it's related to obesity or not. \nOperator: Next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. \nVamil Divan : I mean, transit right now. But the two questions I have actually, one is maybe building on Terence's question around business development base in the pipeline. I think we get a lot of other questions just around sort of the underappreciated assets within your pipeline. I don't know if you can maybe just comment on that. I know there's a couple of assets that you plan out things people are overlooking where they might be some underappreciated upside? And then the second one is just on the charge you took today or this quarter on Imbruvica regarding the Medicare drug pricing program.  And obviously, I understand why you did. I'm curious on the amount and the timing of why you're doing now, I suppose I may be willing to see how the losses play out or negotiation process plays out. And then in terms of the amount or how you -- what your assumptions were that you can share on the competitive dynamics for sort of what you're assuming around the impact this program would have on the pricing of Imbruvica\u2026? \nRick Gonzalez : Divan, this is Rick. I'll take the first question, and then Scott will take the second question. So on the pipeline, I think as I look at the pipeline and how we built the pipeline and how it's playing out, I think -- I don't know that I would call it underappreciated because you don't necessarily have access to all the data that we have on some of these programs. But we obviously invested significantly over the last several years in rapidly developing the indications for Rinvoq and Skyrizi and a lot of our focus had been built around that. But in parallel, we were advancing a number of other programs along the way.  And I would say the investment that we made on Skyrizi and Rinvoq are pretty clear the kind of return that we are getting for those assets. I mean, they're growing at a phenomenal rate. In fact, in the not-too-distant future, the combination of those two products on a running rate basis will be larger than Humira, to give you some idea of how rapidly those products are growing and how large they are. But if I look at our pipeline, the real meaningful programs that we have in our pipeline that will be true needle movers for the company, there are several of them that are advancing now I think we have a high level of confidence in 400, our topo warhead platform with our c-Met version of that, we're seeing very encouraging data in CRC. We'll follow that with non-small cell lung cancer. And that platform is demonstrating to us that it is a broad-based platform that we can expand to a number of other areas. And that should be a fairly significant opportunity for us going forward. Later sort of the '27, '28 timeframe, I think it's going well have meaningful benefit play through. And then I'd say the second one is 383, our BCMA bispecific. As we indicated earlier, we're seeing more and more data out of that program that clearly tells us this has a best-in-class profile, high levels of efficacy and very good safety and very convenient dosing.  We think it has that ideal profile to be able to enter this market. And as you know, multiple myeloma is a very large market. There are very significant products in this market. So those are two opportunities. I would obviously say, $16 million. And some of our TA programs are also exciting programs that are running in parallel to these. We'll be getting more data on those next year. And I think those have significant opportunities as well. The third program I talked about is in our eye care business. It's our REGENXBIO program for both wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. We're seeing some very, very encouraging data out of that program, and that could be a nice opportunity for us as well, and it continues to advance. So there are a number of important programs that you'll start to see more and more data as we go through '24 and into '25 that I think will give the market an opportunity to be able to better assess those. \nScott Reents: Vam, this is Scott. With respect to your question on the Imbruvica charge. So I think a couple of things. As we have signaled in some of our regulatory filings, our last 10-Q, for instance, we had indicated that if we were to be selected in the negotiation process under the Inflation Reduction Act, that there would likely trigger an impairment. And so we had anticipated that this would be happy. And so the timing really relates to the fact that under the rules, you have to look at the fair value of that intangible asset with respect to future cash flows. And so the accounting rules would require that we would make that analysis upon selection as we had kind of previewed in our filings. And so we went through the process under that triggering event to determine what the impairment should be. And I would say that when you look at that impairment, the magnitude of the impairment is driven by a number of factors, but really, one of the biggest factors that you're seeing there is it requires you to discount the future cash flow. So as we calculate the future cash flows, looked at what we had assumed was a reasonable assumption on the price, you discount those back. And so that creates part of the magnitude of this adjustment. In terms of the negotiated price that we assumed, I think we're in the middle of these negotiations, and it really wouldn't be appropriate for us to talk about what that is. But we looked at a number of factors, and we think that process is going to play out. Certainly, we will see on February 1 in a private conversation with CMS what they anticipate at least an initial thought on price, but it won't be finalized until September 1 of next year. And so we will see what that price is as the process plays out. \nOperator: Next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. \nSteve Scala : I have two questions and one clarification. First, a clarification. Is the base year for the high single-digit revenue growth to the end of the decade? Is the base year 2023 -- or excuse me, 2024 or 2025. I think it's '25, but maybe you can clarify that. Second, given AbbVie's stated interest in building the oncology business, I assume that AbbVie took a hard look at the ADC deal that Merck signed with Daiichi. I'm just curious what about it didn't you like -- was it the profile of the products? Was it the price? Or do you feel you have everything you need already? And then the last question is at least 1 other company has changed its tax rate guidance stemming from a recent IRS document clarifying Section 174 tax legislation. Do you have any perspective on this update and why it doesn't impact AbbVie? \nRob Michael : Steve, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So the base year is '24. And if you think about it, we signaled that we expect to return a robust growth in '25. And so that high single-digit CAGR really would pick up that first year of robust growth of 25%. If you start in '25, you miss that your growth. So our intention has always been '24 is a base year and that high single-digit CAGR starts from '24 to the end of the decade. \nRick Gonzalez : Steve, this is Rick. I'll take the second question. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on whether we looked at that same transaction and that probably wouldn't be appropriate. But what I can tell you is we knew it was there. So maybe that gives you some idea of our perspective on it. But the reality is, we believe we have what we need with 400. We believe that platform, and we own that platform, we developed it internally. We give us everything that we need in that area. And so it wasn't something that we were looking at. Scott? \nScott Reents : Yes. It's Scott. So with respect to the tax legislation, I certainly when can talk about what our facts are. But when we've looked at -- certainly, this results out of tax reform legislation a few years ago. The tax rules, there's always a little bit of uncertainty. And what happened this quarter, there was guidance that came out that, I would say, clarified a certain approach in treatment. Prior to that guidance, though, there was a little bit of a diversity of opinion amongst advisors as to -- and ourselves as to how we might implement. So I would tell you that we were already implementing consistent with how that guidance ultimately came out, and that's why you're not seeing any impact to us on our tax rate. \nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. \nGary Nachman : So first, back to the trough raise in 2024. How are you thinking about spending levels for both SG&A and R&D into the trough year next year to set up for growth in '21 and beyond? Do you have a better sense of where the operating margin might end up next year? And then secondly, Scares and Rinvoq have been doing very well in the IBD indications talk about how much headroom you see for those products in UC and Crohn's with that landscape likely getting more competitive in the coming years? And any updated thoughts on 2025 guidance for those products? \nScott Reents: Gary, it's Scott. I'll start with your question regarding operating margin. So when we've looked at the operating margins we talked about in the past, for '23 and '24, we talked about those being very, very similar. So when you think about the operating margin that we've talked about for this year and next year, it's really about 46% to 47% range. This year, our guidance is 46.5% and we would expect operating margin in '24 to be very similar to what we're seeing this year. And then I think as a result, roughly the gross margin is going to be in line in '24 with what we're seeing this year as well as the expense profile. So very consistent with this year. And of course, we'll refine that when we come out with guidance. \nJeff Stewart : Yes. This is Jeff. I'll highlight the -- your comment on the head space and IBD. I mean the IBD market is very, very attractive. If we think back historically, we were always, frankly, a little surprised at how fast Humira back in the day grew when we started to achieve the UC and the Chrome's indications. And again, I would say we're very, very pleasantly encouraged about the momentum. The momentum is very, very significant. So there is significant headroom. And what we see in the market dynamic is that unlike what you might think that patients would always want to rotate off of their medications because of the severity of the disease, actually physicians haven't been able to really move the market very much over the years, simply because it's very dangerous to try to go to another drug that hasn't provided any increase in benefit for those patients. It puts those patients at risk. So when you look at what Tom had highlighted, our ability with two complementary assets -- for example, in the U.S., Skyrizi position in the early lines, Rinvoq position in later lines, both of which have exceptional performance criteria versus the market. That gives us a lot of confidence. The other thing that gives us a lot of confidence because there will be more competitive entries in the future is we think our profiles are going to hold up exceptionally well. And then there's the commercial executional component in most of the countries around the world, we have dual sales forces that basically will carry two products with four big indications. So our ability to compete in the market for share even as it gets a little more competitive over time, is still going to be very, very strong. So lots of headroom in the market, lots of unmet need in the market, and we believe we have the best position in the market for the foreseeable future. \nRob Michael : And Gary, this is Rob. On your question regarding 2025 guidance, we do periodically update the long-term guidance for our portfolio. We're obviously very pleased with the momentum we're seeing both from Skyrizi and RNA, particularly in -- if you recall when we provided -- last time we provided guidance for Skyrizi, we had about $2.5 billion of revenue in IBD in 2025 and it was $1.8 billion for Rinvoq. And those are obviously ramping very nicely. We have a lot of confidence. We periodically update that guidance, we'll find the right time to provide a holistic update to our long-term guy. But clearly, the momentum is there. And the Street reflects that, too. I mean if I look at consensus, not for Skyrizi, I think it's around $11 billion. So it's $1 billion higher than our 2025 guide. So I think the market is recognizing the strong momentum, and we'll update that long-term guide holistically at the appropriate time. \nOperator: Next question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. \nLuisa Hector : To continue with IBD, I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the AbbVie pipeline emerging behind Skyrizi and Rinvoq and how we think about that and maybe potential combinations with Skyrizi? And with the recent competitor launch in psoriasis with a label where the FDA has asked to mention anti-TNF safety warnings. I wondered whether the FDA has mentioned anything to you about the review of labor in that regard. . \nRoopal Thakkar: It's Roople. I'll take the IBD question. So you've heard already some mention of Lutikizumab. That's our IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody. That's an in-house antibody. And we have observed data where there's resistance to anti-TNF and other biologics with patients with 1 beta signal. So we'll be entering into ulcerative colitis looking at a potential biomarker approach. But in addition to that, we will also be looking at a set of combinations as was already mentioned, for example, with Skyrizi, we have Lutikizumab. We have other agents as well. RIPK1 was also mentioned. There's also some partnerships that we have is another mechanism we're interested in. And another one I'll mention is an IL-2 mutein. All of these are under assessment. And we do believe either you find a biomarker approach where you can see the high efficacy or if you want to see real transformational efficacy, you're going to have to go a combination approach. So those are the assets we'll be looking at. Now moving on to the question, I think it was around depression and suicidal ideation if I heard it correctly. This was in an IL-17 class agent that was recently approved. We've also observed a similar warning and precaution previously also in the IL-17 class. In fact, that previous asset, in fact, had a REMS in place. Remember, Skyrizi is an anti-IL-23 very different class. And to date, with all the data that's been generated across numerous indications, we don't see that type of signal at all nor do we have any of that in our label.  And as we look at psoriasis therapy, that particular agent that's been mentioned has been available in Europe and our physicians really don't tell us that there's much of an uptake there. So Skyrizi continues to perform well. Also, our label does not have the high rate of fungal infections that have been observed with the new 1 in the '17 class -- and also, we've talked a lot about IBD. We -- the Skyrizi doesn't also lead to IBD, which is another risk for the IL-17 class. And also with our dosing regimen -- you get it at 0 and week 4, and then it's quarterly after that. With the new one, I think there's 5 doses that are required and potentially every 8 weeks or in heavier patients every 4 weeks. So we're very confident in Skyrizi's position across indications, especially in psoriasis. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. \nDavid Risinger : Upon your vision for oncology, clearly, the company has compelling assets. But in light of an increasingly complex and competitive oncology landscape, could you just paint a picture of how you see your portfolio evolving and opportunities to acquire assets when it may be difficult to see what's around the corner from, let's say, an emerging oncology competitor in 3 to 4 years? \nTom Hudson : This is Tom Hudson. We've been -- we certainly -- when we talk about 400, we're also talking about going in different space than lung and breast, where there's a lot of competition, like colon cancer, gastric cancer, pancreas. So c-Met is a target that's expressed in many other tumors, and that's why we've developed this with topo warhead, so we can go to a broader set of tumors. And that's where we're seeing a very good data with ABBV-400 even unselected patient population, third line plus, we saw a 22% response versus 2% to 3%. What's also interesting about this is -- it's not just for colon cancer, but most chemos, most treatments and GI tumors have a lot of toxicity, a lot of diarrhea.  And one of the things that excite the clinicians about this program is actually a very low rate of diarrhea. So what makes that not only can we see some efficacy in third line, but it sees we can move to earlier lines and combined with other therapies have higher efficacy. So there's a lot of unmet need in GI tumors. And so this data, again, we're going to have more data in our next cohort at the end of this year. In CRC will have different doses, and we'll also have potential cutoffs of biomarkers. So moving very well, but we're actually in a big space, in GI tumors, as I've mentioned, even our GARP program, also where we've shown the best data is in liver cancer, where c-Met is also expressed. We have opportunities to go explore places where there's a big unmet need and the competition is not the same. Now the other targets because we talked about topo platform. We have others, 706, which is already in the clinic with 6. Next year, we'll be going to 2 other indications, which for which there's less competition in terms of ADC space. So our strategy is actually to go and bring this in offering to a lot more cancer patients. I'll stop there, and I'll stop there. \nRoopal Thakkar : It's Roopal. Let me add on a little bit. I think you may be also reflecting on some of the ESMO data that came out I will mention long a little bit, we still see an opportunity with Teliso-V. We're going to get data later this year. But what we've already observed is 50% ORRs in a biomarker-selected population in the EGFR wild type. If you look at some of the data that has come out, the ORRs are probably right around 20% to 30%. We don't have all the breakdown of all the different lung subtypes. But 1 approach is to use a biomarker and then select the patient population rather than going so broadly that was observed at ESMO. The other thing I would say reflecting on the data that came out, if you looked at EGFR mutants in lung, you see some higher levels of efficacy, either in the frontline or second line in that space. But that comes at a cost, and that's a chemo-like adverse event profile. And those are things like nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue. These are things that you may see slight increases in efficacy, but clearly, patients don't want that. And like -- as Tom was mentioning with our platform and including Teliso-V, we have an opportunity there in the mutant side to combine with osimertinib, which has a nice profile. And those mutant patients when they progress, half of them have highly expressed c-Met. So that's where a combo looks good. And then we're also seeing 50% ORR in that segment as well. And we have a plan to get into Phase 3 into that next year. And then as we think about heme, we spoke about 383, which we feel has best-in-class potential. And one of the things that we're observing with that one is the high level of efficacy. [PRFs], we're driving down past grade 3 and now driving down to get past grade 2.  So that enables the potential where you may not need hospitalization. And what you see now with the BCMA dual engagers is not just hospitalization but a REMS. And what we would add to that is dose spacing potentially every other month. So that one is a very nice profile, and we're moving into Phase 3 with that one, and we continue to conduct a variety of combinations there so we can move into earlier lines of therapy in multiple myeloma. We are still moving into earlier lines in Phase 3s with EPKINLY in heme, which is another dual engager. We have an asset called 453, which is our next-gen BCL2 blocker. And then we have a BTK degrader called 101 that's also in clinic. So quite a comprehensive approach across oncology. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. \nGeoff Meacham : Just have a couple of quick ones, one on immunology. So you guys have evaluated the impact from Humira biosimilars beyond even 25%, is it your view that tail revenues are likely to be better than you initially modeled. And what, if anything, do Stelara, the delay in Stelara biosimilars impact this. And the second question, just on capital deployment. Just given your higher guidance, I know you guys just raised the dividend, but would you also say that the deal capacity is higher. I know you recently raised kind of M&A range and wondering if that's even going higher. \nJeff Stewart : Yes. Geoff, it's Jeff here. And we continue to study the tail. I mean it's something that we're -- we look very closely at -- we continue to think that the Humira tail will emerge sometime in '25 or '26. And that's looking at some of the international analogs, how we think we see pricing may move I mean the one thing that we do believe is that you're not going to have a small molecule like tail, which is virtually nothing. There's going to be a sub-segment of patients that are going to stay on Humira. It's going to be modest, whether it's low price or low volume, but it will be there even in an interchangeable world. We don't necessarily believe that since we've outperformed here in volume in '23 that that's going to fundamentally change our view on the tail at this point. And again, we're still highlighting that. In terms of Stelara, obviously, we think in the U.S. that will not come until -- and I think it was recently confirmed this week until sometime in '25. And so overall, we think that's a modest net positive for AbbVie in terms of how that may play out. But that's not the primary driver of our strategy. Our primary driver of the strategy is how distinctive we are across our indications with Skyrizi versus Stelara, which I've already highlighted. So I hope that helps. \nRob Michael : And Jeff, this is Rob. You're right. We did lift the cap. We had put that $2 billion BD cap in place, although we are rapidly paying down debt. And we lifted that at the beginning of this year because we essentially -- by the end of this year, we're going to have paid off all the incremental financing from the Allergan transaction. As Scott mentioned, our net leverage ratio is around 1.8x. And I have said previously that as long as we're going to pass back to 2x that leverage in 2 to 3 years, that's the way we're thinking about balance sheet capacity. So as we look at it, there's nothing from a balance capacity standpoint that would limit us today for pursuing the opportunities we'd be interested in. So that's not a limiting factor. And to the extent that we continue to raise guidance and perform more strongly. That just means there's even more capacity. But there's -- at this point, that's not a rate limiter for the types of opportunities we'd be interested in. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. \nEvan Seigerman : Congrats on a progress. I just wanted to touch on the dividend growth. So at first line, it seems that your dividend growth, while impressive, is slowing a bit relative to other recent periods. Maybe you could help us understand kind of what's driving this dynamic at play? Is it concerns around near-term performance of key products you Humira erosion continuing next year? Or are you preserving capital for you to help further? Maybe some color on that would be very helpful. \nRob Michael : So Evan, it's Rob. If you think about it, we're delivering dividend growth both in '23 and '24, while earnings are not growing, right? So then you look at the payout ratio we're at, we're going to be in the mid-50s. And we have said that over the long term, if you look at just across the industry as well, I'd say a good target is in, say, the mid- to high 40% payout ratio, which would mean that during this period where you see our payout ratio go up in the future, we're very committed to growing the dividend. We'll continue to grow the dividend, but we would expect then earnings would grow faster than dividend increases. So I would say we've gone through this period for a couple of years where we are still delivering a very nice dividend growth despite earnings declining. But given our commitment to that dividend, we're going to continue growing it. We'll likely see it step up from here, but not at the same rate as earnings growth because that payout ratio right now will be sitting in. So that's the way we think about it. Over the long term, we want to deliver a healthy, sustainable, growing dividend. And so we have a long view on this, and we are committed to delivering that growth to investors. And so that's the way we're thinking about it. We're going through a period of a couple of years here where earnings aren't growing. And then we see us return a robust growth, we'll step up that dividend again, but it's -- that's a dynamic that we're balancing here. \nOperator: Our last question comes from [Jon Hung] with UBS. \nUnidentified Analyst: I've got two. Just one confirmation on the trough and then one on aesthetics. So -- on the trough in '24, you mentioned that costs you will have the same margin in '24 is '23. So is it going to be a trough year on sales rather than the trough being driven by costs? And then second, again, just lots of noise on GLP-1s impacting aesthetics. You've commented before on fillers and Ozempic face in the past, but there's potential impact on body scope in -- is this actually anything that you're seeing coming through yet in the sales? And overall, is this trend a net positive or a net negative for you? \nRob Michael : This is Rob. So clearly, we've communicated a floor for earnings. And Scott previously mentioned that I expect a similar level of operating margin year-over-year. And so you can model the sales accordingly. It should be fairly clear. \nRick Gonzalez : Operating margin profile. \nRob Michael : Operating margin profile, yes. So we said the 46% to 47% is the way to think about operating margin profile in '23 and '24. We've given you the $11 EPS ex IPR&D as a floor for next year. So I was just using those parameters to model revenue. . \nRick Gonzalez : Carrie? \nCarrie Strom : And this is Carrie. For your question around the weight loss products and the impact on the aesthetics business, I mean as we look at the long-term view of this market, we continue to think that anything that gets a subset of patients engaged in their appearance, which these weight loss products can do, that is a positive tailwind for our business. And we hear that from our customers and many of our customers are bringing these GLP-1s into their practice, and they see it as a natural opportunity to cross-sell. Now that said, in the short term, especially in an environment where discretionary spending is pressured and there could be trade-offs for higher-priced products such as fillers or body contouring. Now we're not necessarily seeing that as a driver.  Right now, what we're seeing is the broader macroeconomic dynamics. But in the short term, that could be a trade-off in terms of share of wallet. But absolutely long term, this is something that is going to help patients get engaged in aesthetics and be an opportunity for cross-selling. \nLiz Shea : And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us. . \nOperator: Thank you, and that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. AbbVie continues to perform exceptionally well. We once again delivered an excellent quarter with results ahead of our expectations. We are now several quarters into the U.S. biosimilar event for Humira and continue to effectively manage erosion. We have been able to maintain significant volume with the majority of the impact to date driven by lower price.  Importantly, our growth platform, the base business excluding Humira, which includes a well-diversified portfolio with multiple leading products in highly attractive markets across immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and aesthetics continues to demonstrate robust performance and outperform expectations. This platform, which is the critical driver in our return to rapid growth in 2025 and beyond, delivered strong double digit revenue growth this quarter, a considerable acceleration from the first half of this year.  We anticipate this platform, which is led by Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, and Botox will continue to drive significant revenue growth going forward. At the same time, we have several promising R&D programs with the potential to contribute meaningfully in the latter part of this decade and into the 2030s. This includes next generation approaches in immunology, a focus on bispecifics, ADCs, and novel I-O in oncology, as well as innovative therapies to potentially treat a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.  In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the continued strong momentum and execution across our business. The growth platform is substantially outperforming our expectations, giving us the confidence to once again raise our financial outlook, including upgraded guidance for floor earnings, which Rob will share momentarily. And further underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today, we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown by more than 285% since our inception.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob? Lee, this is Rick. The other thing that you're looking at sequentially, you have to keep in mind is we do Botox today in the fourth quarter. So that elevates revenue in the fourth quarter, and that occurs every year. So if you're looking at third quarter to fourth quarter and trying to understand why is there a big step up, part of that step-up is that. Okay. Terence, this is Rick. I'll cover it. That question for you. Yes, I think as we look at the business, as Rob indicated, we're extremely comfortable with how the growth platform is performing. And I'd say how we're managing the biosimilar erosion, which gives us a lot of confidence that we can deliver this high single-digit going forward. From '25 -- going forward through the end of the decade. So I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at, and we're in a fortunate position from that standpoint. There are many companies in our sector we need to go out and do lots of BD to be able to drive the growth that they're trying to achieve. We're not in that position. But I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at is we're looking to add assets that could give us incremental pipeline and revenue growth towards the end of this decade and into the 30s. That's what our -- the bulk of our focus is on. .  And I'd say if I look at AbbVie's track record, certainly, BD has been a critical part of how we've grown this company over the last 11 years. And I'd say, for the most part, we have done a pretty good job when we acquire assets and bring them in we can make them perform quite well. Skyrizi is a good example of that. Certainly, Allergan was another good example of that, and there are many others. So I'd say we value BD as a very important tool and how we should grow the business and how we should position our leadership positions in these franchises. Our primary focus is within the franchises that we're operating in. So let's take immunology as an example.  I would say our greatest focus in immunology is to continue to add additional mechanisms in particular, that could be used in combination in order to create deeper levels of clinical response in areas like IBD, rheumatology and other areas. So we continue to look for those. We have several already that are in development now, like Luti, like RIPK1 and several others in our pipeline, but we'll continue to look for additional assets that we could add to that. And like I said, especially focused on combination therapy because we think that is the way to get much deeper clinical remission or responses in those patients who aren't responding to things like Skyrizi, Rinvoq, which obviously performed exceptionally well.  So that's a big area. Oncology is another big area. We have a high level of interest in next-generation CAR-T technology. We have a high level of interest in T cell engagers beyond our BCMA product. I think as we look at that asset continue to develop, we are very convinced it has a best-in-class profile. And it shows us that for the right indication, T cell engagers can be extremely effective, and they're much easier to use and can be much more broadly brought to patients and CAR-Ts, at least the current version of CAR-Ts. So I'd say that's an area that we have a high level -- in psychiatry, we're interested in additional assets in anxiety and mood, and a variety of other assets, but that gives you some feel for it. And we obviously have the financial wherewithal to go out and do transactions. We need to make sure we find the right transaction. So it's a value-enhancing asset for the company. And when we find them, we will act on and we will act on quickly. Divan, this is Rick. I'll take the first question, and then Scott will take the second question. So on the pipeline, I think as I look at the pipeline and how we built the pipeline and how it's playing out, I think -- I don't know that I would call it underappreciated because you don't necessarily have access to all the data that we have on some of these programs. But we obviously invested significantly over the last several years in rapidly developing the indications for Rinvoq and Skyrizi and a lot of our focus had been built around that. But in parallel, we were advancing a number of other programs along the way.  And I would say the investment that we made on Skyrizi and Rinvoq are pretty clear the kind of return that we are getting for those assets. I mean, they're growing at a phenomenal rate. In fact, in the not-too-distant future, the combination of those two products on a running rate basis will be larger than Humira, to give you some idea of how rapidly those products are growing and how large they are. But if I look at our pipeline, the real meaningful programs that we have in our pipeline that will be true needle movers for the company, there are several of them that are advancing now I think we have a high level of confidence in 400, our topo warhead platform with our c-Met version of that, we're seeing very encouraging data in CRC. We'll follow that with non-small cell lung cancer. And that platform is demonstrating to us that it is a broad-based platform that we can expand to a number of other areas. And that should be a fairly significant opportunity for us going forward. Later sort of the '27, '28 timeframe, I think it's going well have meaningful benefit play through. And then I'd say the second one is 383, our BCMA bispecific. As we indicated earlier, we're seeing more and more data out of that program that clearly tells us this has a best-in-class profile, high levels of efficacy and very good safety and very convenient dosing.  We think it has that ideal profile to be able to enter this market. And as you know, multiple myeloma is a very large market. There are very significant products in this market. So those are two opportunities. I would obviously say, $16 million. And some of our TA programs are also exciting programs that are running in parallel to these. We'll be getting more data on those next year. And I think those have significant opportunities as well. The third program I talked about is in our eye care business. It's our REGENXBIO program for both wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. We're seeing some very, very encouraging data out of that program, and that could be a nice opportunity for us as well, and it continues to advance. So there are a number of important programs that you'll start to see more and more data as we go through '24 and into '25 that I think will give the market an opportunity to be able to better assess those. Steve, this is Rick. I'll take the second question. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on whether we looked at that same transaction and that probably wouldn't be appropriate. But what I can tell you is we knew it was there. So maybe that gives you some idea of our perspective on it. But the reality is, we believe we have what we need with 400. We believe that platform, and we own that platform, we developed it internally. We give us everything that we need in that area. And so it wasn't something that we were looking at. Scott? Operating margin profile. Carrie?"
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Roopal Thakkar",
            "content": "It's Roople. I'll take the IBD question. So you've heard already some mention of Lutikizumab. That's our IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody. That's an in-house antibody. And we have observed data where there's resistance to anti-TNF and other biologics with patients with 1 beta signal. So we'll be entering into ulcerative colitis looking at a potential biomarker approach. But in addition to that, we will also be looking at a set of combinations as was already mentioned, for example, with Skyrizi, we have Lutikizumab. We have other agents as well. RIPK1 was also mentioned. There's also some partnerships that we have is another mechanism we're interested in. And another one I'll mention is an IL-2 mutein. All of these are under assessment. And we do believe either you find a biomarker approach where you can see the high efficacy or if you want to see real transformational efficacy, you're going to have to go a combination approach. So those are the assets we'll be looking at. Now moving on to the question, I think it was around depression and suicidal ideation if I heard it correctly. This was in an IL-17 class agent that was recently approved. We've also observed a similar warning and precaution previously also in the IL-17 class. In fact, that previous asset, in fact, had a REMS in place. Remember, Skyrizi is an anti-IL-23 very different class. And to date, with all the data that's been generated across numerous indications, we don't see that type of signal at all nor do we have any of that in our label.  And as we look at psoriasis therapy, that particular agent that's been mentioned has been available in Europe and our physicians really don't tell us that there's much of an uptake there. So Skyrizi continues to perform well. Also, our label does not have the high rate of fungal infections that have been observed with the new 1 in the '17 class -- and also, we've talked a lot about IBD. We -- the Skyrizi doesn't also lead to IBD, which is another risk for the IL-17 class. And also with our dosing regimen -- you get it at 0 and week 4, and then it's quarterly after that. With the new one, I think there's 5 doses that are required and potentially every 8 weeks or in heavier patients every 4 weeks. So we're very confident in Skyrizi's position across indications, especially in psoriasis. It's Roopal. Let me add on a little bit. I think you may be also reflecting on some of the ESMO data that came out I will mention long a little bit, we still see an opportunity with Teliso-V. We're going to get data later this year. But what we've already observed is 50% ORRs in a biomarker-selected population in the EGFR wild type. If you look at some of the data that has come out, the ORRs are probably right around 20% to 30%. We don't have all the breakdown of all the different lung subtypes. But 1 approach is to use a biomarker and then select the patient population rather than going so broadly that was observed at ESMO. The other thing I would say reflecting on the data that came out, if you looked at EGFR mutants in lung, you see some higher levels of efficacy, either in the frontline or second line in that space. But that comes at a cost, and that's a chemo-like adverse event profile. And those are things like nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue. These are things that you may see slight increases in efficacy, but clearly, patients don't want that. And like -- as Tom was mentioning with our platform and including Teliso-V, we have an opportunity there in the mutant side to combine with osimertinib, which has a nice profile. And those mutant patients when they progress, half of them have highly expressed c-Met. So that's where a combo looks good. And then we're also seeing 50% ORR in that segment as well. And we have a plan to get into Phase 3 into that next year. And then as we think about heme, we spoke about 383, which we feel has best-in-class potential. And one of the things that we're observing with that one is the high level of efficacy. [PRFs], we're driving down past grade 3 and now driving down to get past grade 2.  So that enables the potential where you may not need hospitalization. And what you see now with the BCMA dual engagers is not just hospitalization but a REMS. And what we would add to that is dose spacing potentially every other month. So that one is a very nice profile, and we're moving into Phase 3 with that one, and we continue to conduct a variety of combinations there so we can move into earlier lines of therapy in multiple myeloma. We are still moving into earlier lines in Phase 3s with EPKINLY in heme, which is another dual engager. We have an asset called 453, which is our next-gen BCL2 blocker. And then we have a BTK degrader called 101 that's also in clinic. So quite a comprehensive approach across oncology."

            "name": "Tom Hudson",
            "content": "Thank you, Carrie. In immunology, we had two important milestones in the third quarter for Skyrizi in inflammatory bowel disease. Following completion of the Phase 3 maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis. We submitted our regulatory applications for Scares in this indication in the U.S. and Europe with approvals anticipated in 2024. We also recently presented results from the SEQUENCE head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Stelara in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We're extremely pleased with how Skyrizi performed in this study, which enrolled very difficult-to-treat patients who all failed anti-TNF therapy. Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial, demonstrating clear superiority to Stelara on all endpoints at week 48 and with a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission at 32% of Skyrizi versus 16% for Stelara and endoscopic response at 45% versus 22% for Stelara.  Furthermore, steroid-free clinical remission was 61% for Scares versus 40% for Stelara. So these compelling head-to-head Crohn's data combined with the additional indication approval for ulcerative colitis expected next year will further position Skyrizi as a highly effective, durable, safe and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. We continue to make very good progress with the second wave of Rinvoq development programs as well in addition to the ongoing Phase 3 programs in GCA, lupus and HS, we recently began the Phase 3 program for Rinvoq in Alopecia Areata. We also recently announced positive top line results from a Phase 2 study for Rinvoq in vitiligo. In this study, Rinvoq met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 24 and demonstrating a significant improvement in both facial and total body vitiligo scoring measures compared to placebo.  Importantly, these results continued to improve through week 52 of the study illustrating Rinvoq's potential to provide significant skin repigmentation to patients suffering from vitiligo. Based on these results, we're advancing Rinvoq to Phase 3 in this indication with studies expected to begin soon.  Moving to oncology, where in the quarter, we received approval in Europe and Japan for epcoritamab as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, were received two or more systemic therapies. These approvals represent important regulatory milestones for EPCO, and we look forward to bringing this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients in these international markets. We also continue to make good progress with the development programs in earlier lines of DLBCL and follicular lymphoma and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. In our Venclexta multiple myeloma program, we recently announced top line results of a Phase 3 CANOVA trial evaluating Venclexta plus dexamethasone compared to PomDex in relapsed/refractory patients with a T114 mutation. In this study, the primary endpoint of IR CSS PFS was longer with VenDex versus PomDex but did not meet statistical significance. accommodation also resulted in numerically higher response rates and longer overall survival compared to PomDex. While the differences in efficacy measures were not statistically significant, we believe the totality of the data show a benefit with the Venclexta combination and we plan to discuss the results with regulatory agencies. We'll provide updates on the program as they become available.  Behind Venclexta, we have several exciting multiple myeloma programs emerging from our earlier stage pipeline. We continue to make good progress with our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 and where we're nearing completion of the dose optimization work and are on track to begin Phase 3 studies in the first half of next year. At an upcoming medical meeting, we plan to present updated Phase 1 efficacy and safety results as well as monthly administration dose data. We're also making good progress with our next-generation BCL2 inhibitor, ABBV-53, which is currently in Phase 1 studies and we'll provide updates as the data become available.  Now moving to Neuroscience, where in the quarter, we received approval for Aquipta in Europe, which is now the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently announced top line results from a second Phase 3 study evaluating Botox in platysma prominence, similar to results from the first Phase 3 study, all primary and secondary endpoints were met with Botox demonstrating a significant reduction in platysma prominence and vertical neckband. We anticipate a regulatory submission in the U.S. here the end of the year.  In addition to indication expansion for Botox, we continue to advance our novel toxin pipeline. We recently announced positive top line results from two Phase 3 trials evaluating BoNT/E, our rapid onset, short-acting novel toxin in glabellar lines. BoNT/E performed very well in both studies meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints compared to placebo. BoNT/E was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. We're very pleased with these results, which demonstrate this toxin's rapid onset of action and short duration of effect. Patients treated with BoNT/E showed an improvement in glabellar lines as early as 8 hours following injection and a duration of effect of 2 to 3 weeks. This highly differentiated clinical profile could offer patients a novel option compared to currently available neurotoxins. We plan to complete the remaining development work over the course of the next few quarters and anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the second half of next year. So in summary, we continue to make good progress across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to several more important milestones in the remainder of this year, including Phase 2 data for Teliso-V and second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Phase 2 proof-of-concept data for our anti-IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody, lutikizumab in hidradenitis suprativa, and regulatory approval in Europe for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery system for advanced Parkinson's disease. We also plan to submit updated 951 data in the U.S. near the end of the year.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. This is Tom Hudson. We've been -- we certainly -- when we talk about 400, we're also talking about going in different space than lung and breast, where there's a lot of competition, like colon cancer, gastric cancer, pancreas. So c-Met is a target that's expressed in many other tumors, and that's why we've developed this with topo warhead, so we can go to a broader set of tumors. And that's where we're seeing a very good data with ABBV-400 even unselected patient population, third line plus, we saw a 22% response versus 2% to 3%. What's also interesting about this is -- it's not just for colon cancer, but most chemos, most treatments and GI tumors have a lot of toxicity, a lot of diarrhea.  And one of the things that excite the clinicians about this program is actually a very low rate of diarrhea. So what makes that not only can we see some efficacy in third line, but it sees we can move to earlier lines and combined with other therapies have higher efficacy. So there's a lot of unmet need in GI tumors. And so this data, again, we're going to have more data in our next cohort at the end of this year. In CRC will have different doses, and we'll also have potential cutoffs of biomarkers. So moving very well, but we're actually in a big space, in GI tumors, as I've mentioned, even our GARP program, also where we've shown the best data is in liver cancer, where c-Met is also expressed. We have opportunities to go explore places where there's a big unmet need and the competition is not the same. Now the other targets because we talked about topo platform. We have others, 706, which is already in the clinic with 6. Next year, we'll be going to 2 other indications, which for which there's less competition in terms of ADC space. So our strategy is actually to go and bring this in offering to a lot more cancer patients. I'll stop there, and I'll stop there."

            "name": "Scott Reents",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom. I'm very pleased with the momentum of our business. The strong performance we are demonstrating from our ex Humira growth platform continues to support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook.  Starting with our third quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.04 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance and down 5.8% on an operational basis excluding a 0.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect double-digit sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform.  The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.7% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.4% of sales acquired IP R&D expense of 0.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.9% of sales. Net interest expense was $398 million. The adjusted tax rate was 15.7%.  Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $11.19 and $11.23. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the fourth quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $54 billion, an increase of $600 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% and unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. The updated revenue forecast contemplates a full year sales increase of $300 million roughly split evenly between Skyrizi and Rinvoq, reflecting strong uptake in IBD. The remaining $300 million full year sales increase is primarily attributed to better-than-expected performance of international Humira and Restasis.  Moving to the P&L. We continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of roughly $1.7 billion. And we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.5%, reflecting IP R&D occurred through the third quarter.  Turning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.87 and $2.91. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated more than $16.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow which is net of approximately $1.1 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments in the first 9 months of the year.  And our cash balance at the end of September was approximately $13.3 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we announced a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payment in February of 2024, and we remain on track to achieve by the end of this year, $34 billion of cumulative debt paydown since the Allergan transaction, maintaining a net leverage ratio around 1.8x. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Liz. Vam, this is Scott. With respect to your question on the Imbruvica charge. So I think a couple of things. As we have signaled in some of our regulatory filings, our last 10-Q, for instance, we had indicated that if we were to be selected in the negotiation process under the Inflation Reduction Act, that there would likely trigger an impairment. And so we had anticipated that this would be happy. And so the timing really relates to the fact that under the rules, you have to look at the fair value of that intangible asset with respect to future cash flows. And so the accounting rules would require that we would make that analysis upon selection as we had kind of previewed in our filings. And so we went through the process under that triggering event to determine what the impairment should be. And I would say that when you look at that impairment, the magnitude of the impairment is driven by a number of factors, but really, one of the biggest factors that you're seeing there is it requires you to discount the future cash flow. So as we calculate the future cash flows, looked at what we had assumed was a reasonable assumption on the price, you discount those back. And so that creates part of the magnitude of this adjustment. In terms of the negotiated price that we assumed, I think we're in the middle of these negotiations, and it really wouldn't be appropriate for us to talk about what that is. But we looked at a number of factors, and we think that process is going to play out. Certainly, we will see on February 1 in a private conversation with CMS what they anticipate at least an initial thought on price, but it won't be finalized until September 1 of next year. And so we will see what that price is as the process plays out. Yes. It's Scott. So with respect to the tax legislation, I certainly when can talk about what our facts are. But when we've looked at -- certainly, this results out of tax reform legislation a few years ago. The tax rules, there's always a little bit of uncertainty. And what happened this quarter, there was guidance that came out that, I would say, clarified a certain approach in treatment. Prior to that guidance, though, there was a little bit of a diversity of opinion amongst advisors as to -- and ourselves as to how we might implement. So I would tell you that we were already implementing consistent with how that guidance ultimately came out, and that's why you're not seeing any impact to us on our tax rate. Gary, it's Scott. I'll start with your question regarding operating margin. So when we've looked at the operating margins we talked about in the past, for '23 and '24, we talked about those being very, very similar. So when you think about the operating margin that we've talked about for this year and next year, it's really about 46% to 47% range. This year, our guidance is 46.5% and we would expect operating margin in '24 to be very similar to what we're seeing this year. And then I think as a result, roughly the gross margin is going to be in line in '24 with what we're seeing this year as well as the expense profile. So very consistent with this year. And of course, we'll refine that when we come out with guidance."

            "name": "Jeff Stewart",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. We once again delivered strong results across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of nearly $6.8 billion exceeding our expectations.  Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to demonstrate impressive growth and are now on pace to deliver approximately $11.6 billion in combined sales this year. This performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we are still in the early launch phase for both assets and IBD, an area of high unmet need where we are very competitively positioned with two complementary assets, each having generated strong response rates and durable remission across our development programs.  Skyrizi total sales were $2.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 50%. This robust performance includes further share gains in psoriasis, where we remain the clear market leader, capturing roughly one-third of the total prescriptions in the U.S. biologic market, and approximately 50% of in-play patients who are either new to therapy or switching. Increasing momentum in psoriatic arthritis, where Skyrizi is now the leading in-play biologic therapy in the U.S. dermatology segment, as well as continued rapid uptake in Crohn's disease where we are capturing roughly one out of every four in-play patients.  Importantly, we recently announced positive results from SEQUENCE the ninth and perhaps the most impactful head-to-head study across our development program for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. SEQUENCE is a Phase 3 head-to-head study in Crohn's, which demonstrated Skyrizi's superiority versus Stelara across key efficacy parameters, including impressive, statistically significant differences in both clinical and endoscopic remission. The detailed data from this trial were presented earlier this month, and we plan to share the findings more broadly now via our medical personnel and representatives in the field. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will clearly support Skyrizi as the best in category therapy for Crohn's, which is important for continued rapid share capture. So based on this very positive data as well as our continued momentum, we will be once again raising the full year sales outlook for Skyrizi. Moving now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of nearly 60% with increasing prescriptions across each of the approved indications. In particular, I am very excited about Rinvoq's growth potential in gastroenterology, where uptake is exceeding our expectations. In ulcerative colitis, Rinvoq is now capturing more than 25% total in-play patient share in the U.S. second-line plus setting, nearly at parity to the current market-leading therapy. And in Crohn's disease, Rinvoq is ramping very significantly. The inflection we are seeing is even faster when compared to our time aligned launch in UC just last year. Given this impressive momentum in IBD, we will now be raising our full year sales outlook for Rinvoq. Global Humira sales were more than $3.5 billion, down 36.2% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the U.S. played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets is trending better-than-expected. Turning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $908 million down 20% and consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $590 million, up 14% on an operational basis with strong demand for CLL and AML across our key countries. The U.S. launch of at EPKINLY in third line plus DLBCL is also tracking well with commercialization also now underway in Europe and Japan, following the recent respective approvals. In neuroscience, total revenues were more than $2 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $751 million were up 35.4% and we have seen a significant uplift in new prescriptions across all indications, following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder late last year. Our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $365 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 65%, as we continue to see strong demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Atogepant was also recently approved as a new therapy in Europe branded as Aquipta, where it is the only once-daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine, further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity.  Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic global sales were $748 million, up 7.4% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. So overall, I am extremely pleased with commercial execution across the therapeutic portfolio, especially with our growth platform, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? Yes. It's Jeff. I'll take the first question. Yes, we're very comfortable as we see things start to evolve and close here as we move into 2024. I mean if you think about all the indications that we've had 7 over the last 18 months, I highlighted in my remarks, 9 head-to-head trials. We're just a very, very nice position for Skyrizi and Rinvoq as we move into '24 to continue some very strong momentum that we're seeing in the actual. So quite confident in terms of how we're looking at that. And to your key point there on the price, we continue to see that we're not going to have a repeat of what we saw this year. And remember, the background there were those 7 indications that came very fast all on top of each other. And so that was the root cause of that -- of those concessions that won't repeat. Next year, we have really one more big indication, not 7, and that's Skyrizi you see that Tom highlighted. So we'll see the normalized price erosion more in line with industry forms versus what we saw this year. Thank you for the question. It's Jeff. And I think you've got to take a step back regardless of the obesity issues and think about the overall strategy that we pursued, which was 1 of fundamental distinction. And I'll take your point over some of these head-to-head trials, and there's 9 of them, right? So if you take Skyrizi, just in psoriasis, we have gross superiority versus every mechanism in the category. So a head-to-head of gross superiority versus Humira versus the leading IL-17 COSENTYX versus the oral Otezla, and we also have versus Stelara. So fundamentally, when payers think about stepping or not stepping or how they would think about that, there's a medical dynamic there and that distinctiveness that we have across our program is very, very important to help manage maybe the urge of the payers to think of formulary structures like that. If you think about your comments that you have -- that you heard yesterday or the day before, that's a very different dynamic.  I mean, if you're not that different or you have the same efficacy as a Humira, it's not going to go that well on some of these formularies. And so I think you got to take a step back and look at the fundamental distinctiveness that we have on both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And I think my last comment would be, let's take Reno, which is growing very fast, 60%, okay? All of that is in the second-line plus setting. So from a strategic standpoint, it's already stepped. And so when you take a look at those dynamics, we remain quite confident that as we rely on the power of raising the standard of care, that will help us navigate any of these scenarios, whether it's related to obesity or not. Yes. This is Jeff. I'll highlight the -- your comment on the head space and IBD. I mean the IBD market is very, very attractive. If we think back historically, we were always, frankly, a little surprised at how fast Humira back in the day grew when we started to achieve the UC and the Chrome's indications. And again, I would say we're very, very pleasantly encouraged about the momentum. The momentum is very, very significant. So there is significant headroom. And what we see in the market dynamic is that unlike what you might think that patients would always want to rotate off of their medications because of the severity of the disease, actually physicians haven't been able to really move the market very much over the years, simply because it's very dangerous to try to go to another drug that hasn't provided any increase in benefit for those patients. It puts those patients at risk. So when you look at what Tom had highlighted, our ability with two complementary assets -- for example, in the U.S., Skyrizi position in the early lines, Rinvoq position in later lines, both of which have exceptional performance criteria versus the market. That gives us a lot of confidence. The other thing that gives us a lot of confidence because there will be more competitive entries in the future is we think our profiles are going to hold up exceptionally well. And then there's the commercial executional component in most of the countries around the world, we have dual sales forces that basically will carry two products with four big indications. So our ability to compete in the market for share even as it gets a little more competitive over time, is still going to be very, very strong. So lots of headroom in the market, lots of unmet need in the market, and we believe we have the best position in the market for the foreseeable future. Yes. Geoff, it's Jeff here. And we continue to study the tail. I mean it's something that we're -- we look very closely at -- we continue to think that the Humira tail will emerge sometime in '25 or '26. And that's looking at some of the international analogs, how we think we see pricing may move I mean the one thing that we do believe is that you're not going to have a small molecule like tail, which is virtually nothing. There's going to be a sub-segment of patients that are going to stay on Humira. It's going to be modest, whether it's low price or low volume, but it will be there even in an interchangeable world. We don't necessarily believe that since we've outperformed here in volume in '23 that that's going to fundamentally change our view on the tail at this point. And again, we're still highlighting that. In terms of Stelara, obviously, we think in the U.S. that will not come until -- and I think it was recently confirmed this week until sometime in '25. And so overall, we think that's a modest net positive for AbbVie in terms of how that may play out. But that's not the primary driver of our strategy. Our primary driver of the strategy is how distinctive we are across our indications with Skyrizi versus Stelara, which I've already highlighted. So I hope that helps."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Third quarter global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.2 billion, an operational decline of 4%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $759 million were roughly flat to last year as growth for Botox Cosmetic was offset by declines in other brands that continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures. U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $388 million, an increase of 5%. We are beginning to see a recovery in the U.S. toxin market, which posted positive year-over-year growth in the third quarter following three consecutive quarters of declines due to economic pressures. Botox continues to perform very well despite increasing competition. It remains the clear market leader with a strong and stable share, and we have seen little to no share impact from new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $116 million in the third quarter, a decline of 6.4% versus prior year as recovery in the facial filler market continues to lag the cosmetic toxin market. The filler market is improving, however, as a higher priced, more deferrable procedure relative to toxins. The segment of the aesthetics market continues to be suppressed by lower consumer spending. In the third quarter, the U.S. facial filler market was down low teens percentage compared to the prior year.  Juvederm remains the market-leading facial seller in the U.S. and share was stable in the quarter. While the U.S. facial injectable markets continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending in this inflationary environment, we are seeing signs of stabilization and even a return to growth in the cosmetic toxin segment. This gives us confidence in a stable to improving outlook in the U.S. as we end this year and enter 2024. Internationally, third quarter aesthetic sales were $480 million, representing an operational decline of 9.7%. As anticipated, year-over-year performance in the quarter was impacted by a shipment timing benefit we experienced in the third quarter of last year. Results were also impacted by softening economic conditions across major international aesthetic markets, primarily China. Despite the economic pressures that are currently impacting our aesthetics portfolio, we remain very confident in its long-term growth outlook. In September, we began launching Skin Vive in the U.S. And in the next few years, we plan to launch new indications for Botox in the lower face segment, and our novel fast-onset, short-duration toxin BoNT/E. In addition to our R&D programs, we have a robust Alle technology pipeline, which will bring new tech products into the U.S. market to help our customers acquire, retain and cross-sell more aesthetic patients. Our strong leadership positions in both cosmetic toxins and facial fillers combined with the significant investments we're making to drive market acceleration will position us for strong growth going forward.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. And this is Carrie. For your question around the weight loss products and the impact on the aesthetics business, I mean as we look at the long-term view of this market, we continue to think that anything that gets a subset of patients engaged in their appearance, which these weight loss products can do, that is a positive tailwind for our business. And we hear that from our customers and many of our customers are bringing these GLP-1s into their practice, and they see it as a natural opportunity to cross-sell. Now that said, in the short term, especially in an environment where discretionary spending is pressured and there could be trade-offs for higher-priced products such as fillers or body contouring. Now we're not necessarily seeing that as a driver.  Right now, what we're seeing is the broader macroeconomic dynamics. But in the short term, that could be a trade-off in terms of share of wallet. But absolutely long term, this is something that is going to help patients get engaged in aesthetics and be an opportunity for cross-selling."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. Our results once again demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio and support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance. The performance of our ex-Humira growth platform continues to be very strong with revenue growth above 12% this quarter, including more than 50% growth from both Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our best in category immunology medicines. We continue to anticipate that these two products will collectively exceed Humira peak revenues by 2027 with robust growth expected into the next decade. Neuroscience also delivered strong performance with operational sales growth of more than 20% this quarter, driven by our leading portfolio for migraine and psychiatric conditions. And lastly, aesthetics performance was highlighted by the return to growth of the U.S. toxin market.  This outstanding execution across our well-diversified portfolio gives us the confidence to once again raise our near-term financial outlook. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance by $600 million and have now raised total revenue by $2 billion since our initial guidance in February, including more than $1.4 billion from our ex-Humira growth platform. As a result, we are also raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25, and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.19 and $11.23. Given the strong momentum of our growth platform, which is significantly outperforming our expectations this year, we are now raising the floor guidance for 2024 adjusted EPS to $11, which is $0.30 better than our previous expectations. This floor guidance continues to exclude any impact from IPR&D expense. As is our typical practice, we'll provide our formal EPS guidance range for 2024 on the fourth quarter call.  Finally, today, we are announcing a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.48 to $1.55, beginning with a dividend payable in February 2024. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by more than 285%.  In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong execution across our portfolio. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single digit CAGR to the end of the decade.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Chris, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So since we provided that guidance in February, recall we gave a $10.70 EPS floor to really help investors model earnings regardless of whether the trough recurred in '23 or '24 we've raised growth platform sales by $1.4 billion covering immunology, neuroscience and aesthetics. We're seeing the IBD indications for Skyrizi and Rinvoq very nicely, and we continue to capture more share in their other indications, both Vraylar and our migraine portfolio have outperformed our share forecast and the strong recovery of Botox has led us to raise guidance for aesthetics twice this year. So given the clear over-performance of the growth platform, we decided to raise the floor to $11 ex IPR&D. We hope this provides investors the view of the low end of the 2024 guidance range and also confirms that '24 will indeed be the trough year. And given that we expect to deliver a high single-digit CAGR from '24 to the end of the decade, it should allow investors to value the company with a better growth multiple. Maybe I'll start -- this is Rob. I'll start with your question. So one thing to keep in mind is that we mentioned in the last call that we had some dynamics in the international market when you look at the growth rates where we had more difficult comparison because of some of the -- some stocking that occurred in the prior year, that's something to keep in mind. We also do have a certain amount of seasonality that occurs in our business in the U.S. in particular. So those are things to keep in mind. I'd say as we look at it, we're very encouraged by the return to growth of the U.S. toxin market.  Botox is performing very well, and we're certainly doing a very nice job maintaining our share position despite competitive pressure. So I'd say we're very pleased there. I'd say on fillers, what we're seeing is probably more of a lag in the recovery. And if we've studied this market historically, we do tend to see a lag and that's really relative to thinking about the price point for fillers versus toxins. It's natural to assume that the recovery will take a little bit longer. So we are seeing that recovery take a little bit longer. We're still very, very encouraged by the trends we're seeing. We're very excited about the new fillers we've launched, both SkinVive and Volux. We're starting to see some nice share momentum come from those new introductions. And so from that standpoint, we feel very good. And then as we've been monitoring the situation in China, as all of you I'm sure have been watching very carefully. We saw, as you recall, a very strong recovery in the first half of the year. We've seen it moderate, and we're keeping a close eye on that. And so that's something we're obviously paying a lot of attention to. Now we look at the rest of the international business, it's growing nicely. And so as I think about the guidance for this year, I'd say we're fairly close. We're not overly concerned. We don't adjust guidance for plus or minus $100 million. If it was greater than that, we would consider it. So that's something to keep in mind. But as we look at this, the long-term outlook for this business, we're very confident. When you think about the U.S. toxin market, it's historically grown in the mid-teens and it's still heavily underpenetrated in the low single digits.  And market growth is really the key to deliver on our long-term outlook. We've seen this market rebound very strongly following a period of economic pressure, and we've demonstrated time and again that we can increase new patient starts for our promotional efforts. And something I think probably isn't appreciated is that we do have several innovations that can accelerate that growth. And when you think about the master and platysma indications for Botox, those can each add a few hundred million dollars. Our novel short-acting toxin BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients that could really drive an inflection in market growth. As you think about one of the biggest barriers for new patients is fear of an unnatural look, and the short-acting toxin opportunity is a great way to unlock that. And then if you look at our regenerative fillers pipeline, those are aimed at providing both short- and long-term treatment benefits for consumers.  And as I mentioned, we're also very excited about the new fillers we've launched both SkinVive and Volux. So with this business, you see us go through some cycles with economic pressure. But over the long term, we feel very confident that we can certainly deliver very robust growth and deliver on that real than $9 billion expectation for 2029. And then, Chris, this is Rob. On HUMIRA, I think if you think about the annualization rebates that given the rest increase in the second half of this year, so you have an annualization impact, and the additional rebates to secure parity access next year, really price should be the main driver of the erosion in '24. I mean volume will have an impact, particularly in wax sensitive accounts, but price will make up the vast majority of the erosion next year. And while we're not giving '24 guidance today, as you've mentioned, Chris, I've highlighted the average, it was about $7 billion when I mentioned that was a reasonable expectation for U.S. Humira next year. Now there are a few animals who have forecasted U.S. Humira above $8 billion next year, which is just not a reasonable expectation given the price dynamic. Steve, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So the base year is '24. And if you think about it, we signaled that we expect to return a robust growth in '25. And so that high single-digit CAGR really would pick up that first year of robust growth of 25%. If you start in '25, you miss that your growth. So our intention has always been '24 is a base year and that high single-digit CAGR starts from '24 to the end of the decade. And Gary, this is Rob. On your question regarding 2025 guidance, we do periodically update the long-term guidance for our portfolio. We're obviously very pleased with the momentum we're seeing both from Skyrizi and RNA, particularly in -- if you recall when we provided -- last time we provided guidance for Skyrizi, we had about $2.5 billion of revenue in IBD in 2025 and it was $1.8 billion for Rinvoq. And those are obviously ramping very nicely. We have a lot of confidence. We periodically update that guidance, we'll find the right time to provide a holistic update to our long-term guy. But clearly, the momentum is there. And the Street reflects that, too. I mean if I look at consensus, not for Skyrizi, I think it's around $11 billion. So it's $1 billion higher than our 2025 guide. So I think the market is recognizing the strong momentum, and we'll update that long-term guide holistically at the appropriate time. And Jeff, this is Rob. You're right. We did lift the cap. We had put that $2 billion BD cap in place, although we are rapidly paying down debt. And we lifted that at the beginning of this year because we essentially -- by the end of this year, we're going to have paid off all the incremental financing from the Allergan transaction. As Scott mentioned, our net leverage ratio is around 1.8x. And I have said previously that as long as we're going to pass back to 2x that leverage in 2 to 3 years, that's the way we're thinking about balance sheet capacity. So as we look at it, there's nothing from a balance capacity standpoint that would limit us today for pursuing the opportunities we'd be interested in. So that's not a limiting factor. And to the extent that we continue to raise guidance and perform more strongly. That just means there's even more capacity. But there's -- at this point, that's not a rate limiter for the types of opportunities we'd be interested in. So Evan, it's Rob. If you think about it, we're delivering dividend growth both in '23 and '24, while earnings are not growing, right? So then you look at the payout ratio we're at, we're going to be in the mid-50s. And we have said that over the long term, if you look at just across the industry as well, I'd say a good target is in, say, the mid- to high 40% payout ratio, which would mean that during this period where you see our payout ratio go up in the future, we're very committed to growing the dividend. We'll continue to grow the dividend, but we would expect then earnings would grow faster than dividend increases. So I would say we've gone through this period for a couple of years where we are still delivering a very nice dividend growth despite earnings declining. But given our commitment to that dividend, we're going to continue growing it. We'll likely see it step up from here, but not at the same rate as earnings growth because that payout ratio right now will be sitting in. So that's the way we think about it. Over the long term, we want to deliver a healthy, sustainable, growing dividend. And so we have a long view on this, and we are committed to delivering that growth to investors. And so that's the way we're thinking about it. We're going through a period of a couple of years here where earnings aren't growing. And then we see us return a robust growth, we'll step up that dividend again, but it's -- that's a dynamic that we're balancing here. This is Rob. So clearly, we've communicated a floor for earnings. And Scott previously mentioned that I expect a similar level of operating margin year-over-year. And so you can model the sales accordingly. It should be fairly clear. Operating margin profile, yes. So we said the 46% to 47% is the way to think about operating margin profile in '23 and '24. We've given you the $11 EPS ex IPR&D as a floor for next year. So I was just using those parameters to model revenue. ."

Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President and Chief Financer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.  Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. \nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 is an important year for AbbVie as we experience Humira biosimilar competition in the U.S. market, and as we execute our long-term diversification growth strategy. Now roughly seven months into the year, I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making against these objectives. The U.S. Humira biosimilar impact is playing out as projected and slightly better than our planning assumptions. We are competing very effectively with the various biosimilar offerings. We have exceeded our guidance in burst in second quarters with the overachievement predominantly driven by our growth platform, the base portfolio, excluding Humira which, as you know, is the critical driver in our rapid return to growth in 2025 and beyond. To that point, this platform demonstrated operational revenue growth of nearly 8% this quarter with growth expected to further accelerate in the second half of this year. We are also once again raising our full year revenue guidance by $1 billion, which is on top of the $400 million sales increase we delivered in the first quarter for a total overachievement of $1.4 billion. And lastly, we are making good progress with our pipeline, across all stages of development, including recent strong data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis as well as the recent U.S. approvals for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease and Epkinly in relapsed or refractory DLBCL, both important new therapies for patients. So in summary, I'm extremely pleased with the strong momentum and execution across the business. It reinforces our confidence in our ability to return to robust growth in 2025 with high single-digit compounded growth rate to the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob? \nRob Michael: Thank you, Rick. AbbVie delivered excellent results once again this quarter. We are demonstrating strong execution across our business with each of our five key therapeutic areas beating expectations. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance with the vast majority of the beat coming from our ex Humira growth platform. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive growth with sales for both therapies up more than 50% versus the prior year. These two agents have achieved differentiated clinical profiles, including head-to-head data versus Humira and other novel therapies. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are now collectively approved across 10 large indications, and we are forecasting combined revenue growth of more than $3.5 billion this year. With ongoing programs in several additional disease areas, we expect both Skyrizi and Rinvoq to deliver robust growth into the next decade and significantly exceed Humira peak revenue. U.S. Humira is also performing well. The first half erosion coming in better than our expectations due to volume. We have been carefully analyzing the biosimilar marketplace, where the total number of competitors has now expanded to 8. While many of these biosimilars have been added to payer formularies, Humira continues to maintain strong parity access. Based on the volume trends and parity access, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, an improvement of two points versus our original guidance. Neuroscience is another area that is outperforming expectations. Based on the current run rate, this portfolio is now on pace to add more than $1 billion of incremental revenue this year. with continued strong growth from Vraylar as well as our leading migraine portfolio. In aesthetics, the outlook continues to improve. We delivered positive growth this quarter, driven by strong international performance and stabilizing trends in the U.S. These positive trends give us the confidence to once again raise our full year guidance for aesthetics. And as a clear market leader, we are focused on expanding the aesthetics category with increased commercial investment and continued innovation to support robust long-term growth. Given the strong and balanced performance across our diverse portfolio, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. In closing, our operational execution has been outstanding, and we are very well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2023 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? \nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of $6.8 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi continues to perform exceptionally well. Global sales were approximately $1.9 billion, reflecting very strong operational growth of 51%. Our performance in psoriasis continues to be impressive. Total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market is now at 32%, double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. When you consider that Skyrizi is capturing roughly one out of two every in-play patient, which are either new to therapy or switching, there remains substantial opportunity for continued robust sales growth. And based on the available clinical data we are seeing from emerging competitive therapies in psoriasis, including orals, we feel very confident in Skyrizi's long-term potential with robust sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade. We are also seeing very nice prescription growth in psoriatic arthritis, especially in the U.S. dermatology segment where Skyrizi is approaching the leading new patient biologic market share. Skyrizi's momentum across psoriatic disease is very solid globally as well with total in-play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries. Turning now to IBD, where Skyrizi has demonstrated a very compelling clinical profile, including strong endoscopic data paired with convenient dosing. Uptake in Crohn's disease has been rapid, with total in-play patient share of approximately 25% in the U.S., roughly at parity leadership with Stelara. This uptake is very encouraging for Skyrizi's potential in ulcerative colitis, where we recently reported positive maintenance data with approval and commercialization anticipated next year. Given the momentum we are seeing across all of the approved indications, we will be raising our full year sales outlook for Skyrizi. Moving now to Rinvoq which delivered global sales of $918 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 57%. A key element of Rinvoq's success is its strong differentiation. It is now approved across seven distinct indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD as well as atopic dermatitis. It's the only potent daily oral medication with compelling head-to-head data against multiple novel therapies, including superiority to Humira in RA and Dupixent in AD. It's the only JAK inhibitor now approved to treat both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And we have established strong and broad commercial access for each of the core diseases with formulary coverage for Crohn's expected to ramp quickly over the next months. As it pertains to Rinvoq's book performance, we are seeing increasing prescriptions across each of the room indications globally, further market share momentum in atopic dermatitis, including now high-teens in-play patient share in the U.S. and robust uptake in IBD, where Rinvoq has demonstrated strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. Rinvoq is now capturing roughly one out of every four in-play ulcerative colitis patients in the second line plus setting. And the early data for Crohn's, which launched just in May, also shows a very strong ramp in new patient starts. We remained well positioned for continued momentum in this new indication as the only jack inhibitor approved to treat Crohn's disease.  This level of performance, along with the development of ongoing projects across several other diseases, such as giant cell arteritis and systemic lupus in rheumatology and multiple additional derm indications, reinforces the long-term potential for Rinvoq with strong sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade. Global Humira sales were $4 billion, down 24.8% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. remains slightly better than our expectations due to volume with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were approaching $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $907 million, down 20.8%, consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $571 million, up 15% on an operational basis with strong demand for both CLL and AML, and we are particularly pleased with the international performance here, following continued reimbursement progress in the EU and inclusion in China's national reimbursement list.  We also recently received the U.S. approval for Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL further expanding our on-market portfolio in hem onc. Early prescription trends have been encouraging, with a more robust opportunity expected as we progress development in earlier lines of therapy. We also anticipate approval and commercialization in Europe and Japan later this year. In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 14.2% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to exceed our expectations. Sales of $658 million were up 33.9% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications following the MDD approval late last year. Within migraine, we remain the clear market leader with unique treatment options for both acute and chronic conditions.  Our oral CGRP portfolio contributed $292 million in combined sales this quarter reflecting growth of more than 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $748 million, up 11.3% on an operational basis, reflecting nice momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. This franchise continues to outperform our expectations, and we will be raising our full year guidance for the collective neuroscience portfolio. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance and execution across the therapeutic portfolio with growth expected to accelerate through the second half of the year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? \nCarrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Second quarter global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.4 billion up 2.9% on an operational basis with strong performance from our international portfolio offsetting the economic impact in the U.S. U.S. aesthetic sales were $829 million, down 6.2%. Our U.S. portfolio continues to perform well from a competitive perspective. And as expected, the aesthetics markets continued to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures, which weighed on year-over-year growth rates. U.S. Botox cosmetic sales were $420 million, a decline of 6.5% versus the prior year. While the U.S. cosmetic toxin market declined low single digits in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, growth rates improved through the quarter, with June showing a return to positive year-over-year market growth.  Botox Cosmetic continues to be the clear market leader, maintaining strong and stable share despite new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $125 million, down 14.5% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see a more pronounced impact from inflationary dynamics on higher-priced, more deferrable procedures such as Filler. The U.S. Filler market declined approximately 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic metrics that we track for the U.S. have largely stabilized. Our consumer market research shows a meaningful recovery from last summer and those intending to get treated with toxins and fillers.  Additionally, we have now lapped the beginning of the market downturn, which occurred in the second quarter of last year. Based on these factors, we expect growth rates for the U.S. facial injectables to improve in the second half of this year. Our international aesthetics portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well with strong results in many key markets. Second quarter sales were $555 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 20%. The International Botox cosmetic sales of $265 million increased approximately 14% on an operational basis and International Juvederm sales were $243 million, up approximately 28% on an operational basis. Growth in the Asia Pacific region, particularly robust as aesthetic treatment rates in China have fully recovered to pre-COVID levels.  We continue to anticipate strong normalized growth through the remainder of the year in China. We are very pleased with the strong performance of our international aesthetics portfolio over the first half of the year and continue to expect similarly strong results in the second half. In the third quarter, we will be facing a challenging year-over-year comparison due to a shipment timing benefit we saw in the third quarter of 2022. This is expected to result in relatively flat growth for our international portfolio in the third quarter. On a full year basis, we expect our international aesthetics sales to grow high single digits. We continue to invest to drive future growth for our aesthetics portfolio with a focus on enhanced promotional activities, improve digital products and services through our Alle platform, sales force expansion, and injector training.  We continue to invest in our pipeline as well, and we remain committed to a regular cadence of new product introductions and indication expansions for Botox cosmetic and Juvederm. We recently announced the FDA approval of SkinVive, the first hyaluronic acid filler in the U.S. for improved skin smoothness of the cheeks, which, along with the recently launched Volux filler for jawline contouring, will help sustain our leadership position in the U.S. filler market. Our investments will allow us to maintain a strong leadership position in the highly underpenetrated and rapidly growing global aesthetics markets.  We remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio and continue to expect to deliver greater than $9 billion in 2029. In the near term, the improving aesthetics outlook in the U.S. and continued robust international performance gives us confidence to once again raise our full year aesthetics guidance with an expectation for continued operational growth over the back half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. \nTom Hudson: Thank you, Carrie. We've continued to make very good progress with our pipeline over the quarter. We had a substantial amount of activity across our R&D pipeline, resulting in new approvals and advancements of several programs. In immunology, we received FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, marking its seventh FDA approval across gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology. In our Crohn's development program, Rinvoq demonstrated a very rapid and strong impact on symptoms as well as endoscopic improvement.  Given its strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients suffering from moderate to severe Crohn's disease. While Crohn's disease approval marks the completion of the core indications, we believe Rinvoq revokes the potential to become a highly effective therapy in several additional important diseases. We recently began Phase III studies for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, hidradenitis, suprativa, and we remain on track to begin Phase III studies in alopecia areata later this year.  We'll also see later this year from a Phase II study in vitiligo, which could support advancement to Phase III in this indication as well. Moving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced positive top line results from our Phase III maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis. In this study, Skyrizi met the primary and key secondary end points at week 52 compared to the withdrawal arm, demonstrating that patients continuing treatment with Skyrizi maintain high levels of clinical remission as well as more stringent endpoints such as endoscopic improvement, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement and steroid-free remission. It's important to note that approximately 75% of the patients in this study had failed advanced therapy, including not only anti-TNFs, but also other biologics, JAK inhibitors and S1P modulators. This represents a very difficult-to-treat population in ulcerative colitis. Skyrizi's strong performance in patients with and without failure to advanced therapies including patients who were naive to advanced therapy demonstrate its utility across the spectrum of moderate to severe UC patients.  We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the third quarter with approvals anticipated in 2024. We also recently published results from a head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Otezla in patients with moderate psoriasis with Skyrizi demonstrating clear superiority to Otezla on all primary and ranked secondary endpoints at week 16 and 52. At week 52 of this study, 64% of patients achieved absolute skin clearance as measured by PASI 100 an SPGA clear compared to just 3% for Otezla, underscoring Skyrizi's ability to drive very high and durable responses in these moderate patients. In addition to higher clinical efficacy outcomes, the patients treat with Skyrizi which is a self-injectable administered quarterly reported improvements in health-related quality of life measures and greater treatment satisfaction compared to those treated with Otezla, which is an oral administered twice daily.  Additionally, Skyrizi demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability compared to Otezla. The rates of adverse events, including serious and severe AEs were numerically higher with Otezla than with Skyrizi treatment. Previous to -- similar to previous studies, Otezla treatment was associated with high rates of gastrointestinal distress such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, which resulted in a 7% discontinuation rate in the first 16 weeks of treatment compared to no discontinuations for Skyrizi patients. We're incredibly pleased with these results, which further underscores Skyrizi's position as the best in category treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, providing very high efficacy, durable responses a safe and tolerable profile and convenient quarterly administration. In oncology, we received accelerated approval in the U.S. for Epkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who had received two or more systemic therapies.  We also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. DLBCL is a very aggressive disease where later-line patients have limited options. We're extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients. In the quarter, we also announced positive top line results from the follicular lymphoma cohort of a Phase II trial evaluating Epkinly in patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. In this study, Epkinly performed very well as a monotherapy, demonstrating an overall response rate of 82%. We are pleased with these results and plan to discuss these data with regulatory agencies about the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval. Beyond the mid-stage studies supporting accelerated approvals in later lines of therapy.  We also have Phase III trials ongoing in earlier lines of DLBCL and for follicular lymphoma, and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. In our navitoclax program, we recently saw top line results from the Phase III TRANSFORM one trial, evaluating navitoclax in combination with ruxolitinib in for patients with treatment naive myelofibrosis. This study met the primary endpoint at week 24, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients who achieved complete volume reduction of at least 35% compared to rux plus placebo. For the primary endpoint, the navitoclax combination showed a doubling of improvement over rux alone with 63% of patients on the navitoclax combination achieving SVR35 compared to 32% in the rux plus placebo combination.  In this study, the navitoclax combination did not achieve the first ranked secondary endpoint, which was improvement in total symptom score at week 24. Additional follow-up data on SVR and TSS as well as other endpoints are expected in the fourth quarter of this year. We plan to wait for these more mature data before engaging with regulatory agencies in order to have a more comprehensive picture of the patient's clinical response and clinical benefit that navitoclax can provide. Looking to the remainder of this year. We remain on track for several additional data readouts from our late-stage oncology programs, including Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with t(114) mutation. As a reminder, this is an event-driven study, and we're just waiting -- we're waiting for just a handful of remaining events. So, we'd expect to have these data in-house in the coming months.  And we remain on track to see Phase II data for Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer in the fourth quarter. We're also making very good progress with several earlier line, earlier stage solid tumor programs. We recently initiated a Phase II study for ABBV-151, our anti-GARP antibody in hepatocellular carcinoma and plan to begin Phase II in several additional solid tumors over the course of the next 12 months. At the recent ASCO meeting, we presented promising initial results from a Phase I study evaluating our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400 in several advanced solid tumor types. We're seeing responses across multiple tumors, indicating broad activity. Results in late-line colorectal patients were particularly encouraging, where monotherapy treatment with 400 resulted in a confirmed overall response rate of 22% well in excess of standard of care, which is typically less than 2% to 3%.  We're also encouraged by the durability of response seen in these early results. These patients had an average of five prior lines of therapy, so this level of efficacy is very encouraging. Based on these results, we plan to start our Phase II program later this year, beginning with a second line colorectal cancer study. Now moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter, we received a positive CHMP opinion recommending approval of atogepant for migraine prevention. We anticipate a decision in the coming months. And if approved, atogepant would be the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. This is a debilitating condition that impacts tens of millions of people in Europe, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. Also, in the area of neuroscience, ABBV-916, our A-beta antibody for Alzheimer's disease is rapidly advancing to dose escalation studies. This antibody is demonstrating a long half-life and very low antidrug antibodies, both important attributes to achieve a best-in-class profile for our A-beta antibody. Dose selection in Phase II is expected to begin early next year. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application for Botox in masseter muscle prominence in China, which is the initial focus for our program given the prevalence of masseter muscle prominence in Asian populations and a significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. In our platisima prominence program for Botox, we remain on track to see data from two additional Phase III studies later this year with our regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of the year. So, in summary, we had a very productive first half of the year across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to the second half of 2023 with several important clinical and regulatory milestones. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. \nScott Reents: Thank you, Tom. I'm very pleased with the performance and outlook of the business, including the strong momentum from our ex-Humira growth plan. Starting with our second quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance and down 4.2% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.7% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect high single-digit sales growth from our growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 47% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.5% of sales, acquired IP R&D expense of 2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million, the adjusted tax rate was 15.8%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $53.4 billion, an increase of $1 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions with more than half of the sales improvement attributed to our ex-Humira growth platform. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $7.6 billion, an increase of $200 million due to continued strong performance across all approved indications. We now expect neuroscience sales of approximately $7.7 billion, an increase of $300 million, reflecting robust prescription growth for Vraylar following the MDD approval as well as better-than-expected performance of Botox Therapeutics and Qulipta. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.4 billion, an increase of $100 million, primarily reflecting momentum from Botox Cosmetic. Lastly, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, resulting in a sales guidance increase of $400 million based on volume trends and strong parity access. Moving to the P&L. We continue to anticipate adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales and now expect adjusted R&D expense of $6.9 billion, SG&A expense of $12.7 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. Turning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.7 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 40%. And rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.80 and $2.90. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered strong top and bottom line performance, and we are very pleased with the momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. \nLiz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions in the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or 2. Operator, we'll take the first question, please. \nOperator: Vamil Divan, Guggenheim Securities. . \nVamil Divan: So one, I'm just curious, given the strong quarter and the guidance raise, in terms of that you talked about your floor EPS, is that -- do you still see a floor of $10.70 or is it different? And can you talk anymore at this point or when you see that floor happening? And then my second question is around IRA, and you obviously a lot of focus there. I'm curious if you have any thoughts around what the first list of products around September 1. Are you expecting AbbVie products to be included in that first group of 10. And then infused just Rinvoq specifically and how you see that might be at risk from IRI, given you bring obviously a lot of life cycle development there. And is there a chance that a life cycle may not be quite as long? Or kind of how are you thinking about prioritizing investing in a small molecule like Rinvoq? \nRick Gonzalez : Vamil, this is Rick. I'll take the first question and then maybe Rob and I can also tag team on the first one and the second one as well. So if you look at the floor, if you step back and look at how the business is performing. Obviously, the business is performing extremely well. And a significant part of the over achievement is not the Humira business. In fact, of the $1.4 billion we're raising, as Scott said, only $400 million of it is Humira. So $1 billion of it is the growth platform. So all that speaks. We have very strong momentum going into 2024. And we talked before on these calls about, well, when will the trough year occur. And as you think about the floor, I think you have to sort of think about the trough year at the same time. We said in the past that if we significantly overachieved in 2023, that would increase the probability that the trough year was in 2024. And we said that in the backdrop of primarily thinking about it as Humira overachieving. And obviously, now what we're seeing that it's the majority of the other products that are overachieving the growth platform. So as we look at '24 and as we look at the trough, I think we have to let the year play out a little bit further to see where we're going. But I would say that we're feeling pretty -- we're feeling very good about '24. And the growth of that non-Humira business could more than offset the over performance that we're seeing this year, especially the over performance that we're seeing on Humira. So it's too early to raise the floor. But what I would tell you is the performance that we're seeing now gives us a tremendous amount of confidence of what '24 looks like. Rob, anything you'd add? \nRob Michael : I'd just add that we've now collectively raised revenue guidance by $1.4 billion, as Rick mentioned, we raised $400 million in the first quarter, $1 billion this quarter. When you look at it, it's really across the key therapeutic areas that will drive long-term growth. We've raised Skyrizi, aesthetics, neuroscience, and also Humira. So we do feel very good about the performance of the business. We've debated when we update the floor that will come at some point may not come until we actually give the Q4 guidance -- on the Q4 call of 2024 guidance, but as we look at it, the fundamentals of the business are very, very strong, and we're seeing performance across all of the therapeutic areas. \nRick Gonzalez : On your second question, IRA. I think it's very difficult to predict. In our planning assumptions, we have assumed for some products to be impacted here early on. Imbruca is obviously one product that we're looking at carefully. I would say it's right from how you would calculate it based on the data that we would have, it would be right on the bubble of where the cutoff would occur in those first 10 products. So it could be 10, it could be 9, it could be 11, depending upon how some other products. And I say it that way because remember, we're using the data that we have, we're not 100% sure that, that is the data that CMS is going to use. So there's not perfect clarity around it. But I would say that's one that we obviously have on the radar screen and we're looking at carefully. Anything you'd add, Rob? \nRob Michael : When IRA was passed a year ago, we obviously modeled the impact and we reaffirmed the long-term guidance expectation of high single-digit growth in the second half of this decade. That remains. We looked at what it means in terms of inflation penalties, party benefit redesign, negotiations. So we did make assumptions around that. I think Rick is correct in that there is still enough uncertainty we're going to know soon, right? September one is when they expect to announce the first list. We have modeled it, but we feel good even with IRA although it does have an impact -- has impacted everyone in the industry, we can still deliver on our long-term growth expectations. On your question -- and I think keep in mind, too, when you look at the Medicare percent of business for AbbVie. In the U.S., it's about 20%. Globally, it's a little bit lower, obviously. And so you look at us relative to our peers, we have a lower percent of the business as exposed to Medicare. And then when we look at specific at Rinvoq, you have to keep in mind with Rinvoq with indication expansion, the percent of sales you're talking about by the time it potentially be selected for negotiation, potentially in the later part of the decade, you're talking about something where like 10% to 12% because if you keep in mind, new indications, in many cases, serve younger patient population. And so that's the way we're looking at Rinvoq continuing to develop it. We obviously have a number of indications that could launch later in the decade. We feel very good about that. Those indications can collectively contribute a couple of billion dollars of revenue. We'll continue to drive that robust growth we expect from Rinvoq and Skyrizi as well. And so, we've modeled the impact of IRA, we don't expect it to impact the development plans for Rinvoq. \nLiz Shea: Thank you, Vamil. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Chris Schott, JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. I guess first, can you just elaborate in terms of what you're seeing with biosimilar Humira as we think about kind of the price and volume dynamics. I guess specifically, any surprises from your side in terms of how this is playing out? And then just any qualitative comments you can provide about how you see this kind of translating as we kind of think out to 2024? And then my second question was just on the Skyrizi updated guidance. Just a little bit more color on that $7.6 billion of at this point, how much is coming from psoriasis versus psoriatic arthritis versus this Crohn's launch that seems to be off to such a strong start. So just directional color of like the mix of the indications would be very helpful. Thank you.\nJeff Stewart: Yeah. Hi, Chris. It's Jeff. And I'll answer your first question. So in a nutshell, we haven't been surprised at any of the dynamics that we've seen play out, we've called it very, very accurately. So again, nothing that's really other than some small volume holding on a little bit better that's really different. So we're quite pleased with how our contracting and access has played out. And that parity access for Humira has been important. And again, it's what we believe would happen. We think it's good for patients, obviously, who can maintain their therapy with very little volatility, and it certainly provided us with a lot of predictability. And so I think we've managed sort of the first half with the Amgen launch and then the second half dynamics very, very well. And if you look to '24, as I've highlighted before, we do have 2-year agreements with some of our accounts. And we negotiated those in good faith, and we expect them to be honored. And remember, these are parity contracts for both '23 and '24 with Humira access coexisting with these multiple biosimilars. So I would say based on these dynamics, we're confident that Humira access will remain quite meaningful in 2024. And we know that as more biosimilars become established, we're also, as we've highlighted, appropriately planning for some volume loss in those certain so-called wax-sensitive accounts over time. So really no surprises in terms of what we've seen overall. So we're quite pleased. \nRob Michael: Chris, this is Rob. Just to give you some color, both in terms of the '23 guidance and the erosion assumptions around that, and then I'll talk about '24 briefly as well. In the first half of the year, obviously, the vast majority of that erosion came from price. We saw very little volume impact. But now with eight biosimilars on the market and some pursuing a low act strategy, we have assumed high single-digit volume erosion in the second half of the year, which would put the full year volume impact at mid-single digits. The rest of the 35% comes from prices we've negotiated those higher rebates and maintain strong parity access. Now while we're not providing '24 guidance today for U.S. Humira, it is reasonable to assume that there will be additional price erosion. Some will come from the annualization of the rebates that increased in the second half of this year and some will come from rebate increases negotiated for 2024 parity access. I'd also expect more volume erosion in '24, given the midyear entry of biosimilars this year, especially those that are pursuing a low act strategy. We've taken a close look at consensus estimates, analyst estimates have a very wide range the difference between the lowest estimate and the highest estimate approach is $4 billion. However, I'd say the average of those estimates appears to be a reasonable expectation for next year. Obviously, we'll give formal guidance likely on the Q4 call, which is our customary practice. But if you look at the average of those estimates, it should give you a good sense.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator? Oh, sorry. \nRob Michael: Yes. And then I'll take -- this is Rob on to your question on Skyrizi. So of the $200 million, it's split evenly between psoriatic $100 million and IBD a $100 million. So that $7.6 billion psoriatics, about $6.7 million, and IBD is around $900 million. Thanks Chris.\nLiz Shea: Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Mohit Bansal, Wells Fargo. \nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And congrats on the quarter. One clarification question and then one question. So clarification. So Rick, you mentioned that you think, like, again, at this point, you're not talking about increasing the floor, but you feel comfortable about the floor EPS range of $10.70. Is that fair to be in 2023 or '24, that's the first clarification question. And then second one is, when we talk to investors, they do feel comfortable about the ex-Humira portfolio. But one question that cuts up all the time is that, I mean, the lack of shiny object or pipeline beyond Skyrizi and Rinvoq. To the extent you agree with that assessment, how do you plan to mitigate that? Or is there anything in the pipeline that investors are missing at this point? Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. This is Rick. So as far as the $10.70, I would tell you that we feel highly confident in the $10.70. So there shouldn't be any concern there. And as I said, with how the growth platform is performing, we would expect to update at some point the floor. And obviously, by the way I'm saying it, the update would be in an upward direction. So hopefully, that gives some clarity around the floor.  And when you think about the pipeline, what I tell you about the way we operate is we design our investment in R&D to be able to deliver the kind of growth that we expect for the business over the long term, both short term and the long term. Our expectations of the business haven't changed. Our expectations are to build a strategy that allows this business to grow at the top tier and be able to do it over the long term and do it in a consistent way. And I'd say, as I look at our historical performance, we've obviously delivered on that. But as I look at forward-looking performance through the end of this decade and into the early part of the \u201830s, we're highly confident we can deliver high single-digit growth with the pipeline that we have now, and ultimately, with the assets that we have in the marketplace and how they're performing in the marketplace and their ability to be able to drive significant growth. And you see that in the performance that we're delivering now. If you look at the growth platform's growth in first quarter, and then look at it in the second quarter, it's accelerating at a very good pace, and it will continue to accelerate as we go through the rest of this year. And that once we get to a stable tail or relatively stable tail on Humira will be that growth that emerges to be able to drive the company, and that's what gives us such a high level of confidence. But I think when you look at our pipeline, certainly, we invested significantly in Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and that investment is paying off extremely well. We have a number of assets in our pipeline that will continue to help accelerate that growth as we move forward. So venetoclax for t114 and MDS are in samples of that. 951, we should do any submission and get that product on the marketplace. There\u2019s a huge need for that product in the marketplace. And a number of other assets, I won't go through every one of them. The rest of our investment in R&D has really been focusing on assets that are designed to be able to sustain our growth from 2030 - \u201840 forward. And so as I look at our pipeline, and I know you don't have as much visibility as we do, but when I look at our pipeline for things like the 400 platform and the cement platform that we have, the data we're seeing in CRC, non-small cell, that's a significant opportunity for us [indiscernible] is another significant opportunity for us. Our neuroscience portfolio is 916 and other assets is another significant opportunity for us that will emerge in that time frame. We have a next-generation BTK degrader that we're excited about. We have a second-generation BCL-2 that we're very interested in pursuing in multiple myeloma. And so there's a number of assets here that just haven't emerged to the point that you have clear visibility on all that data, but we do have visibility to where they're progressing. And so I think it's just hard for you to assess that earlier pipeline, but it's really designed to deliver on that long-term growth. So we're confident between now and the early \u201830s. And as that pipeline matures and the data comes out, three is another good example of where we have a lot of data now that is demonstrating that is probably best in class for a bispecific in myeloma. And so as that data emerges, you're going to get more visibility to it. And then obviously, we have the ability to go out and acquire things and we find things that we're interested in. \nLiz Shea: Okay. Thank you, Mohit. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Terence Flynn, Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn: Maybe a couple for me. Maybe Rick, just to follow-up on that last comment, maybe just an update on your M&A BD appetite here, particularly assets that can contribute more near term to growth? And then again, I want to see what you guys are hearing out there regarding the long-acting Botox competitor. It sounds like you're seeing stable market share, but any feedback on that product? \nRick Gonzalez : Okay. So M&A, I mean, obviously, we have a very active group who's constantly working in the area of business development. We're primarily focused in the areas that we operate in franchises. So think of things like immunology, neuroscience, certain areas of neuroscience, oncology, aesthetics, as an example, we constantly look at and then eye care would be, I would say, the key areas of focus.  As I said before, we don't need anything to be able to drive that high single digits. Obviously, if we can grow even faster, that's a good thing. I think all of us recognize that. If we find assets that are out there that are later-stage assets, and they fit our strategy and they fit the kind of target product profile that we would expect because we only look for assets that can significantly change standard of care. That's what we're good at. And so we evaluate lots of things, but many of them don't meet that threshold that we're looking for. But if we find something, we would obviously pursue it. If it was in an area that we thought we could maximize the value of it. And so, we'll continue to do that.  So like I said, I feel good about where we are and what we can drive, and I feel good about how we're looking at assets that are in the outside. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to be able to acquire assets that are out there. And as we've mentioned before, we obviously acquire larger assets. And so we continue to look at those. But they have to meet our criteria and they have to be able to deliver a good return to the business. On DAXI, I feel very good about how the team -- Harry and the team are performing against that. But I'll let Carrie actually describe to you how it looks. \nCarrie Strom : Thanks, Rick. So in terms of DAXI, it's been more than six months since their launch and the uptake has been quite limited from our perspective in the low single digits. So for context, as we benchmark our competitive launches. And you would benchmark this launch versus the most recent toxin to enter the U.S. market you would see it's tracking to about 25% of where another product would be at the same point in its launch. And in terms of customer feedback, we continue to hear that expectations are just not being met on duration, that expectations on the customer side and on the consumer side.  So we have yet to see impact on Botox share and Botox will continue to be the clear market leader as the other toxins compete for the number 2, 3, 4 position in our customers' offices. We are very pleased with the team's ability to execute on these competitive strategies here. And actually, their clear focus not only on the competitive strategies, but also on the broader focus and vision to grow the entire toxin market in the U.S., which we continue to see as biggest opportunity now and in the future. \nLiz Shea: Thank you, Carrie. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Evan Seigerman, BMO. \nEvan Seigerman: I wanted to just talk about kind of how you think about market share across the growth portfolio, specifically Skyrizi and Rinvoq kind of going forward. Is there a potential ceiling for them in one market share you can realize in these markets? Or maybe comment on some of the gating factors for market share growth in each of the patient provider or reimbursement agreements. \nJeff Stewart: Yes. Evan, it's Jeff. I'll take that one. One of the aspects that we have that I highlight and we look very carefully at, we look at both sort of in-play capture which I often refer to, for example, right now, the in-play capture for Skyrizi in psoriasis is about 50%. So we're capturing one out of every two patients. And our market share is about 32%, as I highlighted. So theoretically, as we study these markets that if there's not major innovation or major disruption that comes in place. And we really don't see that in psoriasis. You get such a high level of efficacy with Skyrizi, your market share, so the 32% starts to ramp up over time towards your in-play capture because you get the persistency effects and the fall off that take place in the market.  So really, when you look at that, I could say the same thing, for example, with Rinvoq. I mentioned that it's capturing 25% of second line plus in-play share. It has like a 3% market share. So in terms of the ability to sort of grow that market share over time, we really monitor that capture rate in the early years, and then you just sort of -- the in place sort of pulls up your market share over time. So that's why we're quite encouraged at the speed of the ramps that we're seeing there and the ability to move that market share.  Now when we study the models, you don't fully get there because typically, something else launches, time goes by. But we can feel very, very encouraged as we look at our in-play momentum that the market share starts to approach that over our long-range planning cycle. \nRick Gonzalez: The only other thing I would add, this is Rick, is with Otezla head-to-head. I would say currently, Skyrizi is not competing much against Otezla, which is a pretty sizable opportunity. And we're very pleased with this head-to-head data. So that will open up another pool of patients that today Skyrizi doesn't necessarily compete against. So that data will obviously allow us to be able to position it quite effectively against Otezla. \nLiz Shea: All right. Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Chris Raymond, Piper Sandler. \nChris Raymond: Just maybe a pipeline line of questioning here. Rick, I heard you mention maybe ABBV-951, but it wasn't in your prepared comments. Maybe -- I know you guys were saying you're working to respond to the CRL later this year with PDUFA in the first half. Is that still the case. And then maybe also on the pipeline. A couple of quarters ago, I think you guys talked about an interesting combo opportunity in IBD with that GLP-2 in-licensed, I think, from Scripps. Any updated thoughts here with this sort of mechanism as a combo agent? \nRoopal Thakkar: It's Roopal. I can take those. So for 951, the team is still on track for a resubmission this year, consistent with what you just stated. And in fact, we've launched in Japan, and there's already commercial patients receiving it. So the team is very excited about that. And what was described earlier. The unmet need is still quite high, and we still believe in a very strong profile in that asset.  Along the lines of combinations, as you mentioned, on GLP-2, we feel with something like Skyrizi, the data that we've seen in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis there's still potentially an opportunity to even increase endoscopic or mucosal healing even higher. We're seeing high ranges already 50%, 60%. And but we can still potentially go higher and something like a GLP-2 can directly address mucosal healing. So that could be a potential combo. There's other assets in our immunology pipeline that we are also considering for a combination. But when you have an asset like Skyrizi and the safety profile that we continue to observe that creates, I would say, multiple opportunities. \nTom Hudson: If I can just add, we didn't really opt in yet. Our collaboration with Caliber, which we expanded this week to more programs includes them doing a Phase Ia study which is almost finished. We're going to see the data and make that decision. It does fall into our -- part of our immunology program, which is in epithelial repair, which Roopal just mentioned. And so this is one of the assets which we think if you get a healthy gut to prepare that there will be in combination with immunomodulators will get a better response over time. We have another program called RIPK1, which also is involved in epithelial repair. So as multiple strategies, but this is one where we'll be making a decision and announcing a later time this year. \nLiz Shea: Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Steve Scala, TD Cowen. \nSteve Scala: A couple of questions. This morning, Takeda noted weakness in the U.S. GI market, and it seemed to be mainly on patient levels as opposed to competition. Wondering if you're seeing this and to what do you attribute it? So that's the first question. On the second question, on the Q1 call, the company said it would narrow the EPS range when it had clarity on biosimilar Humira and the landscape for that. So you narrowed that range today despite most biosimilars having been on the market for only three weeks, what do you know now that you didn't know when you reported in April that gives you the confidence to narrow the range today or is it all about the performance of the rest of the portfolio and really not about Humira?\nJeff Stewart: Yeah, hi Steve, it's Jeff. No, we don't see any slowdown in the IBD market. I mean this market has been just one of the highest growth markets we've seen from a CAGR perspective over many, many years. There's such unmet need. And so no, we're not seeing any patient slowdown. I would say, look, if we look at our particular data, I mean, you're seeing very fast ramps on this in-place share from Skyrizi and Crohn's disease. Now you're seeing an equally fast ramp in the early weeks from Rinvoq and Crohn's disease. And again, we're capturing up to 25% of the second line plus patients in ulcerative colitis. So I don't know what data Takeda is looking at, but we're seeing that the competitors in that space. And the leading competitors are Stelara and Entyvio and of course, our own Humira, but it's Stelara and Entyvio, they're under pressure in terms of incremental patient capture since our launch, and we'll continue to monitor. But we don't see any patient flow issues in the marketplace. \nRob Michael: And Steve, this is Rob. On your second question. I think it's a combination of both. We're seeing very strong performance from the ex-Humira growth platform, as you can see by the guidance raise, that's really a contributor. But now that we're beyond the middle of the year. We know the biosimilars that have entered the market, we know they're facing prices. We've maintained strong parity access. And so that also increased our confidence which is why we've narrowed the range to $0.20. But it's a combination of both the ex-Humira growth platform performing very strongly as well as where we sit today with biosimilar competition for Humira. \nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Carter Gould, Barclays. \nCarter Gould: Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on the quarter. I guess, two, acknowledging all your comments on the pipeline and previous comments on BD. Rick, was looking to get your thoughts on how the more assertive FTC here is limiting your target list on BD or your ability to complete deals? And then maybe just on Botox. Just was hoping for a little bit more color on the sustainability of the ex-U.S. trends versus maybe some of that demand getting pushed into the quarter after some of the shutdowns, COVID impacts and whatnot ex-U.S. Thank you.\nRick Gonzalez: Okay. So, I'll take the first question. Obviously, the FTC appears to be applying a lot more scrutiny to transactions. Having said that, I would say even before this happened, we would always evaluate an acquisition of a product or a company in the backdrop of what we thought the competitive environment would be our position in that market, meaning we didn't necessarily go out and try to do transactions that we thought would be extremely difficult from an FTC standpoint. So, I think the way we think about the FTC situation now is, look, it may require more time to get acquisitions through it may even require that you're willing to pursue litigation in order to get those through. But in the end, if your position is that what you're trying to do is not anticompetitive. You will be able to ultimately prevail in that process. And I think we're seeing that as some of these transactions go to court. Some not in our own industry, but in other industries, I think that's playing out. And so, I think ultimately, it will end up being more of a delay, but not something that staples your ability to do things that are appropriate to do. That's my perspective on it. Carrie? \nCarrie Strom: Sure. In terms of the aesthetics market internationally, like we said, we've been very pleased with the performance so far, and we expect to -- we continue to expect to see that type of strong performance through the rest of the year. We're continuing to invest in key growth markets like Japan and in markets like Brazil. And of course, China has become our second biggest market globally. And in China, in the first quarter, we did see significant growth as the market was reopening from COVID and some pent-up demand that came through in Q1 and early Q2. And now China has returned to normalized high growth rates. And so despite some economic pressures there, we really continue to see strong growth as we continue to invest and expand our promotional footprint there through field force, through injector training and our consumer efforts. And China will continue to be a really attractive market for us. Based on that commercial expansion and also, we're going to have a steady flow of new product launches throughout the decade in that market. One thing to note, which we did mention in our prepared remarks is that we do expect Q3 to be relatively flat internationally based on shipment timing from last year with that return to growth in Q4 and high single-digit growth for the full year internationally. \nRob Michael: And then, Carter, you were specifically asking about international Botox. I think if you just look at the run rate through the six months of the year, that's probably a good proxy for where we expect international Botox to land. We're holding strong share positions. Force is very, very good. So there's really no dynamic there. As Carrie mentioned, I mean you have to keep in mind that fillers a very large market for us, business for us internationally. We do have the Q3 dynamic. But when you look at the full year for international, that high single-digit growth, is certainly a way to think about the international business for aesthetics. \nLiz Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: David Risinger, Leerink Partners. \nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So I have two questions. Rick, you had mentioned that you're expecting stabilization of Humira sales at some point. Could you provide some perspective on when you might expect that? And then second, with respect to the filler franchise, obviously, it's performing strongly, could you discuss the prospects including the driver of weight loss drug patients seeking to compensate for facial hallowing? Thank you very much.\nRick Gonzalez: On the Humira tail, as Rob mentioned earlier, obviously, you have the annualization of the impact that we have this year, the second half annualization that's going to roll into '24. We're going to have further price erosion in '24, both based on the contracts that we have and how we're expecting the market to play out. And I'd say the pricing in the marketplace has been consistent with what our original assumptions were. So, I think the expectation you'll start to see stabilization of that tail in '25. And benefit operates similar to what we see in the international markets, which I think would probably be low at that point. it becomes relatively stable, I'd say, in '26 going forward. And it should be still a substantial tail that we maintain. But see less erosion pressure on it at that point. Carrie, do you want to talk a little bit about the Otezla impact? \nCarrie Strom: Sure. So, in terms of the filler opportunity and outlook, I guess, as that big -- I'll start -- I'll zoom out a little bit and just comment on that the filler market continues to be really attractive, especially internationally, as you've already seen here right now. with China driving some strong growth. And really some of the key Juvederm brand have just become available in China in the past few years, and we'll continue to have, like I said, a cadence of Juvederm launches in China. And then our increased investment all over the world and continues to drive our filler business and gives us a lot of optimism there internationally. Now in the U.S., we have said that the inflationary dynamics have impacted the U.S. market for filler and more than toxin just by the nature of the filler pricing and procedure. And also in terms of the patient journey patients tend to start on toxin before they add filler. And so, for all those reasons, we believe that the top -- the filler market will continue to improve in the second half of the year. although it will lag the toxin market recovery a bit. Now in terms of the question around Ozempic, we have been keeping an eye on that and how these weight loss products could have an impact on the aesthetics market. And what we see is that really anything that gets a consumer engaged in their appearance, including products like Ozempic are a positive tailwind for the aesthetics business. And we are hearing some customers say that these facial hollowing fillers or for -- that's a result of these products is an opportunity for fillers. We see that on social media. We're tracking it in other forms of media. And we think that like many other consumer trends around aesthetics, this will just continue to be a tailwind and the positive dynamic of the business. \nLiz Shea: Thanks, David Risinger. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Tim Anderson, Wolfe Research\nTim Anderson: Thank you. A couple of questions. How much uncertainty is there in terms of contracting in the I&I category in 2024 from a pricing standpoint for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And when will you be able to provide an update on how those pricing discussions are going for those two brands. So not the formal sales guidance for those products, but how the pricing discussions are going. And what is your expectation today for that level of price erosion in 2024 relative to what it's been in 2023? \nRick Gonzalez: Okay. So, I think Jeff and I will tag team this one. It's a great question because, look, I think we all know there has been some question out in the marketplace since the first quarter about I&I pricing. And so let me try to frame our perspective on the pricing because I think there's some misconception that's developed in the marketplace to some extent around I&I pricing. I guess the first thing I'd say to you, this is a market we know well. We've been in this market for a long time. We're obviously a leader in this market. So, it's a market we know extremely well. And obviously, we know any trend that's occurring in this market to a high degree of detail. And what I would tell you is that we see no fundamental change in the way pricing is being dealt with in this marketplace nor do we expect to see any fundamental change that occurs in the foreseeable future. So that brings me to the rebate question in the first quarter. And I would tell you that we're operating exactly the same way we have historically operated in this segment as it relates to rebating or discounting. When we get a new indication or a new product, one of the things that we evaluate is -- okay, what level of rebating should we do in order to maximize two things for the product. The speed at which we can drive the ramp and the ultimate peak sales that we can drive for that asset. We weigh those two things against how we look at contracting and getting on formulary. And so when you get an indication, you make a trade off. Do I want to be on formulator? I don't. If I do, I have to provide some level of incremental rebates. Is that a financially positive decision for the asset in the company. And if it is, we make that decision. And I would say that Skyrizi and Rinvoq are classic examples of that strategy. And I would say, look at how they're performing. We're going to grow those two assets despite the increased rebates, $3.5 billion this year. And that's a pretty good trade-off. I don't know, Jeff, anything you'd add? \nJeff Stewart: Yes. Maybe just to build on that point, Rick. I mean this fact base of seven indications in one year in one category with one firm, it's just -- it's really unprecedented. It's not going to happen again. And I think it's important to think about how it works. I mean, when you get a new indication and they're sequencing over time, you've got to clear the payer's P&T clinical committee, and they don't meet every day. They meet every couple of months. So there's a process there. And then you've got to be added to the formulary structure. So you either have to somehow gain a new spot by indication or replace a competitor. And that's not easy as well. And so that's why what we see in the marketplace. Many competitive firms have to offer these free or bridge programs and not just for a quarter or 2, sometimes there are multiple quarters or years until that access ramps. And I would say, in contrast, Rick, as you noted, on average, we achieved fully paid access for those seven indications in about 60 days, really, really unprecedented. So that means we had to give very little free goods we had almost immediate paid access and profit flow and then, of course, that rapid revenue accumulation that you highlighted. So definitely the right trade-off, and we don't see that recurring. \nRob Michael: And Tim, on your second question, I mean we've said this before, the high single-digit price impact this year is a function, again, as Jeff mentioned, seven new indications. We do not expect that type of price erosion going forward. It should not be what investors are modeling. So I wouldn't be concerned about high single-digit price erosion in '24. \nLiz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, we have time for one final question. \nOperator: And that will be from Geoff Meacham, Bank of America. \nGeoff Meacham: Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. On OUS Humira, you're obviously well past the initial biosimilar way, but you're still seeing some sequential decline. So what's the context here? And is there a dynamic that could impact Skyrizi or Rinvoq even indirectly OUS? And then on navitoclax, I know you guys have more details to come, but is there a threshold you're looking for and TRANSFORM one to move forward or even to inform development in other indications, just thinking about maybe the tolerability profile and the comps in that? \nRob Michael: So Jeff, this is Rob. I'll answer your question on International Humira. If you look at the '23 erosions, about $600 million it's really split in, I'd say, three buckets. About $300 million of it is new biosimilar markets, markets like Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico. Those are -- remember, we have additional waves coming in. So that's the next wave coming in so about half of it is that. And then I characterize about $200 million being really the impact of new agents like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, right? So you have agents that deliver higher standard of care, and so you're going to see share erosion just through that dynamic. And fortunately, we've brought forward our own products that do that. And so I'd say of that $600 million, $200 million is roughly that. And then in the international markets, you typically see some, I'd say, low to mid-single-digit price erosion, just typically year-over-year. So that's about another $100 million. So it's important to characterize it the right way. It's not so much markets that were biosimilar several years ago. It's more recent biosimilar markets, our own competition from our own agents as well as the typical price erosion you see in the international market. \nRoopal Thakkar: It's Roopal. I'll take the navitoclax question. So we'll continue to monitor the spleen volume reduction and see how that looks towards the end of the year. And if it maintains the high level that Tom described, that's something that definitely a positive. The other things that we'll get that will reveal themselves over the longer term as the marrow fibrosis and that, along with the spleen volume reduction and actually some of our earlier data may be correlative for survival events. So we'll get an early look at those. And then in terms of tolerability, what we've seen thus far is consistent with what we've seen initially, and it is a titratable dosing. So the clinicians can tailor in the study to what the patient needs. So more to come by year-end.  Liz Shea Okay. Thanks, Jeff. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us. \nOperator: As we are concluded.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rick Gonzalez",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 is an important year for AbbVie as we experience Humira biosimilar competition in the U.S. market, and as we execute our long-term diversification growth strategy. Now roughly seven months into the year, I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making against these objectives. The U.S. Humira biosimilar impact is playing out as projected and slightly better than our planning assumptions. We are competing very effectively with the various biosimilar offerings. We have exceeded our guidance in burst in second quarters with the overachievement predominantly driven by our growth platform, the base portfolio, excluding Humira which, as you know, is the critical driver in our rapid return to growth in 2025 and beyond. To that point, this platform demonstrated operational revenue growth of nearly 8% this quarter with growth expected to further accelerate in the second half of this year. We are also once again raising our full year revenue guidance by $1 billion, which is on top of the $400 million sales increase we delivered in the first quarter for a total overachievement of $1.4 billion. And lastly, we are making good progress with our pipeline, across all stages of development, including recent strong data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis as well as the recent U.S. approvals for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease and Epkinly in relapsed or refractory DLBCL, both important new therapies for patients. So in summary, I'm extremely pleased with the strong momentum and execution across the business. It reinforces our confidence in our ability to return to robust growth in 2025 with high single-digit compounded growth rate to the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob? Vamil, this is Rick. I'll take the first question and then maybe Rob and I can also tag team on the first one and the second one as well. So if you look at the floor, if you step back and look at how the business is performing. Obviously, the business is performing extremely well. And a significant part of the over achievement is not the Humira business. In fact, of the $1.4 billion we're raising, as Scott said, only $400 million of it is Humira. So $1 billion of it is the growth platform. So all that speaks. We have very strong momentum going into 2024. And we talked before on these calls about, well, when will the trough year occur. And as you think about the floor, I think you have to sort of think about the trough year at the same time. We said in the past that if we significantly overachieved in 2023, that would increase the probability that the trough year was in 2024. And we said that in the backdrop of primarily thinking about it as Humira overachieving. And obviously, now what we're seeing that it's the majority of the other products that are overachieving the growth platform. So as we look at '24 and as we look at the trough, I think we have to let the year play out a little bit further to see where we're going. But I would say that we're feeling pretty -- we're feeling very good about '24. And the growth of that non-Humira business could more than offset the over performance that we're seeing this year, especially the over performance that we're seeing on Humira. So it's too early to raise the floor. But what I would tell you is the performance that we're seeing now gives us a tremendous amount of confidence of what '24 looks like. Rob, anything you'd add? On your second question, IRA. I think it's very difficult to predict. In our planning assumptions, we have assumed for some products to be impacted here early on. Imbruca is obviously one product that we're looking at carefully. I would say it's right from how you would calculate it based on the data that we would have, it would be right on the bubble of where the cutoff would occur in those first 10 products. So it could be 10, it could be 9, it could be 11, depending upon how some other products. And I say it that way because remember, we're using the data that we have, we're not 100% sure that, that is the data that CMS is going to use. So there's not perfect clarity around it. But I would say that's one that we obviously have on the radar screen and we're looking at carefully. Anything you'd add, Rob? Okay. This is Rick. So as far as the $10.70, I would tell you that we feel highly confident in the $10.70. So there shouldn't be any concern there. And as I said, with how the growth platform is performing, we would expect to update at some point the floor. And obviously, by the way I'm saying it, the update would be in an upward direction. So hopefully, that gives some clarity around the floor.  And when you think about the pipeline, what I tell you about the way we operate is we design our investment in R&D to be able to deliver the kind of growth that we expect for the business over the long term, both short term and the long term. Our expectations of the business haven't changed. Our expectations are to build a strategy that allows this business to grow at the top tier and be able to do it over the long term and do it in a consistent way. And I'd say, as I look at our historical performance, we've obviously delivered on that. But as I look at forward-looking performance through the end of this decade and into the early part of the \u201830s, we're highly confident we can deliver high single-digit growth with the pipeline that we have now, and ultimately, with the assets that we have in the marketplace and how they're performing in the marketplace and their ability to be able to drive significant growth. And you see that in the performance that we're delivering now. If you look at the growth platform's growth in first quarter, and then look at it in the second quarter, it's accelerating at a very good pace, and it will continue to accelerate as we go through the rest of this year. And that once we get to a stable tail or relatively stable tail on Humira will be that growth that emerges to be able to drive the company, and that's what gives us such a high level of confidence. But I think when you look at our pipeline, certainly, we invested significantly in Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and that investment is paying off extremely well. We have a number of assets in our pipeline that will continue to help accelerate that growth as we move forward. So venetoclax for t114 and MDS are in samples of that. 951, we should do any submission and get that product on the marketplace. There\u2019s a huge need for that product in the marketplace. And a number of other assets, I won't go through every one of them. The rest of our investment in R&D has really been focusing on assets that are designed to be able to sustain our growth from 2030 - \u201840 forward. And so as I look at our pipeline, and I know you don't have as much visibility as we do, but when I look at our pipeline for things like the 400 platform and the cement platform that we have, the data we're seeing in CRC, non-small cell, that's a significant opportunity for us [indiscernible] is another significant opportunity for us. Our neuroscience portfolio is 916 and other assets is another significant opportunity for us that will emerge in that time frame. We have a next-generation BTK degrader that we're excited about. We have a second-generation BCL-2 that we're very interested in pursuing in multiple myeloma. And so there's a number of assets here that just haven't emerged to the point that you have clear visibility on all that data, but we do have visibility to where they're progressing. And so I think it's just hard for you to assess that earlier pipeline, but it's really designed to deliver on that long-term growth. So we're confident between now and the early \u201830s. And as that pipeline matures and the data comes out, three is another good example of where we have a lot of data now that is demonstrating that is probably best in class for a bispecific in myeloma. And so as that data emerges, you're going to get more visibility to it. And then obviously, we have the ability to go out and acquire things and we find things that we're interested in. Okay. So M&A, I mean, obviously, we have a very active group who's constantly working in the area of business development. We're primarily focused in the areas that we operate in franchises. So think of things like immunology, neuroscience, certain areas of neuroscience, oncology, aesthetics, as an example, we constantly look at and then eye care would be, I would say, the key areas of focus.  As I said before, we don't need anything to be able to drive that high single digits. Obviously, if we can grow even faster, that's a good thing. I think all of us recognize that. If we find assets that are out there that are later-stage assets, and they fit our strategy and they fit the kind of target product profile that we would expect because we only look for assets that can significantly change standard of care. That's what we're good at. And so we evaluate lots of things, but many of them don't meet that threshold that we're looking for. But if we find something, we would obviously pursue it. If it was in an area that we thought we could maximize the value of it. And so, we'll continue to do that.  So like I said, I feel good about where we are and what we can drive, and I feel good about how we're looking at assets that are in the outside. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to be able to acquire assets that are out there. And as we've mentioned before, we obviously acquire larger assets. And so we continue to look at those. But they have to meet our criteria and they have to be able to deliver a good return to the business. On DAXI, I feel very good about how the team -- Harry and the team are performing against that. But I'll let Carrie actually describe to you how it looks. The only other thing I would add, this is Rick, is with Otezla head-to-head. I would say currently, Skyrizi is not competing much against Otezla, which is a pretty sizable opportunity. And we're very pleased with this head-to-head data. So that will open up another pool of patients that today Skyrizi doesn't necessarily compete against. So that data will obviously allow us to be able to position it quite effectively against Otezla. Okay. So, I'll take the first question. Obviously, the FTC appears to be applying a lot more scrutiny to transactions. Having said that, I would say even before this happened, we would always evaluate an acquisition of a product or a company in the backdrop of what we thought the competitive environment would be our position in that market, meaning we didn't necessarily go out and try to do transactions that we thought would be extremely difficult from an FTC standpoint. So, I think the way we think about the FTC situation now is, look, it may require more time to get acquisitions through it may even require that you're willing to pursue litigation in order to get those through. But in the end, if your position is that what you're trying to do is not anticompetitive. You will be able to ultimately prevail in that process. And I think we're seeing that as some of these transactions go to court. Some not in our own industry, but in other industries, I think that's playing out. And so, I think ultimately, it will end up being more of a delay, but not something that staples your ability to do things that are appropriate to do. That's my perspective on it. Carrie? On the Humira tail, as Rob mentioned earlier, obviously, you have the annualization of the impact that we have this year, the second half annualization that's going to roll into '24. We're going to have further price erosion in '24, both based on the contracts that we have and how we're expecting the market to play out. And I'd say the pricing in the marketplace has been consistent with what our original assumptions were. So, I think the expectation you'll start to see stabilization of that tail in '25. And benefit operates similar to what we see in the international markets, which I think would probably be low at that point. it becomes relatively stable, I'd say, in '26 going forward. And it should be still a substantial tail that we maintain. But see less erosion pressure on it at that point. Carrie, do you want to talk a little bit about the Otezla impact? Okay. So, I think Jeff and I will tag team this one. It's a great question because, look, I think we all know there has been some question out in the marketplace since the first quarter about I&I pricing. And so let me try to frame our perspective on the pricing because I think there's some misconception that's developed in the marketplace to some extent around I&I pricing. I guess the first thing I'd say to you, this is a market we know well. We've been in this market for a long time. We're obviously a leader in this market. So, it's a market we know extremely well. And obviously, we know any trend that's occurring in this market to a high degree of detail. And what I would tell you is that we see no fundamental change in the way pricing is being dealt with in this marketplace nor do we expect to see any fundamental change that occurs in the foreseeable future. So that brings me to the rebate question in the first quarter. And I would tell you that we're operating exactly the same way we have historically operated in this segment as it relates to rebating or discounting. When we get a new indication or a new product, one of the things that we evaluate is -- okay, what level of rebating should we do in order to maximize two things for the product. The speed at which we can drive the ramp and the ultimate peak sales that we can drive for that asset. We weigh those two things against how we look at contracting and getting on formulary. And so when you get an indication, you make a trade off. Do I want to be on formulator? I don't. If I do, I have to provide some level of incremental rebates. Is that a financially positive decision for the asset in the company. And if it is, we make that decision. And I would say that Skyrizi and Rinvoq are classic examples of that strategy. And I would say, look at how they're performing. We're going to grow those two assets despite the increased rebates, $3.5 billion this year. And that's a pretty good trade-off. I don't know, Jeff, anything you'd add?"

            "name": "Roopal Thakkar",
            "content": "It's Roopal. I can take those. So for 951, the team is still on track for a resubmission this year, consistent with what you just stated. And in fact, we've launched in Japan, and there's already commercial patients receiving it. So the team is very excited about that. And what was described earlier. The unmet need is still quite high, and we still believe in a very strong profile in that asset.  Along the lines of combinations, as you mentioned, on GLP-2, we feel with something like Skyrizi, the data that we've seen in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis there's still potentially an opportunity to even increase endoscopic or mucosal healing even higher. We're seeing high ranges already 50%, 60%. And but we can still potentially go higher and something like a GLP-2 can directly address mucosal healing. So that could be a potential combo. There's other assets in our immunology pipeline that we are also considering for a combination. But when you have an asset like Skyrizi and the safety profile that we continue to observe that creates, I would say, multiple opportunities. It's Roopal. I'll take the navitoclax question. So we'll continue to monitor the spleen volume reduction and see how that looks towards the end of the year. And if it maintains the high level that Tom described, that's something that definitely a positive. The other things that we'll get that will reveal themselves over the longer term as the marrow fibrosis and that, along with the spleen volume reduction and actually some of our earlier data may be correlative for survival events. So we'll get an early look at those. And then in terms of tolerability, what we've seen thus far is consistent with what we've seen initially, and it is a titratable dosing. So the clinicians can tailor in the study to what the patient needs. So more to come by year-end.  Liz Shea Okay. Thanks, Jeff. And that concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Tom Hudson",
            "content": "Thank you, Carrie. We've continued to make very good progress with our pipeline over the quarter. We had a substantial amount of activity across our R&D pipeline, resulting in new approvals and advancements of several programs. In immunology, we received FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, marking its seventh FDA approval across gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology. In our Crohn's development program, Rinvoq demonstrated a very rapid and strong impact on symptoms as well as endoscopic improvement.  Given its strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients suffering from moderate to severe Crohn's disease. While Crohn's disease approval marks the completion of the core indications, we believe Rinvoq revokes the potential to become a highly effective therapy in several additional important diseases. We recently began Phase III studies for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, hidradenitis, suprativa, and we remain on track to begin Phase III studies in alopecia areata later this year.  We'll also see later this year from a Phase II study in vitiligo, which could support advancement to Phase III in this indication as well. Moving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced positive top line results from our Phase III maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis. In this study, Skyrizi met the primary and key secondary end points at week 52 compared to the withdrawal arm, demonstrating that patients continuing treatment with Skyrizi maintain high levels of clinical remission as well as more stringent endpoints such as endoscopic improvement, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement and steroid-free remission. It's important to note that approximately 75% of the patients in this study had failed advanced therapy, including not only anti-TNFs, but also other biologics, JAK inhibitors and S1P modulators. This represents a very difficult-to-treat population in ulcerative colitis. Skyrizi's strong performance in patients with and without failure to advanced therapies including patients who were naive to advanced therapy demonstrate its utility across the spectrum of moderate to severe UC patients.  We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the third quarter with approvals anticipated in 2024. We also recently published results from a head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Otezla in patients with moderate psoriasis with Skyrizi demonstrating clear superiority to Otezla on all primary and ranked secondary endpoints at week 16 and 52. At week 52 of this study, 64% of patients achieved absolute skin clearance as measured by PASI 100 an SPGA clear compared to just 3% for Otezla, underscoring Skyrizi's ability to drive very high and durable responses in these moderate patients. In addition to higher clinical efficacy outcomes, the patients treat with Skyrizi which is a self-injectable administered quarterly reported improvements in health-related quality of life measures and greater treatment satisfaction compared to those treated with Otezla, which is an oral administered twice daily.  Additionally, Skyrizi demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability compared to Otezla. The rates of adverse events, including serious and severe AEs were numerically higher with Otezla than with Skyrizi treatment. Previous to -- similar to previous studies, Otezla treatment was associated with high rates of gastrointestinal distress such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, which resulted in a 7% discontinuation rate in the first 16 weeks of treatment compared to no discontinuations for Skyrizi patients. We're incredibly pleased with these results, which further underscores Skyrizi's position as the best in category treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, providing very high efficacy, durable responses a safe and tolerable profile and convenient quarterly administration. In oncology, we received accelerated approval in the U.S. for Epkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who had received two or more systemic therapies.  We also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. DLBCL is a very aggressive disease where later-line patients have limited options. We're extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients. In the quarter, we also announced positive top line results from the follicular lymphoma cohort of a Phase II trial evaluating Epkinly in patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. In this study, Epkinly performed very well as a monotherapy, demonstrating an overall response rate of 82%. We are pleased with these results and plan to discuss these data with regulatory agencies about the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval. Beyond the mid-stage studies supporting accelerated approvals in later lines of therapy.  We also have Phase III trials ongoing in earlier lines of DLBCL and for follicular lymphoma, and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. In our navitoclax program, we recently saw top line results from the Phase III TRANSFORM one trial, evaluating navitoclax in combination with ruxolitinib in for patients with treatment naive myelofibrosis. This study met the primary endpoint at week 24, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients who achieved complete volume reduction of at least 35% compared to rux plus placebo. For the primary endpoint, the navitoclax combination showed a doubling of improvement over rux alone with 63% of patients on the navitoclax combination achieving SVR35 compared to 32% in the rux plus placebo combination.  In this study, the navitoclax combination did not achieve the first ranked secondary endpoint, which was improvement in total symptom score at week 24. Additional follow-up data on SVR and TSS as well as other endpoints are expected in the fourth quarter of this year. We plan to wait for these more mature data before engaging with regulatory agencies in order to have a more comprehensive picture of the patient's clinical response and clinical benefit that navitoclax can provide. Looking to the remainder of this year. We remain on track for several additional data readouts from our late-stage oncology programs, including Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with t(114) mutation. As a reminder, this is an event-driven study, and we're just waiting -- we're waiting for just a handful of remaining events. So, we'd expect to have these data in-house in the coming months.  And we remain on track to see Phase II data for Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer in the fourth quarter. We're also making very good progress with several earlier line, earlier stage solid tumor programs. We recently initiated a Phase II study for ABBV-151, our anti-GARP antibody in hepatocellular carcinoma and plan to begin Phase II in several additional solid tumors over the course of the next 12 months. At the recent ASCO meeting, we presented promising initial results from a Phase I study evaluating our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400 in several advanced solid tumor types. We're seeing responses across multiple tumors, indicating broad activity. Results in late-line colorectal patients were particularly encouraging, where monotherapy treatment with 400 resulted in a confirmed overall response rate of 22% well in excess of standard of care, which is typically less than 2% to 3%.  We're also encouraged by the durability of response seen in these early results. These patients had an average of five prior lines of therapy, so this level of efficacy is very encouraging. Based on these results, we plan to start our Phase II program later this year, beginning with a second line colorectal cancer study. Now moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter, we received a positive CHMP opinion recommending approval of atogepant for migraine prevention. We anticipate a decision in the coming months. And if approved, atogepant would be the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. This is a debilitating condition that impacts tens of millions of people in Europe, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. Also, in the area of neuroscience, ABBV-916, our A-beta antibody for Alzheimer's disease is rapidly advancing to dose escalation studies. This antibody is demonstrating a long half-life and very low antidrug antibodies, both important attributes to achieve a best-in-class profile for our A-beta antibody. Dose selection in Phase II is expected to begin early next year. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application for Botox in masseter muscle prominence in China, which is the initial focus for our program given the prevalence of masseter muscle prominence in Asian populations and a significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. In our platisima prominence program for Botox, we remain on track to see data from two additional Phase III studies later this year with our regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of the year. So, in summary, we had a very productive first half of the year across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to the second half of 2023 with several important clinical and regulatory milestones. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. If I can just add, we didn't really opt in yet. Our collaboration with Caliber, which we expanded this week to more programs includes them doing a Phase Ia study which is almost finished. We're going to see the data and make that decision. It does fall into our -- part of our immunology program, which is in epithelial repair, which Roopal just mentioned. And so this is one of the assets which we think if you get a healthy gut to prepare that there will be in combination with immunomodulators will get a better response over time. We have another program called RIPK1, which also is involved in epithelial repair. So as multiple strategies, but this is one where we'll be making a decision and announcing a later time this year."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom. I'm very pleased with the performance and outlook of the business, including the strong momentum from our ex-Humira growth plan. Starting with our second quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance and down 4.2% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.7% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect high single-digit sales growth from our growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 47% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.5% of sales, acquired IP R&D expense of 2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million, the adjusted tax rate was 15.8%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $53.4 billion, an increase of $1 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions with more than half of the sales improvement attributed to our ex-Humira growth platform. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $7.6 billion, an increase of $200 million due to continued strong performance across all approved indications. We now expect neuroscience sales of approximately $7.7 billion, an increase of $300 million, reflecting robust prescription growth for Vraylar following the MDD approval as well as better-than-expected performance of Botox Therapeutics and Qulipta. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.4 billion, an increase of $100 million, primarily reflecting momentum from Botox Cosmetic. Lastly, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, resulting in a sales guidance increase of $400 million based on volume trends and strong parity access. Moving to the P&L. We continue to anticipate adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales and now expect adjusted R&D expense of $6.9 billion, SG&A expense of $12.7 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. Turning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.7 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 40%. And rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.80 and $2.90. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered strong top and bottom line performance, and we are very pleased with the momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

            "name": "Jeff Stewart",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of $6.8 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi continues to perform exceptionally well. Global sales were approximately $1.9 billion, reflecting very strong operational growth of 51%. Our performance in psoriasis continues to be impressive. Total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market is now at 32%, double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. When you consider that Skyrizi is capturing roughly one out of two every in-play patient, which are either new to therapy or switching, there remains substantial opportunity for continued robust sales growth. And based on the available clinical data we are seeing from emerging competitive therapies in psoriasis, including orals, we feel very confident in Skyrizi's long-term potential with robust sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade. We are also seeing very nice prescription growth in psoriatic arthritis, especially in the U.S. dermatology segment where Skyrizi is approaching the leading new patient biologic market share. Skyrizi's momentum across psoriatic disease is very solid globally as well with total in-play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries. Turning now to IBD, where Skyrizi has demonstrated a very compelling clinical profile, including strong endoscopic data paired with convenient dosing. Uptake in Crohn's disease has been rapid, with total in-play patient share of approximately 25% in the U.S., roughly at parity leadership with Stelara. This uptake is very encouraging for Skyrizi's potential in ulcerative colitis, where we recently reported positive maintenance data with approval and commercialization anticipated next year. Given the momentum we are seeing across all of the approved indications, we will be raising our full year sales outlook for Skyrizi. Moving now to Rinvoq which delivered global sales of $918 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 57%. A key element of Rinvoq's success is its strong differentiation. It is now approved across seven distinct indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD as well as atopic dermatitis. It's the only potent daily oral medication with compelling head-to-head data against multiple novel therapies, including superiority to Humira in RA and Dupixent in AD. It's the only JAK inhibitor now approved to treat both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And we have established strong and broad commercial access for each of the core diseases with formulary coverage for Crohn's expected to ramp quickly over the next months. As it pertains to Rinvoq's book performance, we are seeing increasing prescriptions across each of the room indications globally, further market share momentum in atopic dermatitis, including now high-teens in-play patient share in the U.S. and robust uptake in IBD, where Rinvoq has demonstrated strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. Rinvoq is now capturing roughly one out of every four in-play ulcerative colitis patients in the second line plus setting. And the early data for Crohn's, which launched just in May, also shows a very strong ramp in new patient starts. We remained well positioned for continued momentum in this new indication as the only jack inhibitor approved to treat Crohn's disease.  This level of performance, along with the development of ongoing projects across several other diseases, such as giant cell arteritis and systemic lupus in rheumatology and multiple additional derm indications, reinforces the long-term potential for Rinvoq with strong sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade. Global Humira sales were $4 billion, down 24.8% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. remains slightly better than our expectations due to volume with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were approaching $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $907 million, down 20.8%, consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $571 million, up 15% on an operational basis with strong demand for both CLL and AML, and we are particularly pleased with the international performance here, following continued reimbursement progress in the EU and inclusion in China's national reimbursement list.  We also recently received the U.S. approval for Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL further expanding our on-market portfolio in hem onc. Early prescription trends have been encouraging, with a more robust opportunity expected as we progress development in earlier lines of therapy. We also anticipate approval and commercialization in Europe and Japan later this year. In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 14.2% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to exceed our expectations. Sales of $658 million were up 33.9% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications following the MDD approval late last year. Within migraine, we remain the clear market leader with unique treatment options for both acute and chronic conditions.  Our oral CGRP portfolio contributed $292 million in combined sales this quarter reflecting growth of more than 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $748 million, up 11.3% on an operational basis, reflecting nice momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. This franchise continues to outperform our expectations, and we will be raising our full year guidance for the collective neuroscience portfolio. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance and execution across the therapeutic portfolio with growth expected to accelerate through the second half of the year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? Yeah. Hi, Chris. It's Jeff. And I'll answer your first question. So in a nutshell, we haven't been surprised at any of the dynamics that we've seen play out, we've called it very, very accurately. So again, nothing that's really other than some small volume holding on a little bit better that's really different. So we're quite pleased with how our contracting and access has played out. And that parity access for Humira has been important. And again, it's what we believe would happen. We think it's good for patients, obviously, who can maintain their therapy with very little volatility, and it certainly provided us with a lot of predictability. And so I think we've managed sort of the first half with the Amgen launch and then the second half dynamics very, very well. And if you look to '24, as I've highlighted before, we do have 2-year agreements with some of our accounts. And we negotiated those in good faith, and we expect them to be honored. And remember, these are parity contracts for both '23 and '24 with Humira access coexisting with these multiple biosimilars. So I would say based on these dynamics, we're confident that Humira access will remain quite meaningful in 2024. And we know that as more biosimilars become established, we're also, as we've highlighted, appropriately planning for some volume loss in those certain so-called wax-sensitive accounts over time. So really no surprises in terms of what we've seen overall. So we're quite pleased. Yes. Evan, it's Jeff. I'll take that one. One of the aspects that we have that I highlight and we look very carefully at, we look at both sort of in-play capture which I often refer to, for example, right now, the in-play capture for Skyrizi in psoriasis is about 50%. So we're capturing one out of every two patients. And our market share is about 32%, as I highlighted. So theoretically, as we study these markets that if there's not major innovation or major disruption that comes in place. And we really don't see that in psoriasis. You get such a high level of efficacy with Skyrizi, your market share, so the 32% starts to ramp up over time towards your in-play capture because you get the persistency effects and the fall off that take place in the market.  So really, when you look at that, I could say the same thing, for example, with Rinvoq. I mentioned that it's capturing 25% of second line plus in-play share. It has like a 3% market share. So in terms of the ability to sort of grow that market share over time, we really monitor that capture rate in the early years, and then you just sort of -- the in place sort of pulls up your market share over time. So that's why we're quite encouraged at the speed of the ramps that we're seeing there and the ability to move that market share.  Now when we study the models, you don't fully get there because typically, something else launches, time goes by. But we can feel very, very encouraged as we look at our in-play momentum that the market share starts to approach that over our long-range planning cycle. Yeah, hi Steve, it's Jeff. No, we don't see any slowdown in the IBD market. I mean this market has been just one of the highest growth markets we've seen from a CAGR perspective over many, many years. There's such unmet need. And so no, we're not seeing any patient slowdown. I would say, look, if we look at our particular data, I mean, you're seeing very fast ramps on this in-place share from Skyrizi and Crohn's disease. Now you're seeing an equally fast ramp in the early weeks from Rinvoq and Crohn's disease. And again, we're capturing up to 25% of the second line plus patients in ulcerative colitis. So I don't know what data Takeda is looking at, but we're seeing that the competitors in that space. And the leading competitors are Stelara and Entyvio and of course, our own Humira, but it's Stelara and Entyvio, they're under pressure in terms of incremental patient capture since our launch, and we'll continue to monitor. But we don't see any patient flow issues in the marketplace. Yes. Maybe just to build on that point, Rick. I mean this fact base of seven indications in one year in one category with one firm, it's just -- it's really unprecedented. It's not going to happen again. And I think it's important to think about how it works. I mean, when you get a new indication and they're sequencing over time, you've got to clear the payer's P&T clinical committee, and they don't meet every day. They meet every couple of months. So there's a process there. And then you've got to be added to the formulary structure. So you either have to somehow gain a new spot by indication or replace a competitor. And that's not easy as well. And so that's why what we see in the marketplace. Many competitive firms have to offer these free or bridge programs and not just for a quarter or 2, sometimes there are multiple quarters or years until that access ramps. And I would say, in contrast, Rick, as you noted, on average, we achieved fully paid access for those seven indications in about 60 days, really, really unprecedented. So that means we had to give very little free goods we had almost immediate paid access and profit flow and then, of course, that rapid revenue accumulation that you highlighted. So definitely the right trade-off, and we don't see that recurring."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Second quarter global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.4 billion up 2.9% on an operational basis with strong performance from our international portfolio offsetting the economic impact in the U.S. U.S. aesthetic sales were $829 million, down 6.2%. Our U.S. portfolio continues to perform well from a competitive perspective. And as expected, the aesthetics markets continued to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures, which weighed on year-over-year growth rates. U.S. Botox cosmetic sales were $420 million, a decline of 6.5% versus the prior year. While the U.S. cosmetic toxin market declined low single digits in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, growth rates improved through the quarter, with June showing a return to positive year-over-year market growth.  Botox Cosmetic continues to be the clear market leader, maintaining strong and stable share despite new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $125 million, down 14.5% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see a more pronounced impact from inflationary dynamics on higher-priced, more deferrable procedures such as Filler. The U.S. Filler market declined approximately 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic metrics that we track for the U.S. have largely stabilized. Our consumer market research shows a meaningful recovery from last summer and those intending to get treated with toxins and fillers.  Additionally, we have now lapped the beginning of the market downturn, which occurred in the second quarter of last year. Based on these factors, we expect growth rates for the U.S. facial injectables to improve in the second half of this year. Our international aesthetics portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well with strong results in many key markets. Second quarter sales were $555 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 20%. The International Botox cosmetic sales of $265 million increased approximately 14% on an operational basis and International Juvederm sales were $243 million, up approximately 28% on an operational basis. Growth in the Asia Pacific region, particularly robust as aesthetic treatment rates in China have fully recovered to pre-COVID levels.  We continue to anticipate strong normalized growth through the remainder of the year in China. We are very pleased with the strong performance of our international aesthetics portfolio over the first half of the year and continue to expect similarly strong results in the second half. In the third quarter, we will be facing a challenging year-over-year comparison due to a shipment timing benefit we saw in the third quarter of 2022. This is expected to result in relatively flat growth for our international portfolio in the third quarter. On a full year basis, we expect our international aesthetics sales to grow high single digits. We continue to invest to drive future growth for our aesthetics portfolio with a focus on enhanced promotional activities, improve digital products and services through our Alle platform, sales force expansion, and injector training.  We continue to invest in our pipeline as well, and we remain committed to a regular cadence of new product introductions and indication expansions for Botox cosmetic and Juvederm. We recently announced the FDA approval of SkinVive, the first hyaluronic acid filler in the U.S. for improved skin smoothness of the cheeks, which, along with the recently launched Volux filler for jawline contouring, will help sustain our leadership position in the U.S. filler market. Our investments will allow us to maintain a strong leadership position in the highly underpenetrated and rapidly growing global aesthetics markets.  We remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio and continue to expect to deliver greater than $9 billion in 2029. In the near term, the improving aesthetics outlook in the U.S. and continued robust international performance gives us confidence to once again raise our full year aesthetics guidance with an expectation for continued operational growth over the back half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thanks, Rick. So in terms of DAXI, it's been more than six months since their launch and the uptake has been quite limited from our perspective in the low single digits. So for context, as we benchmark our competitive launches. And you would benchmark this launch versus the most recent toxin to enter the U.S. market you would see it's tracking to about 25% of where another product would be at the same point in its launch. And in terms of customer feedback, we continue to hear that expectations are just not being met on duration, that expectations on the customer side and on the consumer side.  So we have yet to see impact on Botox share and Botox will continue to be the clear market leader as the other toxins compete for the number 2, 3, 4 position in our customers' offices. We are very pleased with the team's ability to execute on these competitive strategies here. And actually, their clear focus not only on the competitive strategies, but also on the broader focus and vision to grow the entire toxin market in the U.S., which we continue to see as biggest opportunity now and in the future. Sure. In terms of the aesthetics market internationally, like we said, we've been very pleased with the performance so far, and we expect to -- we continue to expect to see that type of strong performance through the rest of the year. We're continuing to invest in key growth markets like Japan and in markets like Brazil. And of course, China has become our second biggest market globally. And in China, in the first quarter, we did see significant growth as the market was reopening from COVID and some pent-up demand that came through in Q1 and early Q2. And now China has returned to normalized high growth rates. And so despite some economic pressures there, we really continue to see strong growth as we continue to invest and expand our promotional footprint there through field force, through injector training and our consumer efforts. And China will continue to be a really attractive market for us. Based on that commercial expansion and also, we're going to have a steady flow of new product launches throughout the decade in that market. One thing to note, which we did mention in our prepared remarks is that we do expect Q3 to be relatively flat internationally based on shipment timing from last year with that return to growth in Q4 and high single-digit growth for the full year internationally. Sure. So, in terms of the filler opportunity and outlook, I guess, as that big -- I'll start -- I'll zoom out a little bit and just comment on that the filler market continues to be really attractive, especially internationally, as you've already seen here right now. with China driving some strong growth. And really some of the key Juvederm brand have just become available in China in the past few years, and we'll continue to have, like I said, a cadence of Juvederm launches in China. And then our increased investment all over the world and continues to drive our filler business and gives us a lot of optimism there internationally. Now in the U.S., we have said that the inflationary dynamics have impacted the U.S. market for filler and more than toxin just by the nature of the filler pricing and procedure. And also in terms of the patient journey patients tend to start on toxin before they add filler. And so, for all those reasons, we believe that the top -- the filler market will continue to improve in the second half of the year. although it will lag the toxin market recovery a bit. Now in terms of the question around Ozempic, we have been keeping an eye on that and how these weight loss products could have an impact on the aesthetics market. And what we see is that really anything that gets a consumer engaged in their appearance, including products like Ozempic are a positive tailwind for the aesthetics business. And we are hearing some customers say that these facial hollowing fillers or for -- that's a result of these products is an opportunity for fillers. We see that on social media. We're tracking it in other forms of media. And we think that like many other consumer trends around aesthetics, this will just continue to be a tailwind and the positive dynamic of the business."

            "name": "Rob Michael",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. AbbVie delivered excellent results once again this quarter. We are demonstrating strong execution across our business with each of our five key therapeutic areas beating expectations. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance with the vast majority of the beat coming from our ex Humira growth platform. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive growth with sales for both therapies up more than 50% versus the prior year. These two agents have achieved differentiated clinical profiles, including head-to-head data versus Humira and other novel therapies. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are now collectively approved across 10 large indications, and we are forecasting combined revenue growth of more than $3.5 billion this year. With ongoing programs in several additional disease areas, we expect both Skyrizi and Rinvoq to deliver robust growth into the next decade and significantly exceed Humira peak revenue. U.S. Humira is also performing well. The first half erosion coming in better than our expectations due to volume. We have been carefully analyzing the biosimilar marketplace, where the total number of competitors has now expanded to 8. While many of these biosimilars have been added to payer formularies, Humira continues to maintain strong parity access. Based on the volume trends and parity access, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, an improvement of two points versus our original guidance. Neuroscience is another area that is outperforming expectations. Based on the current run rate, this portfolio is now on pace to add more than $1 billion of incremental revenue this year. with continued strong growth from Vraylar as well as our leading migraine portfolio. In aesthetics, the outlook continues to improve. We delivered positive growth this quarter, driven by strong international performance and stabilizing trends in the U.S. These positive trends give us the confidence to once again raise our full year guidance for aesthetics. And as a clear market leader, we are focused on expanding the aesthetics category with increased commercial investment and continued innovation to support robust long-term growth. Given the strong and balanced performance across our diverse portfolio, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. In closing, our operational execution has been outstanding, and we are very well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2023 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? I'd just add that we've now collectively raised revenue guidance by $1.4 billion, as Rick mentioned, we raised $400 million in the first quarter, $1 billion this quarter. When you look at it, it's really across the key therapeutic areas that will drive long-term growth. We've raised Skyrizi, aesthetics, neuroscience, and also Humira. So we do feel very good about the performance of the business. We've debated when we update the floor that will come at some point may not come until we actually give the Q4 guidance -- on the Q4 call of 2024 guidance, but as we look at it, the fundamentals of the business are very, very strong, and we're seeing performance across all of the therapeutic areas. When IRA was passed a year ago, we obviously modeled the impact and we reaffirmed the long-term guidance expectation of high single-digit growth in the second half of this decade. That remains. We looked at what it means in terms of inflation penalties, party benefit redesign, negotiations. So we did make assumptions around that. I think Rick is correct in that there is still enough uncertainty we're going to know soon, right? September one is when they expect to announce the first list. We have modeled it, but we feel good even with IRA although it does have an impact -- has impacted everyone in the industry, we can still deliver on our long-term growth expectations. On your question -- and I think keep in mind, too, when you look at the Medicare percent of business for AbbVie. In the U.S., it's about 20%. Globally, it's a little bit lower, obviously. And so you look at us relative to our peers, we have a lower percent of the business as exposed to Medicare. And then when we look at specific at Rinvoq, you have to keep in mind with Rinvoq with indication expansion, the percent of sales you're talking about by the time it potentially be selected for negotiation, potentially in the later part of the decade, you're talking about something where like 10% to 12% because if you keep in mind, new indications, in many cases, serve younger patient population. And so that's the way we're looking at Rinvoq continuing to develop it. We obviously have a number of indications that could launch later in the decade. We feel very good about that. Those indications can collectively contribute a couple of billion dollars of revenue. We'll continue to drive that robust growth we expect from Rinvoq and Skyrizi as well. And so, we've modeled the impact of IRA, we don't expect it to impact the development plans for Rinvoq. Chris, this is Rob. Just to give you some color, both in terms of the '23 guidance and the erosion assumptions around that, and then I'll talk about '24 briefly as well. In the first half of the year, obviously, the vast majority of that erosion came from price. We saw very little volume impact. But now with eight biosimilars on the market and some pursuing a low act strategy, we have assumed high single-digit volume erosion in the second half of the year, which would put the full year volume impact at mid-single digits. The rest of the 35% comes from prices we've negotiated those higher rebates and maintain strong parity access. Now while we're not providing '24 guidance today for U.S. Humira, it is reasonable to assume that there will be additional price erosion. Some will come from the annualization of the rebates that increased in the second half of this year and some will come from rebate increases negotiated for 2024 parity access. I'd also expect more volume erosion in '24, given the midyear entry of biosimilars this year, especially those that are pursuing a low act strategy. We've taken a close look at consensus estimates, analyst estimates have a very wide range the difference between the lowest estimate and the highest estimate approach is $4 billion. However, I'd say the average of those estimates appears to be a reasonable expectation for next year. Obviously, we'll give formal guidance likely on the Q4 call, which is our customary practice. But if you look at the average of those estimates, it should give you a good sense. Yes. And then I'll take -- this is Rob on to your question on Skyrizi. So of the $200 million, it's split evenly between psoriatic $100 million and IBD a $100 million. So that $7.6 billion psoriatics, about $6.7 million, and IBD is around $900 million. Thanks Chris. And Steve, this is Rob. On your second question. I think it's a combination of both. We're seeing very strong performance from the ex-Humira growth platform, as you can see by the guidance raise, that's really a contributor. But now that we're beyond the middle of the year. We know the biosimilars that have entered the market, we know they're facing prices. We've maintained strong parity access. And so that also increased our confidence which is why we've narrowed the range to $0.20. But it's a combination of both the ex-Humira growth platform performing very strongly as well as where we sit today with biosimilar competition for Humira. And then, Carter, you were specifically asking about international Botox. I think if you just look at the run rate through the six months of the year, that's probably a good proxy for where we expect international Botox to land. We're holding strong share positions. Force is very, very good. So there's really no dynamic there. As Carrie mentioned, I mean you have to keep in mind that fillers a very large market for us, business for us internationally. We do have the Q3 dynamic. But when you look at the full year for international, that high single-digit growth, is certainly a way to think about the international business for aesthetics. And Tim, on your second question, I mean we've said this before, the high single-digit price impact this year is a function, again, as Jeff mentioned, seven new indications. We do not expect that type of price erosion going forward. It should not be what investors are modeling. So I wouldn't be concerned about high single-digit price erosion in '24. So Jeff, this is Rob. I'll answer your question on International Humira. If you look at the '23 erosions, about $600 million it's really split in, I'd say, three buckets. About $300 million of it is new biosimilar markets, markets like Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico. Those are -- remember, we have additional waves coming in. So that's the next wave coming in so about half of it is that. And then I characterize about $200 million being really the impact of new agents like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, right? So you have agents that deliver higher standard of care, and so you're going to see share erosion just through that dynamic. And fortunately, we've brought forward our own products that do that. And so I'd say of that $600 million, $200 million is roughly that. And then in the international markets, you typically see some, I'd say, low to mid-single-digit price erosion, just typically year-over-year. So that's about another $100 million. So it's important to characterize it the right way. It's not so much markets that were biosimilar several years ago. It's more recent biosimilar markets, our own competition from our own agents as well as the typical price erosion you see in the international market."

[Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. \nElizabeth Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman and President; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President, Allergan aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer.\n Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\n On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. \nRichard Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2023. With first quarter total revenues and adjusted earnings per share both exceeding our expectations. This performance was driven by double-digit sales growth from several key products, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta and Vraylar. Positive momentum from our aesthetics business with strong results internationally and stabilizing consumer trends in the U.S. and in line performance from U.S. Humira where biosimilar erosion is tracking as expected with much of the impact driven by price.\n Since our inception, we have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in highly attractive markets, including immunology, hematological oncology, neuroscience and aesthetics. Our commercial execution, including the launch of new products and expanded indications has been outstanding, especially across Skyrizi and Rinvoq and recently with Vraylar and MDD. Each of these assets are expected to contribute significant revenue growth over the decade. The breadth and the depth of our R&D pipeline also supports our long-term growth outlook and we anticipate numerous important pipeline milestones over the next 2 years.\n In summary, we are 1 quarter into the U.S. biosimilar event for Humira and are managing the erosion well. Most importantly, our growth platform is demonstrating strong performance, exceeding our expectations. We are executing well across all aspects of our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob? \nRobert Michael: Thank you, Rick. We're off to an excellent start in 2023 with each of our 5 key therapeutic areas meeting or exceeding our first quarter expectations, a testament to the strength of our broad portfolio. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations.\n First quarter results include continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which remain on track to contribute more than $11 billion in combined sales this year. Growth rates in the first quarter for both products are consistent with our full year expectations.\n Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating momentum across all approved indications and we expect to round out their opportunities in IBD later this year. This includes Rinvoq's anticipated U.S. approval in Crohn's disease as well as Skyrizi's European launch in Crohn's and its global regulatory submission in UC.\n We are also performing exceptionally well in neuroscience. Total net revenues this quarter were nearly $200 million above our guidance with Vraylar sales accelerating following MDD approval and migraine delivering strong growth. As a result, we will be increasing our full year outlook for neuroscience.\n Aesthetics is also performing better than expected. We are seeing positive recovery trends in China and some stability in the U.S. market, where we are closely monitoring several economic indicators that correlate with aesthetics procedures, including consumer confidence, personal consumption and Google searches. Although it's still early in the year, these positive trends, especially across our international markets, give us the confidence to increase our full year outlook for aesthetics as well. This continues to be an underpenetrated market with significant growth potential.\n Based on our robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.72 and $11.12.\n In closing, I'm extremely pleased with the performance of our diverse portfolio. We're off to a strong start to the year, which further reinforces our confidence in the long-term outlook of the business.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? \nJeffrey Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I'm very pleased with the strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. Immunology delivered total revenues of approximately $5.6 billion with continued robust double-digit growth from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Skyrizi global sales were nearly $1.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 46%, despite retail inventory destocking in the quarter. Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market with a total prescription share now at 30%.\n In psoriasis, Skyrizi has set a very high bar relative to other therapies on the market or in development with differentiated attributes across the categories that physicians and patients deem most important. This includes the rapid onset of action after the first dose, nearly complete skin clearance with multifold higher rates on PASI 90 and PASI 100. High durability of response, which we have demonstrated can increase over time as well as quarterly dosing for maintenance therapy, a convenient alternative to daily oral or more frequently administered injectables. With a nearly 50% U.S. in-play share of new and switching patients, there is substantial room for Skyrizi's continued growth in psoriasis.\n This best-in-class profile is supporting strong momentum now in psoriatic arthritis with Skyrizi achieving an in-play biologic share of roughly 20% in the U.S. dermatology segment. Skyrizi is also being co-positioned with Rinvoq in the U.S. room segment in PSA where we are seeing increasing utilization among rheumatologists as well. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved in-play psoriatic disease leadership in more than 25 countries and total market share leadership in nearly 20 of those key markets.\n In Crohn's disease, we are seeing very fast adoption of Skyrizi in the U.S., with a total in-play patient share at approximately 20%, second only to STELARA. Feedback from gastroenterologists is very positive, especially as it relates to Skyrizi's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We see strong uptake in Japan and Canada as well with the European launch forthcoming.\n We also recently reported strong induction data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which Tom will discuss momentarily. Based on the results of that trial, it is increasingly clear that Skyrizi represents a differentiated asset across inflammatory bowel disease and we look forward to bringing this potential new indication to physicians and patients next year.\n Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $686 million, reflecting operational growth of more than 50% despite similar retail inventory destocking in the quarter. I'm very pleased with the performance in rheumatology with total prescriptions increasing across each of the 4 approved indications. Atopic dermatitis is also tracking in line with our expectations. We continue to see market share momentum globally, including in-play patient share increasing to approximately 17% in the U.S.\n We are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology. Rinvoq has set a high bar for efficacy in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, demonstrating strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. We're seeing very strong momentum in UC, where adoption has been robust. Rinvoq is now achieving a 23% in-play share in the U.S. second-line plus setting, reflecting an impressive ramp since our launch in UC less than 1 year ago. This accelerated adoption among gastroenterologists is very encouraging for Rinvoq's pending outlook in Crohn's. We are currently launching this indication in the EU, a geography where Rinvoq is the only JAK approved to treat both IBD conditions, and we remain on track for CD approval and commercialization in the U.S. later this quarter with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the back half of this year.\n So we see inflammatory bowel disease continues to be an area of high unmet need. Having 2 novel therapies in IBD with Skyrizi and Rinvoq that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy is an important step forward for patients. And with these 2 complementary assets, we are very well positioned to compete against other oral or biological agents.\n Global Humira sales were approximately $3.5 billion, down 24.3% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. remains in line with our expectations with most of the impact driven by price.\n Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.4 billion with continued pressure on Imbruvica, partially offset by robust double-digit growth with Venclexta. Imbruvica global revenues were $878 million, down 25.2% due to increasing competition and the cumulative impact of a suppressed market. Venclexta global sales were $538 million, up 17.5% on an operational basis with strong momentum across both AML and CLL.\n In neuroscience, revenues were approximately $1.7 billion, up 15% on an operational basis. Vraylar is performing exceptionally well. Sales of $561 million were up 31.3% on an operational basis, above our expectations. We are very pleased with the AMDD label and the launch, which has resulted in a significant uplift in total new prescriptions for Vraylar. With a dedicated sales force that calls on both psychiatrists and primary care as well as ramping DTC promotion, we see an opportunity for accelerated growth across all approved indications. And we will be raising our full year guidance for Vraylar accordingly.\n Within migraine, we remain uniquely positioned with a portfolio to support complete migraine freedom. Our leading oral CGRP therapies contributed $218 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 45% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. We recently expanded the label for Qulipta, which is now uniquely positioned as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine further strengthening our competitive profile.\n Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $719 million, reflecting strong performance in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance across the therapeutic portfolio.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? \nCarrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. First quarter Global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.3 billion, which came in ahead of our guidance, primarily due to a faster reopening in China as well as a slightly stronger economy in the U.S. versus our planning assumption. In the U.S., aesthetics sales were $777 million, down 8.1% as we continue to see softness in aesthetics procedures related to inflationary dynamics. As a reminder, we saw a very robust performance for our U.S. performance in the first quarter of 2022, which created difficult comparison for growth in the first quarter of this year.\n U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $409 million, down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see a lesser impact from inflationary dynamics on Botox Cosmetic compared to other areas of our aesthetics portfolio due to its relatively lower price point and large install base of loyal repeat consumers.\n The U.S. cosmetic toxin market was down low single digits in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Botox Cosmetic continues  be the clear market leader and its share of the U.S. toxin market remains stable.\n Sales for our U.S. Juvederm collection were down 18% as our dermal filler portfolio continues to be impacted by inflationary pressure on consumer spending. The U.S. filler market was down nearly 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains the clear market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic pressure on our U.S. dermal filler business is partially offset in the quarter by strong initial uptake for our recently launched Volux filler, which is approved for the improvement of jawline definition. We expect Volux combined with the upcoming launch of our skin quality injectable [ Skinvive ] to support long-term growth for our filler portfolio in the U.S.\n While the aesthetics category in the U.S. continues to be challenged due to the fast economy, the key external economic metrics that we track have remained relatively consistent with year-end 2022 levels.\n Our international aesthetics portfolio continues to demonstrate robust growth with strong performance in Japan, which is rapidly growing and China, which is recovering faster than expected. Sales from our international aesthetics portfolio were $523 million, up 7.8% on an operational basis. International Botox Cosmetics sales grew approximately 17.5% operationally, and international Juvederm sales were down approximately 1.4% on an operational basis. China, which is our second largest market, was negatively impacted by COVID in January and February, but experienced a sharp recovery in March. We expect this level of activity to be sustained throughout the remainder of the year.\n Recall, our original guidance assumed we would not reach a full recovery until the second half of this year. And in Japan, which is an underdeveloped market and proving to be very responsive to promotion, we continue to make significant investments in injector training, our field force and consumer education. Overall, we are pleased with how our team has been executing through this dynamic environment and remain encouraged by improving trends internationally and stabilization across our U.S. portfolio. These positive trends and continued strong momentum give us the confidence to increase the full year outlook for our aesthetics business.\n Longer term, we remain extremely confident in our ability to grow the aesthetics business and continue to expect to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion by the end of this decade. Aesthetics continues to be an extremely attractive underpenetrated market and our proven ability to drive consumer demand and develop a strong base of loyal customers as well as bring innovative new products to the market will support robust growth over the long term.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. \nThomas J. Hudson: Thank you, Carrie. We've continued to make very good progress with our pipeline to start this year. In immunology, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, making it the first JAK inhibitor approved for this indication. We continue to anticipate FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease next month. We also recently announced positive top line results from our Phase III induction study for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which is a disease with unpredictable symptoms and frequent players making it challenging to manage.\n In our study, Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary end points demonstrating a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement. We're particularly pleased with Skyrizi's impressive performance on the more stringent measures in this trial with approximately 37% of Skyrizi-treated patients achieving endoscopic improvement compared to 12% of patients on placebo. This level of efficacy has the potential to position Skyrizi as a highly effective therapy, and we believe it will be a welcome new treatment option for physicians and patients once approved. Detailed data from this induction study will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting. We expect to see data from the Phase III maintenance study in the second quarter with our regulatory submissions planned for the second half of the year.\n In oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our hematology and solid tumor pipelines. We remain on track for several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approval for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory in multiple myeloma patients with a t(1114) mutation and navitoclax's TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. And Phase II data for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support a regulatory submission for accelerated approval.\n We're also beginning to see very encouraging data for our next-generation c-Met ADC, which uses a more potent Topol payload than our Teliso-V ADC. Based on the data we've seen to date for ABBV-400 in our Phase I solid tumor basket study, we plan to expand the program to earlier lines in colorectal cancer as well as evaluate in other tumors where c-Met is expressed, including pancreatic and liver cancer.\n Moving to our neuroscience pipeline, where we've recently received FDA approval for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine, making it the only oral CGRP antagonist approved for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our Phase III study, Qulipta provided a significant reduction in migraine days as well as significant improvements in function and quality of life in patients with chronic migraine, a common and debilitating disease. As a highly effective oral treatment option, we believe Qulipta will be well positioned in a chronic migraine prevention market. In Europe, we continue to anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine.\n Turning now to ABBV-951. We announced that we received a complete response letter for our regulatory application in the U.S. The FDA has not asked for additional efficacy or safety studies related to our drug delivery -- drug device delivery system, but rather they have requested additional information regarding the pump as well as updates to instruction for use. We are working to generate the necessary information, and we expect to respond to the CRL later this year with an FDA action anticipated in the first half of '24.\n In international markets, we've recently received approval for 951 in Japan, and we continue to expect approval in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.\n In our early-stage neuroscience pipeline, we recently began Phase I studies of our selective D3 dopamine receptor agonist, ABBV-932. Our experience with Vraylar has highlighted the potential clinical benefit of achieving D3 selectivity, and we believe that a compound that more selectively engages the D3 dopamine receptor has the potential to provide enhanced efficacy. Our program will initially focus on general anxiety disorder with the potential to expand to other neuropsychiatric disorders.\n The programs under our collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. We now have 4 assets in clinical trials, including 2 PTPN2 inhibitors in Phase I in oncology. Our eIF2B activator for neurodegenerative diseases and an IGF-1 signaling pathway modulator that will be explored in aging-related diseases. Our most advanced program is the eIF2B activator 7262. The first patient was recently enrolled in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a Phase II/III study conducted by the HEALEY Center for ALS at Mass General. This trial is designed to evaluate multiple therapies simultaneously with a goal to accelerate the development of potential breakthrough treatments for ALS.\n Now I'd like to provide a brief update on 2 earlier stage programs in our therapeutic pipeline. In cystic fibrosis, we recently analyzed data from an ongoing proof-of-concept study, evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results from this interim analysis did not meet our criteria for advancing and we are discontinuing our cystic fibrosis program.\n We also recently reviewed interim data from our exploratory studies for ABBV-154 in PMR in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the RA study, while we observed efficacy with 154, we also observed some changes in biomarkers that are consistent with systemic steroid exposure at the higher doses. The benefit risk profile does not sufficiently differentiate 154 from other available treatments. So based on the totality of the data across RA, PMR and Crohn's disease studies, we will not be pursuing further development of this asset.\n Now moving to our aesthetics pipeline. We recently saw data from our Phase III studies for Botox in platysma prominence and masseter muscle prominence. In our study for prominent neck muscles, Botox met all primary and secondary endpoints demonstrating a significant reduction in the unwanted appearance of platysma prominence on the neck and jaw line. This was the first of 3 Phase III studies in platysma prominence with data from the 2 remaining trials expected in the second half of the year, followed by regulatory submission in the U.S. near the end of 2023.\n Botox also performed very well in our study for prominent masseter muscles, meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial. Our program is initially focused on China and other Asian markets as masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. Based on the results from this trial, we expect to submit our regulatory application in China in the second half of the year. Once approved, we anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication, which will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment.\n So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones throughout the remainder of 2023.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. \nScott Reents: Thank you, Tom. I will discuss our most recent financial results and guidance. Starting with our first quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottom line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance and down 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 45% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 13.6% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.4% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million. The adjusted tax rate was 13.7%.\n Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.72 and $11.12. This earning per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $52.4 billion, an increase of $400 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions. We now expect Vraylar sales of approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting strong prescription growth following the MDD approval. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting the better-than-expected recovery in China and stable economic trends in the U.S.\n Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.5 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of 27%. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 48.5% of sales. We are modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.90 and $3. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\n In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations.\n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. \nElizabeth Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to 1 or 2. Operator, first question, please. \nOperator: Our first question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn: Great. Maybe 2 for me. Just on immunology, can you quantify the amount of destocking for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq in the quarter? I think Biogen on their call spoke to some tighter working capital requirements at wholesalers due to rising interest rates. So just wondering if you're seeing something similar here and just to want to be sure that it's not a pricing dynamic. And then can you elaborate at all about your ALS program when we might see some data there? \nRobert Michael: Terence, it's Rob. So on the retail inventory destocking, we do typically see this in the first quarter, so it wasn't a complete surprise. In fact, it was factored into our guidance. We did beat our guidance in immunology for the quarter. The impact was high single digits, both for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In terms of absolute value, we're talking about around $70 million for Skyrizi and $30 million for Rinvoq. \nJeffrey Stewart: And it's Jeff. Just to clarify on your wholesale comment, I think, as Rob highlighted, it's in the retail. So it's in the specialty pharmacy channel. And you'll recall, as you know, there's about 18 specialty pharmacies that basically distribute the I&I products, and there are some big ones there. So it was not a wholesaler dynamic. It was a retail inventory dynamic, which, again, as these products get bigger, we do see and contemplate in our projections. \nRobert Michael: And then Terence, this is Rob. Just to more broadly answer the question that I'm sure many investors have. If you look at the growth in the quarter, so overall, U.S. demand was up just north of 60% for Rinvoq and Skyrizi. We saw very strong performance across all approved indications, as Jeff highlighted. We did have the 2 partial offsets, one being the retail inventory destock, which I've already quantified. And then price was down high single digits and that's really driven by rebate increases, which is typical when we see the type of volume increase.\n And we saw Skyrizi sales up 80% last year, Rinvoq in the U.S. up 40% last year. So when you see that kind of volume growth and couple that with the number of indications we had approved, we had 5 new indications for Rinvoq and 2 for Skyrizi. So it was something we were contemplating. It was factored into our guidance, but I don't know that The Street fully appreciated that in terms of the first quarter estimates that were put out there. \nThomas J. Hudson: This is Tom for the ALS question. I'd say about 2 years, we had to recruit the patients and there's about a year of follow-up that is needed. So I would say, late '24, early '25, all depends on the enrollment, which I understand is starting off on a good pace. \nElizabeth Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. \nSteve Scala: A couple of questions. Some of your peers have called out co-pay resets early in the year that have led to more modest performances in products such as Dupixent and Cosentyx. AbbVie has been less vocal on this point. How much was that a factor? Or are Skyrizi and Rinvoq different in some way? And then secondly, despite the solid performance in Q1, the EPS guidance range continues to be very wide. What factors would have to play out for you to hit the high end of that and the low end of that? \nJeffrey Stewart: Yes, Steve, it's Jeff, and thanks for the question. I'll take the co-pay one. Look, I mean, some of the peers are seeing the effects of the so-called maximizer programs or even some of the lingering accumulator programs which do sometimes as benefit designs are reset in the first quarter can apply some pressure. We don't see that. We've been managing that very tightly. And we're not seeing any significant sort of surge or creep in terms of that dynamic. The dynamic is exactly what Rob had highlighted, which is the modest price based on the number of indications and how fast the volume is moving and this destocking event that we talked through. So co-pay is very stable for AbbVie. \nRobert Michael: And Steve, this is Rob, on your EPS range question. We've typically given a $0.20 range; this year, we gave a $0.40 range. And the key driver of that is obviously the U.S. Humira dynamics. As we see that play out, particularly in the second half, we would typically tighten that range. Now keep in mind, that $0.20 wider range represents about 1% of U.S. Humira growth. So it's not as wide as you might think. But we did widen it given the dynamics of U.S. Humira. And I think we'll be able to give you more color as we see those 7, 9 biosimilars coming in the market in the middle of the year. We'll have more clarity for you on the second quarter call. \nElizabeth Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Schott: Just coming back to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I think you mentioned high single-digit price erosion beyond just those inventory changes. I guess is that a reasonable assumption to think about price as we progress through the rest of this year? And then maybe longer term, should we think about that level of price erosion as more like a onetime kind of issue this year given all the new indications and a more stable trend going forward? I'm just trying to kind of get my hands around the pricing a little bit more.\n And my second question was on the aesthetics business. You obviously saw a very strong 1Q. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on your confidence in the sustainability of these trends? I know the market has been a little bit bumpy, but it seems like the tone is that you're encouraged with the trends you're seeing. But just how much, I guess, visibility you have in terms of sustainability of those favorable international trends we're seeing right now? \nRobert Michael: Chris, this is Rob. So on your question on price, yes, the way to think about 2023 price for the year for Skyrizi and Rinvoq would be down high single digits. Now we wouldn't expect high single digits to be the rate going forward given a big driver was the number of new indications that we launched. And so I would expect that to moderate over time.\n Carrie? \nCarrie Strom: This is Carrie. In terms of your questions around the aesthetics market, there are 2 key assumptions for the 2023 planning. One was around the U.S. economy and the other was around the recovery in China. When you think about the U.S. economy, we look at Q1 and we see some favorability to our planning assumptions with the metrics that we track, which Rob mentioned, include real personal consumption expenditure and Google.\n And so in January and February, we saw favorability there. Although in March, there are some potential signs of softening. So we continue to have a cautious outlook for our U.S. business for the rest of the year. The way to think about market growth for the full year would be low -- for toxins, the market would be down low to mid-single digits until we lap the 2022 downturn, which happened around May. And then after that, we would expect flat market growth for the rest of the year. So that's how we think about the U.S.\n Our other -- our second biggest market is China. And recall, we had assumed that the aesthetics market in China would not recall -- would not fully recover until the second half of the year. Well, in actuality, what we saw was although January was significantly impacted, in February, we started to see improvement. And in March, there was a really steep recovery that we do expect will sustain through the rest of the year. And in other markets around the world, I guess, in Canada and U.K., we are seeing some high inflation impacting consumer demand, but the rest of Europe seems stable right now. \nElizabeth Shea: Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. \nMohit Bansal: I have one clarification and one question. So clarification is regarding the price decline for I&I. You said that high single digit, but should we assume like going forward, year-over-year, we should -- versus volumes, should we assume high single-digit decline still going forward for at least for rest of the quarter and then more stable pricing quarter-over-quarter term, just that clarification.\n And the question is, regarding the I&I pipeline, so you have a leadership position with Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and they are growing. But some of the pipeline products like 154 and 157 did not pan out as you were hoping them to. So what is -- how should we think about the pipeline strategy beyond these 2 products? And can you even do M&A given the increased FTC scrutiny nowadays? \nRichard Gonzalez: So this is Rick. I'll cover number two and maybe just touch on number one. If you think about our pipeline, obviously, as we look at Skyrizi and Rinvoq, they clearly have restated the immunology market across most of the segments that we operate in. We view those assets as being able to drive strong growth through the early part of the next decade.\n Having said that, we're continuing to look for assets in areas where we believe there's still a significant opportunity to restate standard of care. And we obviously explore, as everyone in this industry does many different assets and different mechanisms to try to find those kinds of mechanisms that will deliver that kind of performance. It's interesting. When you look at the 154 platform, it did exactly what we thought it would do from the standpoint of efficacy. But it did it in a way only at the highest dose and at that highest dose, we did see it -- some effects of steroids on some of the biomarkers. And based on the way we think regulators would look at a label for those kinds of products, we didn't believe that would be a competitive profile.\n But the hypothesis certainly worked around the mechanism. So we continue to look for opportunities. We have lots of runway here to be able to get to those, but we do desire to find some additional mechanisms that will be the follow-on products that should be introduced hopefully near the end of this decade or early into the next decade as the next-generation immunology assets for AbbVie. So -- and I feel good about the progress that we're making there. We're continuing to explore a number of other areas. And we're continuing to look both internally and externally at different assets that we can bring into the company to be able to do that.\n To your question of being able to bring assets into this market, we don't believe that we would be encumbered because immunology is a very crowded space from a competitive standpoint. And that's one of the most important criteria that you look at from an FTC standpoint. So we believe we have freedom to operate across most of those segments from an FTC standpoint as well.\n And on price, maybe Rob and I will tag team this one to make sure it's clear. It is common that when you go out and you add indications in this industry, that when you negotiate those contracts to be able to get access, it does require some level of price concession. I would say we're on the lower end of what you typically would have seen with the speed at which we got access for Skyrizi and Rinvoq for those indications and the breadth of that access. And so we certainly would expect this year and last year to be the areas where you saw the most significant amount of price because those are the years that we added the majority of the indications, you would expect that to moderate.\n So then going forward, the way to think about it is, then it's only really driven by volume at that point. And volume typically requires much more modest kinds of price as you go forward. It's not 0 price. You shouldn't have that expectation. But I would not have an expectation of high single digits going forward.\n Anything you'd add, Rob? \nRobert Michael: Just to answer the question, Mohit, on the gating. Yes, I think it's safe to assume that you'll see high single-digit price in each of the quarters this year. \nElizabeth Shea: Thank you, Mohit. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. \nAlice Nettleton: This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. So a question on PBMs, which are under renewed scrutiny. If there were material changes to the rebating structure currently in place, would that put big incumbent products at risk because it might remove the so-called rebate wall? And more generally, do you think there is any chance of some of the proposed legislative changes actually becoming law? And then secondly, any collateral impact you're seeing on Skyrizi or Rinvoq since Humira biosimilars have launched? And given the overlapping indications, do you think that you'll start to see some picking off of patients from these 2 brands to biosimilars in the second half of the year? \nJeffrey Stewart: Yes, it's Jeff. I'll give some comment on that. I think the way that we think about our brands is the first place that we look at is how distinctive they are. I mean we've got 4 head-to-head trials with Skyrizi and another one on the way where we can clearly differentiate the product. And we have many as well on Rinvoq. So we've really thought about it from a development standpoint. And I would say the perspective is somehow there was a restructuring of the PDMs, which I don't think is imminent. And the rebate sort of approach disappeared. It disappears for everybody. I mean all of these I&I products have a fairly reasonable rebate load and there would be a different basis of competition, which we would do very, very well. So we're not concerned about sort of a fundamental structural change relative to these 2 products, which are very distinctive.\n If we look at your second part of your question, which is it's really the same answer, which is we don't see that there are going to be significant impacts of Humira biosimilars on the performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And one perspective, let's take Rinvoq is sort of a very simple way of thinking about it. It's already in the United States, a step behind TNF and it's performing at that level because you see such expansion of second and third lines in that space. And Skyrizi is very, very distinctive. So no, in the second half, we do not anticipate sort of a knock-on effect of the emergent biosimilars to our 2 core brands. \nElizabeth Shea: Thanks, Alice. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. \nCarter L. Gould: Maybe a different spin on sort of the BE question there, just given sort of the volatility in the marketplace, as you kind of have those conversations or engage with potential targets. Just if you've seen a shift in sort of that bid-ask spread and the willingness of boards and management to consider deals. Any update on that front would be helpful. \nRichard Gonzalez: This is Rick. I'd say the environment hasn't changed materially in the last 24 months from my perspective. I still think it's certainly more difficult to raise money for biotech companies. So it probably makes them a bit more willing to engage with players like us or engage in a process, if they're at a point where they've generated data that makes them attractive. But I'd say the interest level in that engagement is similar to what has been for the last 12 to 24 months. And there's a lot of opportunity to be able to find assets that are in the biotech area. The question is you have to find the right kind of asset and you have to find one that's attractive and meet your needs. And I'd say being able to negotiate a transaction, I think, is a reasonable probability.\n I'd say prices are still relatively high. And so valuations for good assets tend to go at a pretty high level. So again, it's got to be an asset that can demonstrate that it's going to provide significant value to justify that kind of a valuation and a return. But we continue to look for opportunities. And I think as we find those kinds of opportunities, as I've said in the past, we're certainly going to pursue them. \nElizabeth Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. \nVamil Divan: Maybe a couple from me as well. So one, just a couple of data points you have coming up this year that I think may be a little bit less focused on is on Navitoclax and Teliso-V. So maybe you can just sort of frame so what we should be looking for, what your expectations are, what you're hoping to see from those assets, especially Teliso-V given your comments on the sort of next-gen ABBV-400?\n And then the other question, I guess, would be for Rick and is more on succession planning. I know we've talked -- you've mentioned before that your plans to stick around through the Humira bench. I'm just wondering if you have any sort of updated sort of thoughts around timing on that now that we're in the middle of this process. We've been getting some questions there, too. Is this something we should expect some sort of announcement this year? Or is it more -- are you're looking for 2024 or later? \nRoopal Thakkar: It's Roopal. I'll take the ones on Navitoclax and Teliso-V. So for Navitoclax, it's the combination with the JAK2 in myelofibrosis. And there, we're looking to be better than monotherapy with JAK2 in that space and improving spleen size and symptoms like abdominal pain, fullness, fever, fatigue. Also, perhaps uniquely, what we've observed is also an improvement in bone marrow fibrosis and a decrease in variant allelic frequency. So that's what we would be looking for, and we should get a readout by midyear or so.\n For Teliso-V, in lung cancer, EGFR wild type with high c-Met and that's the indication where we have breakthrough therapy designation. Around the end of this year, I would say that's where we would see a readout. What we've seen in earlier data cuts is an ORR above 50%, which is quite a bit higher than what would be expected in standard of care in that second, third line setting. And if the data looks strong, there's a potential that we could submit next year for an accelerated approval. \nRichard Gonzalez: I'll take the second question. And maybe I'll make a little bit of a comment on Teliso-V because I think you mentioned 400. I think the early data that we're seeing in 400 is impressive to us. There's no question about it. And I think we're going to have some data presented at this ASCO, right, where you'll have an opportunity to see that in CRC.\n Now having said that, Teliso-V, as Roopal said, does get very good responses in c-Met highs. But to get a broader set of c-MET population, we do believe you need to move to the Topol warhead and seems to get deeper responses and more durable responses.\n Data has to play out over time, but it appears to be a very good platform for c-MET. And so we need the data to mature, and we need to develop more data in that area. But I'd say the early data is pretty encouraging. You'll have a chance to see a snippet of that at this ASCO.\n As far as leadership changes, I'd say it's similar to what we've said in the first quarter or fourth quarter, I can't recall, last year around succession. We obviously have a process in place. We have a very experienced board. I've had many, many discussions with the Board about succession. The Board knows I'm committed to be here to ensure a successful and smooth transition. The criteria that we're operating against is we need to completely get through the transition for Humira biosimilars here in the U.S.\n I'd say, so far, I'm pretty pleased with how the transition is going. And I'm even more pleased with the way the growth platform is operating right now. And in fact, if you look at it this year, the growth platform is going to deliver mid-single digits and it's going to do it despite the headwinds that we see on Imbruvica and the headwinds that we're seeing from the economy on aesthetics. Once the aesthetics business returns to its normal growth rates and much of the pressure on Imbruvica starts to subside, we should see that growth rate increase significantly as we move into '24 for the growth platform.\n And obviously, returning to robust growth in '25 and deliver high single digit from that point forward. So that's the expectation that we're working against. So we want to make sure that the business is operating the way we want it to. We want to make sure that we're through the biosimilar erosion to the point that we believe it is predictable.\n And then obviously, the second part of the criteria is ensuring that the candidate that will succeed me is ready to do that. We can make a successful transition. I've also told the Board that I'm willing to stay in any capacity that they would desire for whatever length of time they would. I think the expectation right now is that I would assume the Executive Chairman role for a period of time to finish the transition to the new CEO. You should not be expecting that, that transition is going to occur in '23. \nElizabeth Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. \nEvan Seigerman: Just on kind of Skyrizi and some of the dynamics you're seeing there, can you characterize about kind of how you're thinking about further penetration in the psoriasis indication, kind of some puts and takes in the dermatology market? And just a follow-up on the CF program, is it safe to assume that you're totally done investing in this area? Or do you have other assets kind of in earlier development that could emerge? \nJeffrey Stewart: Yes. It's Jeff. I'll take your comment on psoriasis. I think that, as I mentioned, it's -- the share is very, very impressive. So we have a 30% total market share now which is really putting significant headroom against any other drug in that category by a lot. And one way to think about it is, I think what you're asking is how much further can it run? And it can run quite a bit further. To some degree, if you think about it, so we're capturing on the dynamic share roughly 50%. So 1 out of every 2 patients. And our market share is about 30.\n So theoretically, over time, right, unless there's some disruption, which we don't see significant disruption in the market, your total market share is going to move towards that in-play share. Now that takes many, many years. But as we look at the fundamental momentum that we can achieve, it's still very, very significant. Add on to that, that basically, we're still in the rest of the world, starting to really see the PSA ramp. And remember, PSA has a very significant impact because it's treated by derms and it was sort of the last remaining gap that we had, so you're going to see continued momentum in the international markets and the U.S. market and we have a long way to run.\n And I'd be remiss if I didn't say how fast again that we're growing in both Crohn's right now and very exciting data in UC. And that market is very, very dynamic. So we feel very secure in our ability to continue to create a lot of value with Skyrizi. \nThomas J. Hudson: This is Tom. Regarding the question on our triplet program, yes, we are -- our C2 corrector that we just tested did not work. This was not our first attempt that producing one and we do not have another backup. So we don't have other options than to discontinue the CF program. \nElizabeth Shea: Thanks, Evan. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse. \nCarson Wong: This is Carson on for Trung. Just on Imbruvica, how confident are you for the [ 5.7 ] hem-onc guide given the significant competitive pressures there? I mean I understand Brukinsa did particularly have legs in the U.S. until late January. What level of pricing pressures can we expect through the year? And is there a potential for further step downs in your guide for later in the year? And if you do that, could the trough be pushed out given the delay with 951 as well? \nJeffrey Stewart: Yes. It's Jeff. And I think we think that's a very good call. And just as a reminder, we're not seeing significant pricing pressure in the market. This is really two effects, which is one, the cumulative effect as we've highlighted over the suppressed market over time, which looks to be normalizing. Actually, for the first time in 3 years, we actually saw a positive growth in the market. So that's encouraging.\n The big driver is the share -- is the new patient share, which has been under pressure, initially under pressure by Calquence certainly from our own Venclexta and then the recent Brukinsa launch. And so when we put all of that into the calculus, we think we've got it right and it's probably unlikely that we're going to see any significant step down that would put that in jeopardy. \nRobert Michael: Carson, this is Rob. I'll answer your second question. So I wouldn't consider Imbruvica in 951 to be variables that would push the trough out. It's really more about how the overall year plays out, particularly the second half with U.S. Humira. So if U.S. Humira does better and we outperform in '23, then we could see the trough in '24. I think the important thing to keep in mind is regardless of when the trough occurs, we wouldn't expect earnings to fall below the [ 1074 ex-IPR&D ]. That's really what I would focus on, and we don't consider Imbruvica in 951 delays to be variables that would push that trough. \nElizabeth Shea: Thanks, Carson. We are cognizant of a number of peers reporting today. And so in the interest of time, we have one last question. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Susan ] on for Geoff Meacham. We had a follow-up on Imbruvica. Do you guys expect any changes to outlook following MCL/MDL withdrawal? And then do you expect any read-through to follicular lymphoma from that withdrawal? \nJeffrey Stewart: It's Jeff. Thank you for the question. First, these are very small indications. So to give you some sense of the relative size for Imbruvica, MCL is about 4% of the value. MDL is really less than 1% or about 1%. So we don't anticipate that those withdrawals due to the fact that we didn't get the confirmatory studies to clear, we'll have a material impact. I think it's also important to note that many physicians will continue these patients on the medication. They won't be all switched, for example, or taken off and put on another product. That's the market intelligence. There's no requirement that they need to do that for the physicians. And so net-net, this is not a really material issue given the size of those indications. And I think Roopal will address your point on follicle. \nRoopal Thakkar: Yes, I can talk about FL here for a minute. So a Phase III readout is expected later this year. It's not clear if the MCL outcomes would be reflected in what we see there. But what I would say about FL is our focus would be with epcoritamab, or dual engager, which we expect DLBCL actions here soon. And then we have programs and we're seeing very high levels of response in FL with epco either as monotherapy or in combination, which we'll see some data in those combos in DLBCL and FL at ASCO as well. \nElizabeth Shea: Thanks, [ Susan ]. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us. \nOperator: Thank you for your participation. Participants, you may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Roopal Thakkar",
            "content": "It's Roopal. I'll take the ones on Navitoclax and Teliso-V. So for Navitoclax, it's the combination with the JAK2 in myelofibrosis. And there, we're looking to be better than monotherapy with JAK2 in that space and improving spleen size and symptoms like abdominal pain, fullness, fever, fatigue. Also, perhaps uniquely, what we've observed is also an improvement in bone marrow fibrosis and a decrease in variant allelic frequency. So that's what we would be looking for, and we should get a readout by midyear or so.\n For Teliso-V, in lung cancer, EGFR wild type with high c-Met and that's the indication where we have breakthrough therapy designation. Around the end of this year, I would say that's where we would see a readout. What we've seen in earlier data cuts is an ORR above 50%, which is quite a bit higher than what would be expected in standard of care in that second, third line setting. And if the data looks strong, there's a potential that we could submit next year for an accelerated approval. Yes, I can talk about FL here for a minute. So a Phase III readout is expected later this year. It's not clear if the MCL outcomes would be reflected in what we see there.

            "name": "Thomas J. Hudson",
            "content": "Thank you, Carrie. We've continued to make very good progress with our pipeline to start this year. In immunology, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, making it the first JAK inhibitor approved for this indication. We continue to anticipate FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease next month. We also recently announced positive top line results from our Phase III induction study for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which is a disease with unpredictable symptoms and frequent players making it challenging to manage.\n In our study, Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary end points demonstrating a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement. We're particularly pleased with Skyrizi's impressive performance on the more stringent measures in this trial with approximately 37% of Skyrizi-treated patients achieving endoscopic improvement compared to 12% of patients on placebo. This level of efficacy has the potential to position Skyrizi as a highly effective therapy, and we believe it will be a welcome new treatment option for physicians and patients once approved. Detailed data from this induction study will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting. We expect to see data from the Phase III maintenance study in the second quarter with our regulatory submissions planned for the second half of the year.\n In oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our hematology and solid tumor pipelines. We remain on track for several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approval for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory in multiple myeloma patients with a t(1114) mutation and navitoclax's TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. And Phase II data for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support a regulatory submission for accelerated approval.\n We're also beginning to see very encouraging data for our next-generation c-Met ADC, which uses a more potent Topol payload than our Teliso-V ADC. Based on the data we've seen to date for ABBV-400 in our Phase I solid tumor basket study, we plan to expand the program to earlier lines in colorectal cancer as well as evaluate in other tumors where c-Met is expressed, including pancreatic and liver cancer.\n Moving to our neuroscience pipeline, where we've recently received FDA approval for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine, making it the only oral CGRP antagonist approved for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our Phase III study, Qulipta provided a significant reduction in migraine days as well as significant improvements in function and quality of life in patients with chronic migraine, a common and debilitating disease. As a highly effective oral treatment option, we believe Qulipta will be well positioned in a chronic migraine prevention market. In Europe, we continue to anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine.\n Turning now to ABBV-951. We announced that we received a complete response letter for our regulatory application in the U.S. The FDA has not asked for additional efficacy or safety studies related to our drug delivery -- drug device delivery system, but rather they have requested additional information regarding the pump as well as updates to instruction for use. We are working to generate the necessary information, and we expect to respond to the CRL later this year with an FDA action anticipated in the first half of '24.\n In international markets, we've recently received approval for 951 in Japan, and we continue to expect approval in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.\n In our early-stage neuroscience pipeline, we recently began Phase I studies of our selective D3 dopamine receptor agonist, ABBV-932. Our experience with Vraylar has highlighted the potential clinical benefit of achieving D3 selectivity, and we believe that a compound that more selectively engages the D3 dopamine receptor has the potential to provide enhanced efficacy. Our program will initially focus on general anxiety disorder with the potential to expand to other neuropsychiatric disorders.\n The programs under our collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. We now have 4 assets in clinical trials, including 2 PTPN2 inhibitors in Phase I in oncology. Our eIF2B activator for neurodegenerative diseases and an IGF-1 signaling pathway modulator that will be explored in aging-related diseases. Our most advanced program is the eIF2B activator 7262. The first patient was recently enrolled in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a Phase II/III study conducted by the HEALEY Center for ALS at Mass General. This trial is designed to evaluate multiple therapies simultaneously with a goal to accelerate the development of potential breakthrough treatments for ALS.\n Now I'd like to provide a brief update on 2 earlier stage programs in our therapeutic pipeline. In cystic fibrosis, we recently analyzed data from an ongoing proof-of-concept study, evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results from this interim analysis did not meet our criteria for advancing and we are discontinuing our cystic fibrosis program.\n We also recently reviewed interim data from our exploratory studies for ABBV-154 in PMR in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the RA study, while we observed efficacy with 154, we also observed some changes in biomarkers that are consistent with systemic steroid exposure at the higher doses. The benefit risk profile does not sufficiently differentiate 154 from other available treatments. So based on the totality of the data across RA, PMR and Crohn's disease studies, we will not be pursuing further development of this asset.\n Now moving to our aesthetics pipeline. We recently saw data from our Phase III studies for Botox in platysma prominence and masseter muscle prominence. In our study for prominent neck muscles, Botox met all primary and secondary endpoints demonstrating a significant reduction in the unwanted appearance of platysma prominence on the neck and jaw line. This was the first of 3 Phase III studies in platysma prominence with data from the 2 remaining trials expected in the second half of the year, followed by regulatory submission in the U.S. near the end of 2023.\n Botox also performed very well in our study for prominent masseter muscles, meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial. Our program is initially focused on China and other Asian markets as masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. Based on the results from this trial, we expect to submit our regulatory application in China in the second half of the year. Once approved, we anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication, which will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment.\n So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones throughout the remainder of 2023.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. This is Tom for the ALS question. I'd say about 2 years, we had to recruit the patients and there's about a year of follow-up that is needed. So I would say, late '24, early '25, all depends on the enrollment, which I understand is starting off on a good pace. This is Tom. Regarding the question on our triplet program, yes, we are -- our C2 corrector that we just tested did not work. This was not our first attempt that producing one and we do not have another backup. So we don't have other options than to discontinue the CF program."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. We're off to an excellent start in 2023 with each of our 5 key therapeutic areas meeting or exceeding our first quarter expectations, a testament to the strength of our broad portfolio. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations.\n First quarter results include continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which remain on track to contribute more than $11 billion in combined sales this year. Growth rates in the first quarter for both products are consistent with our full year expectations.\n Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating momentum across all approved indications and we expect to round out their opportunities in IBD later this year. This includes Rinvoq's anticipated U.S. approval in Crohn's disease as well as Skyrizi's European launch in Crohn's and its global regulatory submission in UC.\n We are also performing exceptionally well in neuroscience. Total net revenues this quarter were nearly $200 million above our guidance with Vraylar sales accelerating following MDD approval and migraine delivering strong growth. As a result, we will be increasing our full year outlook for neuroscience.\n Aesthetics is also performing better than expected. We are seeing positive recovery trends in China and some stability in the U.S. market, where we are closely monitoring several economic indicators that correlate with aesthetics procedures, including consumer confidence, personal consumption and Google searches. Although it's still early in the year, these positive trends, especially across our international markets, give us the confidence to increase our full year outlook for aesthetics as well. This continues to be an underpenetrated market with significant growth potential.\n Based on our robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.72 and $11.12.\n In closing, I'm extremely pleased with the performance of our diverse portfolio. We're off to a strong start to the year, which further reinforces our confidence in the long-term outlook of the business.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Terence, it's Rob. So on the retail inventory destocking, we do typically see this in the first quarter, so it wasn't a complete surprise. In fact, it was factored into our guidance. We did beat our guidance in immunology for the quarter. The impact was high single digits, both for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In terms of absolute value, we're talking about around $70 million for Skyrizi and $30 million for Rinvoq. And then Terence, this is Rob. Just to more broadly answer the question that I'm sure many investors have. If you look at the growth in the quarter, so overall, U.S. demand was up just north of 60% for Rinvoq and Skyrizi. We saw very strong performance across all approved indications, as Jeff highlighted. We did have the 2 partial offsets, one being the retail inventory destock, which I've already quantified. And then price was down high single digits and that's really driven by rebate increases, which is typical when we see the type of volume increase.\n And we saw Skyrizi sales up 80% last year, Rinvoq in the U.S. up 40% last year. So when you see that kind of volume growth and couple that with the number of indications we had approved, we had 5 new indications for Rinvoq and 2 for Skyrizi. So it was something we were contemplating. It was factored into our guidance, but I don't know that The Street fully appreciated that in terms of the first quarter estimates that were put out there. And Steve, this is Rob, on your EPS range question. We've typically given a $0.20 range; this year, we gave a $0.40 range. And the key driver of that is obviously the U.S. Humira dynamics. As we see that play out, particularly in the second half, we would typically tighten that range. Now keep in mind, that $0.20 wider range represents about 1% of U.S. Humira growth. So it's not as wide as you might think. But we did widen it given the dynamics of U.S. Humira. And I think we'll be able to give you more color as we see those 7, 9 biosimilars coming in the market in the middle of the year. We'll have more clarity for you on the second quarter call. Chris, this is Rob. So on your question on price, yes, the way to think about 2023 price for the year for Skyrizi and Rinvoq would be down high single digits. Now we wouldn't expect high single digits to be the rate going forward given a big driver was the number of new indications that we launched. And so I would expect that to moderate over time.\n Carrie? Just to answer the question, Mohit, on the gating. Yes, I think it's safe to assume that you'll see high single-digit price in each of the quarters this year. Carson, this is Rob. I'll answer your second question. So I wouldn't consider Imbruvica in 951 to be variables that would push the trough out. It's really more about how the overall year plays out, particularly the second half with U.S. Humira. So if U.S. Humira does better and we outperform in '23, then we could see the trough in '24. I think the important thing to keep in mind is regardless of when the trough occurs, we wouldn't expect earnings to fall below the [ 1074 ex-IPR&D ]. That's really what I would focus on, and we don't consider Imbruvica in 951 delays to be variables that would push that trough."

            "name": "Jeffrey Stewart",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. I'm very pleased with the strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. Immunology delivered total revenues of approximately $5.6 billion with continued robust double-digit growth from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Skyrizi global sales were nearly $1.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 46%, despite retail inventory destocking in the quarter. Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market with a total prescription share now at 30%.\n In psoriasis, Skyrizi has set a very high bar relative to other therapies on the market or in development with differentiated attributes across the categories that physicians and patients deem most important. This includes the rapid onset of action after the first dose, nearly complete skin clearance with multifold higher rates on PASI 90 and PASI 100. High durability of response, which we have demonstrated can increase over time as well as quarterly dosing for maintenance therapy, a convenient alternative to daily oral or more frequently administered injectables. With a nearly 50% U.S. in-play share of new and switching patients, there is substantial room for Skyrizi's continued growth in psoriasis.\n This best-in-class profile is supporting strong momentum now in psoriatic arthritis with Skyrizi achieving an in-play biologic share of roughly 20% in the U.S. dermatology segment. Skyrizi is also being co-positioned with Rinvoq in the U.S. room segment in PSA where we are seeing increasing utilization among rheumatologists as well. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved in-play psoriatic disease leadership in more than 25 countries and total market share leadership in nearly 20 of those key markets.\n In Crohn's disease, we are seeing very fast adoption of Skyrizi in the U.S., with a total in-play patient share at approximately 20%, second only to STELARA. Feedback from gastroenterologists is very positive, especially as it relates to Skyrizi's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We see strong uptake in Japan and Canada as well with the European launch forthcoming.\n We also recently reported strong induction data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which Tom will discuss momentarily. Based on the results of that trial, it is increasingly clear that Skyrizi represents a differentiated asset across inflammatory bowel disease and we look forward to bringing this potential new indication to physicians and patients next year.\n Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $686 million, reflecting operational growth of more than 50% despite similar retail inventory destocking in the quarter. I'm very pleased with the performance in rheumatology with total prescriptions increasing across each of the 4 approved indications. Atopic dermatitis is also tracking in line with our expectations. We continue to see market share momentum globally, including in-play patient share increasing to approximately 17% in the U.S.\n We are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology. Rinvoq has set a high bar for efficacy in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, demonstrating strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. We're seeing very strong momentum in UC, where adoption has been robust. Rinvoq is now achieving a 23% in-play share in the U.S. second-line plus setting, reflecting an impressive ramp since our launch in UC less than 1 year ago. This accelerated adoption among gastroenterologists is very encouraging for Rinvoq's pending outlook in Crohn's. We are currently launching this indication in the EU, a geography where Rinvoq is the only JAK approved to treat both IBD conditions, and we remain on track for CD approval and commercialization in the U.S. later this quarter with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the back half of this year.\n So we see inflammatory bowel disease continues to be an area of high unmet need. Having 2 novel therapies in IBD with Skyrizi and Rinvoq that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy is an important step forward for patients. And with these 2 complementary assets, we are very well positioned to compete against other oral or biological agents.\n Global Humira sales were approximately $3.5 billion, down 24.3% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. remains in line with our expectations with most of the impact driven by price.\n Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.4 billion with continued pressure on Imbruvica, partially offset by robust double-digit growth with Venclexta. Imbruvica global revenues were $878 million, down 25.2% due to increasing competition and the cumulative impact of a suppressed market. Venclexta global sales were $538 million, up 17.5% on an operational basis with strong momentum across both AML and CLL.\n In neuroscience, revenues were approximately $1.7 billion, up 15% on an operational basis. Vraylar is performing exceptionally well. Sales of $561 million were up 31.3% on an operational basis, above our expectations. We are very pleased with the AMDD label and the launch, which has resulted in a significant uplift in total new prescriptions for Vraylar. With a dedicated sales force that calls on both psychiatrists and primary care as well as ramping DTC promotion, we see an opportunity for accelerated growth across all approved indications. And we will be raising our full year guidance for Vraylar accordingly.\n Within migraine, we remain uniquely positioned with a portfolio to support complete migraine freedom. Our leading oral CGRP therapies contributed $218 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 45% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. We recently expanded the label for Qulipta, which is now uniquely positioned as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine further strengthening our competitive profile.\n Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $719 million, reflecting strong performance in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance across the therapeutic portfolio.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? And it's Jeff. Just to clarify on your wholesale comment, I think, as Rob highlighted, it's in the retail. So it's in the specialty pharmacy channel. And you'll recall, as you know, there's about 18 specialty pharmacies that basically distribute the I&I products, and there are some big ones there. So it was not a wholesaler dynamic. It was a retail inventory dynamic, which, again, as these products get bigger, we do see and contemplate in our projections. Yes, Steve, it's Jeff, and thanks for the question. I'll take the co-pay one. Look, I mean, some of the peers are seeing the effects of the so-called maximizer programs or even some of the lingering accumulator programs which do sometimes as benefit designs are reset in the first quarter can apply some pressure. We don't see that. We've been managing that very tightly. And we're not seeing any significant sort of surge or creep in terms of that dynamic. The dynamic is exactly what Rob had highlighted, which is the modest price based on the number of indications and how fast the volume is moving and this destocking event that we talked through. So co-pay is very stable for AbbVie. Yes, it's Jeff. I'll give some comment on that. I think the way that we think about our brands is the first place that we look at is how distinctive they are. I mean we've got 4 head-to-head trials with Skyrizi and another one on the way where we can clearly differentiate the product. And we have many as well on Rinvoq. So we've really thought about it from a development standpoint. And I would say the perspective is somehow there was a restructuring of the PDMs, which I don't think is imminent. And the rebate sort of approach disappeared. It disappears for everybody. I mean all of these I&I products have a fairly reasonable rebate load and there would be a different basis of competition, which we would do very, very well. So we're not concerned about sort of a fundamental structural change relative to these 2 products, which are very distinctive.\n If we look at your second part of your question, which is it's really the same answer, which is we don't see that there are going to be significant impacts of Humira biosimilars on the performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And one perspective, let's take Rinvoq is sort of a very simple way of thinking about it. It's already in the United States, a step behind TNF and it's performing at that level because you see such expansion of second and third lines in that space. And Skyrizi is very, very distinctive. So no, in the second half, we do not anticipate sort of a knock-on effect of the emergent biosimilars to our 2 core brands. Yes. It's Jeff. I'll take your comment on psoriasis. I think that, as I mentioned, it's -- the share is very, very impressive. So we have a 30% total market share now which is really putting significant headroom against any other drug in that category by a lot. And one way to think about it is, I think what you're asking is how much further can it run? And it can run quite a bit further. To some degree, if you think about it, so we're capturing on the dynamic share roughly 50%. So 1 out of every 2 patients. And our market share is about 30.\n So theoretically, over time, right, unless there's some disruption, which we don't see significant disruption in the market, your total market share is going to move towards that in-play share. Now that takes many, many years. But as we look at the fundamental momentum that we can achieve, it's still very, very significant. Add on to that, that basically, we're still in the rest of the world, starting to really see the PSA ramp. And remember, PSA has a very significant impact because it's treated by derms and it was sort of the last remaining gap that we had, so you're going to see continued momentum in the international markets and the U.S. market and we have a long way to run.\n And I'd be remiss if I didn't say how fast again that we're growing in both Crohn's right now and very exciting data in UC. And that market is very, very dynamic. So we feel very secure in our ability to continue to create a lot of value with Skyrizi. Yes. It's Jeff. And I think we think that's a very good call. And just as a reminder, we're not seeing significant pricing pressure in the market. This is really two effects, which is one, the cumulative effect as we've highlighted over the suppressed market over time, which looks to be normalizing. Actually, for the first time in 3 years, we actually saw a positive growth in the market. So that's encouraging.\n The big driver is the share -- is the new patient share, which has been under pressure, initially under pressure by Calquence certainly from our own Venclexta and then the recent Brukinsa launch. And so when we put all of that into the calculus, we think we've got it right and it's probably unlikely that we're going to see any significant step down that would put that in jeopardy. It's Jeff. Thank you for the question. First, these are very small indications. So to give you some sense of the relative size for Imbruvica, MCL is about 4% of the value. MDL is really less than 1% or about 1%. So we don't anticipate that those withdrawals due to the fact that we didn't get the confirmatory studies to clear, we'll have a material impact. I think it's also important to note that many physicians will continue these patients on the medication. They won't be all switched, for example, or taken off and put on another product. That's the market intelligence. There's no requirement that they need to do that for the physicians. And so net-net, this is not a really material issue given the size of those indications. And I think Roopal will address your point on follicle."

With first quarter total revenues and adjusted earnings per share both exceeding our expectations. This performance was driven by double-digit sales growth from several key products, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta and Vraylar. Positive momentum from our aesthetics business with strong results internationally and stabilizing consumer trends in the U.S. and in line performance from U.S. Humira where biosimilar erosion is tracking as expected with much of the impact driven by price.\n Since our inception, we have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in highly attractive markets, including immunology, hematological oncology, neuroscience and aesthetics. Our commercial execution, including the launch of new products and expanded indications has been outstanding, especially across Skyrizi and Rinvoq and recently with Vraylar and MDD. Each of these assets are expected to contribute significant revenue growth over the decade. The breadth and the depth of our R&D pipeline also supports our long-term growth outlook and we anticipate numerous important pipeline milestones over the next 2 years.\n In summary, we are 1 quarter into the U.S. biosimilar event for Humira and are managing the erosion well. Most importantly, our growth platform is demonstrating strong performance, exceeding our expectations. We are executing well across all aspects of our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob? So this is Rick. I'll cover number two and maybe just touch on number one. If you think about our pipeline, obviously, as we look at Skyrizi and Rinvoq, they clearly have restated the immunology market across most of the segments that we operate in. We view those assets as being able to drive strong growth through the early part of the next decade.\n Having said that, we're continuing to look for assets in areas where we believe there's still a significant opportunity to restate standard of care. And we obviously explore, as everyone in this industry does many different assets and different mechanisms to try to find those kinds of mechanisms that will deliver that kind of performance. It's interesting. When you look at the 154 platform, it did exactly what we thought it would do from the standpoint of efficacy. But it did it in a way only at the highest dose and at that highest dose, we did see it -- some effects of steroids on some of the biomarkers. And based on the way we think regulators would look at a label for those kinds of products, we didn't believe that would be a competitive profile.\n But the hypothesis certainly worked around the mechanism. So we continue to look for opportunities. We have lots of runway here to be able to get to those, but we do desire to find some additional mechanisms that will be the follow-on products that should be introduced hopefully near the end of this decade or early into the next decade as the next-generation immunology assets for AbbVie. So -- and I feel good about the progress that we're making there. We're continuing to explore a number of other areas. And we're continuing to look both internally and externally at different assets that we can bring into the company to be able to do that.\n To your question of being able to bring assets into this market, we don't believe that we would be encumbered because immunology is a very crowded space from a competitive standpoint. And that's one of the most important criteria that you look at from an FTC standpoint. So we believe we have freedom to operate across most of those segments from an FTC standpoint as well.\n And on price, maybe Rob and I will tag team this one to make sure it's clear. It is common that when you go out and you add indications in this industry, that when you negotiate those contracts to be able to get access, it does require some level of price concession. I would say we're on the lower end of what you typically would have seen with the speed at which we got access for Skyrizi and Rinvoq for those indications and the breadth of that access. And so we certainly would expect this year and last year to be the areas where you saw the most significant amount of price because those are the years that we added the majority of the indications, you would expect that to moderate.\n So then going forward, the way to think about it is, then it's only really driven by volume at that point. And volume typically requires much more modest kinds of price as you go forward. It's not 0 price. You shouldn't have that expectation. But I would not have an expectation of high single digits going forward.\n Anything you'd add, Rob? This is Rick. I'd say the environment hasn't changed materially in the last 24 months from my perspective. I still think it's certainly more difficult to raise money for biotech companies. So it probably makes them a bit more willing to engage with players like us or engage in a process, if they're at a point where they've generated data that makes them attractive. But I'd say the interest level in that engagement is similar to what has been for the last 12 to 24 months. And there's a lot of opportunity to be able to find assets that are in the biotech area. The question is you have to find the right kind of asset and you have to find one that's attractive and meet your needs. And I'd say being able to negotiate a transaction, I think, is a reasonable probability.\n I'd say prices are still relatively high. And so valuations for good assets tend to go at a pretty high level. So again, it's got to be an asset that can demonstrate that it's going to provide significant value to justify that kind of a valuation and a return. But we continue to look for opportunities. And I think as we find those kinds of opportunities, as I've said in the past, we're certainly going to pursue them. I'll take the second question. And maybe I'll make a little bit of a comment on Teliso-V because I think you mentioned 400. I think the early data that we're seeing in 400 is impressive to us. There's no question about it. And I think we're going to have some data presented at this ASCO, right, where you'll have an opportunity to see that in CRC.\n Now having said that, Teliso-V, as Roopal said, does get very good responses in c-Met highs. But to get a broader set of c-MET population, we do believe you need to move to the Topol warhead and seems to get deeper responses and more durable responses.\n Data has to play out over time, but it appears to be a very good platform for c-MET. And so we need the data to mature, and we need to develop more data in that area. But I'd say the early data is pretty encouraging. You'll have a chance to see a snippet of that at this ASCO.\n As far as leadership changes, I'd say it's similar to what we've said in the first quarter or fourth quarter, I can't recall, last year around succession. We obviously have a process in place. We have a very experienced board. I've had many, many discussions with the Board about succession. The Board knows I'm committed to be here to ensure a successful and smooth transition. The criteria that we're operating against is we need to completely get through the transition for Humira biosimilars here in the U.S.\n I'd say, so far, I'm pretty pleased with how the transition is going. And I'm even more pleased with the way the growth platform is operating right now. And in fact, if you look at it this year, the growth platform is going to deliver mid-single digits and it's going to do it despite the headwinds that we see on Imbruvica and the headwinds that we're seeing from the economy on aesthetics. Once the aesthetics business returns to its normal growth rates and much of the pressure on Imbruvica starts to subside, we should see that growth rate increase significantly as we move into '24 for the growth platform.\n And obviously, returning to robust growth in '25 and deliver high single digit from that point forward. So that's the expectation that we're working against. So we want to make sure that the business is operating the way we want it to. We want to make sure that we're through the biosimilar erosion to the point that we believe it is predictable.\n And then obviously, the second part of the criteria is ensuring that the candidate that will succeed me is ready to do that. We can make a successful transition. I've also told the Board that I'm willing to stay in any capacity that they would desire for whatever length of time they would. I think the expectation right now is that I would assume the Executive Chairman role for a period of time to finish the transition to the new CEO. You should not be expecting that, that transition is going to occur in '23."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom. I will discuss our most recent financial results and guidance. Starting with our first quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottom line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance and down 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 45% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 13.6% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.4% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million. The adjusted tax rate was 13.7%.\n Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.72 and $11.12. This earning per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $52.4 billion, an increase of $400 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions. We now expect Vraylar sales of approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting strong prescription growth following the MDD approval. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting the better-than-expected recovery in China and stable economic trends in the U.S.\n Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.5 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of 27%. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 48.5% of sales. We are modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.90 and $3. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\n In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations.\n With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

            "name": "Carrie Strom",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. First quarter Global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.3 billion, which came in ahead of our guidance, primarily due to a faster reopening in China as well as a slightly stronger economy in the U.S. versus our planning assumption. In the U.S., aesthetics sales were $777 million, down 8.1% as we continue to see softness in aesthetics procedures related to inflationary dynamics. As a reminder, we saw a very robust performance for our U.S. performance in the first quarter of 2022, which created difficult comparison for growth in the first quarter of this year.\n U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $409 million, down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see a lesser impact from inflationary dynamics on Botox Cosmetic compared to other areas of our aesthetics portfolio due to its relatively lower price point and large install base of loyal repeat consumers.\n The U.S. cosmetic toxin market was down low single digits in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Botox Cosmetic continues  be the clear market leader and its share of the U.S. toxin market remains stable.\n Sales for our U.S. Juvederm collection were down 18% as our dermal filler portfolio continues to be impacted by inflationary pressure on consumer spending. The U.S. filler market was down nearly 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains the clear market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic pressure on our U.S. dermal filler business is partially offset in the quarter by strong initial uptake for our recently launched Volux filler, which is approved for the improvement of jawline definition. We expect Volux combined with the upcoming launch of our skin quality injectable [ Skinvive ] to support long-term growth for our filler portfolio in the U.S.\n While the aesthetics category in the U.S. continues to be challenged due to the fast economy, the key external economic metrics that we track have remained relatively consistent with year-end 2022 levels.\n Our international aesthetics portfolio continues to demonstrate robust growth with strong performance in Japan, which is rapidly growing and China, which is recovering faster than expected. Sales from our international aesthetics portfolio were $523 million, up 7.8% on an operational basis. International Botox Cosmetics sales grew approximately 17.5% operationally, and international Juvederm sales were down approximately 1.4% on an operational basis. China, which is our second largest market, was negatively impacted by COVID in January and February, but experienced a sharp recovery in March. We expect this level of activity to be sustained throughout the remainder of the year.\n Recall, our original guidance assumed we would not reach a full recovery until the second half of this year. And in Japan, which is an underdeveloped market and proving to be very responsive to promotion, we continue to make significant investments in injector training, our field force and consumer education. Overall, we are pleased with how our team has been executing through this dynamic environment and remain encouraged by improving trends internationally and stabilization across our U.S. portfolio. These positive trends and continued strong momentum give us the confidence to increase the full year outlook for our aesthetics business.\n Longer term, we remain extremely confident in our ability to grow the aesthetics business and continue to expect to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion by the end of this decade. Aesthetics continues to be an extremely attractive underpenetrated market and our proven ability to drive consumer demand and develop a strong base of loyal customers as well as bring innovative new products to the market will support robust growth over the long term.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. This is Carrie. In terms of your questions around the aesthetics market, there are 2 key assumptions for the 2023 planning. One was around the U.S. economy and the other was around the recovery in China. When you think about the U.S. economy, we look at Q1 and we see some favorability to our planning assumptions with the metrics that we track, which Rob mentioned, include real personal consumption expenditure and Google.\n And so in January and February, we saw favorability there. Although in March, there are some potential signs of softening. So we continue to have a cautious outlook for our U.S. business for the rest of the year. The way to think about market growth for the full year would be low -- for toxins, the market would be down low to mid-single digits until we lap the 2022 downturn, which happened around May. And then after that, we would expect flat market growth for the rest of the year. So that's how we think about the U.S.\n Our other -- our second biggest market is China. And recall, we had assumed that the aesthetics market in China would not recall -- would not fully recover until the second half of the year. Well, in actuality, what we saw was although January was significantly impacted, in February, we started to see improvement. And in March, there was a really steep recovery that we do expect will sustain through the rest of the year. And in other markets around the world, I guess, in Canada and U.K., we are seeing some high inflation impacting consumer demand, but the rest of Europe seems stable right now."

All participants will be in a listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nLiz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics.

Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert A. Michael: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. AbbVie is performing exceptionally well, and I\u2019m extremely pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities, including continued double-digit sales growth from our ex-Humira platform, the closing and integration of Cerevel Therapeutics and the progress we are making to build and advance a compelling pipeline of innovative medicines. Turning to our results, AbbVie\u2019s diversified portfolio delivered sales that were $260 million above our expectations and reflect robust mid-single-digit operational sales growth. Our ex-Humira platform drove this over achievement, including growth of nearly 18%. The momentum of Skyrizi and Rinvoq is especially impressive with combined sales expected to exceed $17 billion this year, which is $1.3 billion above our initial expectations. And, we see substantial opportunity for continued strong growth well into the next decade. Several other key products also delivered double-digit sales growth, including Venclexta, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and Qulipta. This broad-based performance further demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. For the third time this year, we are raising our full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We are increasing our full-year revenue guidance by $500 million and have now raised total revenue by $1.8 billion since our initial guidance in February. We are also raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 and now expect adjusted EPS between $10.90 and $10.94. In addition to achieving strong quarterly results, we have been very focused on investing in the business to generate sustainable long-term performance in the 2030s and beyond. During the quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, strengthening our neuroscience pipeline. Cerevel enhances our ability to help patients suffering from devastating conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s and schizophrenia. The integration has been seamless and we are excited to have the talented Cerevel team join our organization. Within the Cerevel pipeline, we are very pleased with the positive Phase 3 results and emerging profile of tavapadon in Parkinson\u2019s. And, we remain on-track to read out both pivotal studies for emraclidine in schizophrenia in the fourth quarter. More broadly on the pipeline, we have been advancing key R&D programs across all stages of development. Some notable highlights include the U.S. approvals of Vyalev for advanced Parkinson\u2019s and Botox for platysma bands. The U.S. regulatory submission of Teliso-V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, and the start of our Phase 2 Crohn\u2019s platform study, which is evaluating Skyrizi in combination with several novel biologics. In summary, AbbVie continues to demonstrate strong commercial, operational and R&D execution. The robust performance of our growth platform once again exceeded our expectations and we see numerous opportunities to drive long-term growth. Further underscoring our confidence in that growth, today we announced a 5.8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2025. Since inception, we have increased our quarterly dividend by more than 300%. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff, for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\nJeffrey R. Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the continued strong momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. I\u2019ll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $7 billion up 4.8% on an operational basis. Skyrizi global sales were $3.2 billion up 51.5% on an operational basis, exceeding our expectations. We are seeing robust prescription growth across psoriatic disease, with Skyrizi achieving in-play biologic share leadership in approximately now 30 key countries. In the U.S, we continue to capture nearly one out of every two in-play psoriatic disease patients on biologic therapy and we see substantial room for further total share growth. We believe that Skyrizi\u2019s best-in-class profile with nearly complete skin clearance, high durability of response, easy onboarding and quarterly dosing for maintenance therapy sets a very high bar relative to other therapies on market or in development. Skyrizi has also demonstrated a compelling clinical profile in IBD, including strong endoscopic data paired with convenient dosing. This differentiated profile as well as our compelling head-to-head sequence data versus Stelara is supporting very rapid uptake in Crohn\u2019s disease, where Skyrizi continues to gain market share globally, achieving in-play patient leadership across all lines of therapy in the U.S, Japan and Canada. Skyrizi\u2019s U.S. in-play patient share is now approximately 32%, more than double the share of the second biologic treatment. And with Skyrizi\u2019s total prescription share of approximately 8%, we see significant opportunity for revenue inflection in Crohn\u2019s going forward. While we are still very early in our launch in the U.S. and Europe, we also anticipate robust uptake for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis the new indication. Initial prescription trends as well as feedback from gastroenterologists have been overwhelmingly positive. Physicians are particularly impressed with the data that has been demonstrated for naive UC patients, who have not been exposed yet to biologics, where Skyrizi achieved very high results for clinical remission and endoscopic response. We have now secured broad formulary access for Skyrizi in UC, with sales in this indication expected to ramp meaningfully over the next several quarters. So, given the momentum we are seeing across all of these indications, we will be raising our full-year sales guidance once again for Skyrizi. Turning now to Rinvoq, which is also demonstrating robust growth. Global sales were $1.6 billion up 47.4% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong prescription growth across all seven of Rinvoq\u2019s approved indications. I\u2019m especially pleased with our performance in IBD, where Rinvoq\u2019s uptake is exceeding our expectations. Rinvoq is now capturing double-digit in-play patient share in the U.S. for ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn\u2019s disease. Both indications are now available in more than 75 countries with reimbursement and share continuing to increase. I also wanted to highlight our recent performance in atopic dermatitis, where Rinvoq is seeing an acceleration of in-play share following recent positive data from our second head-to-head study versus Dupixent. As an oral option that provides rapid skin clearance and itch relief, we believe Rinvoq\u2019s strong differentiated profile will continue to compete well in this highly underpenetrated AD market. As a result of this continued strong performance, we will also be increasing the full-year sales guidance once again for Rinvoq. Looking forward, we see substantial momentum for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq, including continued share gains across existing indications on top of the typical underlying market growth across room, derm and gastro. Additionally, we are making excellent progress with several new indications for Rinvoq across sizable markets that will have the potential to provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s. From a competitive perspective, a key element of Skyrizi and Rinvoq\u2019s success has been their strong differentiation with compelling head-to-head data against several novel therapies. This includes Skyrizi superiority versus Humira, Cosentyx, Otezla and Stelara in psoriasis as well as Stelara in Crohn\u2019s disease and Rinvoq superiority versus Humira and Orencia in rheumatoid arthritis as well as Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. To further support our differentiation, we have another head-to-head study ongoing for Skyrizi versus Sotyktu in psoriasis with plans also underway now for a study comparing Skyrizi versus Entyvio in ulcerative colitis. So given all of these factors, we feel very confident about the long-term growth prospects for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $2.2 billion down 36.5% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. While Humira share erosion to biosimilars in the U.S. is largely in-line with our expectations, we are now seeing more Humira molecule volume moving to other novel mechanisms than previously anticipated. So, while this has an unfavorable impact to Humira sales, we are seeing a benefit to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a very favorable dynamic for immunology portfolio now and certainly over the long-term. Moving now to Oncology, where total revenues were approximately $1.7 billion Imbruvica global revenues were $828 million down 8.8%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL, partially offset by higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta is performing extremely well. Global sales were $677 million up 18.2% on an operational basis. This reflects strong momentum in CLL, especially in Europe, where recent guideline changes recommend combination use of Venclexta Plus BTK inhibitors as a preferred fixed duration treatment versus continuous BTK treatment alone. Growth is also supported by our very strong share position in frontline AML, where Venclexta is the leading treatment for patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. We are also seeing nice sequential revenue growth from Elahere and Epkinly, which are both demonstrating strong launch trajectories. Turning now to neuroscience, where total revenues were more than $2.3 billion up 16% on an operational basis. Vraylar is demonstrating robust performance. Sales were $875 million up 16.6% on an operational basis, reflecting continued new prescription growth in both bipolar disorder and adjunctive MDD. Within migraine, our leading oral CGRP therapies contributed $445 million in combined revenue this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 22%, as we continue to see increasing prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Global Botox Therapeutic sales were $848 million reflecting strong performance in chronic migraine as well as the other approved indications. Finally, we are very excited for the recent U.S. approval of Vyalev, a transformative therapy for patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, who are uncontrolled on oral therapy alone. As a less invasive, non-surgical delivery system that can provide meaningful improvements in on-time and off-time, we believe Vyalev has the potential to significantly expand use beyond current device aided therapies. Sales in the U.S. for Vyalev are expected to ramp gradually over the next several quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination. At the same time, we are very encouraged by the interest in uptake internationally, where we have approval now in 35 countries with several thousand patients already on treatment. Longer-term, we anticipate peak sales of Vyalev to exceed $1 billion. So overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the continued commercial execution and performance across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Carrie, for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\nCarrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Third quarter global aesthetics sales were more than $1.2 billion representing growth of 1.8% on an operational basis. In the U.S, aesthetic sales of $791 million increased by 3.9%, driven by growth from Botox Cosmetic as well as other brands across our broad portfolio. U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $414 million an increase of 6.5% versus the prior year. Favorable pricing dynamics and facial toxin market growth more than offset modest share erosion. Botox Cosmetics remains the clear market leader. U.S. Juvederm sales were $105 million. Juvederm\u2019s market-leading share was consistent with last year and the overall filler market was roughly flat to the prior year. While the U.S. facial injectable market remains largely stable, growth is below historical rates. As a result, there is a reluctance from customers to maintain traditional toxin and filler inventory levels. Based upon the relatively higher price point of filler procedures in a still challenging U.S. economic environment, Juvederm is more impacted by this dynamic, which can be seen in third quarter results. Internationally, aesthetic sales were $448 million reflecting a decline of 1.6% on an operational basis. Within China, the economic dynamics that weighed on our results during the first half of the year have continued to impact consumer spending. This has created challenging aesthetic market conditions that have been particularly impactful to Juvederm\u2019s performance. Primarily due to this circumstance, we are moderating our Juvederm sales outlook for the year. We are encouraged by the recently announced government stimulus in China. We will continue to monitor for any further developments and how it could positively impact consumer discretionary spending and aesthetic market growth. Although the current dynamics in China are challenging, its potential remains attractive and we are committed to bring innovation to this market that will drive long-term growth. Along those lines, in China, we recently received approval for the Botox Cosmetic indication in masseter muscle prominence, marking the first toxin in the world to have this indication. This approval enables us to market and train to this important treatment option that addresses a top aesthetic concern among many Asian patients. In the U.S., we are pleased that we received FDA approval for the use of Botox Cosmetic to treat platysma bands. This approval positions Botox as the only cosmetic toxin with four distinct indications and enables us to market and train beyond the face for the improvement of neck and jawline appearance. We also remain excited about the opportunity for BoNT/E. Based upon its rapid onset and short acting profile, BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients that are hesitant to try facial toxins, driving long-term market expansion. Looking to the future, we continue to see significant growth potential for our aesthetics portfolio based upon low market penetration rates, our commitment to introduce novel treatments, our strong customer relationships and our position as the global aesthetics leader. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roopal.\nRoopal Thakkar: Thank you, Carrie. Starting with immunology, where we recently began our Phase 2 Crohn\u2019s disease platform study, which will evaluate Skyrizi in combination with several other novel biologics. This study will initially look at combinations of Skyrizi with our anti-IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2 bispecific lutikizumab and our novel anti-\u03b14\u03b27 antibody ABBV-382. We are planning to include additional novel biologics in the future. Our approach in immunology has been to pursue therapies that are well differentiated and have the potential to elevate standard of care. We have clearly achieved this with Rinvoq and Skyrizi across multiple indications, including Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. As we think about how the IBD market will evolve, we view dual mechanism approaches as having the greatest potential to achieve levels of efficacy that are above current standard of care. We are very excited about the potential for these combination therapies in IBD and we look forward to sharing updates as the data mature. In Oncology, we continue to make very good progress across all stages of our hem and solid tumor pipeline. In the area of solid tumors, we recently submitted our application to the FDA for accelerated approval of Teliso-V as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Once approved, Teliso-V will become the first c-Met targeted ADC to enter non-small cell lung cancer, a segment with limited options and where patients tend to have a very poor prognosis, especially if their tumors express c-Met. We anticipate an approval decision in the first half of 2025. In the quarter, we also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending Elahere for the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer in patients with high expression of FR\u03b1 and treated with up to three prior therapies. This decision was based on the positive Phase 3 MIRASOL trial where Elahere demonstrated an overall survival benefit and significantly reduce the risk of cancer progression. We anticipate an approval decision in Europe in the fourth quarter. At the recent ESMO Congress we presented new Phase 1 data for ABBV-400 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. Early efficacy data from the lung cohort are promising with an objective response rate of 48% across all patients in the study and response rates ranging from 60% to 78% in patients with overexpressed c-Met. We are very pleased with the level of activity we\u2019re seeing from our next generation c-Met ADC, which compares favorably to Teliso-V, where we\u2019ve seen objective response rates ranging from 23% in medium c-Met expressors to 35% in patients with high c-Met expression. 400 has the potential to expand our c-Met portfolio into earlier lines of therapy and lower levels of c-Met expression in lung cancer. Similarly, in patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer, 400 demonstrated promising activity with an objective response rate of 29% across all patients. This compares well against combination and single agent chemotherapy, which are the standards of care for patients in second line and third line of therapy respectively. Based on these encouraging preliminary data, we plan to begin Phase 2 studies for 400 in both non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. Recall, we\u2019ve also advanced 400 in late line colorectal cancer and we remain on-track to begin a Phase 3 study later this year. In the area of hematologic oncology, we received approval in Europe for Tepkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of therapy. Epcoritamab is now the only T-cell engaging bispecific approved in the U.S. and Europe to treat both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Moving to neuroscience, we recently received FDA approval for Vyalev as the first subcutaneous 24 hour infusion of levodopa based therapy for the treatment of motor fluctuations in adults with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery offers meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development. Vyalev delivers significant improvements in on-time and off-time with a non-surgical 24 hour delivery system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by Duopa and it doesn\u2019t require combination with oral drugs to achieve efficacy. We\u2019re extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in the U.S. We also recently announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 TEMPO-1 trial, which evaluated fixed doses of monotherapy tavapadon in early Parkinson\u2019s disease. In the study, both doses of tavapadon met the primary endpoint demonstrating a significant reduction in the severity of Parkinson\u2019s disease symptoms compared with placebo at week 26, as measured by decreases in the combined scores for Parts 2 and 3 of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale. Key secondary endpoints were also met in this study. We are very pleased with the emerging profile for tavapadon, which shows it is generally safe and well tolerated and it can drive strong efficacy as a monotherapy in early Parkinson\u2019s and as an adjunctive treatment in patients with more advanced disease. Results from the two Phase 3 studies thus far look favorable compared to other dopamine agonists on the market. And, we believe tavapadon has the potential to become an important new treatment option as a monotherapy for Parkinson\u2019s patients as well as an adjunct to oral levo/carbidopa. We expect to see results from TEMPO-2 later this year, which is our Phase 3 monotherapy study evaluating a flexible dose of tavapadon. Results from our long-term safety study, TEMPO-4 are expected next year. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to share data from the two emraclidine pivotal studies in the fourth quarter. We also continue to invest in external innovation to strengthen our neuroscience pipeline. We recently announced two deals in this area, including an expanded collaboration with Gedeon Richter to develop novel targets for neuropsychiatric conditions and the acquisition of Aliada brings an anti-pyroglutamate A\u03b2 antibody, which uses a unique blood brain barrier crossing and amyloid aggregate clearing technology. Aliada\u2019s lead antibody has been able to achieve encouraging levels in cerebrospinal fluid with an extended half-life and the potential to be delivered subcutaneously. This molecule could become a best-in-class treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Aliada\u2019s novel technologies for enabling therapeutics to access the central nervous system also have the potential to be used with other programs across our neuroscience pipeline. In aesthetics, we recently received approval for Botox in the U.S. for moderate to severe platysma bands, marking the first global approval in this indication for any neurotoxin. There is currently a lack of non-surgical treatments available to improve the appearance of prominent platysma bands. And, we believe Botox will represent an important new treatment option for patients who are looking to reduce the appearance of vertical neck bands and improve jawline definition. In our novel toxin portfolio, we remain on-track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E around the end of this year. Our rapid onset short acting toxin has a highly differentiated clinical profile and once approved will offer patients a novel option compared to currently available neurotoxins. So in summary, this has been a very productive year thus far for our R&D organization and we are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made advancing our broad pipeline. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to, Scott.\nScott T. Reents: Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our third quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3 which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.04 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $14.5 billion reflecting robust growth of 4.9% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Our ex-Humira growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie\u2019s total sales, delivered reported growth of nearly 18%, once again exceeding our expectations. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.7% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.4%, adjusted R&D expense of 14.2%, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.6% and adjusted SG&A expense of 23%. Net interest expense was $591 million. The adjusted tax rate was 16.2%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $10.94. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $56 billion, an increase of $500 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.7% unfavorable impact on full-year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updates to select key products and therapeutic areas. We now approximate Skyrizi global sales of $11.5 billion, an increase of $500 million due to continued strong performance across all approved indications. Rinvoq total revenue of $5.8 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting robust uptake in IBD. U.S. Humira total sales of $7.4 billion a decrease of $400 million reflecting more Humira molecule volume moving to other novel mechanisms, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Imbruvica totaled revenue of $3.3 billion an increase of $200 million reflecting higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta total sales of $2.6 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting momentum in both U.S. and international markets. Aesthetics global revenue of $5.3 billion a decrease of $200 million almost entirely due to lower Juvederm volume which continues to be impacted by challenging economic conditions in key markets. Vraylar total sales of $3.3 billion a decrease of $100 million reflecting continued strong prescription demand partially offset by modestly unfavorable channel mix. And for Botox, we now expect global revenue in the therapeutic space of $3.3 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting robust demand across all indications. Moving to the P&L for 2024. We continue to forecast a full-year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% as well as an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales, which includes a 2.1% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Turning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues approaching $14.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.94 and $2.98. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter and excludes any potential impact from the recently announced acquisition of Aliada Therapeutics. Finally, AbbVie\u2019s robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of September was nearly $7.3 billion and we generated more than $11 billion of free cash flow, which includes approximately $1.5 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments in the first nine-months of the year. This free cash flow fully supports a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we are increasing 5.8% to $1.64 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in 2025, as well as debt repayment, where we remain on-track to pay down the roughly $7 billion of maturities this year and anticipate achieving a net leverage ratio of two times by the end of 2026. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for additional business development. We have executed more than a dozen early stage deals so far this year, and we continue to assess external innovation across all of our key growth areas. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered strong top and bottom line results. I\u2019m very pleased with the momentum of our ex-Humira growth platform, including continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which further supports AbbVie\u2019s long-term outlook. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. We are aware of a peer earnings call that begins at 9:00 A.M. Central, so we will do our best to wrap up our Q&A right around the top of the hour. So, in the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible, please limit yourself to just one question. Operator, first question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question, and congrats on the results. My question was really just centered around 2025 and just some preliminary outlook there. I guess a specific question, you mentioned Humira volumes are maybe shifting over to newer drugs. You comment at all about just in terms of where the street sits currently with Humira. I think consensus number is about $6.8 billion. Is that a reasonable forecast, or is that something you could see higher erosion given what\u2019s happening with Humira? And, then bigger picture kind of tied to that, the mid-single-digit topline growth, it sounds like the trends you\u2019re seeing here may be a net positive where maybe Humira volumes are declining, but that\u2019s largely moving over to Skyrizi and Rinvoq. I just want to get some context of is that mid-single-digit target still a reasonable one to think about for AbbVie next year? Thank you.\nRobert A. Michael: Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Rob. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll have Jeff supplement. So yes, we are very confident in that robust mid-single-digit growth, both topline, bottom line for 2025. I think you\u2019ve interpreted correctly that the trends we\u2019re seeing are net positive and that we\u2019re seeing over performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq more than offsetting the dynamics with Humira. And so, as we look at consensus, that\u2019s probably not reflected. So, I think it\u2019s fair to say, there\u2019s a shift that\u2019s required there, but we\u2019re very pleased with the strong uptake for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. As I mentioned in my remarks, we have now delivered guidance increases of $1.3 billion for Skyrizi and Rinvoq in total. We\u2019re seeing tremendous momentum, particularly with the IBD indications across really all indications, but particularly in IBD. And, we are starting to see the dynamic with the overall Humira molecule, where there is the switching that we\u2019re seeing now to other mechanisms, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a long-term very positive benefit. So, as we look at the business, we\u2019re very well-positioned. Essentially two years after the U.S. Humira LOE, we\u2019ll be returning to robust top line and bottom line growth, and really performance across many parts of the business, not just Skyrizi and Rinvoq. You\u2019ve seen us perform very nicely in oncology. We\u2019ve obviously over performed our expectations in oncology, very pleased with the earlier returns on Elahere. Venclexta is performing exceptionally well. The guidelines changes in Europe are positive as we think about combination opportunities with BTK inhibitors. So, Venclexta is going to be strong, Epkinly is performing very nicely as well. And, then when I look across the neuroscience franchise, Vraylar is a strong grower. We\u2019re very pleased with the migraine portfolio. Obviously, very excited about Cerevel and doing a number of deals now on the early pipeline both with Gedeon Richter and Aliada that really fortifies the long-term view for neuroscience as well. And, then with aesthetics, while it\u2019s below our expectations for this year, obviously the economic conditions have dictated that. We still have tremendous confidence in the long-term outlook for that business. But, as we look at 2025, we\u2019re very confident in our ability to return to that robust mid-single-digit growth.\nJeffrey R. Stewart: Yes. Thanks, Rob. And, I\u2019ll just add a little bit more flavor. It\u2019s Jeff. So, we saw this trend start to emerge in terms of this compression of the, let\u2019s say, the ADAM molecule or the ADAM market, the Humira plus biosimilars, just prior to the CVS event and then it accelerated over Q2. And again, we saw it throughout Q3. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve adapted our approach here. Other than this dynamic, the biosimilar dynamics are playing out really exactly as we anticipated. And you can see this compression in the IQVIA data. So, really the shrinking of the Humira or the ADAM market is something that\u2019s quite clear. It\u2019s a little difficult quantify over time with full precision, but we can see that the molecule continues to decline sequentially and we continue to see strong share gains as I highlighted for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So, this incremental flow from the molecule compression, it\u2019s clearly a contributing factor to some of the over performance that we saw in Q2 and Q3, but it\u2019s really only one of several. We\u2019ve also had significant incremental investments in the consumer space, the sales force approaches we\u2019ve taken, Chris, the integration of the head-to-head data I talked about. And, certainly now we\u2019re starting to see the impact of the UC launch. So, when we put all that together, we think that the dynamics are net-net quite positive overall. And, as Rob said, we\u2019re still looking good for 25%.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question please.,\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nMohit Bansal: Awesome. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just wanted to touch upon the trial you are running head-to-head against Entyvio. Could you help us understand based on pre-clinical or early data, what gives you confidence there? And, are you looking at non-inferiority or potential superiority over Entyvio there? Thank you.\nRoopal Thakkar: Mohit, it\u2019s Roopal. I\u2019ll take that one. So, when we look at the data, in particular, I think Jeff highlighted this, in ulcerative colitis with Skyrizi in this naive patient population, this is a patient population that hasn\u2019t seen biologics or other advanced therapies like JAK inhibitors. The endoscopic improvement and this is in label was 76% in the maintenance portion of this. So, it was quite high, in fact, higher than what we\u2019ve observed even with Rinvoq. So that gave us a good amount of confidence that we have the potential to differentiate with all other assets. You heard about the Skyrizi versus, ustekinumab head to head in Crohn\u2019s disease, but this one gives us a unique opportunity there to go head to head with vedolizumab, especially looking at endoscopic improvement. So, for that particular endpoint, you asked about the type of endpoint. There we would think about superiority, because of it being an objective endpoint. Sometimes with symptoms like clinical remission, these could bounce around. That may be one where we consider as non-inferiority. But I would say endoscopic improvements in the field are now believed to be highly predictive of long-term outcomes. So, that would be how we\u2019re looking at this, Mohit.\nMohit Bansal: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. And this question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. You may ask your question.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, yes, I\u2019ll give you just one on emraclidine. Just getting a lot of questions from investors kind of leading up to that data release. So, maybe you can just the level set expectations on what you\u2019re hoping to see from the data, especially obviously now we have the approval from Bristol with [Coventry] (ph). Just kind of what are you thinking in terms of efficacy safety profile relative to that competitor? And also on the liver testing requirement that they had at initiation, is that something you\u2019d expect as well based on your data? And then finally just tying to that just in terms of the data release, do you expect to get one press release or do you think you\u2019re combining both studies? Or should we still expect the two separate releases? Thank you.\nRoopal Thakkar: Yes, Vamil, it\u2019s Roopal. I\u2019ll take that one. So, a couple of things. Maybe starting with what we\u2019ve observed with the approval. So, we were encouraged by the lack of a boxed warning, meaning there\u2019s a recognition that this is a unique mechanism of action looking specifically at the muscarinic class. So, we were pleased to see that. I think what was notable for us was the GI adverse events, including how that would play out in terms of longer-term tolerability. Also anticholinergic effects, bladder retention that was something I guess we did not anticipate. You mentioned hepatic monitoring that was something that we didn\u2019t anticipate. The other thing that was notable is along with the BID dosing, there is a food effect. So, you have to wait a certain period amount of time when you eat and after you eat when you can take the pill. So, when we think about our profile, we continue to be encouraged with emraclidine being a single agent, once a day, no food effect. We don\u2019t see the extent of GI effects. We don\u2019t and we have not observed in the Phase 1b data any bladder issues. And when we had looked at that 1b data, we didn\u2019t see any hepatic issues, so we don\u2019t anticipate any type of laboratory monitoring. We were also thinking about neurodegeneration associated psychosis and these patients are typically older and likely more sensitive to anticholinergic effects. So, we continue to see an opportunity in that patient population as well. So, we\u2019ve stated that the data will read out here in the next couple of months in the quarter. The same team is working on wrapping up these two studies. So, depending on how far apart the data are, we\u2019ll probably determine as you stated, is it 1 or 2 press releases. It\u2019s a little early right now for us to tell you is it going to be 1 or 2. But if they\u2019re going to be close together, it\u2019s potentially going to be 1.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Vamil. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nTerence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two part for me. Just wondering if you can I\u2019m assuming contracting is now wrapped up, if you can comment at all on how to think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, formulary positioning and pricing just high level for 2025. Thank you.\nJeffrey R. Stewart: Yes. Hi, it\u2019s Jeff. So yes, contracting is very, very close to wrapping up. We have a few more nuances and so typically that may take another month or so. Overall, we\u2019re making very good progress on contracting next year. So, in terms of what we\u2019ve highlighted in the past is we do not anticipate any material change for Skyrizi and Rinvoq in terms of the access for next year across Medicare or the commercial plans. We have quite high, very broad access and we assume that will continue. In terms of what we\u2019ve highlighted to anticipate, we\u2019ve said that we do have over our near-term in LRP sort of a negative pricing environment, but it\u2019s modest. It\u2019s nothing like we saw many quarters ago where we had seven indications. So, we said from a rebate perspective, low single digit changes is a reasonable assumption that we feel confident in despite we\u2019re not fully complete, I think that\u2019s a fair assessment at this point.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Chris Shibutani, your line is open. You may ask your question.\nChris Shibutani: Apologies, I was on mute. Thanks for the question. All the comments you\u2019ve made about Skyrizi or Rinvoq and the molecule switching are very helpful. Just curious as we think on the forward about other potential mechanisms and modalities in particular. I think we have competitor oral data that\u2019s coming up. Interested to hear your thoughts in terms of that modality difference as well as, how you might rank your optimism for some of the new mechanisms of action? I believe you have a TL1A as well in your pipeline though earlier stage. Thank you.\nRoopal Thakkar: Hi, Chris. It\u2019s Roopal. I\u2019ll take that one. With respect to the oral, I\u2019ll take us back to the Skyrizi head-to-head that occurred with apremilast, which is also an oral. The data were substantially higher from an efficacy standpoint for Skyrizi as was the tolerability along with when we asked patients what did they prefer, they actually preferred quarterly subcutaneous dosing. So, I would think about it that way as well. Now the question would be, it\u2019s a similar mechanism, could the efficacy be better than what has been observed with a apremilast in psoriasis? Well, what we saw in the Phase 2 data, my recollection still is that Skyrizi is a full 50% higher when it comes to full skin clearance at a PASI 100. And that\u2019s where the bar is now at PASI 90 and PASI 100. So, we still see an efficacy advantage. Also the data I\u2019m sharing are Phase 3 Skyrizi data. The data that we saw for the oral 23 was from Phase 2. So, there is a reasonable potential that the efficacy data tend to settle down when you go to a broader patient population, especially those that have had longer standing disease or have seen other therapies like other biologics. So, we continue to feel very good and optimistic about our profile versus any emerging competition. Also, we think about our assets from a global standpoint. And when you think about majority of the countries, they are very driven by efficacy to gain access. And in the oral space, we don\u2019t really see it across the globe. Maybe there\u2019s a couple of countries. I think Jeff has mentioned the U.S., but that space may be referred to as a pre biologic space. So maybe more of an influence on the TIK2 or on a apremilast is how we see it. In terms of other mechanisms that we like, as I mentioned, we like anti L23 the way it\u2019s delivered with Skyrizi, the depth of response, the high durability and the convenience with quarterly dosing. If we can couple that with other assets as part of our combination approach, we think that\u2019s going to be extremely competitive in the future. Mechanisms like TL1a, we think are going to be important, especially from a combination approach, which we have one internally. We think the ulcerative colitis data are encouraging, but from a monotherapy standpoint, not differentiated, especially when you look at the Skyrizi data that I mentioned earlier and Rinvoq. And then in Crohn\u2019s, something like TL1a, we think it really does need a combo. So that\u2019ll be part of our platform along with our novel alpha 4 beta 7, we think that\u2019s also a good combo. And then we\u2019ve also provided very strong data in hidradenitis suppurativa with our IL-1 alpha beta lutikizumab. And we\u2019ve seen some preclinical signals that IL-1 beta could be a driver of disease and resistance to other biologics. So, lutikizumab will also be part of the combo in our IBD platform. So, that\u2019s just some of the mechanisms that we\u2019re excited about. There are several others that are early in the pipeline and we will give you more information about those as the data mature.\nChris Shibutani: Thanks very helpful.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Craig. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. You may ask your question.\nTrung Huynh: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the aesthetics business, in the Q&A you did mention that you still have a tremendous amount of confidence hitting that longer term guide here. I\u2019m curious on how dependent this is on the economic environment getting better and getting better quickly. So, you\u2019ve moderated your Juvederm outlook this year because it\u2019s not being good. If next year is another challenging economic year, could we see that $9 billion in 2029 being moderated or even pulled? Just what\u2019s giving you confidence? Thank you.\nRobert A. Michael: Thanks for the question. This is Rob. I\u2019ll take that one. So, as we think about the long-term guide, which is greater than $9 billion by 2029, you need to believe that you can have essentially a compound growth around 11% to get there. If we look at the historical growth of this market, it\u2019s been, let\u2019s say, call it low double digits, low teens. As we look at it going forward, we think probably a more prudent assumption is when we see the recovery, something more in the high single digits, right? So, you need something beyond just the market recovery to get there. And when we look at our the innovation that we\u2019re bringing particularly with the short onset, short acting or fast onset short acting BoNT/E that we expect to launch in \u201826. That could really transform the market, because if you think about the number one barrier for patients is fear of an unnatural look. That could really unlock a part of the market that\u2019s dormant right now, plus it could also lead to share gains. And so I think we need to see, 1, how the market recovers, I would say, 2025 and 26 and then ultimately see how the BoNT/E launch ramps in \u201826. At that point, we\u2019ll have a better sense of the $9 billion as we sit here today. If you believe that the market will recover to high single digits and we have a lot of confidence in BoNT/E, we still believe we can get there, which is why we\u2019re not updating that guidance. But I would expect us to reflect more on that more likely in the \u201826 timeframe than in \u201825.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Trung. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Citi. You may ask your question.\nGeoff Meacham: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I had a bigger picture one for Rob. So, when I look at your therapeutic areas, eye care stands out as one that\u2019s pretty modest contributor today and also down the road. How would you rank that business strategically? And then related when you look at BD going forward, are there other TAs that you\u2019re looking at that could be additive, just thinking specifically maybe metabolic or cardio? Thank you.\nRobert A. Michael: Thanks for the question, Geoff. So, this is Rob. So yes, I mean, our main focus is our five key growth areas, which includes eye care, includes immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. And we participate in large markets with high unmet need that have great growth potential. And within those five verticals, we\u2019re building depth across 24 core areas that does include eye care as well. When you think about diabetic retinopathy, wet AMD, prescription dry eye medications. And so eye care does play an important role, albeit it\u2019s not as high of a growth driver as the other four verticals, but it is part of our five. And that ultimately guides both our internal R&D investments as well as our BD efforts, which as you know, continue to be very active. So, far this year, we\u2019ve executed 15 deals along those lines, really focused more on early stage opportunities to drive growth in the next decade. So that\u2019s our primary focus. Now if we see an opportunity for differentiation in a large market with high unmet need like metabolics, we would consider pursuing it, especially if we can help drive growth in the next decade. But again, it would be more opportunistic. We have to see differentiation and right now it\u2019s not our primary focus. But again, we\u2019re open to more sources of growth for the next decade if we see differentiation that we can create value. And we certainly have the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.\nJames Shin: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our question. For emraclidine\u2019s readout, I think there\u2019s a question on how much erosion could be anticipated. I know you mentioned that the team the same team that was originally working on the Phase 1b is wrapping up studies and so forth. But there\u2019s been some other data that has copied some of Cerevel strategies such as high baseline pans and so forth and placebo effect was still kind of surprisingly higher than it should be. Is there any insight on managing this placebo effect? Thank you.\nRoopal Thakkar: Thanks, James. It\u2019s Roopal. When we did our thorough diligence, that was a major question that we and the broader team had. So, you bring up a good point. Some things that we observed in those two studies that will be the pivotal readouts were what Cerevel was strategically doing. One thing was limiting the number of countries, limiting the number of sites, central review for eligibility criteria, training of raters, certifying those raters, recertifying raters, monitoring blinded data with respect to site activity. So, I think those are important factors that could drive placebo in either direction. So, what we observed was, we would say a good control or at least the best one could do to manage placebo responses. So, it\u2019s hard to know what if there\u2019s any erosion until we see the data. But the effect size that we did see in the Phase 1b was a little over 12 points. So, we think that was a strong separation. And even if that were to go down a little bit, we still feel that based on the safety profile and tolerability profile, this could still be very, very competitive even if we saw a droppage in some point on the efficacy side.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, James. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to follow-up a little bit on the Aliada acquisition, sort of what differentiation you saw over some of the other enhanced brain delivery kind of approaches there that gave you confidence. And maybe we\u2019ve seen AbbVie take a number of shots on goal across Alzheimer\u2019s here, just seems pretty central to your longer term neuroscience portfolio. Can you maybe just again put that in some broader context as you think about the TA strategy longer term? Thank you.\nRoopal Thakkar: Sure. It\u2019s Roopal. I\u2019ll take that. Yes, we\u2019ve been investing for a number of years in the space. And in addition to the recent deal, we\u2019ll have an option readout with Alector and TREM2 coming up. We have SV2A molecule that would look at cognition and other symptoms. Emraclidine could participate in that space from an Alzheimer\u2019s psychosis standpoint. We have other pipeline assets that are looking at tau, intracellular and even an approach looking at extracellular tau. We did have our own A beta monotherapeutic antibody, which we did read out. It did look good, but it wasn\u2019t fully differentiated. And moving on to the Aliada deal, what we see there is the ability to access the CSF at what we would say at this stage at higher concentrations than maybe other competitors. So, we think that\u2019s a good thing. The other aspect that we like is an extended half-life. So that could lead to convenient dosing. And if this approach plays out than one could consider having subcutaneous dosing even getting out to monthly. And if the efficacy is high because of deeper brain penetration that could result in lower levels, faster and a better able to see cognition benefit in a year or 18 months. So, those are some of the benefits that we would see. The other benefit would be getting to the parenchymal tissue more broadly and that could have a reduction in ARIA, which is probably what is disallowing this to really take off. It\u2019s very challenging to take an elderly family member to get multiple scans and worry about them having stroke like symptoms. So, that would be something else we believe we can address with this asset of having a strong safety profile, tolerability, ease of onboarding and high efficacy and ultimately strong benefits on cognition.\nRobert A. Michael: And this is Rob. I\u2019ll just add on here as we think about strategically about the neuroscience franchise. I mean, I think about it as having really four main segments, psychiatry, migraine, Parkinson\u2019s and then neurodegeneration. And if you look at what we\u2019ve done to build out the long-term growth outlook for this franchise, obviously, in psychiatry between Cereval, Gedeon Richter, we also had the early stage opportunity with Gilgamesh, really investing in longer term growth in psychiatry. We have actually a very strong franchise in migraine with the oral CGRPs as well as Botox Therapeutic. In Parkinson\u2019s, now the launch of Vyalev, which is performing very nicely outside the U.S., and we expect will also perform nicely in the U.S. The early Phase 3 data we\u2019ve seen so far for davapidone, the mitokinin disease modifying approach, it\u2019s early and Parkinson\u2019s is another investment we\u2019ve made. And then in Alzheimer\u2019s now with Aliada is another I\u2019d say, long-term investment we\u2019re making to grow the neuroscience franchise. There\u2019s also adjacencies like ALS, MS that we\u2019re interested in that we have some partnerships that we\u2019ll continue to pursue. So, we see neuroscience as an important long-term growth driver for the company. We\u2019re obviously investing heavily across a number of areas. But we think about really in those four categories, and so it\u2019s one that we\u2019re obviously very excited about the future prospects for.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. You may ask your question.\nSteve Scala: Thank you so much. I\u2019m a bit surprised that how Cerevel was such a focus in the prepared remarks given the pending emraclidine data, which very much will color views of the Cerevel acquisition. Should we conclude you have increased confidence and or insight into the pending data? And related to that, KOLs seem to be looking for an effect size of 0.6. But based on what was just said, that doesn\u2019t even seem to be a possibility. So, any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you.\nRobert A. Michael: This is Rob and Roopal can take the second part. I\u2019ll take the first part of the question. So, Steve, in the prepared remarks, we were talking about the quarter. We obviously closed the Cerevel transaction in the quarter. That\u2019s a significant event. We also did see the Phase 3 trial results for tavapadon, so that was important to comment as well. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we expect the two pivotals from emraclidine to read out in the fourth quarter. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it other than it was an important event to highlight in the quarter.\nRoopal Thakkar: Yes. And it\u2019s Roopal. I agree. We have two positive Phase III studies with tavapadon. And in the oral space, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve seen a new mechanism that could have this type of approach in a very long time. So, it is important to discuss that because the unmet need continues to be very high and Parkinson\u2019s is a place where we believe we can meaningfully participate in. On the effect size question, when we look at the 1b data, it was more than a 12 point differential. So we have observed sometimes a decrement and the question was around if placebo responses move up a little bit. So that being said, we still think we can maintain a very strong effect size coupled with the safety profile. Remember that the issue here in therapy isn\u2019t just about efficacy, it\u2019s about maintaining these patients on a drug that they can tolerate. And the majority of these patients don\u2019t last very long and cycle through these assets and even stop these, especially atypicals without even letting their physicians know and then go on to have a flare and end up in the hospital. So, we think about this as a benefit, risk and tolerability profile and from a weight, metabolic, motor symptoms, sedation, these are major problems with atypicals. And with something like emraclidine, we feel that we can still fully differentiate. So, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d read into any concerns other than maybe seeing an effect that\u2019s slightly different than what we saw in Phase 1b. But beyond that, we think this could still be very competitive.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. You may ask your question.\nLuisa Hector: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Vraylar, could you expand a little on the comments of the channel mix pressure in Q3 and how that will play out as we move forward? And perhaps just a quick comment on the extension of the collaboration with Gedeon Richter and why you went down that route? Thank you.\nScott T. Reents: Luisa, this is Scott. I\u2019ll take the question regarding Vraylar. So, essentially it was a channel mix change. It was slight. I would tell you that really kind of had accumulated over the course of the year. And that\u2019s why we made, we decided it made sense to make the adjustment. So, as that channel mix change, we saw a little bit of negative price as a result of that. So, we took down the regular guidance by $100 million. Now, I would note in neuroscience in totality that was offset by the raise in Botox Therapeutics. So, neuroscience in our therapeutic or growth area guide is stable. So, maybe the second question will go to Roopal.\nRoopal Thakkar: Yes. It\u2019s Roopal. We expanded further. We\u2019ve had strong partnership. They\u2019re a terrific organization. We have a follow on to Vraylar that\u2019s more D3 meaning that will start entering the clinic quite soon in Phase II looking at bipolar depression and MDD as well as generalized anxiety disorder. As Rob described as part of our neuroscience strategy, psychiatry is a big part of that and having a deeper relationship with Gedeon Richter will allow us to have potentially even more assets in depression, in bipolar disorder, in schizophrenia and anxiety and potentially other adjacent indications that we continue to be interested in because the unmet need continues to be very high.\nLiz Shea: Well, thank you, and thanks, Shirley. That concludes our conference call today. If you\u2019d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation. And at this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Jeffrey R. Stewart",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the continued strong momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. I\u2019ll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $7 billion up 4.8% on an operational basis. Skyrizi global sales were $3.2 billion up 51.5% on an operational basis, exceeding our expectations. We are seeing robust prescription growth across psoriatic disease, with Skyrizi achieving in-play biologic share leadership in approximately now 30 key countries. In the U.S, we continue to capture nearly one out of every two in-play psoriatic disease patients on biologic therapy and we see substantial room for further total share growth. We believe that Skyrizi\u2019s best-in-class profile with nearly complete skin clearance, high durability of response, easy onboarding and quarterly dosing for maintenance therapy sets a very high bar relative to other therapies on market or in development. Skyrizi has also demonstrated a compelling clinical profile in IBD, including strong endoscopic data paired with convenient dosing. This differentiated profile as well as our compelling head-to-head sequence data versus Stelara is supporting very rapid uptake in Crohn\u2019s disease, where Skyrizi continues to gain market share globally, achieving in-play patient leadership across all lines of therapy in the U.S, Japan and Canada. Skyrizi\u2019s U.S. in-play patient share is now approximately 32%, more than double the share of the second biologic treatment. And with Skyrizi\u2019s total prescription share of approximately 8%, we see significant opportunity for revenue inflection in Crohn\u2019s going forward. While we are still very early in our launch in the U.S. and Europe, we also anticipate robust uptake for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis the new indication. Initial prescription trends as well as feedback from gastroenterologists have been overwhelmingly positive. Physicians are particularly impressed with the data that has been demonstrated for naive UC patients, who have not been exposed yet to biologics, where Skyrizi achieved very high results for clinical remission and endoscopic response. We have now secured broad formulary access for Skyrizi in UC, with sales in this indication expected to ramp meaningfully over the next several quarters. So, given the momentum we are seeing across all of these indications, we will be raising our full-year sales guidance once again for Skyrizi. Turning now to Rinvoq, which is also demonstrating robust growth. Global sales were $1.6 billion up 47.4% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong prescription growth across all seven of Rinvoq\u2019s approved indications. I\u2019m especially pleased with our performance in IBD, where Rinvoq\u2019s uptake is exceeding our expectations. Rinvoq is now capturing double-digit in-play patient share in the U.S. for ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn\u2019s disease. Both indications are now available in more than 75 countries with reimbursement and share continuing to increase. I also wanted to highlight our recent performance in atopic dermatitis, where Rinvoq is seeing an acceleration of in-play share following recent positive data from our second head-to-head study versus Dupixent. As an oral option that provides rapid skin clearance and itch relief, we believe Rinvoq\u2019s strong differentiated profile will continue to compete well in this highly underpenetrated AD market. As a result of this continued strong performance, we will also be increasing the full-year sales guidance once again for Rinvoq. Looking forward, we see substantial momentum for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq, including continued share gains across existing indications on top of the typical underlying market growth across room, derm and gastro. Additionally, we are making excellent progress with several new indications for Rinvoq across sizable markets that will have the potential to provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s. From a competitive perspective, a key element of Skyrizi and Rinvoq\u2019s success has been their strong differentiation with compelling head-to-head data against several novel therapies. This includes Skyrizi superiority versus Humira, Cosentyx, Otezla and Stelara in psoriasis as well as Stelara in Crohn\u2019s disease and Rinvoq superiority versus Humira and Orencia in rheumatoid arthritis as well as Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. To further support our differentiation, we have another head-to-head study ongoing for Skyrizi versus Sotyktu in psoriasis with plans also underway now for a study comparing Skyrizi versus Entyvio in ulcerative colitis. So given all of these factors, we feel very confident about the long-term growth prospects for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $2.2 billion down 36.5% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. While Humira share erosion to biosimilars in the U.S. is largely in-line with our expectations, we are now seeing more Humira molecule volume moving to other novel mechanisms than previously anticipated. So, while this has an unfavorable impact to Humira sales, we are seeing a benefit to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a very favorable dynamic for immunology portfolio now and certainly over the long-term. Moving now to Oncology, where total revenues were approximately $1.7 billion Imbruvica global revenues were $828 million down 8.8%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL, partially offset by higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta is performing extremely well. Global sales were $677 million up 18.2% on an operational basis. This reflects strong momentum in CLL, especially in Europe, where recent guideline changes recommend combination use of Venclexta Plus BTK inhibitors as a preferred fixed duration treatment versus continuous BTK treatment alone. Growth is also supported by our very strong share position in frontline AML, where Venclexta is the leading treatment for patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. We are also seeing nice sequential revenue growth from Elahere and Epkinly, which are both demonstrating strong launch trajectories. Turning now to neuroscience, where total revenues were more than $2.3 billion up 16% on an operational basis. Vraylar is demonstrating robust performance. Sales were $875 million up 16.6% on an operational basis, reflecting continued new prescription growth in both bipolar disorder and adjunctive MDD. Within migraine, our leading oral CGRP therapies contributed $445 million in combined revenue this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 22%, as we continue to see increasing prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Global Botox Therapeutic sales were $848 million reflecting strong performance in chronic migraine as well as the other approved indications. Finally, we are very excited for the recent U.S. approval of Vyalev, a transformative therapy for patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease, who are uncontrolled on oral therapy alone. As a less invasive, non-surgical delivery system that can provide meaningful improvements in on-time and off-time, we believe Vyalev has the potential to significantly expand use beyond current device aided therapies. Sales in the U.S. for Vyalev are expected to ramp gradually over the next several quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination. At the same time, we are very encouraged by the interest in uptake internationally, where we have approval now in 35 countries with several thousand patients already on treatment. Longer-term, we anticipate peak sales of Vyalev to exceed $1 billion. So overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the continued commercial execution and performance across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Carrie, for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? Yes. Thanks, Rob. And, I\u2019ll just add a little bit more flavor. It\u2019s Jeff. So, we saw this trend start to emerge in terms of this compression of the, let\u2019s say, the ADAM molecule or the ADAM market, the Humira plus biosimilars, just prior to the CVS event and then it accelerated over Q2. And again, we saw it throughout Q3. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve adapted our approach here. Other than this dynamic, the biosimilar dynamics are playing out really exactly as we anticipated. And you can see this compression in the IQVIA data. So, really the shrinking of the Humira or the ADAM market is something that\u2019s quite clear. It\u2019s a little difficult quantify over time with full precision, but we can see that the molecule continues to decline sequentially and we continue to see strong share gains as I highlighted for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So, this incremental flow from the molecule compression, it\u2019s clearly a contributing factor to some of the over performance that we saw in Q2 and Q3, but it\u2019s really only one of several. We\u2019ve also had significant incremental investments in the consumer space, the sales force approaches we\u2019ve taken, Chris, the integration of the head-to-head data I talked about. And, certainly now we\u2019re starting to see the impact of the UC launch. So, when we put all that together, we think that the dynamics are net-net quite positive overall. And, as Rob said, we\u2019re still looking good for 25%. Yes. Hi, it\u2019s Jeff. So yes, contracting is very, very close to wrapping up. We have a few more nuances and so typically that may take another month or so. Overall, we\u2019re making very good progress on contracting next year. So, in terms of what we\u2019ve highlighted in the past is we do not anticipate any material change for Skyrizi and Rinvoq in terms of the access for next year across Medicare or the commercial plans. We have quite high, very broad access and we assume that will continue. In terms of what we\u2019ve highlighted to anticipate, we\u2019ve said that we do have over our near-term in LRP sort of a negative pricing environment, but it\u2019s modest. It\u2019s nothing like we saw many quarters ago where we had seven indications. So, we said from a rebate perspective, low single digit changes is a reasonable assumption that we feel confident in despite we\u2019re not fully complete, I think that\u2019s a fair assessment at this point."

            "name": "Roopal Thakkar",
            "content": "Thank you, Carrie. Starting with immunology, where we recently began our Phase 2 Crohn\u2019s disease platform study, which will evaluate Skyrizi in combination with several other novel biologics. This study will initially look at combinations of Skyrizi with our anti-IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2 bispecific lutikizumab and our novel anti-\u03b14\u03b27 antibody ABBV-382. We are planning to include additional novel biologics in the future. Our approach in immunology has been to pursue therapies that are well differentiated and have the potential to elevate standard of care. We have clearly achieved this with Rinvoq and Skyrizi across multiple indications, including Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. As we think about how the IBD market will evolve, we view dual mechanism approaches as having the greatest potential to achieve levels of efficacy that are above current standard of care. We are very excited about the potential for these combination therapies in IBD and we look forward to sharing updates as the data mature. In Oncology, we continue to make very good progress across all stages of our hem and solid tumor pipeline. In the area of solid tumors, we recently submitted our application to the FDA for accelerated approval of Teliso-V as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Once approved, Teliso-V will become the first c-Met targeted ADC to enter non-small cell lung cancer, a segment with limited options and where patients tend to have a very poor prognosis, especially if their tumors express c-Met. We anticipate an approval decision in the first half of 2025. In the quarter, we also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending Elahere for the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer in patients with high expression of FR\u03b1 and treated with up to three prior therapies. This decision was based on the positive Phase 3 MIRASOL trial where Elahere demonstrated an overall survival benefit and significantly reduce the risk of cancer progression. We anticipate an approval decision in Europe in the fourth quarter. At the recent ESMO Congress we presented new Phase 1 data for ABBV-400 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. Early efficacy data from the lung cohort are promising with an objective response rate of 48% across all patients in the study and response rates ranging from 60% to 78% in patients with overexpressed c-Met. We are very pleased with the level of activity we\u2019re seeing from our next generation c-Met ADC, which compares favorably to Teliso-V, where we\u2019ve seen objective response rates ranging from 23% in medium c-Met expressors to 35% in patients with high c-Met expression. 400 has the potential to expand our c-Met portfolio into earlier lines of therapy and lower levels of c-Met expression in lung cancer. Similarly, in patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer, 400 demonstrated promising activity with an objective response rate of 29% across all patients. This compares well against combination and single agent chemotherapy, which are the standards of care for patients in second line and third line of therapy respectively. Based on these encouraging preliminary data, we plan to begin Phase 2 studies for 400 in both non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. Recall, we\u2019ve also advanced 400 in late line colorectal cancer and we remain on-track to begin a Phase 3 study later this year. In the area of hematologic oncology, we received approval in Europe for Tepkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of therapy. Epcoritamab is now the only T-cell engaging bispecific approved in the U.S. and Europe to treat both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Moving to neuroscience, we recently received FDA approval for Vyalev as the first subcutaneous 24 hour infusion of levodopa based therapy for the treatment of motor fluctuations in adults with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery offers meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development. Vyalev delivers significant improvements in on-time and off-time with a non-surgical 24 hour delivery system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by Duopa and it doesn\u2019t require combination with oral drugs to achieve efficacy. We\u2019re extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in the U.S. We also recently announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 TEMPO-1 trial, which evaluated fixed doses of monotherapy tavapadon in early Parkinson\u2019s disease. In the study, both doses of tavapadon met the primary endpoint demonstrating a significant reduction in the severity of Parkinson\u2019s disease symptoms compared with placebo at week 26, as measured by decreases in the combined scores for Parts 2 and 3 of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale. Key secondary endpoints were also met in this study. We are very pleased with the emerging profile for tavapadon, which shows it is generally safe and well tolerated and it can drive strong efficacy as a monotherapy in early Parkinson\u2019s and as an adjunctive treatment in patients with more advanced disease. Results from the two Phase 3 studies thus far look favorable compared to other dopamine agonists on the market. And, we believe tavapadon has the potential to become an important new treatment option as a monotherapy for Parkinson\u2019s patients as well as an adjunct to oral levo/carbidopa. We expect to see results from TEMPO-2 later this year, which is our Phase 3 monotherapy study evaluating a flexible dose of tavapadon. Results from our long-term safety study, TEMPO-4 are expected next year. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to share data from the two emraclidine pivotal studies in the fourth quarter. We also continue to invest in external innovation to strengthen our neuroscience pipeline. We recently announced two deals in this area, including an expanded collaboration with Gedeon Richter to develop novel targets for neuropsychiatric conditions and the acquisition of Aliada brings an anti-pyroglutamate A\u03b2 antibody, which uses a unique blood brain barrier crossing and amyloid aggregate clearing technology. Aliada\u2019s lead antibody has been able to achieve encouraging levels in cerebrospinal fluid with an extended half-life and the potential to be delivered subcutaneously. This molecule could become a best-in-class treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Aliada\u2019s novel technologies for enabling therapeutics to access the central nervous system also have the potential to be used with other programs across our neuroscience pipeline. In aesthetics, we recently received approval for Botox in the U.S. for moderate to severe platysma bands, marking the first global approval in this indication for any neurotoxin. There is currently a lack of non-surgical treatments available to improve the appearance of prominent platysma bands. And, we believe Botox will represent an important new treatment option for patients who are looking to reduce the appearance of vertical neck bands and improve jawline definition. In our novel toxin portfolio, we remain on-track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E around the end of this year. Our rapid onset short acting toxin has a highly differentiated clinical profile and once approved will offer patients a novel option compared to currently available neurotoxins. So in summary, this has been a very productive year thus far for our R&D organization and we are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made advancing our broad pipeline. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to, Scott. Mohit, it\u2019s Roopal. I\u2019ll take that one. So, when we look at the data, in particular, I think Jeff highlighted this, in ulcerative colitis with Skyrizi in this naive patient population, this is a patient population that hasn\u2019t seen biologics or other advanced therapies like JAK inhibitors. The endoscopic improvement and this is in label was 76% in the maintenance portion of this. So, it was quite high, in fact, higher than what we\u2019ve observed even with Rinvoq. So that gave us a good amount of confidence that we have the potential to differentiate with all other assets. You heard about the Skyrizi versus, ustekinumab head to head in Crohn\u2019s disease, but this one gives us a unique opportunity there to go head to head with vedolizumab, especially looking at endoscopic improvement. So, for that particular endpoint, you asked about the type of endpoint. There we would think about superiority, because of it being an objective endpoint. Sometimes with symptoms like clinical remission, these could bounce around. That may be one where we consider as non-inferiority. But I would say endoscopic improvements in the field are now believed to be highly predictive of long-term outcomes. So, that would be how we\u2019re looking at this, Mohit. Yes, Vamil, it\u2019s Roopal. I\u2019ll take that one. So, a couple of things. Maybe starting with what we\u2019ve observed with the approval. So, we were encouraged by the lack of a boxed warning, meaning there\u2019s a recognition that this is a unique mechanism of action looking specifically at the muscarinic class. So, we were pleased to see that. I think what was notable for us was the GI adverse events, including how that would play out in terms of longer-term tolerability. Also anticholinergic effects, bladder retention that was something I guess we did not anticipate. You mentioned hepatic monitoring that was something that we didn\u2019t anticipate. The other thing that was notable is along with the BID dosing, there is a food effect. So, you have to wait a certain period amount of time when you eat and after you eat when you can take the pill. So, when we think about our profile, we continue to be encouraged with emraclidine being a single agent, once a day, no food effect. We don\u2019t see the extent of GI effects. We don\u2019t and we have not observed in the Phase 1b data any bladder issues. And when we had looked at that 1b data, we didn\u2019t see any hepatic issues, so we don\u2019t anticipate any type of laboratory monitoring. We were also thinking about neurodegeneration associated psychosis and these patients are typically older and likely more sensitive to anticholinergic effects. So, we continue to see an opportunity in that patient population as well. So, we\u2019ve stated that the data will read out here in the next couple of months in the quarter. The same team is working on wrapping up these two studies. So, depending on how far apart the data are, we\u2019ll probably determine as you stated, is it 1 or 2 press releases. It\u2019s a little early right now for us to tell you is it going to be 1 or 2. But if they\u2019re going to be close together, it\u2019s potentially going to be 1. Hi, Chris. It\u2019s Roopal. I\u2019ll take that one. With respect to the oral, I\u2019ll take us back to the Skyrizi head-to-head that occurred with apremilast, which is also an oral. The data were substantially higher from an efficacy standpoint for Skyrizi as was the tolerability along with when we asked patients what did they prefer, they actually preferred quarterly subcutaneous dosing. So, I would think about it that way as well. Now the question would be, it\u2019s a similar mechanism, could the efficacy be better than what has been observed with a apremilast in psoriasis? Well, what we saw in the Phase 2 data, my recollection still is that Skyrizi is a full 50% higher when it comes to full skin clearance at a PASI 100. And that\u2019s where the bar is now at PASI 90 and PASI 100. So, we still see an efficacy advantage. Also the data I\u2019m sharing are Phase 3 Skyrizi data. The data that we saw for the oral 23 was from Phase 2. So, there is a reasonable potential that the efficacy data tend to settle down when you go to a broader patient population, especially those that have had longer standing disease or have seen other therapies like other biologics. So, we continue to feel very good and optimistic about our profile versus any emerging competition. Also, we think about our assets from a global standpoint. And when you think about majority of the countries, they are very driven by efficacy to gain access. And in the oral space, we don\u2019t really see it across the globe. Maybe there\u2019s a couple of countries. I think Jeff has mentioned the U.S., but that space may be referred to as a pre biologic space. So maybe more of an influence on the TIK2 or on a apremilast is how we see it. In terms of other mechanisms that we like, as I mentioned, we like anti L23 the way it\u2019s delivered with Skyrizi, the depth of response, the high durability and the convenience with quarterly dosing. If we can couple that with other assets as part of our combination approach, we think that\u2019s going to be extremely competitive in the future. Mechanisms like TL1a, we think are going to be important, especially from a combination approach, which we have one internally. We think the ulcerative colitis data are encouraging, but from a monotherapy standpoint, not differentiated, especially when you look at the Skyrizi data that I mentioned earlier and Rinvoq. And then in Crohn\u2019s, something like TL1a, we think it really does need a combo. So that\u2019ll be part of our platform along with our novel alpha 4 beta 7, we think that\u2019s also a good combo. And then we\u2019ve also provided very strong data in hidradenitis suppurativa with our IL-1 alpha beta lutikizumab. And we\u2019ve seen some preclinical signals that IL-1 beta could be a driver of disease and resistance to other biologics. So, lutikizumab will also be part of the combo in our IBD platform. So, that\u2019s just some of the mechanisms that we\u2019re excited about. There are several others that are early in the pipeline and we will give you more information about those as the data mature. Thanks, James. It\u2019s Roopal. When we did our thorough diligence, that was a major question that we and the broader team had. So, you bring up a good point. Some things that we observed in those two studies that will be the pivotal readouts were what Cerevel was strategically doing. One thing was limiting the number of countries, limiting the number of sites, central review for eligibility criteria, training of raters, certifying those raters, recertifying raters, monitoring blinded data with respect to site activity. So, I think those are important factors that could drive placebo in either direction. So, what we observed was, we would say a good control or at least the best one could do to manage placebo responses. So, it\u2019s hard to know what if there\u2019s any erosion until we see the data. But the effect size that we did see in the Phase 1b was a little over 12 points. So, we think that was a strong separation. And even if that were to go down a little bit, we still feel that based on the safety profile and tolerability profile, this could still be very, very competitive even if we saw a droppage in some point on the efficacy side. Sure. It\u2019s Roopal. I\u2019ll take that. Yes, we\u2019ve been investing for a number of years in the space. And in addition to the recent deal, we\u2019ll have an option readout with Alector and TREM2 coming up. We have SV2A molecule that would look at cognition and other symptoms. Emraclidine could participate in that space from an Alzheimer\u2019s psychosis standpoint. We have other pipeline assets that are looking at tau, intracellular and even an approach looking at extracellular tau. We did have our own A beta monotherapeutic antibody, which we did read out. It did look good, but it wasn\u2019t fully differentiated. And moving on to the Aliada deal, what we see there is the ability to access the CSF at what we would say at this stage at higher concentrations than maybe other competitors. So, we think that\u2019s a good thing. The other aspect that we like is an extended half-life. So that could lead to convenient dosing. And if this approach plays out than one could consider having subcutaneous dosing even getting out to monthly. And if the efficacy is high because of deeper brain penetration that could result in lower levels, faster and a better able to see cognition benefit in a year or 18 months. So, those are some of the benefits that we would see. The other benefit would be getting to the parenchymal tissue more broadly and that could have a reduction in ARIA, which is probably what is disallowing this to really take off. It\u2019s very challenging to take an elderly family member to get multiple scans and worry about them having stroke like symptoms. So, that would be something else we believe we can address with this asset of having a strong safety profile, tolerability, ease of onboarding and high efficacy and ultimately strong benefits on cognition. Yes. And it\u2019s Roopal. I agree. We have two positive Phase III studies with tavapadon. And in the oral space, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve seen a new mechanism that could have this type of approach in a very long time. So, it is important to discuss that because the unmet need continues to be very high and Parkinson\u2019s is a place where we believe we can meaningfully participate in. On the effect size question, when we look at the 1b data, it was more than a 12 point differential. So we have observed sometimes a decrement and the question was around if placebo responses move up a little bit. So that being said, we still think we can maintain a very strong effect size coupled with the safety profile. Remember that the issue here in therapy isn\u2019t just about efficacy, it\u2019s about maintaining these patients on a drug that they can tolerate. And the majority of these patients don\u2019t last very long and cycle through these assets and even stop these, especially atypicals without even letting their physicians know and then go on to have a flare and end up in the hospital. So, we think about this as a benefit, risk and tolerability profile and from a weight, metabolic, motor symptoms, sedation, these are major problems with atypicals. And with something like emraclidine, we feel that we can still fully differentiate. So, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d read into any concerns other than maybe seeing an effect that\u2019s slightly different than what we saw in Phase 1b. But beyond that, we think this could still be very competitive. Yes. It\u2019s Roopal. We expanded further. We\u2019ve had strong partnership. They\u2019re a terrific organization. We have a follow on to Vraylar that\u2019s more D3 meaning that will start entering the clinic quite soon in Phase II looking at bipolar depression and MDD as well as generalized anxiety disorder. As Rob described as part of our neuroscience strategy, psychiatry is a big part of that and having a deeper relationship with Gedeon Richter will allow us to have potentially even more assets in depression, in bipolar disorder, in schizophrenia and anxiety and potentially other adjacent indications that we continue to be interested in because the unmet need continues to be very high."

            "name": "Robert A. Michael",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. AbbVie is performing exceptionally well, and I\u2019m extremely pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities, including continued double-digit sales growth from our ex-Humira platform, the closing and integration of Cerevel Therapeutics and the progress we are making to build and advance a compelling pipeline of innovative medicines. Turning to our results, AbbVie\u2019s diversified portfolio delivered sales that were $260 million above our expectations and reflect robust mid-single-digit operational sales growth. Our ex-Humira platform drove this over achievement, including growth of nearly 18%. The momentum of Skyrizi and Rinvoq is especially impressive with combined sales expected to exceed $17 billion this year, which is $1.3 billion above our initial expectations. And, we see substantial opportunity for continued strong growth well into the next decade. Several other key products also delivered double-digit sales growth, including Venclexta, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and Qulipta. This broad-based performance further demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. For the third time this year, we are raising our full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We are increasing our full-year revenue guidance by $500 million and have now raised total revenue by $1.8 billion since our initial guidance in February. We are also raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 and now expect adjusted EPS between $10.90 and $10.94. In addition to achieving strong quarterly results, we have been very focused on investing in the business to generate sustainable long-term performance in the 2030s and beyond. During the quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, strengthening our neuroscience pipeline. Cerevel enhances our ability to help patients suffering from devastating conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s and schizophrenia. The integration has been seamless and we are excited to have the talented Cerevel team join our organization. Within the Cerevel pipeline, we are very pleased with the positive Phase 3 results and emerging profile of tavapadon in Parkinson\u2019s. And, we remain on-track to read out both pivotal studies for emraclidine in schizophrenia in the fourth quarter. More broadly on the pipeline, we have been advancing key R&D programs across all stages of development. Some notable highlights include the U.S. approvals of Vyalev for advanced Parkinson\u2019s and Botox for platysma bands. The U.S. regulatory submission of Teliso-V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, and the start of our Phase 2 Crohn\u2019s platform study, which is evaluating Skyrizi in combination with several novel biologics. In summary, AbbVie continues to demonstrate strong commercial, operational and R&D execution. The robust performance of our growth platform once again exceeded our expectations and we see numerous opportunities to drive long-term growth. Further underscoring our confidence in that growth, today we announced a 5.8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2025. Since inception, we have increased our quarterly dividend by more than 300%. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff, for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Rob. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll have Jeff supplement. So yes, we are very confident in that robust mid-single-digit growth, both topline, bottom line for 2025. I think you\u2019ve interpreted correctly that the trends we\u2019re seeing are net positive and that we\u2019re seeing over performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq more than offsetting the dynamics with Humira. And so, as we look at consensus, that\u2019s probably not reflected. So, I think it\u2019s fair to say, there\u2019s a shift that\u2019s required there, but we\u2019re very pleased with the strong uptake for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. As I mentioned in my remarks, we have now delivered guidance increases of $1.3 billion for Skyrizi and Rinvoq in total. We\u2019re seeing tremendous momentum, particularly with the IBD indications across really all indications, but particularly in IBD. And, we are starting to see the dynamic with the overall Humira molecule, where there is the switching that we\u2019re seeing now to other mechanisms, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a long-term very positive benefit. So, as we look at the business, we\u2019re very well-positioned. Essentially two years after the U.S. Humira LOE, we\u2019ll be returning to robust top line and bottom line growth, and really performance across many parts of the business, not just Skyrizi and Rinvoq. You\u2019ve seen us perform very nicely in oncology. We\u2019ve obviously over performed our expectations in oncology, very pleased with the earlier returns on Elahere. Venclexta is performing exceptionally well. The guidelines changes in Europe are positive as we think about combination opportunities with BTK inhibitors. So, Venclexta is going to be strong, Epkinly is performing very nicely as well. And, then when I look across the neuroscience franchise, Vraylar is a strong grower. We\u2019re very pleased with the migraine portfolio. Obviously, very excited about Cerevel and doing a number of deals now on the early pipeline both with Gedeon Richter and Aliada that really fortifies the long-term view for neuroscience as well. And, then with aesthetics, while it\u2019s below our expectations for this year, obviously the economic conditions have dictated that. We still have tremendous confidence in the long-term outlook for that business. But, as we look at 2025, we\u2019re very confident in our ability to return to that robust mid-single-digit growth. Thanks for the question. This is Rob. I\u2019ll take that one. So, as we think about the long-term guide, which is greater than $9 billion by 2029, you need to believe that you can have essentially a compound growth around 11% to get there. If we look at the historical growth of this market, it\u2019s been, let\u2019s say, call it low double digits, low teens. As we look at it going forward, we think probably a more prudent assumption is when we see the recovery, something more in the high single digits, right? So, you need something beyond just the market recovery to get there. And when we look at our the innovation that we\u2019re bringing particularly with the short onset, short acting or fast onset short acting BoNT/E that we expect to launch in \u201826. That could really transform the market, because if you think about the number one barrier for patients is fear of an unnatural look. That could really unlock a part of the market that\u2019s dormant right now, plus it could also lead to share gains. And so I think we need to see, 1, how the market recovers, I would say, 2025 and 26 and then ultimately see how the BoNT/E launch ramps in \u201826. At that point, we\u2019ll have a better sense of the $9 billion as we sit here today. If you believe that the market will recover to high single digits and we have a lot of confidence in BoNT/E, we still believe we can get there, which is why we\u2019re not updating that guidance. But I would expect us to reflect more on that more likely in the \u201826 timeframe than in \u201825. Thanks for the question, Geoff. So, this is Rob. So yes, I mean, our main focus is our five key growth areas, which includes eye care, includes immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. And we participate in large markets with high unmet need that have great growth potential. And within those five verticals, we\u2019re building depth across 24 core areas that does include eye care as well. When you think about diabetic retinopathy, wet AMD, prescription dry eye medications. And so eye care does play an important role, albeit it\u2019s not as high of a growth driver as the other four verticals, but it is part of our five. And that ultimately guides both our internal R&D investments as well as our BD efforts, which as you know, continue to be very active. So, far this year, we\u2019ve executed 15 deals along those lines, really focused more on early stage opportunities to drive growth in the next decade. So that\u2019s our primary focus. Now if we see an opportunity for differentiation in a large market with high unmet need like metabolics, we would consider pursuing it, especially if we can help drive growth in the next decade. But again, it would be more opportunistic. We have to see differentiation and right now it\u2019s not our primary focus. But again, we\u2019re open to more sources of growth for the next decade if we see differentiation that we can create value. And we certainly have the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities. And this is Rob. I\u2019ll just add on here as we think about strategically about the neuroscience franchise. I mean, I think about it as having really four main segments, psychiatry, migraine, Parkinson\u2019s and then neurodegeneration. And if you look at what we\u2019ve done to build out the long-term growth outlook for this franchise, obviously, in psychiatry between Cereval, Gedeon Richter, we also had the early stage opportunity with Gilgamesh, really investing in longer term growth in psychiatry. We have actually a very strong franchise in migraine with the oral CGRPs as well as Botox Therapeutic. In Parkinson\u2019s, now the launch of Vyalev, which is performing very nicely outside the U.S., and we expect will also perform nicely in the U.S. The early Phase 3 data we\u2019ve seen so far for davapidone, the mitokinin disease modifying approach, it\u2019s early and Parkinson\u2019s is another investment we\u2019ve made. And then in Alzheimer\u2019s now with Aliada is another I\u2019d say, long-term investment we\u2019re making to grow the neuroscience franchise. There\u2019s also adjacencies like ALS, MS that we\u2019re interested in that we have some partnerships that we\u2019ll continue to pursue. So, we see neuroscience as an important long-term growth driver for the company. We\u2019re obviously investing heavily across a number of areas. But we think about really in those four categories, and so it\u2019s one that we\u2019re obviously very excited about the future prospects for. This is Rob and Roopal can take the second part. I\u2019ll take the first part of the question. So, Steve, in the prepared remarks, we were talking about the quarter. We obviously closed the Cerevel transaction in the quarter. That\u2019s a significant event. We also did see the Phase 3 trial results for tavapadon, so that was important to comment as well. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we expect the two pivotals from emraclidine to read out in the fourth quarter. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it other than it was an important event to highlight in the quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our third quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3 which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.04 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $14.5 billion reflecting robust growth of 4.9% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Our ex-Humira growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie\u2019s total sales, delivered reported growth of nearly 18%, once again exceeding our expectations. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.7% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.4%, adjusted R&D expense of 14.2%, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.6% and adjusted SG&A expense of 23%. Net interest expense was $591 million. The adjusted tax rate was 16.2%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $10.94. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $56 billion, an increase of $500 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.7% unfavorable impact on full-year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updates to select key products and therapeutic areas. We now approximate Skyrizi global sales of $11.5 billion, an increase of $500 million due to continued strong performance across all approved indications. Rinvoq total revenue of $5.8 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting robust uptake in IBD. U.S. Humira total sales of $7.4 billion a decrease of $400 million reflecting more Humira molecule volume moving to other novel mechanisms, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Imbruvica totaled revenue of $3.3 billion an increase of $200 million reflecting higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta total sales of $2.6 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting momentum in both U.S. and international markets. Aesthetics global revenue of $5.3 billion a decrease of $200 million almost entirely due to lower Juvederm volume which continues to be impacted by challenging economic conditions in key markets. Vraylar total sales of $3.3 billion a decrease of $100 million reflecting continued strong prescription demand partially offset by modestly unfavorable channel mix. And for Botox, we now expect global revenue in the therapeutic space of $3.3 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting robust demand across all indications. Moving to the P&L for 2024. We continue to forecast a full-year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% as well as an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales, which includes a 2.1% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Turning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues approaching $14.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.94 and $2.98. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter and excludes any potential impact from the recently announced acquisition of Aliada Therapeutics. Finally, AbbVie\u2019s robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of September was nearly $7.3 billion and we generated more than $11 billion of free cash flow, which includes approximately $1.5 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments in the first nine-months of the year. This free cash flow fully supports a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we are increasing 5.8% to $1.64 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in 2025, as well as debt repayment, where we remain on-track to pay down the roughly $7 billion of maturities this year and anticipate achieving a net leverage ratio of two times by the end of 2026. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for additional business development. We have executed more than a dozen early stage deals so far this year, and we continue to assess external innovation across all of our key growth areas. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered strong top and bottom line results. I\u2019m very pleased with the momentum of our ex-Humira growth platform, including continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which further supports AbbVie\u2019s long-term outlook. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz. Luisa, this is Scott. I\u2019ll take the question regarding Vraylar. So, essentially it was a channel mix change. It was slight. I would tell you that really kind of had accumulated over the course of the year. And that\u2019s why we made, we decided it made sense to make the adjustment. So, as that channel mix change, we saw a little bit of negative price as a result of that. So, we took down the regular guidance by $100 million. Now, I would note in neuroscience in totality that was offset by the raise in Botox Therapeutics. So, neuroscience in our therapeutic or growth area guide is stable. So, maybe the second question will go to Roopal."

            "name": "Carrie Strom",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Third quarter global aesthetics sales were more than $1.2 billion representing growth of 1.8% on an operational basis. In the U.S, aesthetic sales of $791 million increased by 3.9%, driven by growth from Botox Cosmetic as well as other brands across our broad portfolio. U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $414 million an increase of 6.5% versus the prior year. Favorable pricing dynamics and facial toxin market growth more than offset modest share erosion. Botox Cosmetics remains the clear market leader. U.S. Juvederm sales were $105 million. Juvederm\u2019s market-leading share was consistent with last year and the overall filler market was roughly flat to the prior year. While the U.S. facial injectable market remains largely stable, growth is below historical rates. As a result, there is a reluctance from customers to maintain traditional toxin and filler inventory levels. Based upon the relatively higher price point of filler procedures in a still challenging U.S. economic environment, Juvederm is more impacted by this dynamic, which can be seen in third quarter results. Internationally, aesthetic sales were $448 million reflecting a decline of 1.6% on an operational basis. Within China, the economic dynamics that weighed on our results during the first half of the year have continued to impact consumer spending. This has created challenging aesthetic market conditions that have been particularly impactful to Juvederm\u2019s performance. Primarily due to this circumstance, we are moderating our Juvederm sales outlook for the year. We are encouraged by the recently announced government stimulus in China. We will continue to monitor for any further developments and how it could positively impact consumer discretionary spending and aesthetic market growth. Although the current dynamics in China are challenging, its potential remains attractive and we are committed to bring innovation to this market that will drive long-term growth. Along those lines, in China, we recently received approval for the Botox Cosmetic indication in masseter muscle prominence, marking the first toxin in the world to have this indication. This approval enables us to market and train to this important treatment option that addresses a top aesthetic concern among many Asian patients. In the U.S., we are pleased that we received FDA approval for the use of Botox Cosmetic to treat platysma bands. This approval positions Botox as the only cosmetic toxin with four distinct indications and enables us to market and train beyond the face for the improvement of neck and jawline appearance. We also remain excited about the opportunity for BoNT/E. Based upon its rapid onset and short acting profile, BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients that are hesitant to try facial toxins, driving long-term market expansion. Looking to the future, we continue to see significant growth potential for our aesthetics portfolio based upon low market penetration rates, our commitment to introduce novel treatments, our strong customer relationships and our position as the global aesthetics leader. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roopal."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\nLiz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics. Before we get started, I\u2019ll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.

On today\u2019s conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie\u2019s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll take your questions. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Michael: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak with you today as AbbVie\u2019s new CEO. I look forward to building on our track record of success and delivering on AbbVie\u2019s promise to our patients, employees, shareholders and communities. As we begin this new chapter, nearly every aspect of AbbVie\u2019s business is performing at or above our expectations. We are demonstrating a rapid return to revenue growth, with operational sales up nearly 4% through the first half of this year, including robust mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. Our ex-Humira growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie\u2019s total sales, will outperform our initial full year sales guidance by more than $1 billion, driven by strong performance in immunology and oncology. In addition, U.S. Humira performance continues to meet our expectations, having achieved or exceeded our guidance in all six quarters with biosimilar competition. The strong performance across our diversified portfolio will drive top-tier high single-digit compound growth through the end of this decade, which will support continued investment to drive growth in the next decade. Turning to our results, I\u2019m especially pleased with immunology, where our leading portfolio is delivering performance well above our expectations. Skyrizi continues to demonstrate strong momentum in psoriasis and Crohn\u2019s disease, where we have substantial headroom for additional share gains and the recent approval in UC will add another source of long-term growth. Rinvoq is also delivering robust growth across all approved indications. We are making excellent progress with late-stage development in five additional indications that we anticipate will launch in the second half of this decade. In oncology, Elahere has accelerated our on-market presence in solid tumors. We also have several exciting pipeline programs, including two novel c-Met ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, as well as 383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma. In neuroscience, our leading therapies for migraine and mood disorders continue to gain share and are competitively well-positioned. The pending acquisition of Cerevel will further augment our neuroscience pipeline and we\u2019re excited about what our two companies can achieve together to make a difference for patients with neuropsych disorders. We have certified substantial compliance to the FTC second request and anticipate the Cerevel transaction will close soon. Lastly, we\u2019ve been very active with business development, investing in exciting opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. Through the first half of this year, we have executed nearly a dozen early-stage deals. These include promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard-of-care in immunology, oncology and neuroscience. In summary, I\u2019m very pleased with the strong momentum of our business. AbbVie\u2019s results once again exceed our expectations and we are raising guidance for the second time this year, underscoring our confidence in the business. The robust performance of our growth platform and the advancement of our pipeline supports AbbVie\u2019s top-tier long-term outlook. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I\u2019ll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7 billion. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $4.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 50% in their fifth full year on the market. These assets are approved across a broad set of indications and are collectively supported by nine compelling head-to-head studies that demonstrate clear differentiation across multiple novel therapies, which has resulted in strong share capture. For Skyrizi, we continue to advance our clear leadership position in psoriasis, where total prescription share of the U.S. biologic market has increased to approximately 38%. Share is also ramping nicely in PSA, especially in the dermatology segment, where Skyrizi has achieved roughly 15% total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market. And for Rinvoq, we are seeing increasing share across each of the rheum indications, as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis, including total prescription share of 10% in the U.S. We are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq are on pace to double their respective sales in IBD this year. The adoption in Crohn\u2019s disease has been impressive, with Skyrizi and Rinvoq now achieving a combined in-place share in the U.S. of more than 40%. Skyrizi has achieved overall in-place share leadership in Crohn\u2019s, with in-place share approximately now 13 points ahead of Stelara, following our compelling head-to-head sequence data published last year. This positive trial, which demonstrated Skyrizi\u2019s high efficacy versus Stelara, including a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission has driven a significant inflection in performance and we anticipate continued share momentum. Commercialization for Skyrizi and ulcerative colitis is now underway in the U.S., with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the next several months. Early feedback from gastroenterologists has been very encouraging, with Skyrizi\u2019s UC data viewed as impressive, particularly for na\u00efve patients who have not been exposed to biologics. We also expect the European launch in the coming months. We also see very robust adoption of Rinvoq in UC, where the brand is now achieving a leading in-place share in the U.S. Internationally, Rinvoq UC is now approved in 75 countries, with reimbursement and share gaining momentum. Having two novel therapies that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy to treat both of these IBD conditions demonstrates our commitment to transforming the treatment landscape for physicians and patients in this area of high unmet need. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $2.8 billion, down 28.9% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. was in line with our expectations in the quarter and our guidance complicates -- contemplates the impact of additional formulary changes over the course of the year. Importantly, we continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.6 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $833 million, down 8.2, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $637 million, up 15.8 on an operational basis, with strong momentum across CLL and AML. Elahere is also performing very well, with sales of $128 million and our compelling overall survival data, recent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines and the expansion of commercial resources will continue to drive rapid uptake. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with the prescription trends for Epkinly in DLBCL. Commercialization is now underway for Epkinly\u2019s second indication, follicular lymphoma, in the U.S., with European approval expected later this year. Neuroscience total revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar, with global sales of $774 million, Ubrelvy with total revenue of $231 million and Qulipta with global sales of $150 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well-positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $814 million, up 9.6% on an operational basis. Finally, we are pleased with the early launch trends for 951 in Japan and Europe, and look forward to bringing this innovative therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s to the U.S. soon. Overall, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\nCarrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Second quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, representing growth of 2.8% on an operational basis. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $863 million increased by 4.4%, driven by Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm growth of 7.1% and 10.4%, respectively. This toxin and filler performance is supported by a consistent recovery in the facial injectable market, as the number of procedures in both categories increased by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. However, this level of market growth was lower than previously anticipated. Sales for Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm also benefited from a partial reversal of the prior quarter\u2019s inventory destock, which was related to the timing of certain promotional activities. From a competitive perspective, our U.S. facial injectable portfolio remains the clear market leader, with strong and stable market share. Internationally, second quarter aesthetic sales were $527 million, roughly flat versus the prior year on an operational basis, as declines in China were balanced by growth in other international markets. In China, our largest international market, sales growth continued to be impacted by sustained economic headwinds, as well as a challenging comparison to the second quarter of last year, which benefited from a strong post-COVID recovery. Consistent with what we experienced in the U.S., economic challenges have impacted Juvederm sales growth more than other areas of our portfolio, based upon Juvederm\u2019s relatively higher price point. Looking to the rest of the year, we expect our market-leading aesthetics portfolio to continue to perform well from a competitive perspective across the globe. As we evaluate market dynamics and leading economic indicators, particularly in the U.S. and China, market growth trends are below our prior expectations. Based upon this, we have moderated our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite this near-term dynamic, we remain confident in the long-term growth outlook of our aesthetics portfolio. Global market penetration rates are extremely low and we expect long-term market growth to accelerate from current levels as economic conditions improve. As the market leader, we are also committed to driving growth by activating new patients and launching innovative treatment options. For example, in China, launch activities are underway for the Botox Cosmetic masseter muscle prominence indication. And in the U.S., we will soon launch Juvederm VOLUMA XC for the treatment of temple hollowing and we expect an approval for Botox Cosmetic in the platysma prominence indication by the end of the year. Pipeline catalysts like these in the key U.S. and China markets, along with our significant investment in consumer activation, injector training and practice support, will enable us to grow the aesthetics market and maintain our clear leadership position over the long-term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roopal.\nRoopal Thakkar: Thank you, Carrie. We continue to make very good progress advancing our pipeline with several regulatory and clinical milestones since our last earnings call. I will start with immunology. We received FDA approval for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which marks its second inflammatory bowel disease indication. Skyrizi is now the only IL-23 specific inhibitor approved for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Skyrizi has proven to be a highly effective, durable, safe and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. And this recent approval further strengthens AbbVie\u2019s leadership position in this market. We also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in Europe, with an approval decision anticipated soon. Earlier this month, we submitted our regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe for Rinvoq and giant cell arteritis. Our submissions are based on the previously announced Phase 3 results from our SELECT-GCA trial, where Rinvoq demonstrated superiority compared to placebo on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52 on disease flare and showed a reduction in total steroid exposure at week 52. We expect approval decisions for this indication next year. We also recently began a Phase 3 study for lutikizumab, our anti-IL-1-alpha-beta-bispecific in hidradenitis suppurativa. HS is a skin disease that can be debilitating and there are limited treatment options. In our Phase 2 study, lutikizumab demonstrated strong clinical response rates and improvement in skin pain in a very refractory patient population. Based on these results, we believe lutikizumab has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe HS. We look forward to providing updates on the Phase 3 program as the data become available. In the second quarter, we announced two additional immunology transactions as we continue to invest in external innovation to expand our pipeline. These include the acquisition of Celsius Therapeutics, which brings a Phase 2 ready anti-TREM1 antibody for IBD and a license agreement with FutureGen to develop a next-generation anti-TL1A antibody for IBD that is designed to have less frequent dosing compared to other TL1As in development and will be evaluated in combination with Skyrizi. This follows the four immunology deals we announced earlier this year, which, as a reminder, included the acquisition of Landos and their oral NLRX1 agonist in Phase 2 for UC, a partnership with OSE to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist for IBD and RA, a collaboration with Parvus to utilize their immune tolerization platform for novel IBD therapies and a collaboration with Tentarix to develop conditionally active multi-specific biologics in immunology and oncology. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make very good progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive topline results from our Phase 2 PICCOLO study evaluating Elahere as a monotherapy in ER alpha positive third-line plus platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer for those not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. Elahere met the primary and key secondary endpoints in the study, demonstrating an objective response rate of 52% and median duration of response of 8.25 month. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Following discussions with the FDA, we will be submitting to Teliso-V for accelerated approval as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild-type non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer. This submission will be reviewed under FDA\u2019s real-time oncology review program. Teliso-V has also received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. Our submission will be based on the results of our Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study, where Teliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints, including overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival, with a tolerable safety profile. Submission is expected in the third quarter, with an approval decision anticipated in 2025. The confirmatory Phase 3 study for this potential accelerated approval is currently ongoing. We continue to see encouraging data for ABBV-400, our next generation c-Met ADC, which uses a topo payload. Recall that we\u2019ve advanced 400 in late-line colorectal cancer based on the deep responses and prolonged durability observed as a monotherapy in our Phase 1 trial. And we remain on track to begin a Phase 3 study later this year in third-line CRC. We\u2019re also seeing encouraging signals of activity for this next-gen ADC in the non-small-cell lung cancer cohort from our Phase 1 study. The preliminary data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. And based on the emerging Phase 1 results, we plan to begin a Phase 2 program for 400 in lung cancer. In the area of hematologic oncology, we received accelerated approval in the U.S. for Epkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of prior therapy. Epkinly is now the only T-cell engaging bispecific approved in the U.S. to treat both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We\u2019re extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients suffering from follicular lymphoma. We also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. In the quarter, we initiated a Phase 3 monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. 383 is designed for high affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T-cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T-cell engaging BCMA-based therapies while preserving high levels of efficacy. We remain excited about this asset\u2019s potential to become a best-in-class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS, with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. In addition to our Phase 3 monotherapy program, we have an ongoing Phase 1 study in later lines of multiple myeloma to evaluate 383 in various combinations, including with Pomalyst, Revlimid and Darzalex. Based on this work, we will begin Phase 2 combination studies in earlier lines of therapy next year. Moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter we announced that we received a complete response letter for our 951 regulatory application in the U.S. The CRL is based on observations identified during an inspection at a third-party manufacturing site that was unrelated to 951. The CRL did not identify any issues related to the safety, efficacy or labeling of 951, nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data or device-related testing. We\u2019re working closely with the site and the FDA to get clarity on timelines and we\u2019ll provide updates as soon as information becomes available. Moving to an update on one of our Alzheimer\u2019s disease programs. We recently completed an interim analysis of a Phase 2 study evaluating ABBV-916, our A-beta antibody. The emerging efficacy and safety profile in this study is similar to what has been demonstrated by approved agents. However, given the evolving landscape, we do not believe 916 as a monotherapy treatment will be sufficiently differentiated from other emerging therapies. As a result, we are discontinuing further development for 916 as a standalone antibody. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction soon and we look forward to welcoming the team into our R&D organization. The emraclidine pivotal studies in schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out near the end of this year. We\u2019ll also see data from two additional Phase 3 studies for davapidon in Parkinson\u2019s disease later this year. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed and data are available. In aesthetics, we recently received approval for Botox in China for masseter muscle prominence, marking the first global approval in this indication for any neurotoxin. Masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. We anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication in China, which will help to further build our portfolio in the face-shaping segment. A regulatory application is under review in the U.S. for Botox and platysma prominence, which is another novel indication that will help build our position in the lower face and neck segment. We continue to expect an FDA approval decision later this year. And we remain on track to submit a regulatory application for BoNT/E near the end of this year. A rapid-onset, short-acting toxin has a highly differentiated clinical profile and once approved would offer patients a novel option compared to currently available toxins. So, in summary, we\u2019ve made great progress across all of our therapeutic areas in the first half of the year and we look forward to additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2024. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Reents: Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our second-quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.52 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $14.5 billion, $450 million ahead of our guidance and reflecting robust growth of 5.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 18% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. Adjusted gross margin was 85.2% of sales. Adjusted R&D expense was 13.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.6% of sales, which includes a 6.5% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $506 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18.8%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 to between $10.71 and $10.91. This EPS guidance continues to contemplate approximately $0.19 of dilution for the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which is expected to close soon. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $55.5 billion, an increase of $500 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions with the entire sales increase, once again, driven by our ex-Humira growth platform, which is now on pace to deliver nearly $6 billion of sales growth in 2024. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $11 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong performance across all approved indications. Rinvoq, total revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting continued robust uptake in IBD. Venclexta total sales of approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting momentum in both U.S. and international markets. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion. Given slower-than-expected near-term market growth, particularly in the U.S. and China, as a result, our total sales guidance for Botox and Juvederm will each be lower by roughly $100 million. Moving to the P&L for 2024, we continue to forecast a full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14% and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5%. We now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales, in line with our previous expectations after including the approximately 2% impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the second quarter. And we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16.3%, also reflecting the impact of IPR&D. Turning to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.92 and $2.96. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance and I\u2019m very pleased with the strong momentum across the portfolio heading into the second half of the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We\u2019ll now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats, Rob, on the CEO position. Looking forward to the forward here. The question I had is, last quarter you guys gave some early commentary on how to think about 2025, looking at the business, obviously, momentum in immunology, some headwinds in aesthetics. So any update on how you\u2019re thinking about the 2025 outlook, particularly, growth for revenue relative to EPS? Thanks.\nScott Reents: Thanks, Terence. This is Scott. I\u2019ll handle the question. So, with respect to 2025, as you know, we haven\u2019t given guidance yet and we\u2019ll provide that at a later time. But we have communicated a few top-level, high-level items to put in context of several dynamics at play next year. We have indicated that we\u2019ll be returning to robust revenue growth, despite the headwinds from Medicare Part D redesign and continued Humira erosion. And when you think about robust growth, we characterize robust growth to be above industry average growth, which we see in the low-single digits. So when you think about the drivers, I mentioned in my remarks that we have $6 billion of growth from the growth platform in 2024 that we\u2019re expecting. $5 billion of that is coming from Skyrizi and Rinvoq alone, our neuros franchise is growing by more than $1 billion and aesthetics has begun to recover from the economic headwinds. In 2025, we see incremental contributions from Skyrizi UC, which was recently approved, as well as 951. All these factors demonstrate strong momentum in the business. And then when you think about the offset of Humira, that erosion that we have expected this year at $4.5 billion. Last year that erosion was $6.5 billion and we do expect another step down in absolute dollar terms in 2025 for that erosion as well. So that will be less of a headwind to growth in 2025 than it was in 2024. So we feel very, very strong about that. And I think from a Part D perspective, we\u2019ve talked about the several points of growth headwinds that we see there. And I think when you model that, you can think about those several points as approximately a 3% headwind to growth. So, overall, very strong momentum from the business with some headwinds, but we feel very confident in our ability to return to robust growth at the topline. Regarding EPS, the bottomline, we see EPS growing in line with that revenue growth that we\u2019ve talked about. So, EPS will benefit from operating margin expansion. We\u2019ve talked about that operating margin expansion will be on the SG&A line as we leverage the revenue growth and drive efficiencies and we have a good history of doing that. So, that operating margin will expand. However, that expansion will be roughly offset by the fact that in 2025, we\u2019ll have a full year of interest expense associated with the financing for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So robust growth at the topline and in-line growth from an EPS perspective.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. Maybe first on Rinvoq and Skyrizi, great results in the quarter. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the price versus volume dynamics this quarter? It seemed like results were maybe a little bit stronger than the RX trends would have implied, and I just was wondering if there was anything notable there. My second question was on the immunology portfolio, and as we think about 2025, I know we\u2019re probably in the middle of contracting season right now, but just directionally, what are you anticipating for Humira, and should we be thinking about any incremental pressures on Rinvoq and Skyrizi just given biosimilar Humira dynamics going forward? Thanks.\nJeff Stewart: Yeah. Hi, Chris. It\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll take that question. So, as noted, we\u2019re very, very pleased with the fundamental momentum on Rinvoq and Skyrizi. So all of the indications are really hitting their stride. So we can see the impact of, obviously, consumer investments we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve adjusted some of the sales forces. We\u2019ve started to anticipate the ulcerative colitis that\u2019s helped us basically increase our share of voice. And I think the other dynamic in terms of some of the incremental strength has come from this dynamic that we started to see earlier in the quarter where some of the Humira switching that takes place actually starts to accrue towards Skyrizi and Rinvoq because the physicians, when there\u2019s this disruption in the market, will sometimes bring in those patients and start to assess them, and we saw about 20% would move to other mechanisms. So while it\u2019s a component, there are certainly multifactorial approaches why we see this very, very strong volume dynamic and share capture for both of those agents. If I move to the contracting for 2025, obviously, the contract season is in progress and it\u2019s progressing, and the negotiations are well underway. I think it\u2019s important, if you\u2019ll recall, that we already have some multiyear contracts in place that cover 2025, so that\u2019s a positive dynamic. The remaining payer negotiations, as I mentioned, are underway and we anticipate that those will close out during the normal cycle. I would say that, at a macro level, we do expect to maintain parity access next year for Humira for a meaningful portion of lives across all of the channels. Now, that said, our Humira access will certainly be lower than this year as we continue to anticipate and watch certain segments of the market move to adopt biosimilars. And we\u2019ve understood and planned for this, obviously, as we enter that third year of the biosimilars and so we\u2019re well aware of dynamically evaluating how this is going to work out. So, certainly, things are progressing. We already have some in place from those multiyear contracts and we\u2019ll be in a better position to provide some more information, obviously, later in the year as those negotiations or the remaining negotiations fully close out.\nRob Michael: And Chris, this is Rob. Just to reiterate an important point that Jeff made, I mean, one trend that we are watching very closely is the switching from the Humira molecule to new mechanisms. I mean, we are starting to see an inflection that is accruing to new mechanisms like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as Jeff mentioned. And it makes sense, doctors that are reevaluating the patients in their practice are likely looking at more than just the patients that are covered by CVS. What we have factored in is the CVS impact. What we didn\u2019t factor in necessarily is an impact beyond just the CVS-wise. And to the extent that trend continues, it would represent a downside for Humira and an upside for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a very good long-term tradeoff for us. That\u2019s an important point. We want to make sure that was captured.\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. And maybe, Chris, one more point that I didn\u2019t address was the Skyrizi and Rinvoq contracting. So we are anticipating very robust and consistent access for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And our former comments around sort of low single-digit price erosion should be quite consistent with what we said before. Obviously, the Medicare Part D is a separate dynamic. So things are stable and we\u2019re anticipating ongoing very strong access for both of those brands.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nCarter Gould: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I guess first, just a housekeeping point. I guess, one -- I guess, on the last call, you had talked about earnings growth not being quite at the rate of revenue growth and it sounds like today you see those more in line. Any, I guess, further color on kind of what\u2019s driving that? I would assume it\u2019s sort of the key I&I drivers, but any other color there would be appreciated. And I guess the more pertinent question, maybe on the commentary on Cerevel, should there be any expectation for divestments or other concessions as we contemplate that deal closing? Thank you.\nScott Reents: Yeah. This is Scott. I\u2019ll take the question regarding EPS growth or earnings growth in line with the revenue growth. So when we look at this, as I mentioned, we\u2019re looking at a couple of things. The SG&A that we\u2019re driving some operating margin expansion, we spent a lot of time focusing on that and we do see some efficiencies that we can drive, and we do have the ability to leverage that. So there will be expansion operating margin, which you would expect to then let earnings outpace the revenue growth. However, there is this offset and we had a very successful bond offering when we set the financing in place for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So, but that will be an offset to the operating margin expansion. So you can think of those two as essentially netting one another and then driving that earnings growth in line with the topline.\nRob Michael: Hey, Carter. This is Rob. I\u2019ll take your question on Cerevel. Look, we\u2019ve made very good progress with the FTC and have certified substantial compliance to their second request. No divestments are expected. I would expect the transaction to close soon, potentially as early as next week. We\u2019re obviously very excited about the potential best-in-class therapies in Cerevel\u2019s pipeline, especially emraclidine for schizophrenia, davapidon for early Parkinson\u2019s and their core antagonist for major depression. I mean, these assets clearly will be great additions to our neuroscience franchise.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Vamil Divan. Please go ahead.\nVamil Divan: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe one if I could just, I guess, for Rob, just around sort of your business development priorities now. You obviously did a sort of larger deal last year with Cerevel, ImmunoGen, you\u2019ve done a number of these smaller acquisitions. And I guess I\u2019m trying to get a sense of the kind of balance between investing for the long-term and then sort of balancing the near-term earnings growth outlook. So there\u2019s a lot of focus on that $11 floor for a long time, obviously, with all the IPR&D. You sort of dipped a little bit below that for this year, which makes sense. But I\u2019m just trying to think now that we\u2019re sort of halfway through the year, how are you thinking about sort of where your priorities are and the need to kind of balance the near-term numbers versus investing for the long-term? Thanks.\nRob Michael: Yeah. Vamil, thanks for the question. So, the $11 floor, again, was on an ex-IPR&D basis, where obviously with this guidance, ex-IPR&D, I think, we\u2019re just a little bit over $11.40 and we\u2019re certainly positioned to return to robust growth. I mean, we\u2019re delivering robust revenue growth this quarter. When you look at the outlook for 2025, it\u2019s very strong and so we should be beyond the conversations on the floor at this point. As we think about the tradeoffs for the long-term and the short-term, clearly we have an on-market portfolio today that can drive the growth that we need to deliver on that high single-digit, top-tier outlook in this decade. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on early-stage assets that can drive growth in the next decade, and you\u2019ve seen us execute nearly a dozen deals this year along those lines. These include new mechanisms in immunology that can combine with Skyrizi or Rinvoq or be pursued as model therapies. We\u2019ve also added new platforms, including multi-specifics, that have applicability in immunology and oncology. Our deal targeting in situ CAR-T therapy is another example of a platform investment in oncology. And we added a novel mechanism for psychiatric disorders, given our focus in neuroscience. So we intend to continue adding more depth to our pipeline in our core areas, particularly think about early-stage deals, because what we\u2019re really trying to set up for is that growth in the next decade. We have a clear line of sight to top-tier growth this decade and we want to position the company to deliver strong growth in the next decade as well.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. Good morning. On the aesthetics business, today has been a day of reporting across the industry. There\u2019s some commentary that aligns with what you said. However, some additional questions I have are on granularity about procedure volumes and pricing. Now, in the first quarter, you talked about promotional activities that you pushed towards a seasonally strong second quarter. One, should we think about the pricing backdrop as being a component of some of the sluggishness as opposed to purely thinking about or primarily thinking about volume of procedures? And if you could sort of respond in the neurotoxin neuromodulator versus the filler segment, that\u2019d be helpful. Thank you.\nCarrie Strom: Hi. This is Carrie. I\u2019ll address the questions. So, first let\u2019s talk about the market dynamics for market growth in the U.S. for facial injectables. So, late last year, we started to see a recovery and a return to growth of the toxin market and we\u2019ve seen that market growth recovery continue this year in that mid-single-digit range. And that\u2019s volume, that is traffic into our customers\u2019 offices and that\u2019s really been consistent for the past few quarters. So, the market dynamics for our business are really driven by patient demand and volume. Although, when we think about price, price is a factor that we\u2019ll be looking for the second half of the year, which will give us some favorable pricing dynamics. We did take a price action at the beginning of the year for toxins and then we\u2019ll have some more efficiency when it comes to our strategic shifts in our pricing promotions for the second half of the year. So, one example of that would be promotions we did last year, for example, around competitive launches that we won\u2019t need to do this year based on the success of our competitive strategy last year. So really our performance is driven by market growth and we also had some nice stability in our market share. Anything you\u2019d like to add?\nJeff Stewart: Maybe because it\u2019s worth mentioning, so some of that shift in promotional activity that you mentioned, we did talk about in the first quarter that that was a destocking that occurred of inventory levels. And when Carrie made her remarks and we spoke about it last quarter, we said that would reverse over time. We did see that reversing in the second quarter on a partial basis. And when you think about the reversal of that Q1 destock, you can think about from the U.S. market that really would reduce by 50% or cut in half the growth rates we published for the actual results for both Botox and Juvederm. So we saw that partial reversal of that destocking event and then we will see that continue to unwind throughout the course of the year, especially as we have some of our larger promotional activities and the back half of the year with Botox Day and Juvederm Day, we do see typically an inventory, a stocking uplift from those activities.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the pipeline in IBD space as well. I mean, you have done a bunch of these and then there has been some movement, especially in the oral IBD drugs as well. I mean, given your expertise, I would love to understand, how do you think about a pipeline moving beyond the likes of Skyrizi, IL-17s and all, because these drugs are pretty good. But when you think about an oral, what is the ideal profile of the drug that could be a first-line drug and then when you think about combinations, I mean, what are you exactly looking for? Thank you.\nRoopal Thakkar: Hey, Mohit. It\u2019s Roopal. I can talk about that. With respect to orals, we did do this deal with Landos and this is our NX-13asset, which we\u2019ll anticipate a readout end of this year, beginning of next year. Early data point to good outcomes in ulcerative colitis and this asset works through NF-kappa-beta, so you\u2019ll see what we\u2019ve observed in preclinical models is reductions in IL-6, IL-1, TNF, interferon gamma. And it\u2019s potentially a monotherapy and one that wouldn\u2019t have a boxed warning. So far, the safety data has looked good. But there\u2019s also opportunities, we believe, as you mentioned, combinations, that you could still combine with Rinvoq. And as I mentioned the boxed warning and in certain geographies, Rinvoq is utilized post-anti-TNF. Even with a combo there, there\u2019s still opportunity. The second and third line segments in IBD and across immunology continue to grow, and they\u2019re getting larger and larger as patients cycle through biosimilar anti-TNFs. We\u2019ll see them cycle through, for example, in IBD with IL-1223, like Stelara. So in the future, there\u2019s multiple opportunities. And the way we think about these is do we see an asset that is novel and can address mechanisms that haven\u2019t been addressed yet, and can they complement something like Rinvoq? So if you see a little bit less efficacy, that may be okay if it\u2019s complementary. It may not work necessarily as a monotherapy, but we still see opportunities for a combo. And given the other assets that we\u2019ve talked about that could be IV or sub-cue, we still see a lot of opportunity with Skyrizi. In a platform study in IBD we\u2019ll kick off later this year, looking at various combinations, many of the assets that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, including a TL1A, including our own internal alpha-4 beta-7, could be added on to Skyrizi to drive that efficacy even higher because there\u2019s still a bit of a ceiling effect. And I would say the unmet need in IBD in particular continues to be quite high.\nMohit Bansal: Okay. Thank you.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nChris Raymond: Thanks. Hey. Just another follow-up on Humira. So, Jeff and Rob, just hearing your commentary about how when patients discontinue Humira, a number of them are switching to newer biologics. I think you gave the 20% number going to newer biologics like Skyrizi and then also Rinvoq. But we saw some of this happening in the gastro space with one of the checks we did recently, but I wonder if you could provide maybe a little more color on this phenomenon. Is there a particular therapeutic silo where this is maybe happening more extensively? And can you give us a sense as to how this has been influenced or accelerated by biosimilar availability and just any more color there? Thanks.\nJeff Stewart: Yeah. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s almost like a bimodal phenomenon. So, the 20% I highlighted, so if you just look from our data, when we just look at the CVS template, so we can see the degradation of Humira that goes down pretty steeply because, remember, it\u2019s an exclusion. So, Humira is no longer widely available at all. So, most of it happens within the first two weeks or three weeks. And in that one segment, we see that the biosimilar doesn\u2019t take up all the Humira loss and we can see it moving to other mechanisms, particularly Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So that\u2019s within, let\u2019s say, the acute biosimilar event. Now, to Rob\u2019s point, what he highlighted is, if you take a step back and you look at the macro market, we\u2019ve started to see in the first quarter and second quarter that the overall molecule, so that\u2019s the adalimumab molecule, inclusive of biosimilars, has started to compress faster than it did before there was the availability of this action that was taken by CVS. So, it\u2019s a doubling of effect, acutely in the segment that takes place with the exclusion and then the wider market. Now, we\u2019re watching this pretty carefully because we haven\u2019t -- obviously haven\u2019t seen something like this before in terms of the compression of a molecule. So, that\u2019s basically the dynamics that we\u2019re seeing. And we do think it\u2019s because some physicians or segments of physicians are, they realize that these biosimilars where there\u2019s an acute interruption, they want to check how the patients are doing. And if they\u2019re not fully in remission when they come in for their appointment, let\u2019s say before the switch, sometimes they\u2019re transitioned at the rates that I described. So that\u2019s sort of the prescriber behavior. Now, where is it coming from? Like, well, we actually see that it is accruing across all of the indications, particularly Humira has quite robust, let\u2019s say, base dynamics in the rheumatology indications. But we can see it in rheum. We can see it in derm. Derm to Skyrizi in particular, which is probably not a surprise given the position. I highlighted a 38% share and a 60% in-place share for Skyrizi and derm. And we also do see it to some degree in gastroenterology. So, to Rob\u2019s point, we\u2019re going to continue to monitor that. If the overall molecule would continue to compress, obviously, there would be some mitigation of some of it accruing over to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and so we\u2019ll have to continue to see how these weeks and months play out here over the third quarter.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Gary Nachman from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGary Nachman: All right. Great. Thanks. Can you talk more about how you\u2019re managing the growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq in IBD across both UC and Crohn\u2019s, which have both been really strong? And with the Skyrizi UC launch, is there any cannibalization there with Rinvoq? And I guess, generally, how do you see those products working synergistically both in terms of sales force and reimbursement, if you see any sort of issues or conflicts there? Thanks.\nJeff Stewart: Yeah. Thank you for the question. A very important question in terms of how we commercialize these. Roopal highlighted it. Obviously, you have the two big indications with two assets within those indications. And so we have constructed, not just in the U.S., but around the world, a very sophisticated approach in terms of multiple sleeves of representatives and medical experts that are representing both drugs across both indications. And it really is, let\u2019s say, for example, in our largest market, the U.S., it\u2019s relatively easy to execute, because what we see is that our representatives can highlight Skyrizi\u2019s data and potential as the obvious frontline agent, which is obviously tremendous data. I mentioned the sequence data. I mentioned our core data. The naive to biologic data in UC is absolutely fantastic for the Skyrizi data. And then, really ironically, because of the label changes that took place a few years ago, Rinvoq is positioned in later lines. So, really, that sort of approach is highly synergistic in terms of we recommend that physicians consider starting with Skyrizi and the efficacy will be fantastic. But to Roopal\u2019s point, there\u2019s still pressure on that disease and then you have a backstop with tremendous, tremendous data on Rinvoq in later lines. And so that\u2019s how we position it. We look and we monitor the cannibalization. It\u2019s quite modest, and overall, when you look at the dynamic of share capture, it\u2019s quite encouraging to see how the infield teams and the commercial teams are managing all of those assets. So, we\u2019re very encouraged about how we\u2019ve approached the market in terms of our execution and I think the results are speaking for themselves.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Gary. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. Regarding the 2024 sales guidance, which I realize is about $55 billion, but it implies similar growth in the second half as in the first half, if not a slight deceleration. Why won\u2019t total sales do better and what were your reservations about raising sales guidance today? It seems that across the business, strengths are exceeding challenges, so it would seem not unreasonable to have higher sights now. Second question is, I\u2019m wondering if you can elaborate on the comment, a portion of Humira lives is a portion of Humira lives closest to a quarter, a half or three-quarters of lives. Thank you.\nScott Reents: Steve, this is Scott. I will talk regarding the revenue. So, just to clarify, we did raise the revenue guidance in total from $55 billion to $55.5 billion, a $500 million raise and that included a $300 million raise for Skyrizi, a $100 million raise for Rinvoq, a $100 million raise for Venclexta, a $200 million spread across other products and then a $200 million reduction in the guidance for aesthetics. So, we do see very strong momentum in the business and we did raise our sales guidance from $55 billion to $55.5 billion.\nRob Michael: And Steve, this is Rob. If you just look at, as I mentioned in my remarks, the first half of the year, we talked operational growth around 4%. If you -- the implied operational growth in the second half, based on our guidance, would be slightly above that and really driven by the ex-Humira growth platform, which on a reported basis, grew more than 18% this quarter. And so we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of the business, and I think, when you look at the guidance and you do the math, you\u2019ll see that the actual implied second half operational growth is slightly higher than the first half.\nJeff Stewart: And Steve and Jeff, so to give some sense, so we\u2019re looking at coming up on the third year of biosimilar. So, the first way to think about it, in the first year 2023, we had very strong parity access across all the channels and we really exited the year around, I think, 97% or something like that. This year, I think, when we look at all the ins and outs, I think, the three-quarter approach is quite reasonable, and as I mentioned in my remarks to early one of the questions, it will certainly be lower next year and I would think that that range would be around that 0.5 point, but again, we\u2019re not fully complete with all the dynamics. So, that gives you some broad spectrum over three years, maybe around the halfway point, plus or minus, as we go into 2025.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Trung Huynh from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTrung Huynh: Hi, guys. Trung Huynh from UBS. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. On the aesthetic, thanks for your comments this year and you\u2019ve also moderated your short-term guide accordingly, but you\u2019ve noted that the long-term 2029 guide remains intact. So, with growth around 4% this year in line with that new guide, I imagine next year will be slightly higher, but then it does imply that growth is well into the double digits for 2027, 2028 and 2029 on our calculations. Just what here makes you confident about that level of growth later in the decade? And then secondly, just following up on some of your thoughts on the immunology pipeline, you noted the potential of the utility of multispecifics in immunology. You\u2019ve got a pretty strong bispecific platform. Just what are your thoughts on the data that you\u2019re seeing here? Is there anything in development that we should be looking at? Thank you.\nScott Reents: Trung, this is Scott. I\u2019ll start with your question regarding the long-term guidance on aesthetics. So you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve guided to a long-term $9 billion in 2029 and we\u2019re not changing that guidance. The guidance changed, as you noted, that I mentioned today is just a short-term guidance change for 2024. We remain very confident in our ability to hit that $9 billion in 2029. When you think about these markets, there\u2019s very low penetration in the markets globally. There\u2019s a lot of excitement in the space and we expect the market to recover and grow at historical rates. I would say when we look at the market growth, we do see that rebounding and growing well. And then you also should think about there\u2019s additional innovation coming that will drive that. So, we have some of the additional indications in Botox that Roopal walked through, as well as the quick onset short-acting toxin BoNT/E that will also drive additional market growth. And so we continue to feel very comfortable with our ability to achieve that on a long-term basis in 2029.\nRoopal Thakkar: Trung, it\u2019s Roopal. I\u2019ll take the next question on the pipeline. So, we continue to be excited about bispecifics, in particular lutikizumab. And it\u2019s an IL-1 alpha, and importantly, also 1-beta. And this, we believe, distinguishes it from earlier generation assets that were singular, and let\u2019s say, only took out IL-1 alpha. We see, I would say, very, very strong benefits in hidradenitis suppurativa and I don\u2019t think that was observed as a pure monoclonal. And the efficacy that we\u2019re seeing is in a 100% anti-TNF failure population and very sick, early Stage 3, 70%. It is one of the most severe, probably the most severe ever studied. So we think there continues to be potential in the bispecific space as you take out multiple cytokines. The way to address it is through engineering of the assets. The other way is combination, so we can get to that bispecific approach through combos. And then, thirdly, I would say earlier in the pipeline is the multispecific approach, which the advantage that could provide is you maintain your bispecific approach, but then a third arm, let\u2019s say, can target specific cells and that could further enhance efficacy, and in particular, safety. And we\u2019re looking at that approach in immunology and as well in oncology, and that was reflected in our partnership with Tentarix.\nLiz Shea: Thank you, Trung. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question and it was really, really helpful to update today. So, just looking at kind of the expected growth for\u2026\nLiz Shea: Can you just -- can you speak up just a little bit? Sorry.\nEvan Seigerman: All right. Can you guys hear me all right? Does that work?\nRob Michael: Yeah.\nLiz Shea: It\u2019s still faint, but we\u2019ll do our best.\nEvan Seigerman: All right. Sorry about that. I\u2019ll speak very loudly. So when looking at expected growth for Vraylar over the next few quarters, can you comment on what type of impact you think new competitors to the MBD market might have and what you can do to help maintain a growth position going forward?\nJeff Stewart: Yeah. Hi. It\u2019s Jeff. We\u2019re very pleased with how both of the indications are performing and we monitor them very carefully, certainly with bipolar and aMDD. So when we look at our quarterly surveys of our target physicians and really our whole call cycle, we can see now that Vraylar is the most preferred agent overall for bipolar disease based on its indication set, its tolerability, its efficacy, et cetera. And we\u2019ve really gone to the very top of the lead table for aMDD as well. So, if we look overall on our demand, we\u2019re tracking above 20% in terms of the push. We continue to focus our team and where necessary add share a voice in terms of our sales force. So, we\u2019re quite comfortable that we can continue to grow our share, which has been growing very, very nicely, particularly on the MBRX side, and certainly, face the competitive dynamics and navigate those as we go forward.\nRoopal Thakkar: Jeff, maybe to add. it\u2019s Roopal here. There is going to be competition, but what we see as a benefit clinically for Vraylar is that full spectrum coverage in bipolar and when you\u2019re able to take mania, you don\u2019t need an adjunctive therapy for that. So that\u2019s a big advantage. The other thing that we continue to hear and probably reflected in our data is the really limited impact on fatigue and sedation. And so what we\u2019re hearing is with Vraylar, patients really don\u2019t have to sacrifice their daytime productivity in order to gain that benefit. And then the other benefit, I would say, with Vraylar is flexible, adjustable dosing. So these things together, I think, underlie what Jeff was speaking about.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Evan. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJames Shin: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. You mentioned some of the Humira contracts going to 2025. Does that also apply to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and that\u2019s what gives you visibility on the low single-digit price erosion? And secondly, has the introduction of co-branded Humira and now that PBMs are more intertwined with biosimilars, changed the negotiation dynamics at all? Thank you.\nRob Michael: Yeah. So, typically, again, in some cases we are able to secure multiyear contracts. And as you can imagine that we would do that for the portfolio, basically, the way that our products work. So, that does help with the visibility in terms of what our access would look like for 2025, as well as the pricing dynamics. Again, I want to clarify that the negotiating season is not fully complete, but the dynamics are progressing, as I highlighted there. So, yes, to your first question. The other dynamic in terms of Cordavis, I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s actually changing the dynamics in terms of the negotiations overall. That was obviously a volume-related deal with CVS that we announced over a year ago or almost a year ago now. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily play into other negotiations. Each of these payers and pharmacy benefit managers, they have their own ideas in terms of how they want to approach the I&I category and certainly the Humira -- the emergence of the Humira biosimilars. So it\u2019s a CVS-unique dynamic.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, James. We have time for one final question, Operator.\nOperator: For our last question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So I wanted to first ask you, do you still feel that your aesthetics business is a good strategic asset for you, and if so, where do you see the synergies within your organization? And second question I wanted to ask you is, how do you think pharma will fare under a Democratic versus a Republican presidency and how are you going to navigate through that uncertainty in the near term? Thank you.\nRob Michael: So, Louise, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take your question. Look, we like the aesthetics business. When you think about the growth profile, the profitability, we have set it up as a fully integrated standalone unit, because it behaves differently than the therapeutics business. We think we\u2019ve actually seen, since we announced the transaction, really strong performance. We\u2019ve exceeded our deal model expectations since we announced the deal. So we think it\u2019s operating very well. Obviously, we\u2019re working through some macroeconomic headwinds. But when you look at, for example, share performance, we had the entry of DAXXIFY last year and we did not lose any share. I think a lot of investors were concerned that we\u2019d see considerable share loss. And so I think the team has done a remarkable job of competing in this marketplace, going through a period with economic headwinds. We\u2019re still very confident given low penetration rates, given our relationship in the field, the potential innovations that we plan to bring forward. It has a very nice fit. And you think about just from a profitability and a growth standpoint, it fits the profile we\u2019re looking for. So I certainly feel it\u2019s a nice fit for the company. As it relates to the election, look, it\u2019s hard to handicap it, whether Democrat or Republican. If you think about we\u2019ve obviously contemplated the Inflation Reduction Act. We\u2019ve come out and said that even with modeling that impact in, that we still expect to deliver on our long-term outlook. Now, I will say our view on the IRA from a policy perspective is we\u2019re certainly in favor of the Part D benefit redesign because it helps address patient out-of-pocket burn. But the price-setting provisions in the IRA will certainly harm long-term innovation in our industry. So, we are hopeful that if it\u2019s a new administration or the current administration, that they\u2019ll reassess those provisions that ultimately are harmful for long-term patient care in the U.S. I mean, it clearly takes away the incentive to launch in later lines of smaller patient populations, which is really a very unfortunate negative outcome for the legislation. So, the way I view it is addressing patient out-of-pocket burden is good policy, but taking away the incentive for innovation is not, and my hope is under either administration, that will be reconsidered.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Louise. That concludes today\u2019s conference call. If you\u2019d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining the AbbVie second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today\u2019s conference.

            "name": "Roopal Thakkar",
            "content": "Thank you, Carrie. We continue to make very good progress advancing our pipeline with several regulatory and clinical milestones since our last earnings call. I will start with immunology. We received FDA approval for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which marks its second inflammatory bowel disease indication. Skyrizi is now the only IL-23 specific inhibitor approved for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Skyrizi has proven to be a highly effective, durable, safe and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. And this recent approval further strengthens AbbVie\u2019s leadership position in this market. We also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in Europe, with an approval decision anticipated soon. Earlier this month, we submitted our regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe for Rinvoq and giant cell arteritis. Our submissions are based on the previously announced Phase 3 results from our SELECT-GCA trial, where Rinvoq demonstrated superiority compared to placebo on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52 on disease flare and showed a reduction in total steroid exposure at week 52. We expect approval decisions for this indication next year. We also recently began a Phase 3 study for lutikizumab, our anti-IL-1-alpha-beta-bispecific in hidradenitis suppurativa. HS is a skin disease that can be debilitating and there are limited treatment options. In our Phase 2 study, lutikizumab demonstrated strong clinical response rates and improvement in skin pain in a very refractory patient population. Based on these results, we believe lutikizumab has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe HS. We look forward to providing updates on the Phase 3 program as the data become available. In the second quarter, we announced two additional immunology transactions as we continue to invest in external innovation to expand our pipeline. These include the acquisition of Celsius Therapeutics, which brings a Phase 2 ready anti-TREM1 antibody for IBD and a license agreement with FutureGen to develop a next-generation anti-TL1A antibody for IBD that is designed to have less frequent dosing compared to other TL1As in development and will be evaluated in combination with Skyrizi. This follows the four immunology deals we announced earlier this year, which, as a reminder, included the acquisition of Landos and their oral NLRX1 agonist in Phase 2 for UC, a partnership with OSE to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist for IBD and RA, a collaboration with Parvus to utilize their immune tolerization platform for novel IBD therapies and a collaboration with Tentarix to develop conditionally active multi-specific biologics in immunology and oncology. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make very good progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive topline results from our Phase 2 PICCOLO study evaluating Elahere as a monotherapy in ER alpha positive third-line plus platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer for those not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. Elahere met the primary and key secondary endpoints in the study, demonstrating an objective response rate of 52% and median duration of response of 8.25 month. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Following discussions with the FDA, we will be submitting to Teliso-V for accelerated approval as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild-type non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer. This submission will be reviewed under FDA\u2019s real-time oncology review program. Teliso-V has also received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. Our submission will be based on the results of our Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study, where Teliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints, including overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival, with a tolerable safety profile. Submission is expected in the third quarter, with an approval decision anticipated in 2025. The confirmatory Phase 3 study for this potential accelerated approval is currently ongoing. We continue to see encouraging data for ABBV-400, our next generation c-Met ADC, which uses a topo payload. Recall that we\u2019ve advanced 400 in late-line colorectal cancer based on the deep responses and prolonged durability observed as a monotherapy in our Phase 1 trial. And we remain on track to begin a Phase 3 study later this year in third-line CRC. We\u2019re also seeing encouraging signals of activity for this next-gen ADC in the non-small-cell lung cancer cohort from our Phase 1 study. The preliminary data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. And based on the emerging Phase 1 results, we plan to begin a Phase 2 program for 400 in lung cancer. In the area of hematologic oncology, we received accelerated approval in the U.S. for Epkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of prior therapy. Epkinly is now the only T-cell engaging bispecific approved in the U.S. to treat both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We\u2019re extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients suffering from follicular lymphoma. We also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. In the quarter, we initiated a Phase 3 monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. 383 is designed for high affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T-cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T-cell engaging BCMA-based therapies while preserving high levels of efficacy. We remain excited about this asset\u2019s potential to become a best-in-class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS, with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. In addition to our Phase 3 monotherapy program, we have an ongoing Phase 1 study in later lines of multiple myeloma to evaluate 383 in various combinations, including with Pomalyst, Revlimid and Darzalex. Based on this work, we will begin Phase 2 combination studies in earlier lines of therapy next year. Moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter we announced that we received a complete response letter for our 951 regulatory application in the U.S. The CRL is based on observations identified during an inspection at a third-party manufacturing site that was unrelated to 951. The CRL did not identify any issues related to the safety, efficacy or labeling of 951, nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data or device-related testing. We\u2019re working closely with the site and the FDA to get clarity on timelines and we\u2019ll provide updates as soon as information becomes available. Moving to an update on one of our Alzheimer\u2019s disease programs. We recently completed an interim analysis of a Phase 2 study evaluating ABBV-916, our A-beta antibody. The emerging efficacy and safety profile in this study is similar to what has been demonstrated by approved agents. However, given the evolving landscape, we do not believe 916 as a monotherapy treatment will be sufficiently differentiated from other emerging therapies. As a result, we are discontinuing further development for 916 as a standalone antibody. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction soon and we look forward to welcoming the team into our R&D organization. The emraclidine pivotal studies in schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out near the end of this year. We\u2019ll also see data from two additional Phase 3 studies for davapidon in Parkinson\u2019s disease later this year. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed and data are available. In aesthetics, we recently received approval for Botox in China for masseter muscle prominence, marking the first global approval in this indication for any neurotoxin. Masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. We anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication in China, which will help to further build our portfolio in the face-shaping segment. A regulatory application is under review in the U.S. for Botox and platysma prominence, which is another novel indication that will help build our position in the lower face and neck segment. We continue to expect an FDA approval decision later this year. And we remain on track to submit a regulatory application for BoNT/E near the end of this year. A rapid-onset, short-acting toxin has a highly differentiated clinical profile and once approved would offer patients a novel option compared to currently available toxins. So, in summary, we\u2019ve made great progress across all of our therapeutic areas in the first half of the year and we look forward to additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2024. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott. Hey, Mohit. It\u2019s Roopal. I can talk about that. With respect to orals, we did do this deal with Landos and this is our NX-13asset, which we\u2019ll anticipate a readout end of this year, beginning of next year. Early data point to good outcomes in ulcerative colitis and this asset works through NF-kappa-beta, so you\u2019ll see what we\u2019ve observed in preclinical models is reductions in IL-6, IL-1, TNF, interferon gamma. And it\u2019s potentially a monotherapy and one that wouldn\u2019t have a boxed warning. So far, the safety data has looked good. But there\u2019s also opportunities, we believe, as you mentioned, combinations, that you could still combine with Rinvoq. And as I mentioned the boxed warning and in certain geographies, Rinvoq is utilized post-anti-TNF. Even with a combo there, there\u2019s still opportunity. The second and third line segments in IBD and across immunology continue to grow, and they\u2019re getting larger and larger as patients cycle through biosimilar anti-TNFs. We\u2019ll see them cycle through, for example, in IBD with IL-1223, like Stelara. So in the future, there\u2019s multiple opportunities. And the way we think about these is do we see an asset that is novel and can address mechanisms that haven\u2019t been addressed yet, and can they complement something like Rinvoq? So if you see a little bit less efficacy, that may be okay if it\u2019s complementary. It may not work necessarily as a monotherapy, but we still see opportunities for a combo. And given the other assets that we\u2019ve talked about that could be IV or sub-cue, we still see a lot of opportunity with Skyrizi. In a platform study in IBD we\u2019ll kick off later this year, looking at various combinations, many of the assets that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, including a TL1A, including our own internal alpha-4 beta-7, could be added on to Skyrizi to drive that efficacy even higher because there\u2019s still a bit of a ceiling effect. And I would say the unmet need in IBD in particular continues to be quite high. Trung, it\u2019s Roopal. I\u2019ll take the next question on the pipeline. So, we continue to be excited about bispecifics, in particular lutikizumab. And it\u2019s an IL-1 alpha, and importantly, also 1-beta. And this, we believe, distinguishes it from earlier generation assets that were singular, and let\u2019s say, only took out IL-1 alpha. We see, I would say, very, very strong benefits in hidradenitis suppurativa and I don\u2019t think that was observed as a pure monoclonal. And the efficacy that we\u2019re seeing is in a 100% anti-TNF failure population and very sick, early Stage 3, 70%. It is one of the most severe, probably the most severe ever studied. So we think there continues to be potential in the bispecific space as you take out multiple cytokines. The way to address it is through engineering of the assets. The other way is combination, so we can get to that bispecific approach through combos. And then, thirdly, I would say earlier in the pipeline is the multispecific approach, which the advantage that could provide is you maintain your bispecific approach, but then a third arm, let\u2019s say, can target specific cells and that could further enhance efficacy, and in particular, safety. And we\u2019re looking at that approach in immunology and as well in oncology, and that was reflected in our partnership with Tentarix. Jeff, maybe to add. it\u2019s Roopal here. There is going to be competition, but what we see as a benefit clinically for Vraylar is that full spectrum coverage in bipolar and when you\u2019re able to take mania, you don\u2019t need an adjunctive therapy for that. So that\u2019s a big advantage. The other thing that we continue to hear and probably reflected in our data is the really limited impact on fatigue and sedation. And so what we\u2019re hearing is with Vraylar, patients really don\u2019t have to sacrifice their daytime productivity in order to gain that benefit. And then the other benefit, I would say, with Vraylar is flexible, adjustable dosing. So these things together, I think, underlie what Jeff was speaking about."

            "content": "Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our second-quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.52 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $14.5 billion, $450 million ahead of our guidance and reflecting robust growth of 5.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 18% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. Adjusted gross margin was 85.2% of sales. Adjusted R&D expense was 13.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.6% of sales, which includes a 6.5% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $506 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18.8%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 to between $10.71 and $10.91. This EPS guidance continues to contemplate approximately $0.19 of dilution for the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which is expected to close soon. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $55.5 billion, an increase of $500 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions with the entire sales increase, once again, driven by our ex-Humira growth platform, which is now on pace to deliver nearly $6 billion of sales growth in 2024. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $11 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong performance across all approved indications. Rinvoq, total revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting continued robust uptake in IBD. Venclexta total sales of approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting momentum in both U.S. and international markets. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion. Given slower-than-expected near-term market growth, particularly in the U.S. and China, as a result, our total sales guidance for Botox and Juvederm will each be lower by roughly $100 million. Moving to the P&L for 2024, we continue to forecast a full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14% and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5%. We now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales, in line with our previous expectations after including the approximately 2% impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the second quarter. And we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16.3%, also reflecting the impact of IPR&D. Turning to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.92 and $2.96. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance and I\u2019m very pleased with the strong momentum across the portfolio heading into the second half of the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Liz. Thanks, Terence. This is Scott. I\u2019ll handle the question. So, with respect to 2025, as you know, we haven\u2019t given guidance yet and we\u2019ll provide that at a later time. But we have communicated a few top-level, high-level items to put in context of several dynamics at play next year. We have indicated that we\u2019ll be returning to robust revenue growth, despite the headwinds from Medicare Part D redesign and continued Humira erosion. And when you think about robust growth, we characterize robust growth to be above industry average growth, which we see in the low-single digits. So when you think about the drivers, I mentioned in my remarks that we have $6 billion of growth from the growth platform in 2024 that we\u2019re expecting. $5 billion of that is coming from Skyrizi and Rinvoq alone, our neuros franchise is growing by more than $1 billion and aesthetics has begun to recover from the economic headwinds. In 2025, we see incremental contributions from Skyrizi UC, which was recently approved, as well as 951. All these factors demonstrate strong momentum in the business. And then when you think about the offset of Humira, that erosion that we have expected this year at $4.5 billion. Last year that erosion was $6.5 billion and we do expect another step down in absolute dollar terms in 2025 for that erosion as well. So that will be less of a headwind to growth in 2025 than it was in 2024. So we feel very, very strong about that. And I think from a Part D perspective, we\u2019ve talked about the several points of growth headwinds that we see there. And I think when you model that, you can think about those several points as approximately a 3% headwind to growth. So, overall, very strong momentum from the business with some headwinds, but we feel very confident in our ability to return to robust growth at the topline. Regarding EPS, the bottomline, we see EPS growing in line with that revenue growth that we\u2019ve talked about. So, EPS will benefit from operating margin expansion. We\u2019ve talked about that operating margin expansion will be on the SG&A line as we leverage the revenue growth and drive efficiencies and we have a good history of doing that. So, that operating margin will expand. However, that expansion will be roughly offset by the fact that in 2025, we\u2019ll have a full year of interest expense associated with the financing for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So robust growth at the topline and in-line growth from an EPS perspective. Yeah. This is Scott. I\u2019ll take the question regarding EPS growth or earnings growth in line with the revenue growth. So when we look at this, as I mentioned, we\u2019re looking at a couple of things. The SG&A that we\u2019re driving some operating margin expansion, we spent a lot of time focusing on that and we do see some efficiencies that we can drive, and we do have the ability to leverage that. So there will be expansion operating margin, which you would expect to then let earnings outpace the revenue growth. However, there is this offset and we had a very successful bond offering when we set the financing in place for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So, but that will be an offset to the operating margin expansion. So you can think of those two as essentially netting one another and then driving that earnings growth in line with the topline. Steve, this is Scott. I will talk regarding the revenue. So, just to clarify, we did raise the revenue guidance in total from $55 billion to $55.5 billion, a $500 million raise and that included a $300 million raise for Skyrizi, a $100 million raise for Rinvoq, a $100 million raise for Venclexta, a $200 million spread across other products and then a $200 million reduction in the guidance for aesthetics. So, we do see very strong momentum in the business and we did raise our sales guidance from $55 billion to $55.5 billion. Trung, this is Scott. I\u2019ll start with your question regarding the long-term guidance on aesthetics. So you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve guided to a long-term $9 billion in 2029 and we\u2019re not changing that guidance. The guidance changed, as you noted, that I mentioned today is just a short-term guidance change for 2024. We remain very confident in our ability to hit that $9 billion in 2029. When you think about these markets, there\u2019s very low penetration in the markets globally. There\u2019s a lot of excitement in the space and we expect the market to recover and grow at historical rates. I would say when we look at the market growth, we do see that rebounding and growing well. And then you also should think about there\u2019s additional innovation coming that will drive that. So, we have some of the additional indications in Botox that Roopal walked through, as well as the quick onset short-acting toxin BoNT/E that will also drive additional market growth. And so we continue to feel very comfortable with our ability to achieve that on a long-term basis in 2029."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I\u2019ll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7 billion. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $4.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 50% in their fifth full year on the market. These assets are approved across a broad set of indications and are collectively supported by nine compelling head-to-head studies that demonstrate clear differentiation across multiple novel therapies, which has resulted in strong share capture. For Skyrizi, we continue to advance our clear leadership position in psoriasis, where total prescription share of the U.S. biologic market has increased to approximately 38%. Share is also ramping nicely in PSA, especially in the dermatology segment, where Skyrizi has achieved roughly 15% total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market. And for Rinvoq, we are seeing increasing share across each of the rheum indications, as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis, including total prescription share of 10% in the U.S. We are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq are on pace to double their respective sales in IBD this year. The adoption in Crohn\u2019s disease has been impressive, with Skyrizi and Rinvoq now achieving a combined in-place share in the U.S. of more than 40%. Skyrizi has achieved overall in-place share leadership in Crohn\u2019s, with in-place share approximately now 13 points ahead of Stelara, following our compelling head-to-head sequence data published last year. This positive trial, which demonstrated Skyrizi\u2019s high efficacy versus Stelara, including a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission has driven a significant inflection in performance and we anticipate continued share momentum. Commercialization for Skyrizi and ulcerative colitis is now underway in the U.S., with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the next several months. Early feedback from gastroenterologists has been very encouraging, with Skyrizi\u2019s UC data viewed as impressive, particularly for na\u00efve patients who have not been exposed to biologics. We also expect the European launch in the coming months. We also see very robust adoption of Rinvoq in UC, where the brand is now achieving a leading in-place share in the U.S. Internationally, Rinvoq UC is now approved in 75 countries, with reimbursement and share gaining momentum. Having two novel therapies that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy to treat both of these IBD conditions demonstrates our commitment to transforming the treatment landscape for physicians and patients in this area of high unmet need. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $2.8 billion, down 28.9% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. was in line with our expectations in the quarter and our guidance complicates -- contemplates the impact of additional formulary changes over the course of the year. Importantly, we continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.6 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $833 million, down 8.2, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $637 million, up 15.8 on an operational basis, with strong momentum across CLL and AML. Elahere is also performing very well, with sales of $128 million and our compelling overall survival data, recent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines and the expansion of commercial resources will continue to drive rapid uptake. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with the prescription trends for Epkinly in DLBCL. Commercialization is now underway for Epkinly\u2019s second indication, follicular lymphoma, in the U.S., with European approval expected later this year. Neuroscience total revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar, with global sales of $774 million, Ubrelvy with total revenue of $231 million and Qulipta with global sales of $150 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well-positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $814 million, up 9.6% on an operational basis. Finally, we are pleased with the early launch trends for 951 in Japan and Europe, and look forward to bringing this innovative therapy for advanced Parkinson\u2019s to the U.S. soon. Overall, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? Yeah. Hi, Chris. It\u2019s Jeff. I\u2019ll take that question. So, as noted, we\u2019re very, very pleased with the fundamental momentum on Rinvoq and Skyrizi. So all of the indications are really hitting their stride. So we can see the impact of, obviously, consumer investments we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve adjusted some of the sales forces. We\u2019ve started to anticipate the ulcerative colitis that\u2019s helped us basically increase our share of voice. And I think the other dynamic in terms of some of the incremental strength has come from this dynamic that we started to see earlier in the quarter where some of the Humira switching that takes place actually starts to accrue towards Skyrizi and Rinvoq because the physicians, when there\u2019s this disruption in the market, will sometimes bring in those patients and start to assess them, and we saw about 20% would move to other mechanisms. So while it\u2019s a component, there are certainly multifactorial approaches why we see this very, very strong volume dynamic and share capture for both of those agents. If I move to the contracting for 2025, obviously, the contract season is in progress and it\u2019s progressing, and the negotiations are well underway. I think it\u2019s important, if you\u2019ll recall, that we already have some multiyear contracts in place that cover 2025, so that\u2019s a positive dynamic. The remaining payer negotiations, as I mentioned, are underway and we anticipate that those will close out during the normal cycle. I would say that, at a macro level, we do expect to maintain parity access next year for Humira for a meaningful portion of lives across all of the channels. Now, that said, our Humira access will certainly be lower than this year as we continue to anticipate and watch certain segments of the market move to adopt biosimilars. And we\u2019ve understood and planned for this, obviously, as we enter that third year of the biosimilars and so we\u2019re well aware of dynamically evaluating how this is going to work out. So, certainly, things are progressing. We already have some in place from those multiyear contracts and we\u2019ll be in a better position to provide some more information, obviously, later in the year as those negotiations or the remaining negotiations fully close out. Thank you, Rob. And maybe, Chris, one more point that I didn\u2019t address was the Skyrizi and Rinvoq contracting. So we are anticipating very robust and consistent access for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And our former comments around sort of low single-digit price erosion should be quite consistent with what we said before. Obviously, the Medicare Part D is a separate dynamic. So things are stable and we\u2019re anticipating ongoing very strong access for both of those brands. Maybe because it\u2019s worth mentioning, so some of that shift in promotional activity that you mentioned, we did talk about in the first quarter that that was a destocking that occurred of inventory levels. And when Carrie made her remarks and we spoke about it last quarter, we said that would reverse over time. We did see that reversing in the second quarter on a partial basis. And when you think about the reversal of that Q1 destock, you can think about from the U.S. market that really would reduce by 50% or cut in half the growth rates we published for the actual results for both Botox and Juvederm. So we saw that partial reversal of that destocking event and then we will see that continue to unwind throughout the course of the year, especially as we have some of our larger promotional activities and the back half of the year with Botox Day and Juvederm Day, we do see typically an inventory, a stocking uplift from those activities. Yeah. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s almost like a bimodal phenomenon. So, the 20% I highlighted, so if you just look from our data, when we just look at the CVS template, so we can see the degradation of Humira that goes down pretty steeply because, remember, it\u2019s an exclusion. So, Humira is no longer widely available at all. So, most of it happens within the first two weeks or three weeks. And in that one segment, we see that the biosimilar doesn\u2019t take up all the Humira loss and we can see it moving to other mechanisms, particularly Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So that\u2019s within, let\u2019s say, the acute biosimilar event. Now, to Rob\u2019s point, what he highlighted is, if you take a step back and you look at the macro market, we\u2019ve started to see in the first quarter and second quarter that the overall molecule, so that\u2019s the adalimumab molecule, inclusive of biosimilars, has started to compress faster than it did before there was the availability of this action that was taken by CVS. So, it\u2019s a doubling of effect, acutely in the segment that takes place with the exclusion and then the wider market. Now, we\u2019re watching this pretty carefully because we haven\u2019t -- obviously haven\u2019t seen something like this before in terms of the compression of a molecule. So, that\u2019s basically the dynamics that we\u2019re seeing. And we do think it\u2019s because some physicians or segments of physicians are, they realize that these biosimilars where there\u2019s an acute interruption, they want to check how the patients are doing. And if they\u2019re not fully in remission when they come in for their appointment, let\u2019s say before the switch, sometimes they\u2019re transitioned at the rates that I described. So that\u2019s sort of the prescriber behavior. Now, where is it coming from? Like, well, we actually see that it is accruing across all of the indications, particularly Humira has quite robust, let\u2019s say, base dynamics in the rheumatology indications. But we can see it in rheum. We can see it in derm. Derm to Skyrizi in particular, which is probably not a surprise given the position. I highlighted a 38% share and a 60% in-place share for Skyrizi and derm. And we also do see it to some degree in gastroenterology. So, to Rob\u2019s point, we\u2019re going to continue to monitor that. If the overall molecule would continue to compress, obviously, there would be some mitigation of some of it accruing over to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and so we\u2019ll have to continue to see how these weeks and months play out here over the third quarter. Yeah. Thank you for the question. A very important question in terms of how we commercialize these. Roopal highlighted it. Obviously, you have the two big indications with two assets within those indications. And so we have constructed, not just in the U.S., but around the world, a very sophisticated approach in terms of multiple sleeves of representatives and medical experts that are representing both drugs across both indications. And it really is, let\u2019s say, for example, in our largest market, the U.S., it\u2019s relatively easy to execute, because what we see is that our representatives can highlight Skyrizi\u2019s data and potential as the obvious frontline agent, which is obviously tremendous data. I mentioned the sequence data. I mentioned our core data. The naive to biologic data in UC is absolutely fantastic for the Skyrizi data. And then, really ironically, because of the label changes that took place a few years ago, Rinvoq is positioned in later lines. So, really, that sort of approach is highly synergistic in terms of we recommend that physicians consider starting with Skyrizi and the efficacy will be fantastic. But to Roopal\u2019s point, there\u2019s still pressure on that disease and then you have a backstop with tremendous, tremendous data on Rinvoq in later lines. And so that\u2019s how we position it. We look and we monitor the cannibalization. It\u2019s quite modest, and overall, when you look at the dynamic of share capture, it\u2019s quite encouraging to see how the infield teams and the commercial teams are managing all of those assets. So, we\u2019re very encouraged about how we\u2019ve approached the market in terms of our execution and I think the results are speaking for themselves. And Steve and Jeff, so to give some sense, so we\u2019re looking at coming up on the third year of biosimilar. So, the first way to think about it, in the first year 2023, we had very strong parity access across all the channels and we really exited the year around, I think, 97% or something like that. This year, I think, when we look at all the ins and outs, I think, the three-quarter approach is quite reasonable, and as I mentioned in my remarks to early one of the questions, it will certainly be lower next year and I would think that that range would be around that 0.5 point, but again, we\u2019re not fully complete with all the dynamics. So, that gives you some broad spectrum over three years, maybe around the halfway point, plus or minus, as we go into 2025. Yeah. Hi. It\u2019s Jeff. We\u2019re very pleased with how both of the indications are performing and we monitor them very carefully, certainly with bipolar and aMDD. So when we look at our quarterly surveys of our target physicians and really our whole call cycle, we can see now that Vraylar is the most preferred agent overall for bipolar disease based on its indication set, its tolerability, its efficacy, et cetera. And we\u2019ve really gone to the very top of the lead table for aMDD as well. So, if we look overall on our demand, we\u2019re tracking above 20% in terms of the push. We continue to focus our team and where necessary add share a voice in terms of our sales force. So, we\u2019re quite comfortable that we can continue to grow our share, which has been growing very, very nicely, particularly on the MBRX side, and certainly, face the competitive dynamics and navigate those as we go forward."

In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $863 million increased by 4.4%, driven by Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm growth of 7.1% and 10.4%, respectively. This toxin and filler performance is supported by a consistent recovery in the facial injectable market, as the number of procedures in both categories increased by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. However, this level of market growth was lower than previously anticipated. Sales for Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm also benefited from a partial reversal of the prior quarter\u2019s inventory destock, which was related to the timing of certain promotional activities. From a competitive perspective, our U.S. facial injectable portfolio remains the clear market leader, with strong and stable market share. Internationally, second quarter aesthetic sales were $527 million, roughly flat versus the prior year on an operational basis, as declines in China were balanced by growth in other international markets. In China, our largest international market, sales growth continued to be impacted by sustained economic headwinds, as well as a challenging comparison to the second quarter of last year, which benefited from a strong post-COVID recovery. Consistent with what we experienced in the U.S., economic challenges have impacted Juvederm sales growth more than other areas of our portfolio, based upon Juvederm\u2019s relatively higher price point. Looking to the rest of the year, we expect our market-leading aesthetics portfolio to continue to perform well from a competitive perspective across the globe. As we evaluate market dynamics and leading economic indicators, particularly in the U.S. and China, market growth trends are below our prior expectations. Based upon this, we have moderated our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite this near-term dynamic, we remain confident in the long-term growth outlook of our aesthetics portfolio. Global market penetration rates are extremely low and we expect long-term market growth to accelerate from current levels as economic conditions improve. As the market leader, we are also committed to driving growth by activating new patients and launching innovative treatment options. For example, in China, launch activities are underway for the Botox Cosmetic masseter muscle prominence indication. And in the U.S., we will soon launch Juvederm VOLUMA XC for the treatment of temple hollowing and we expect an approval for Botox Cosmetic in the platysma prominence indication by the end of the year. Pipeline catalysts like these in the key U.S. and China markets, along with our significant investment in consumer activation, injector training and practice support, will enable us to grow the aesthetics market and maintain our clear leadership position over the long-term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Roopal. Hi. This is Carrie. I\u2019ll address the questions. So, first let\u2019s talk about the market dynamics for market growth in the U.S. for facial injectables. So, late last year, we started to see a recovery and a return to growth of the toxin market and we\u2019ve seen that market growth recovery continue this year in that mid-single-digit range. And that\u2019s volume, that is traffic into our customers\u2019 offices and that\u2019s really been consistent for the past few quarters. So, the market dynamics for our business are really driven by patient demand and volume. Although, when we think about price, price is a factor that we\u2019ll be looking for the second half of the year, which will give us some favorable pricing dynamics. We did take a price action at the beginning of the year for toxins and then we\u2019ll have some more efficiency when it comes to our strategic shifts in our pricing promotions for the second half of the year. So, one example of that would be promotions we did last year, for example, around competitive launches that we won\u2019t need to do this year based on the success of our competitive strategy last year. So really our performance is driven by market growth and we also had some nice stability in our market share. Anything you\u2019d like to add?"

            "name": "Rob Michael",
            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It\u2019s a pleasure to speak with you today as AbbVie\u2019s new CEO. I look forward to building on our track record of success and delivering on AbbVie\u2019s promise to our patients, employees, shareholders and communities. As we begin this new chapter, nearly every aspect of AbbVie\u2019s business is performing at or above our expectations. We are demonstrating a rapid return to revenue growth, with operational sales up nearly 4% through the first half of this year, including robust mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. Our ex-Humira growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie\u2019s total sales, will outperform our initial full year sales guidance by more than $1 billion, driven by strong performance in immunology and oncology. In addition, U.S. Humira performance continues to meet our expectations, having achieved or exceeded our guidance in all six quarters with biosimilar competition. The strong performance across our diversified portfolio will drive top-tier high single-digit compound growth through the end of this decade, which will support continued investment to drive growth in the next decade. Turning to our results, I\u2019m especially pleased with immunology, where our leading portfolio is delivering performance well above our expectations. Skyrizi continues to demonstrate strong momentum in psoriasis and Crohn\u2019s disease, where we have substantial headroom for additional share gains and the recent approval in UC will add another source of long-term growth. Rinvoq is also delivering robust growth across all approved indications. We are making excellent progress with late-stage development in five additional indications that we anticipate will launch in the second half of this decade. In oncology, Elahere has accelerated our on-market presence in solid tumors. We also have several exciting pipeline programs, including two novel c-Met ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, as well as 383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma. In neuroscience, our leading therapies for migraine and mood disorders continue to gain share and are competitively well-positioned. The pending acquisition of Cerevel will further augment our neuroscience pipeline and we\u2019re excited about what our two companies can achieve together to make a difference for patients with neuropsych disorders. We have certified substantial compliance to the FTC second request and anticipate the Cerevel transaction will close soon. Lastly, we\u2019ve been very active with business development, investing in exciting opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. Through the first half of this year, we have executed nearly a dozen early-stage deals. These include promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard-of-care in immunology, oncology and neuroscience. In summary, I\u2019m very pleased with the strong momentum of our business. AbbVie\u2019s results once again exceed our expectations and we are raising guidance for the second time this year, underscoring our confidence in the business. The robust performance of our growth platform and the advancement of our pipeline supports AbbVie\u2019s top-tier long-term outlook. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? And Chris, this is Rob. Just to reiterate an important point that Jeff made, I mean, one trend that we are watching very closely is the switching from the Humira molecule to new mechanisms. I mean, we are starting to see an inflection that is accruing to new mechanisms like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as Jeff mentioned. And it makes sense, doctors that are reevaluating the patients in their practice are likely looking at more than just the patients that are covered by CVS. What we have factored in is the CVS impact. What we didn\u2019t factor in necessarily is an impact beyond just the CVS-wise. And to the extent that trend continues, it would represent a downside for Humira and an upside for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a very good long-term tradeoff for us. That\u2019s an important point. We want to make sure that was captured. Hey, Carter. This is Rob. I\u2019ll take your question on Cerevel. Look, we\u2019ve made very good progress with the FTC and have certified substantial compliance to their second request. No divestments are expected. I would expect the transaction to close soon, potentially as early as next week. We\u2019re obviously very excited about the potential best-in-class therapies in Cerevel\u2019s pipeline, especially emraclidine for schizophrenia, davapidon for early Parkinson\u2019s and their core antagonist for major depression. I mean, these assets clearly will be great additions to our neuroscience franchise. Yeah. Vamil, thanks for the question. So, the $11 floor, again, was on an ex-IPR&D basis, where obviously with this guidance, ex-IPR&D, I think, we\u2019re just a little bit over $11.40 and we\u2019re certainly positioned to return to robust growth. I mean, we\u2019re delivering robust revenue growth this quarter. When you look at the outlook for 2025, it\u2019s very strong and so we should be beyond the conversations on the floor at this point. As we think about the tradeoffs for the long-term and the short-term, clearly we have an on-market portfolio today that can drive the growth that we need to deliver on that high single-digit, top-tier outlook in this decade. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on early-stage assets that can drive growth in the next decade, and you\u2019ve seen us execute nearly a dozen deals this year along those lines. These include new mechanisms in immunology that can combine with Skyrizi or Rinvoq or be pursued as model therapies. We\u2019ve also added new platforms, including multi-specifics, that have applicability in immunology and oncology. Our deal targeting in situ CAR-T therapy is another example of a platform investment in oncology. And we added a novel mechanism for psychiatric disorders, given our focus in neuroscience. So we intend to continue adding more depth to our pipeline in our core areas, particularly think about early-stage deals, because what we\u2019re really trying to set up for is that growth in the next decade. We have a clear line of sight to top-tier growth this decade and we want to position the company to deliver strong growth in the next decade as well. And Steve, this is Rob. If you just look at, as I mentioned in my remarks, the first half of the year, we talked operational growth around 4%. If you -- the implied operational growth in the second half, based on our guidance, would be slightly above that and really driven by the ex-Humira growth platform, which on a reported basis, grew more than 18% this quarter. And so we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of the business, and I think, when you look at the guidance and you do the math, you\u2019ll see that the actual implied second half operational growth is slightly higher than the first half. Yeah. Yeah. So, typically, again, in some cases we are able to secure multiyear contracts. And as you can imagine that we would do that for the portfolio, basically, the way that our products work. So, that does help with the visibility in terms of what our access would look like for 2025, as well as the pricing dynamics. Again, I want to clarify that the negotiating season is not fully complete, but the dynamics are progressing, as I highlighted there. So, yes, to your first question. The other dynamic in terms of Cordavis, I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s actually changing the dynamics in terms of the negotiations overall. That was obviously a volume-related deal with CVS that we announced over a year ago or almost a year ago now. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily play into other negotiations. Each of these payers and pharmacy benefit managers, they have their own ideas in terms of how they want to approach the I&I category and certainly the Humira -- the emergence of the Humira biosimilars. So it\u2019s a CVS-unique dynamic. So, Louise, this is Rob. I\u2019ll take your question. Look, we like the aesthetics business. When you think about the growth profile, the profitability, we have set it up as a fully integrated standalone unit, because it behaves differently than the therapeutics business. We think we\u2019ve actually seen, since we announced the transaction, really strong performance. We\u2019ve exceeded our deal model expectations since we announced the deal. So we think it\u2019s operating very well. Obviously, we\u2019re working through some macroeconomic headwinds. But when you look at, for example, share performance, we had the entry of DAXXIFY last year and we did not lose any share. I think a lot of investors were concerned that we\u2019d see considerable share loss. And so I think the team has done a remarkable job of competing in this marketplace, going through a period with economic headwinds. We\u2019re still very confident given low penetration rates, given our relationship in the field, the potential innovations that we plan to bring forward. It has a very nice fit. And you think about just from a profitability and a growth standpoint, it fits the profile we\u2019re looking for. So I certainly feel it\u2019s a nice fit for the company. As it relates to the election, look, it\u2019s hard to handicap it, whether Democrat or Republican. If you think about we\u2019ve obviously contemplated the Inflation Reduction Act. We\u2019ve come out and said that even with modeling that impact in, that we still expect to deliver on our long-term outlook. Now, I will say our view on the IRA from a policy perspective is we\u2019re certainly in favor of the Part D benefit redesign because it helps address patient out-of-pocket burn. But the price-setting provisions in the IRA will certainly harm long-term innovation in our industry. So, we are hopeful that if it\u2019s a new administration or the current administration, that they\u2019ll reassess those provisions that ultimately are harmful for long-term patient care in the U.S. I mean, it clearly takes away the incentive to launch in later lines of smaller patient populations, which is really a very unfortunate negative outcome for the legislation. So, the way I view it is addressing patient out-of-pocket burden is good policy, but taking away the incentive for innovation is not, and my hope is under either administration, that will be reconsidered."

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nLiz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics; and Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer, Global Therapeutics.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2024 with first quarter results exceeding our expectations. Before we discuss our performance in more detail, I'd like to share my perspective on the planned CEO transition that was announced earlier this year. After serving more than 11 years as AbbVie's first CEO, I have decided to retire from the role effective July 1, of this year and will continue to serve AbbVie as Executive Chairman of the Board. As you heard me say before, it is important that we choose the right time to make this critical leadership transition. The Board and I have been long planning for my eventual succession and now is the opportune time to move forward with the transition. As our business is performing very well and is in a strong position for the long-term. We are successfully navigating the Humira U.S. loss of exclusivity. We have built an outstanding company culture, an important priority and competitive advantage. And our productive R&D engine, which has yielded numerous innovative new medicines for patients will continue to fuel our robust pipeline for years to come. After a multi-year process, our board has unanimously selected Rob Michael, our current President and Chief Operating Officer as AbbVie's next CEO. I have known and worked with Rob for many, many years and he is an excellent choice as my successor. He brings the experience, the leadership and the strategic vision to build on AbbVie's past successes, advance our strategy and enhance shareholder value. Since our inception, Rob has held several important leadership positions that have collectively had a tremendous impact on AbbVie from establishing our financial planning organization to navigating the end of exclusivity for Humira in the U.S., to driving key business development opportunities that have been critical to diversify our business and support long-term growth, including the acquisitions of Allergan and ImmunoGen and the pending Cerevel transaction. Looking back, AbbVie has evolved tremendously as an independent company and our performance has truly been exceptional. Since our inception, we've grown our revenue from $18 billion to $55 billion. Our market capitalization has increased substantially from $54 billion to roughly $300 billion today. We have achieved a total shareholder return of more than 675%, which is top tier relative to our peers. And importantly, we\u2019ve substantially increased our investments in R&D to discover and develop new medicines that have the potential to improve the lives of patients. As I look ahead, our company has never been stronger and our future has never been brighter. We are executing well across all aspects of our business and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. In summary, it has been a privilege and immensely gratifying to serve with all of my AbbVie colleagues for the past 11 years, growing AbbVie into what it is today. And I look forward to continuing to work with Rob and the leadership team to create meaningful value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. And I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our shareholders for the trust and confidence you put in me as AbbVie's CEO. With that, I will turn the call over to Rob for comments on our recent business performance. Rob?\nRob Michael: Thank you, Rick. Before I comment on our first quarter performance, I want to congratulate Rick on his exceptional leadership of AbbVie over the past 11 years. During his tenure, Rick made several strategic moves that have positioned AbbVie to have a bright future beyond Humira, consistently drove the organization to deliver very strong performance and demonstrated the genuine care for our employees, patients, shareholders and communities that has defined who we are as a company today. It has been my privilege to work closely with Rick over many years, and I look forward to working with him in his role as Executive Chairman. AbbVie's outlook is very strong and I am excited about the remarkable impact that we the remarkable impact that we will continue to have on patients' lives. Turning to first quarter performance, we're off to an excellent start to the year with strong top and bottom-line results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations. This overachievement was driven by our ex-Humira growth platform, which delivered revenue growth of more than 15% this quarter and includes continued robust sales from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, with combined growth above 50% in their fifth full year on the market, as well as double-digit revenue growth from several other key products including Venclexta, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and Qulipta. This broad based sales momentum clearly demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio with multiple growth drivers to support our long-term outlook. We are also making excellent progress with several of our near-term priorities. We recently completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, which accelerates our entry into the solid tumor market and strengthens our oncology pipeline. The integration has been seamless and we are impressed by the caliber of talent we have welcomed into AbbVie. We also remain on track with the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which we anticipate will close in the middle of the year. Cerevel's pipeline of differentiated assets will further augment our neuroscience portfolio. In addition, we continue to advance our R&D pipeline and invest for long-term growth. This progress includes the FDA's full approval of Elahere for FR alpha positive platinum resistant ovarian cancer, a meaningful first in class treatment for patients and a significant long-term growth opportunity for AbbVie in solid tumors. We also gained U.S. approval of Juvederm Voluma XC for temple hollows, further strengthening our leadership in aesthetic fillers, and we executed several business development opportunities adding novel early stage programs and partnerships in oncology and immunology. Given the strong results this quarter, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.16 and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.13 and $11.33. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie and I am extremely pleased with the momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're off to an excellent start to the year and we are well positioned to deliver a high-single-digit revenue CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\nJeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $5.4 billion exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi global sales were $2 billion reflecting operational growth of 48%. We continue to see exceptional momentum across all of the approved indications. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market with a total prescription share now above 35%. That's more than double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. Share is also ramping nicely in PsA, especially in the dermatology segment, where we are now capturing one out of every four new or switching in play biologic patients. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved psoriatic in play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries. In IBD, Skyrizi is on track to add more than $1 billion of incremental sales growth this year. We are seeing tremendous performance in Crohn's disease, where our compelling head-to-head data versus Stelara is driving a meaningful inflection of patient share. As a result, we have now achieved in play share leadership in Crohn's across all lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Japan as well as other key markets around the world. And finally, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which represents another substantial long-term growth driver. We expect approval decisions in the middle of this year and anticipate rapid access in the U.S. following our launch. Given the robust frontline capture for Skyrizi in Crohn's and the exceptional bio-naive data we have generated in UC, we anticipate a strong launch. Turning now to Rinvoq with global sales of approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of 61.9%. In rheum, we continue to see strong prescription growth across each of the four approved indications, and I'm especially pleased with our performance in rheumatoid arthritis, where Rinvoq has achieved in play share leadership in nearly 20 key international markets. Atopic dermatitis is tracking in line with our expectations with continued market share momentum globally. Importantly, we recently announced positive results from LEVEL UP, our second head-to-head study in AD. LEVEL UP demonstrated Rinvoq superiority for patients starting therapy on the 15 milligram dose versus Dupixent across key efficacy parameters, including the high levels of skin clearance and itch reduction. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will support additional share capture, especially given Rinvoq label use in the U.S., which requires that initiation with a 15 milligram dose. And in IBD, Rinvoq's uptake continues to be very strong. Rinvoq is capturing high teens in play patient share in ulcerative colitis as well as mid-teens in play patient share in Crohn's disease. This performance is especially encouraging recognizing that we're still relatively early in the launch phase for both the UC and CD indications, and the lines of therapy are also expanding, with second line plus growing even faster as patients cycle to newer, higher efficacy agents like Rinvoq and IBD. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of approximately $2.3 billion, down 35.2% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. played out slightly better than our expectations in the quarter with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price. As previously communicated, the recent changes to the CVS template formularies were anticipated in our full year outlook for U.S. Humira and the volume impact is tracking in line with our expectations. Our guidance has also contemplated the impact of additional formulary changes that are expected to go into effect over the course of the year. We continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.5 billion exceeding our expectations. Imbruvica global revenues were $838 million, down 4.5%, reflecting continued competitive pressure in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $614 million, up 16.3% on an operational basis and we are seeing robust momentum internationally with strong performance for both CLL and AML. Elahere generated $64 million of sales to AbbVie, reflecting a partial quarter of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. The Elahere sales and marketing team is executing very well and I'm pleased with the smooth integration into our commercial organization. We anticipate that the recent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines for both platinum sensitive and platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients as well as the full label approval, which of course, includes the compelling overall survival data that has never been achieved before in these platinum resistant patients will continue to drive strong Elahere uptake. Lastly, the global launch of Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL is also performing well and we remain on track for the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Neuroscience total revenues were nearly $2 billion, up 16% on an operational basis, again, ahead of our expectations. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar with global sales of $694 million, Ubrelvy with total revenue of $203 million and Qulipta with global sales of $131 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $748 million, up 4.5% on an operational basis. And finally, we are very excited about 951, which will be commercialized as Vyalev in the U.S. and represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. Feedback from the launches in Japan and Europe have been very encouraging and we remain on track for commercial approval in the U.S. later this year. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\nCarrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. First quarter global aesthetic sales were over $1.2 billion, reflecting a modest decline on an operational basis. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $776 million were roughly flat versus the prior year. We continue to see sustained momentum in the facial injectable market recovery that emerged in the back half of last year. Consistent with the past few quarters, the toxin market grew by a mid-single-digit percentage. We saw similar year-over-year increases in the number of facial filler procedures, representing a return to quarterly market growth for the first time since early 2022. From a competitive perspective, our U.S. aesthetics portfolio continues to perform well. Market share for both Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm was stable in the first quarter as these assets remain the clear market leaders. While we're pleased that the market and share trends across U.S. facial injectables are aligned with our previous expectations, our first quarter results were impacted by customers holding lower than normal inventory levels at quarter end. This dynamic relates to a decision made during the quarter to shift the timing of certain promotional activities into the second quarter. We therefore expect inventory levels to normalize in the second quarter and remain on track to deliver full year aesthetics sales growth in the U.S. Internationally, first quarter aesthetic sales were $473 million reflecting an operational decline of 5.5%. Consistent with our expectations, growth in China was impacted by persistent economic headwinds as well as a challenging comparison versus the first quarter of last year, which benefited from a robust recovery post-COVID. We are monitoring the economic developments across China and continue to anticipate a recovery in the second half of this year. Our pipeline continues to generate important new assets. Uptake of our recently launched Volux and SkinVive products remain strong, underscoring the importance of innovation within aesthetics. Given this context, we are excited for the upcoming launch of Juvederm Voluma XC for the treatment of temple hollows. As the only dermal filler approved for use in the upper face, we anticipate the Voluma XC introduction will activate more consumers and support the long-term growth of our filler portfolio. And within our toxin pipeline, we continue to expect FDA approval of the platysma prominence indication for Botox near the end of this year, enhancing Botox growth potential as a noninvasive treatment to reduce the appearance of vertical neck bands and improve jawline definition. We also remain on track to submit a new drug application for our short acting toxin, BoNT/E, before the end of this year. This novel toxin has demonstrated a rapid onset of action as well as a short duration of effect, meaningfully lowering the barrier for toxin adoption across consumers who have been considering but hesitant to try Botox. Given this profile, BoNT/E has significant market expansion potential as satisfied patients would naturally convert to Botox. Overall, the underlying trends across our aesthetics portfolio align well with our previous expectations and we remain on track to deliver high-single-digit global aesthetics growth this year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\nRoopal Thakkar: Thank you, Carrie. I'll start with immunology. We recently announced positive top-line results from 2 Phase III studies for Rinvoq in dermatology and rheumatology. In the LEVEL UP study, which evaluated Rinvoq against dupilumab in atopic dermatitis, Rinvoq demonstrated superiority on the primary endpoint at week 16, which was a composite endpoint measuring skin clearance and itch reduction. Twice as many Rinvoq patients achieved this very stringent endpoint compared to dupilumab. Rinvoq also demonstrated superiority on all rank secondary endpoints in this trial. LEVEL UP was a study in which patients started on Rinvoq 15 milligrams and could escalate to 30 milligrams if they did not achieve treatment goals, which is how Rinvoq is prescribed for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. We also saw very rapid responses with Rinvoq demonstrating superiority on itch as early as week two and on skin lesions as early as week four. Rinvoq's safety profile in the LEVEL UP trial was consistent with what has been observed in previous studies. There were no serious infections in patients treated with Rinvoq and one in the dupilumab group. The rate of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms. There were no malignancies, MACE events or VTEs reported in either treatment group. Based on these data as well as results from previous Phase III studies, we remain very confident in Rinvoq's profile in atopic dermatitis, and we believe it offers meaningful advantages over other products on the market today. We also announced positive top-line results from our Phase III select giant cell arthritis trial, which evaluated Rinvoq in combination with a 26-week steroid taper regimen compared to patients receiving placebo in combination with a 52-week steroid taper. In the study, Rinvoq 15 milligrams met the primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating superiority on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52, as well as on disease flare and reduction in cumulative steroid exposure at week 52. Importantly, Rinvoq's safety profile was consistent with what has been observed in more than 15,000 patients previously studied across controlled trials. The mean age in this population was 71, which is the oldest population studied to date with Rinvoq. And the average prednisone equivalent dose at baseline was almost 35 milligram. Rates of serious adverse events and VTEs were similar across treatment groups. There were no MACE events in the Rinvoq arm, while there were two in the placebo group. Based on the results from the select GCA trial, we believe Rinvoq has the potential to be a safe and tolerable oral treatment option. We plan to submit our regulatory applications for this indication later this year. We continue to make very good progress with our inflammatory bowel disease programs. We anticipate several advancements this year, including the initiation of a Phase II study for lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis. The start of our Phase II Crohn's disease platform study, which will evaluate combinations of Skyrizi with lutikizumab and other novel biologics. And we remain on track for approval decisions for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, with the U.S. expected in the second quarter and Europe in the second half of the year. We also continue to invest in external innovation to expand our immunology pipeline, as evidenced by four deals that we announced in the first quarter. These include the acquisition of Landos Biopharma, which brings an oral NLRX1 agonist currently in Phase II for ulcerative colitis, a partnership with OSE immunotherapeutics to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist antibody for inflammatory conditions, such as IBD and RA. A collaboration with Parvus Therapeutics to utilize their immune tolerization platform to develop novel therapies for IBD, and a collaboration with Tentarix Biotherapeutics to develop conditionally active, multi-specific biologics in immunology and oncology. We are excited to partner with these companies who are all pursuing very innovative approaches to developing transformative therapies. Moving to oncology, where in the quarter, we closed the ImmunoGen transaction, which brings exciting programs in both solid and blood cancers. Last month, Elahere received full approval from the FDA for FR alpha positive platinum resistant ovarian cancer in patients treated with up to three prior therapies. This conversion to full approval was based on data from the confirmatory Phase III MIRASOL trial, where Elahere demonstrated an overall survival benefit and significantly reduced the risk of cancer progression. We expect to see results from additional ImmunoGen programs this year, including data from the Phase II PICCOLO study evaluating Elahere as a monotherapy in FR alpha positive third line plus platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients who are not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. And we expect to see data in the second half of the year from a potentially registration-enabling Phase II trial for our CD123 targeting ADC, Pivek in a rare blood cancer called blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Now moving to program updates in hematologic oncology. Based on the totality of the data from our TRANSFORM-1 trial and following recent feedback from regulators, we will not be submitting navitoclax for approval in myelofibrosis, and we will wind down the TRANSFORM-2 study, in the relapsed refractory setting. In other areas of [EMAC], we remain on track for several regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for a Epinkly in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. The Phase III readout from the Venclexta VERONA trial, in treatment-naive, higher-risk MDS and initiation of a Phase III monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. We remain very excited about this asset's potential to become a best-in-class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS and with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. Moving to other areas of our pipeline. In aesthetics, we remain on track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E in the second half of the year. Our rapid onset short-acting toxin as a highly differentiated clinical profile compared to currently available neurotoxins. BoNT/E is designed for patients that are considering using facial toxins for the first time or for a special event and will allow them to experience results over a very short period of time. This novel toxin will complement our existing business as patients would naturally transition to BOTOX following experience with this trial toxin. And in neuroscience, we continue to make good progress with 951, where we have received regulatory approvals in 33 countries thus far and anticipate an approval decision in the U.S. in the second quarter. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction in the middle of this year. Cerevel recently announced positive top line results from their Phase III TEMPO-3 trial evaluating Tavapadon as adjunctive therapy to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. In study, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a 1.1 hour increase in total on time without troublesome dyskinesia compared to patients treated with levodopa and placebo. Tavapadon also met the key secondary endpoint in the trial, providing a significant reduction in off time compared to levodopa and placebo. Two additional Phase III studies for Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease are expected to read out later this year. The emracladine pivotal studies in schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out later this year as well. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Reents : Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our first quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance and reflecting a return to growth of 1.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.9% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 15% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.2% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.9%, adjusted R&D expense of 14.7%, acquired IP R&D expense of 1.3% and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.6%. Adjusted net interest expense was $429 million. The adjusted tax rate was 14.8%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $11.13 and $11.33. This increase of $0.16 at the midpoint includes $0.26 of operating overperformance partially offset by $0.10 of higher dilution due to the earlier close of ImmunoGen. As previously communicated, this earnings per share guidance includes $0.42 of dilution related to the recently closed acquisition of ImmunoGen and the pending acquisition of Cerevel. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $55 billion, an increase of $800 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions with the entire sales increase driven by our ex-Humira growth platform. We now expect Skyrizi global revenue of $10.7 billion, an increase of $200 million due to strong momentum across all approved indications. Rinvoq total sales of $5.6 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting robust uptake in IBD. Imbruvica total revenue of $3.1 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting lower erosion and Elahere total sales to AbbVie of $450 million, an increase of roughly $200 million, reflecting a partial year of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. Moving to the P&L for 2024. We continue to forecast adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5%. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.2 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Caravel transactions. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 32%, reflecting a step-up in volume erosion and with the recent CVS formulary change, partially offset by a onetime price benefit also associated with that change. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 49.5% of sales, and we are also modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, I'm very pleased with the excellent start to the year. We are demonstrating strong momentum across the portfolio and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: First question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal : Congrats on the progress and congrats Rob as well. So maybe let's just start with 2024. I mean so thanks for this guidance. But when we look from 2024 to '25, there are a couple of headwinds that you have highlighted in the past. So obviously, IRA Part D redesign will be there and Humira may have another leg down. And given the volume erosion here, people are a little bit concerned there. Can you help us understand that what is your current thinking on the trough, '24 versus '25? And could you give us some confidence that you can continue to grow in '25 despite these headwinds from IRA and Humira?\nRobert Michael : This is Rob. I'll take that question. So if you think about \u201924, \u201825. I mean, clearly, the ex-Humira growth platform is demonstrating great momentum. If you just think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq alone are growing by more than $4 billion per year. Aesthetics will recover to high single-digit growth. Our neuroscience franchise will grow by over $1 billion this year on the heels of strong momentum for Vraylar and our migraine portfolio and we will have incremental contributions from Vyalev and Elahere in '25. So we have several drivers that will offset Humira erosion next year as well as the Part D benefit redesign impact and allow us to still deliver robust revenue growth. When you think about that redesign impact, it will really spread across our business, most concentrated in immunology and oncology. And we would estimate that total revenue impact could be worth several points of growth, while we'll still deliver robust revenue growth, we will have that headwind in '25. But keep in mind, for us, the IRA impact really hits us in '25 and isn't a significant headwind in the years that follow as products that are subject to negotiation will not have that Part D cost share impact. So the way to think about it is despite that headwind in '25, we will still deliver robust growth, with that growth rate accelerating in the years that follow. And then if you think about on a margin perspective, we're going to continue to expand operating margins. So that will be a tailwind. You should be, though modeling annualization of interest expense from these transactions. And keep in mind that we essentially would have -- think of it as a roughly half year for Cereval and 10.5 months this year for ImmunoGen. So that should be something that you do model for '25. So we'll have robust revenue growth we'll have earnings growth, not quite at the rate of the revenue growth because of that annualization impact. But then when you get to \u201826 and beyond, you have even faster revenue growth and very robust earnings growth. So that's probably the best way to think about the profile of the company. But when you look at that ex-Humira growth platform, there's a lot of momentum there and we are very well positioned to deliver very robust growth.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim.\nVamil Divan : So maybe I could just ask a couple on the aesthetics side. It sounds like your commentary is pretty generally in line with Liz said before, but obviously, the number was a little lighter this quarter than even to your guidance that what people are expecting so. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about that you mentioned some shift in promotional efforts to the second quarter and maybe inventory levels then as a result being lower and maybe I don't know if you can quantify that a little bit? And was this sort of planned when you gave your guidance back in February or is this something that's sort of evolved over the quarter? Maybe just kind of why the decision maybe would be helpful to give us some comfort on the outlook there?\nCarrie Strom : This is Carrie. So first, I'll give a little bit of context to the fundamentals in terms of market growth and market share, which were in line with our expectations. So our market share continues to be strong and stable. For Botox Cosmetic, despite a new competitor, strong stable share at high levels. And then for our Juvederm line continued share strength, even some share pickup in in the past few quarters, as we launch our new products. So like you said, those fundamentals are in line with our expectations. As we were going through the quarter, we really realized that the aesthetics market is quite sensitive to seasonality with Q2 and Q4 typically having the highest volume. And after a few years of COVID and economic disruption, we're now anticipating a return to that typical seasonality. So we shifted investment in some of our sales and marketing efforts into Q2, which impacted customer and sales promotional timing and activities, which then resulted in lower inventory held by our customers in Q1. And we do expect that to come back in Q2 and the rest year. And I'll let Scott address the rest of that question.\nScott Reents : Sure. Thanks, Carrie. So Vamil to quantify the inventory impact in the first quarter, it was a little bit more than $50 million between Juvederm and Botox and you can think of that as being split roughly 2/3 to about and 1/3 to Juvederm. And I think as Carrie mentioned in her remarks that impact of that inventory will -- we expect that to turn in the second quarter.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani : When we think about the 2024 upcoming contracting season, which obviously has been quite dynamic for Humira over the past year plus. Can you provide us with any insights in terms of structural aspects within your contracts that you build in that may help provide offsets. We often have limited visibility. We're looking at the prescription volume trends. And it feels as if our calculus is sometimes incomplete. But what can you reassure us in terms of the dynamics as we're seeing this year two play out and how you're approaching contracting for the forward?\nJeff Stewart : Chris, it's Jeff. So the contracting season typically starts April or May. And frankly, as we've highlighted before can run in the immunology category really through the end of the year. So we have a few philosophies that we look towards, which are -- we want to continue to basically make sure that patients if possible, based on our pricing concessions aren't disrupted because when you start to disrupt patients, they do struggle with the change. It's a change in their treatment course. And so as we look to that, we've historically highlighted that we are negotiating for parity contracts with Humira. And we do put some controls in place in some cases, but not all, we seek multi-year contracts with our payers to try to establish the relationship, the pricing, et cetera and we will think of ways to make sure that those contracts can hold. So they have some teeth in them. They can't just be willy-nilly discarded. And so it is a long-term, in some cases, partnership over a couple of years with these payers. I can't go into the details over exactly how those controls work. But suffice it to say that there's terms and timing and limits in terms of when contracts can be changed even maybe some clawbacks in some cases. So because we want these more sustained relationships because of our position in the category with these great brands, we typically use those sort of techniques and that's how we go for it. So again, it's hard to look forward too much because it is dynamic as we look to '25. But we've been quite successful in maintaining good access for our brands and certainly, Humira is tracking in line with our expectations.\nLiz Shea : Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott : Just a couple more on the Humira front. I think Humira you had mentioned that in 2024, you expected most of the impact would be price versus volume. I think the street has been concerned that we're seeing more volume erosion, particularly with the CVS book of business. I'm just interested in your latest thinking as we think about price versus volume for the remainder of this year as we consider CVS [Signa], et cetera. How should we think about that balance just so there's kind of surprises, I guess we watch these volume trends playing out? And then maybe just on a related topic, can you talk at all about the tail for Humira sales in the U.S.? I guess the part of the question, do you expect that you'll see most players or payers eventually switch out Humira like we're seeing at CVS? And if so, is it still reasonable to think about there being a kind of a decent tale of revenue, I guess, for this product in the U.S. over time?\nJeff Ryan : There's a lot in there. Let me go through it in a systematic fashion. So I think, first, to directly answer your question. We still as we look forward, believe that the significant majority of our lives will be at parity. So that means our guidance around the majority being price is still holding in our go-forward look. Let me give you some perspective. I had some in my opening remarks over what's happening with CVS. So the first is that, as I mentioned, the step down in volume was really anticipated and based on our analysis of the data, which I'll highlight, it's really right in line with our expectations. Now one of the things in my remarks, I often talk about new to brand or our in-play share capture, and that's a really good way to look at performance, particularly early in launch cycles when you're looking at capture rate or competitive dynamics. I think it's important that investors and analysts need to be very mindful when you have a dislocation or disruption or switching, you can get very, very full at looking at NRx or NBRx because it sort of overinflates what you might be looking at. So I think that's important. The other fact base that we look at is in terms of the step down is we look at other analogs and we look at the Cosentyx Taltz analog or Taltz was advantage in ESI for Cosentyx back in 2019. And we see that typically in this category, almost 90% of the erosion tracks within the first two to three weeks. And that's actually what we're starting to see, we believe with the CVS template following that similar pattern. So if you can't really look at NRx or NBRx, you really have to look at TRx in this case, Chris. And this is very interesting. And we would make sure to guide folks to look at what's happening with the TRx data in the market. And what we see is that not all of the Humira prescriptions are moving to a biosimilar. And if you look at the first two weeks, it's pretty meaningful. Over 20% of the Humira prescriptions are moving to other mechanisms of actions, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And in fact, while we haven't studied this week as much, it actually seems to have accelerated a bit from there. And that actually makes some sense because if you think it from the physician's perspective, when patients are being switched, they often take a break in a pause to say, are these patients really under control, should I consider an alternative. And that's actually what we see playing out in the market. So the pure degradation or step-down from Humira is in line with what we see, but we are seeing a fairly significant move to other mechanisms, as I mentioned, including our own Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And that could be very, very good for patients who are probably getting better care for control of their disease. Now having said that as well, if we look through the rest of '24, we have very solid contracts with our payers through 2024. And remember that these payers can add biosimilars at parity whenever they choose. We saw that last year in the middle of the year, and that's really not different now. So when we look at the structure and controls of our existing agreements, we do not see widespread exclusions for the rest of the year, as we go forward. And so I think we've been pretty consistent with that that select clients will move towards biosimilars over the course of the year. Last year, we saw that with Kaiser and Medicaid plans. We talked about the CVS exclusion for the template business. And we do see that some select plans may take another approach, which we've contemplated as the year goes on, which is they may move new patients to the biosimilar, but maintain the large existing base. And that's quite manageable because really only about 14% or 15% of the patients are new patients that cycle into Humira. So overall, that's our perspective. We're confident things are tracking in line. We're quite interested in this shift to other mechanisms, which is frankly somewhat anticipated, but maybe operating a little higher than we thought, and we still believe that a significant majority of Humira will see it at parity lives in '24. Okay. So the tail we're going to be negotiating '25. And what we've highlighted is we are going to watch exactly how the interchangeables play out. We think we've got a good understanding of that. And so it will probably become more apparent as we move through '25 where that tail may sit. And we've highlighted that it may start to emerge in '25 and probably be much more visible by '26. And that's going to ultimately depend on how over the course of '25, the price volume fully plays out in the marketplace.\nRobert Michael : And Chris, this is Rob. On your question regarding the guidance for this year. I think it's important to note yes, we've said that the vast majority of the erosion is price. We've talked about that dynamic. If you think about first half, second half, we have the annualization impact given the mid-year step-up in rebates last year. So the annualization impact comes through in the first half, you'd expect price erosion to be greater in the first half or the second half. But at the same time, we did contemplate volume erosion because we were very well aware of the CVS contract. We gave you that guidance. And so we have contemplated that volume erosion, but that's more of a second half versus first half as well as the potential for we knew with an interchangeable coming in, there could be some marginal amount of volume pickup there. So we did put in volume erosion in our guidance, but the vast majority of it is price, but I don't want investors to think that we didn't put any volume into our guidance. We were very well aware of the CVS contract. And I think we made some prudent assumptions on potentially other impacts. But overall, we're still tracking in line with that guidance.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn : Congrats to Rick and best of luck to Rob in a new role. Just wondering if you could maybe frame a little bit for us the opportunity for Skyrizi in UC versus Crohn's disease. I think last time we heard from J&J, Crohn's represented about $7 billion of Stelara sales. Obviously, you guys have made decent inroads there based on your comments. But just wondering think about the dollar opportunity in ulcerative colitis. And then when you were talking through some of the latest Rinvoq data, I was just wondering if there's an opportunity down the road as you generate more clinical data, but also commercial data to potentially revisit the restrictions on line of therapy on the label at some point, or if we shouldn't think about that as a possibility.\nJeff Stewart : It's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So Crohn's is larger than you see. I mean, if you look at the overall market or revenue, I think it's 65%, 70%. So it's -- Crohn's is very, very significant. Having said that, ulcerative colitis is a multibillion-dollar opportunity for us. It's still a very, very underpenetrated and substantial indication. So it's weighted about 65 -- 35 --70-30, but still, I wouldn't underestimate what ulcerative colitis means. And I think I would add in concert with my prepared remarks, we've seen very, very significant acceleration into frontline Crohn's disease with Skyrizi. And what's remarkable, we studied a very, very difficult population in ulcerative colitis, but we still had substantial amount of naive patients. And the performance in that naive population is exceptional. I mean, it is at the very, very top of the league table terms of overall ability to get to endoscopic clearance and symptom control. And so we like that setup because, obviously, we have exactly the same representatives who are establishing the Crohn's indication in frontline, and we know that we can bring UC very fast afterwards when we get the approval this year. So it's a substantial global opportunity, not the size that we'll see over the LRP with Crohn's, but still one of our largest opportunities that we have in the category. And I'll ask Roopal based on the safety data he highlighted to comment on the second question.\nRoopal Thakkar : Yes, thank you. So the data we keep generating continues to at least drive confidence for sure that the original Phase III that came out with their safety profile, and what we continue to learn even with longer-term data, even in more high-risk patients confirms what we've always seen. And that will continue to drive confidence, I think with our clinicians. Now from a health authority standpoint, I think the position there is that you have this oral surveillance study with upadacitinib, and they're going to apply those findings to the other assets in a similar class probably until there's another outcome study to sort of argue against that -- that's kind of how we see it, now that's in the U.S. I would say globally, there's still an opportunity for many jurisdictions where JAK inhibitors can be at parity. So you might start seeing some more movement there in earlier lines. But as Jeff stated in his prepared remarks, the second line and even third line of many of these indications continues to grow as people now have options where in the past, if all you had was a TNF, maybe you were cycling. But now that you know that there's other therapies you're starting to see people break sooner. So I think that second and third line is still a huge opportunity, and we'll continue to grow with this emerging data.\nJeff Stewart : And Terence, it's Jeff again. One more comment. I mentioned how we're excited about the naive position for both Skyrizi, CD and UC coming. But what's also nice is those same representatives are in the office and are able to highlight basically a one-two punch, where you use Skyrizi first in earlier lines based on this exquisite data. And then obviously, for later lines, you can use Rinvoq. And so we actually see in the marketplace that, that combination and that positioning is allowing us right now in real time, capturing almost towards 40% of all in-play share with Skyrizi first and Rinvoq second. So it's an encouraging position as we fill out that portfolio.\nLiz Shea : Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould : I wanted to circle back on the prior commentary around some of the TRx data. And I guess the overarching question is that, I guess, appropriately kind of capturing all the volume you're really seeing? And there's clearly with your part of your agreement with CVS and the Cordavis there, there is the potential for some Humira volume to potentially be shifting there. Is that being captured by TRx. So I guess, any commentary there on sort of the accuracy of that data that we're all seeing. And then maybe if you just go back and I wanted to circle back on the EPS commentary on '25 sort of the way you framed that growth. Is that sort of x-IPR&D? Any color there would be appreciated.\nJeff Stewart : Yes, it's a great question. So it's early, but we believe the data is accurate. I mean, if you look at the first two weeks to give you some sense, and this is inclusive of the Cordavis Humira. There was a downdraft of about 13,000 prescriptions for Humira from baseline. And the biosimilars captured about -- which was primarily the Cordavis Humira, captured about 10. So there's 3,000 prescriptions or over 20% that we can see in our data moving to other mechanisms of action, including our Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And again, it's very logical because this is just not a one-to-one type of switch like these physicians are interviewing and discussing with patients, their care path forward. And so we think that clearly, some are moving to other mechanisms, and we've seen that in other analogs as well. So we believe the data is accurate. Again, it's early. We're going to continue to monitor it. Where that ultimately lands, we'll have to see. Again, I want to reiterate the pure Humira downdraft is within line with what we assumed and we are seeing this other market behavior that's taking place.\nRobert Michael : And Carter, this is Rob. Just to clarify my earlier comments. Yes, it is ex-IP R&D. We always guide to ex-IP R&D. What I was trying to highlight is you should expect robust revenue growth in '25 and that growth accelerating in 2016 and beyond given that Part D benefit redesign impact in '25. And given that operating margin will expand, you typically would expect our earnings to grow faster than our revenue. And that is generally true with 1 exception in '25 being that we will have an annualization impact from net interest expense. We'll still deliver a very solid earnings growth. But as you model it, just keep in mind that while you expect typically earnings to outpace revenue growth given expanding operating margin, you do have that dynamic in '25, that's important for your modeling.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Baker with Redburn Atlantic.\nSimon Baker : Two quick ones, if I may. Just going back to Humira, but in a slightly broader sense. There's been a degree of political noise around the role of PBMs in blocking or rather than assisting biosimilar uptake. I just wondered if you expect that to come to anything in terms of structural changes within the market? And then secondly, on Rinvoq and the Level Up deal -- Level Up data. I wonder how you see the competitive dynamics evolving in that space? Is this about switches? Or is this about market expectation expansion. I asked because this morning Sanofi said that they welcome competition as a way of expanding the number of people treated in an area that's still relatively unpenetrated. So I just wonder how you see the opportunity commercially?\nJeff Stewart : It's Jeff again. I would say that we're not anticipating like a wholesale restructure of the PBM industry, for example. I mean, we certainly think that there's very reasonable chance of sort of transparency reform, exactly how some of the economics are working, maybe transparencies to the government or downstream to the clients, that's very possible. But a major wholesale change, we don't see that happening in the near-term. Obviously, we are continuing to monitor that and would make adjustments as we might need to. Regarding your atopic dermatitis question, I think the answer is really a bit of both. I think as we've highlighted before, the market here is exceptional in terms of the low bio penetration or oral and bio penetration. It's really only about 4% or 5%. And so I think Sanofi's comments are very well timed. I mean this marketplace is going to grow significantly as this innovation is able to be delivered to the global population with this very serious disease. But we also think this Level Up study is good for our market share penetration, and I'll give you some perspective. Our U.S. market share is lower. It's around 9%. So typically, where our countries have been able to highlight more direct comparisons. We couldn't do that because of the starting dose, I highlighted. We see that most of our international affiliates have market shares in the mid-teens in some cases in the low 20s. And so the ability to bring a comparative study that's directly linked to the U.S. label and show the physicians how you can get to higher levels of control and really patients want -- they want no disease on their skin and they really don't want itch if they can get there. And that's what we studied in Level Up. So we think it's certainly going to help with both market expansion and in particular, around the world with our ability to capture some more share. So I hope that helps.\nLiz Shea : Thanks, Simon. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson : I have questions on contracting for Skyrizi in '25. How many lives do you already have locked up through your general multi-year contracting? And then do you continue to think that the availability of cheap versions of Humira, either brand or biosimilar won't lead to any increase in step edits on Skyrizi under the idea that while Skyrizi is better, something like Humira or biosimilar Stelara might be just fine. That same arrangement can be made in the statin category, for example, Crestor is the best Zocor might do just fine.\nJeff Stewart : Yes. I think we'll probably pass on the number of lives locked up. I mean we are confident, given the market position TAM of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I think, in particular around the momentum that we have across the Skyrizi indication that we're going to have very favorable access in 2025 and beyond. I think the other thing that we've highlighted is I'm very pleased with how the adoption of Skyrizi is going in IBD. I mean it's very, very clear that we're taking significant share from Stelara and the doctors are voting with their pen, or they're basically electronic prescribing because the ability to get these very sensitive patients under significant control, the world's really never seen anything like the sequence trial in terms of the ability to control the most difficult aspect of this challenging disease. So as time goes by, we think that differentiation is going to aid us significantly as we think about the formulary positions relative to not only Humira, but also to Stelara.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg.\nLuisa Hector : It's on Elahere. I wonder whether you might be able to tell us the full quarter of sales. And then any commentary around penetration rate of Elahere and how much off-label use you think may be happening with the guideline inclusion?\nScott Reents : Sure. It's Scott. With respect to the Elahere full quarter of sales, we closed mid-year in February. Prior to that there were -- according to what we've seen approximately, just let me just double check here, $70 million -- I'm sorry, $110 million in the full quarter, $113 million in the full quarter.\nJeff Stewart : And it's Jeff. What we also see in the marketplace, a big catalyst that we saw in the first quarter was the movement from the accelerated approval to the full approval that Roopal highlighted with the MIRASOL data. So we were rapidly able to basically integrate that into all the material of the medical liaisons and certainly account managers and sales folks. And having that definitive table in the label and the ability to go deeper into our call plan is going to be very positive to continue the growth rates through the rest of the year. In terms of off-label, that's difficult to say. We think that the majority of the sales thus far are in that platinum-resistant population. However, the guidelines do allow for reimbursement with different levels of FRA alpha some of the updates that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So we'll continue to monitor it, but there's certainly a significant headroom in terms of the populations that are coming in terms of the ovarian cancer marketplace.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Luisa. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James.\nGary Nachman : When looking at the strong performance of the neuro franchise of Vraylar and migraine in particular, talk about the competitive dynamics there in those markets. And how did the gross connects impact you in 1Q versus what you expected? And how should that trend for the rest of the year? And then with respect to Cerevel, just your confidence that it will still close by mid-year, and how FTC is viewing the schizophrenia market and how much overlap there might be between emraclidine and Vraylar? Just the latest thinking on that based on your conversations with FTC.\nJeff Stewart : It's Jeff. I'll take the competitiveness comment in terms of what we're looking at. We're very pleased with the competitive -- our ability to gain market share in these segments. I'll start off with migraine. We continue to be the new to brand share leader in Botox for chronic migraine, and we see that Qulipta is accelerating significantly. So Qulipta is now the leading preventative agent. And what's nice is there's very little interaction with Botox because if you're an injector, you use Botox, if you're not an injector, you have access to a fantastic drug with Qulipta. So Qulipta is really clearly taking over the market leadership position among the injectable and the oral CGRPs. Ubrelvy continues to have a very meaningful and substantial lead over the main competitor, Nurtec and we are seeing some increased penetration into the larger triptan segment, which is key to our long-term growth. Vraylar continues to perform very well, ongoing market growth. And it's really because we have -- if we look at our perceptions, Gary, of our key prescribers, you're at the very, very top of the table, the league table in terms of perceptions around the efficacy around adjunctive major depression, which is our most recent indication and we have probably the best scope of indications for bipolar 1. And so both of those are allowing us to continue to gain share. So we're in a pretty good position. We also feel that the gross to net our vouchers, our co-pay, which sometimes can get a little funky in the first quarter. We have strong controls there and we're seeing a lot of stability. So overall, those businesses are performing very well\nRobert Michael : Gary, I'll take your question. This is Rob. I'll take your question on the FTC. We are working closely with the agency on their additional requests I mean, keep in mind that we do not have any overlapping MOAs with Cereval and Vraylar share in schizophrenia is very low. The vast majority of Vraylar sales comes from the bipolar and AMBD indications. In the case of davapidon, it will serve the early Parkinson's segment, which Duodopa and Vyalev do not participate in. So we don't have any concerns with the merits of the transaction and continue to expect closing it in the middle of the year.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Garry. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\nSteve Scala : And I apologize in advance for asking you to clarify on Humira. But you mentioned several times that things are playing out as planned. But in the prepared remarks, you said U.S. erosion played out slightly better than you thought in Q1. So is the conclusion that whatever was better is temporary. You also mentioned volume pressure, but price -- offset by price benefit. Can you quantify that? But when you sum it all up, it sounds like you expect volumes to underperform the expectations you set three months ago? And is that in part maybe due to the Accredo news from yesterday. So that's a big -- that's a long question, but that's only one question. And the second question is curious if the FDA has contacted at the about the potential safety issues with Emlacridine post the competitor issue with convulsions in rabbits. And have you seen this with your agent?\nJeff Stewart: Yes. So it's Jeff. So I'll try to take that. So the first part was the first quarter. I mean, it was marginally better in terms of overall performance because we didn't see -- obviously, we didn't see any volume disruption until 401. Now when you look at 401 and we look after three weeks, we look at our model in terms of the expectation around retention of Humira with the CVS template, that's largely tracking in line with what our expectations were with a bit of the surprise that some of that Humira is not going to the biosimilar, as I mentioned, is going to other mechanisms including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So overall, as we look to the balance of the -- really the first quarter, what we're seeing play out in the second quarter and look to the full year, our commentary, and I'll ask Rob to highlight if he has anything to add is very much in line with what we've guided at the beginning of the year. So no material change in what we're seeing in the marketplace.\nRobert Michael: Yes, this is Rob. I'll confirm that, what Jeff is saying. I mean it's tracking in line with our expectations. We are not saying that volume is worse than we originally guided. We're saying this is tracking in line with our expectations. We try to characterize for you the price versus volume dynamics? Obviously, saying it's the price erosion is the vast majority of the decline, but there is volume, and it's tracking exactly as we anticipated. So there isn't an additional downside here. As Jeff mentioned, we did have slightly better performance in the first quarter. But again, it was -- I mean, I think, to the tune of $30 million to $40 million on this book of business, not overly material, but ahead of the initial expectation.\nRoopal Thakkar : Steve, it's Roopal. I can take the next question. We did a thorough diligence. And when we look at data sets that offer clinical data, obviously, we do a deep dive there, also look at blinded data, but we also do a deep dive looking at toxicology, animal tox in particular. And we didn't observe anything that was consistent with what has been described thus far. And as I mentioned, when we look at blinded safety data either from the 1B or the current pivotals that are running, we don't see an adverse event like this that would be related. And as far as we know, no health authority has reached out to ask any further questions about this.\nRobert Michael : Steve, this is Rob. I'm going to come back to your previous question and maybe I understand where the confusion could be. That one-time price benefit is a year-over-year dynamic. It was contemplated in our guidance. When you have a formulary change you essentially have those rebates go away and you recognize that. That was part of our guidance. That was not a benefit versus our guidance. That's a benefit in the year-over-year. So if you look at Scott guided to I think it was 32%.\nScott Reents : That's right.\nRobert Michael : Erosion in the second quarter, which is lower than -- it was around 40% in the first quarter. So naturally, you'd wonder why would you have less erosion. Well, there's that year-over-year dynamic but that was how we planned the year. We anticipated it because we knew about the change that was coming in April 1. So I don't want to interpret that as a benefit versus our guidance, that's a benefit in the year-over-year calculation.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS.\nTrung Huynh : Congratulations, Rick, on the next chapter of the life and Rob for moving AbbVie forward. Again, on biosimilar Humira. In your remarks, you mentioned post the expected CVS contract, there was a step-up in price for Humira. Is that simply because you're giving away more price to CVS at the contract at the time. And you mentioned additional contracts moving to biosimilar like CVS this year. Are there any meaningful contracts here that you can flag so we're not surprised? And is it possible we could see a actually a pricing increase by year-end because of this?\nScott Reents : Trung, this is Scott. I'll start with your question regarding the price benefit. So in my remarks, I indicated that with the formulary change in CVS and the volume step-down we saw there that there's a onetime price benefit associated with that. And you can think of this as we have the volume declines, that volume had been associated with price that we would have been paying in terms of rebate that those rebates will no longer be paid. Therefore, there's a one-time price benefit associated with that initial step down in the quarter. So that's what that relates to.\nJeff Stewart : Yes. And in terms of what we see going forward, as I highlighted, we don't see a significant exclusionary action where Humira would be removed from a formulary going forward. We did plan for, obviously, that smaller plans may make some adjustments to their formularies. That's all within the volume degradation and the pricing dynamics that we put into our guidance. And as I mentioned in one of the comments, some of the payers, not super large would maybe consider this idea of starting new patients on the biosimilars versus maintaining all the existing patients on Humira. So if you were to see that, you shouldn't be surprised about that and that would be within the contemplated approaches that we're taking as we look across '24 with our knowledge of what's happening in the marketplace.\nLiz Shea: Thanks, Trung. Operator, we have time for one final question.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman : On the aesthetics business, maybe talk to me about some of the dynamics you're seeing in China. I know that there's a lot of macro headwinds and this is a pretty big part of your business. And then a bit of housekeeping on Skyrizi, where the last quarter you disclosed the $1.9 billion cash payment for royalties. Can you provide us any color on what this quarter's royalty was? And I believe that was for the full year last year but maybe just for the quarter.\nCarrie Strom : This is Carrie. I'll address your question on aesthetics in China. And we do expect economic headwinds that we're seeing in China to persist over the near-term with the China aesthetics market flat overall for 2024. So the way to think about it is to expect negative market until the recovery starts to begin in the second half of 2024. China does remain a very important market for our aesthetics business. And as the market there starts to recover, we will continue to invest in consumer activation, injector training and continue to launch new products in the support market.\nScott Reents : It's Scott. So you're right. With respect to the schedule relative payments. So you have to remember that these are on a bit of a lag, so they don't track each quarter sales. But the $400 million was the amount in the first quarter that we paid in cash payment.\nLiz Shea: Well, thanks, Evan. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference.

            "content": "Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2024 with first quarter results exceeding our expectations. Before we discuss our performance in more detail, I'd like to share my perspective on the planned CEO transition that was announced earlier this year. After serving more than 11 years as AbbVie's first CEO, I have decided to retire from the role effective July 1, of this year and will continue to serve AbbVie as Executive Chairman of the Board. As you heard me say before, it is important that we choose the right time to make this critical leadership transition. The Board and I have been long planning for my eventual succession and now is the opportune time to move forward with the transition. As our business is performing very well and is in a strong position for the long-term. We are successfully navigating the Humira U.S. loss of exclusivity. We have built an outstanding company culture, an important priority and competitive advantage. And our productive R&D engine, which has yielded numerous innovative new medicines for patients will continue to fuel our robust pipeline for years to come. After a multi-year process, our board has unanimously selected Rob Michael, our current President and Chief Operating Officer as AbbVie's next CEO. I have known and worked with Rob for many, many years and he is an excellent choice as my successor. He brings the experience, the leadership and the strategic vision to build on AbbVie's past successes, advance our strategy and enhance shareholder value. Since our inception, Rob has held several important leadership positions that have collectively had a tremendous impact on AbbVie from establishing our financial planning organization to navigating the end of exclusivity for Humira in the U.S., to driving key business development opportunities that have been critical to diversify our business and support long-term growth, including the acquisitions of Allergan and ImmunoGen and the pending Cerevel transaction. Looking back, AbbVie has evolved tremendously as an independent company and our performance has truly been exceptional. Since our inception, we've grown our revenue from $18 billion to $55 billion. Our market capitalization has increased substantially from $54 billion to roughly $300 billion today. We have achieved a total shareholder return of more than 675%, which is top tier relative to our peers. And importantly, we\u2019ve substantially increased our investments in R&D to discover and develop new medicines that have the potential to improve the lives of patients. As I look ahead, our company has never been stronger and our future has never been brighter. We are executing well across all aspects of our business and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. In summary, it has been a privilege and immensely gratifying to serve with all of my AbbVie colleagues for the past 11 years, growing AbbVie into what it is today. And I look forward to continuing to work with Rob and the leadership team to create meaningful value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. And I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our shareholders for the trust and confidence you put in me as AbbVie's CEO. With that, I will turn the call over to Rob for comments on our recent business performance. Rob?"

            "content": "Thank you, Carrie. I'll start with immunology. We recently announced positive top-line results from 2 Phase III studies for Rinvoq in dermatology and rheumatology. In the LEVEL UP study, which evaluated Rinvoq against dupilumab in atopic dermatitis, Rinvoq demonstrated superiority on the primary endpoint at week 16, which was a composite endpoint measuring skin clearance and itch reduction. Twice as many Rinvoq patients achieved this very stringent endpoint compared to dupilumab. Rinvoq also demonstrated superiority on all rank secondary endpoints in this trial. LEVEL UP was a study in which patients started on Rinvoq 15 milligrams and could escalate to 30 milligrams if they did not achieve treatment goals, which is how Rinvoq is prescribed for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. We also saw very rapid responses with Rinvoq demonstrating superiority on itch as early as week two and on skin lesions as early as week four. Rinvoq's safety profile in the LEVEL UP trial was consistent with what has been observed in previous studies. There were no serious infections in patients treated with Rinvoq and one in the dupilumab group. The rate of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms. There were no malignancies, MACE events or VTEs reported in either treatment group. Based on these data as well as results from previous Phase III studies, we remain very confident in Rinvoq's profile in atopic dermatitis, and we believe it offers meaningful advantages over other products on the market today. We also announced positive top-line results from our Phase III select giant cell arthritis trial, which evaluated Rinvoq in combination with a 26-week steroid taper regimen compared to patients receiving placebo in combination with a 52-week steroid taper. In the study, Rinvoq 15 milligrams met the primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating superiority on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52, as well as on disease flare and reduction in cumulative steroid exposure at week 52. Importantly, Rinvoq's safety profile was consistent with what has been observed in more than 15,000 patients previously studied across controlled trials. The mean age in this population was 71, which is the oldest population studied to date with Rinvoq. And the average prednisone equivalent dose at baseline was almost 35 milligram. Rates of serious adverse events and VTEs were similar across treatment groups. There were no MACE events in the Rinvoq arm, while there were two in the placebo group. Based on the results from the select GCA trial, we believe Rinvoq has the potential to be a safe and tolerable oral treatment option. We plan to submit our regulatory applications for this indication later this year. We continue to make very good progress with our inflammatory bowel disease programs. We anticipate several advancements this year, including the initiation of a Phase II study for lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis. The start of our Phase II Crohn's disease platform study, which will evaluate combinations of Skyrizi with lutikizumab and other novel biologics. And we remain on track for approval decisions for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, with the U.S. expected in the second quarter and Europe in the second half of the year. We also continue to invest in external innovation to expand our immunology pipeline, as evidenced by four deals that we announced in the first quarter. These include the acquisition of Landos Biopharma, which brings an oral NLRX1 agonist currently in Phase II for ulcerative colitis, a partnership with OSE immunotherapeutics to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist antibody for inflammatory conditions, such as IBD and RA. A collaboration with Parvus Therapeutics to utilize their immune tolerization platform to develop novel therapies for IBD, and a collaboration with Tentarix Biotherapeutics to develop conditionally active, multi-specific biologics in immunology and oncology. We are excited to partner with these companies who are all pursuing very innovative approaches to developing transformative therapies. Moving to oncology, where in the quarter, we closed the ImmunoGen transaction, which brings exciting programs in both solid and blood cancers. Last month, Elahere received full approval from the FDA for FR alpha positive platinum resistant ovarian cancer in patients treated with up to three prior therapies. This conversion to full approval was based on data from the confirmatory Phase III MIRASOL trial, where Elahere demonstrated an overall survival benefit and significantly reduced the risk of cancer progression. We expect to see results from additional ImmunoGen programs this year, including data from the Phase II PICCOLO study evaluating Elahere as a monotherapy in FR alpha positive third line plus platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients who are not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. And we expect to see data in the second half of the year from a potentially registration-enabling Phase II trial for our CD123 targeting ADC, Pivek in a rare blood cancer called blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Now moving to program updates in hematologic oncology. Based on the totality of the data from our TRANSFORM-1 trial and following recent feedback from regulators, we will not be submitting navitoclax for approval in myelofibrosis, and we will wind down the TRANSFORM-2 study, in the relapsed refractory setting. In other areas of [EMAC], we remain on track for several regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for a Epinkly in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. The Phase III readout from the Venclexta VERONA trial, in treatment-naive, higher-risk MDS and initiation of a Phase III monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. We remain very excited about this asset's potential to become a best-in-class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS and with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. Moving to other areas of our pipeline. In aesthetics, we remain on track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E in the second half of the year. Our rapid onset short-acting toxin as a highly differentiated clinical profile compared to currently available neurotoxins. BoNT/E is designed for patients that are considering using facial toxins for the first time or for a special event and will allow them to experience results over a very short period of time. This novel toxin will complement our existing business as patients would naturally transition to BOTOX following experience with this trial toxin. And in neuroscience, we continue to make good progress with 951, where we have received regulatory approvals in 33 countries thus far and anticipate an approval decision in the U.S. in the second quarter. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction in the middle of this year. Cerevel recently announced positive top line results from their Phase III TEMPO-3 trial evaluating Tavapadon as adjunctive therapy to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. In study, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a 1.1 hour increase in total on time without troublesome dyskinesia compared to patients treated with levodopa and placebo. Tavapadon also met the key secondary endpoint in the trial, providing a significant reduction in off time compared to levodopa and placebo. Two additional Phase III studies for Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease are expected to read out later this year. The emracladine pivotal studies in schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out later this year as well. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Yes, thank you. So the data we keep generating continues to at least drive confidence for sure that the original Phase III that came out with their safety profile, and what we continue to learn even with longer-term data, even in more high-risk patients confirms what we've always seen. And that will continue to drive confidence, I think with our clinicians. Now from a health authority standpoint, I think the position there is that you have this oral surveillance study with upadacitinib, and they're going to apply those findings to the other assets in a similar class probably until there's another outcome study to sort of argue against that -- that's kind of how we see it, now that's in the U.S. I would say globally, there's still an opportunity for many jurisdictions where JAK inhibitors can be at parity. So you might start seeing some more movement there in earlier lines. But as Jeff stated in his prepared remarks, the second line and even third line of many of these indications continues to grow as people now have options where in the past, if all you had was a TNF, maybe you were cycling. But now that you know that there's other therapies you're starting to see people break sooner. So I think that second and third line is still a huge opportunity, and we'll continue to grow with this emerging data. Steve, it's Roopal. I can take the next question. We did a thorough diligence. And when we look at data sets that offer clinical data, obviously, we do a deep dive there, also look at blinded data, but we also do a deep dive looking at toxicology, animal tox in particular. And we didn't observe anything that was consistent with what has been described thus far. And as I mentioned, when we look at blinded safety data either from the 1B or the current pivotals that are running, we don't see an adverse event like this that would be related. And as far as we know, no health authority has reached out to ask any further questions about this."

            "content": "Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our first quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance and reflecting a return to growth of 1.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.9% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 15% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.2% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.9%, adjusted R&D expense of 14.7%, acquired IP R&D expense of 1.3% and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.6%. Adjusted net interest expense was $429 million. The adjusted tax rate was 14.8%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $11.13 and $11.33. This increase of $0.16 at the midpoint includes $0.26 of operating overperformance partially offset by $0.10 of higher dilution due to the earlier close of ImmunoGen. As previously communicated, this earnings per share guidance includes $0.42 of dilution related to the recently closed acquisition of ImmunoGen and the pending acquisition of Cerevel. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $55 billion, an increase of $800 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions with the entire sales increase driven by our ex-Humira growth platform. We now expect Skyrizi global revenue of $10.7 billion, an increase of $200 million due to strong momentum across all approved indications. Rinvoq total sales of $5.6 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting robust uptake in IBD. Imbruvica total revenue of $3.1 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting lower erosion and Elahere total sales to AbbVie of $450 million, an increase of roughly $200 million, reflecting a partial year of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. Moving to the P&L for 2024. We continue to forecast adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5%. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.2 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Caravel transactions. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 32%, reflecting a step-up in volume erosion and with the recent CVS formulary change, partially offset by a onetime price benefit also associated with that change. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 49.5% of sales, and we are also modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, I'm very pleased with the excellent start to the year. We are demonstrating strong momentum across the portfolio and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. Sure. Thanks, Carrie. So Vamil to quantify the inventory impact in the first quarter, it was a little bit more than $50 million between Juvederm and Botox and you can think of that as being split roughly 2/3 to about and 1/3 to Juvederm. And I think as Carrie mentioned in her remarks that impact of that inventory will -- we expect that to turn in the second quarter. Sure. It's Scott. With respect to the Elahere full quarter of sales, we closed mid-year in February. Prior to that there were -- according to what we've seen approximately, just let me just double check here, $70 million -- I'm sorry, $110 million in the full quarter, $113 million in the full quarter. That's right. Trung, this is Scott. I'll start with your question regarding the price benefit. So in my remarks, I indicated that with the formulary change in CVS and the volume step-down we saw there that there's a onetime price benefit associated with that. And you can think of this as we have the volume declines, that volume had been associated with price that we would have been paying in terms of rebate that those rebates will no longer be paid. Therefore, there's a one-time price benefit associated with that initial step down in the quarter. So that's what that relates to. It's Scott. So you're right. With respect to the schedule relative payments. So you have to remember that these are on a bit of a lag, so they don't track each quarter sales. But the $400 million was the amount in the first quarter that we paid in cash payment."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $5.4 billion exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi global sales were $2 billion reflecting operational growth of 48%. We continue to see exceptional momentum across all of the approved indications. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market with a total prescription share now above 35%. That's more than double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. Share is also ramping nicely in PsA, especially in the dermatology segment, where we are now capturing one out of every four new or switching in play biologic patients. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved psoriatic in play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries. In IBD, Skyrizi is on track to add more than $1 billion of incremental sales growth this year. We are seeing tremendous performance in Crohn's disease, where our compelling head-to-head data versus Stelara is driving a meaningful inflection of patient share. As a result, we have now achieved in play share leadership in Crohn's across all lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Japan as well as other key markets around the world. And finally, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which represents another substantial long-term growth driver. We expect approval decisions in the middle of this year and anticipate rapid access in the U.S. following our launch. Given the robust frontline capture for Skyrizi in Crohn's and the exceptional bio-naive data we have generated in UC, we anticipate a strong launch. Turning now to Rinvoq with global sales of approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of 61.9%. In rheum, we continue to see strong prescription growth across each of the four approved indications, and I'm especially pleased with our performance in rheumatoid arthritis, where Rinvoq has achieved in play share leadership in nearly 20 key international markets. Atopic dermatitis is tracking in line with our expectations with continued market share momentum globally. Importantly, we recently announced positive results from LEVEL UP, our second head-to-head study in AD. LEVEL UP demonstrated Rinvoq superiority for patients starting therapy on the 15 milligram dose versus Dupixent across key efficacy parameters, including the high levels of skin clearance and itch reduction. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will support additional share capture, especially given Rinvoq label use in the U.S., which requires that initiation with a 15 milligram dose. And in IBD, Rinvoq's uptake continues to be very strong. Rinvoq is capturing high teens in play patient share in ulcerative colitis as well as mid-teens in play patient share in Crohn's disease. This performance is especially encouraging recognizing that we're still relatively early in the launch phase for both the UC and CD indications, and the lines of therapy are also expanding, with second line plus growing even faster as patients cycle to newer, higher efficacy agents like Rinvoq and IBD. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of approximately $2.3 billion, down 35.2% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. played out slightly better than our expectations in the quarter with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price. As previously communicated, the recent changes to the CVS template formularies were anticipated in our full year outlook for U.S. Humira and the volume impact is tracking in line with our expectations. Our guidance has also contemplated the impact of additional formulary changes that are expected to go into effect over the course of the year. We continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.5 billion exceeding our expectations. Imbruvica global revenues were $838 million, down 4.5%, reflecting continued competitive pressure in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $614 million, up 16.3% on an operational basis and we are seeing robust momentum internationally with strong performance for both CLL and AML. Elahere generated $64 million of sales to AbbVie, reflecting a partial quarter of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. The Elahere sales and marketing team is executing very well and I'm pleased with the smooth integration into our commercial organization. We anticipate that the recent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines for both platinum sensitive and platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients as well as the full label approval, which of course, includes the compelling overall survival data that has never been achieved before in these platinum resistant patients will continue to drive strong Elahere uptake. Lastly, the global launch of Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL is also performing well and we remain on track for the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Neuroscience total revenues were nearly $2 billion, up 16% on an operational basis, again, ahead of our expectations. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar with global sales of $694 million, Ubrelvy with total revenue of $203 million and Qulipta with global sales of $131 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $748 million, up 4.5% on an operational basis. And finally, we are very excited about 951, which will be commercialized as Vyalev in the U.S. and represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. Feedback from the launches in Japan and Europe have been very encouraging and we remain on track for commercial approval in the U.S. later this year. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? Chris, it's Jeff. So the contracting season typically starts April or May. And frankly, as we've highlighted before can run in the immunology category really through the end of the year. So we have a few philosophies that we look towards, which are -- we want to continue to basically make sure that patients if possible, based on our pricing concessions aren't disrupted because when you start to disrupt patients, they do struggle with the change. It's a change in their treatment course. And so as we look to that, we've historically highlighted that we are negotiating for parity contracts with Humira. And we do put some controls in place in some cases, but not all, we seek multi-year contracts with our payers to try to establish the relationship, the pricing, et cetera and we will think of ways to make sure that those contracts can hold. So they have some teeth in them. They can't just be willy-nilly discarded. And so it is a long-term, in some cases, partnership over a couple of years with these payers. I can't go into the details over exactly how those controls work. But suffice it to say that there's terms and timing and limits in terms of when contracts can be changed even maybe some clawbacks in some cases. So because we want these more sustained relationships because of our position in the category with these great brands, we typically use those sort of techniques and that's how we go for it. So again, it's hard to look forward too much because it is dynamic as we look to '25. But we've been quite successful in maintaining good access for our brands and certainly, Humira is tracking in line with our expectations. It's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So Crohn's is larger than you see. I mean, if you look at the overall market or revenue, I think it's 65%, 70%. So it's -- Crohn's is very, very significant. Having said that, ulcerative colitis is a multibillion-dollar opportunity for us. It's still a very, very underpenetrated and substantial indication. So it's weighted about 65 -- 35 --70-30, but still, I wouldn't underestimate what ulcerative colitis means. And I think I would add in concert with my prepared remarks, we've seen very, very significant acceleration into frontline Crohn's disease with Skyrizi. And what's remarkable, we studied a very, very difficult population in ulcerative colitis, but we still had substantial amount of naive patients. And the performance in that naive population is exceptional. I mean, it is at the very, very top of the league table terms of overall ability to get to endoscopic clearance and symptom control. And so we like that setup because, obviously, we have exactly the same representatives who are establishing the Crohn's indication in frontline, and we know that we can bring UC very fast afterwards when we get the approval this year. So it's a substantial global opportunity, not the size that we'll see over the LRP with Crohn's, but still one of our largest opportunities that we have in the category. And I'll ask Roopal based on the safety data he highlighted to comment on the second question. And Terence, it's Jeff again. One more comment. I mentioned how we're excited about the naive position for both Skyrizi, CD and UC coming. But what's also nice is those same representatives are in the office and are able to highlight basically a one-two punch, where you use Skyrizi first in earlier lines based on this exquisite data. And then obviously, for later lines, you can use Rinvoq. And so we actually see in the marketplace that, that combination and that positioning is allowing us right now in real time, capturing almost towards 40% of all in-play share with Skyrizi first and Rinvoq second. So it's an encouraging position as we fill out that portfolio. Yes, it's a great question. So it's early, but we believe the data is accurate. I mean, if you look at the first two weeks to give you some sense, and this is inclusive of the Cordavis Humira. There was a downdraft of about 13,000 prescriptions for Humira from baseline. And the biosimilars captured about -- which was primarily the Cordavis Humira, captured about 10. So there's 3,000 prescriptions or over 20% that we can see in our data moving to other mechanisms of action, including our Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And again, it's very logical because this is just not a one-to-one type of switch like these physicians are interviewing and discussing with patients, their care path forward. And so we think that clearly, some are moving to other mechanisms, and we've seen that in other analogs as well. So we believe the data is accurate. Again, it's early. We're going to continue to monitor it. Where that ultimately lands, we'll have to see. Again, I want to reiterate the pure Humira downdraft is within line with what we assumed and we are seeing this other market behavior that's taking place. It's Jeff again. I would say that we're not anticipating like a wholesale restructure of the PBM industry, for example. I mean, we certainly think that there's very reasonable chance of sort of transparency reform, exactly how some of the economics are working, maybe transparencies to the government or downstream to the clients, that's very possible. But a major wholesale change, we don't see that happening in the near-term. Obviously, we are continuing to monitor that and would make adjustments as we might need to. Regarding your atopic dermatitis question, I think the answer is really a bit of both. I think as we've highlighted before, the market here is exceptional in terms of the low bio penetration or oral and bio penetration. It's really only about 4% or 5%. And so I think Sanofi's comments are very well timed. I mean this marketplace is going to grow significantly as this innovation is able to be delivered to the global population with this very serious disease. But we also think this Level Up study is good for our market share penetration, and I'll give you some perspective. Our U.S. market share is lower. It's around 9%. So typically, where our countries have been able to highlight more direct comparisons. We couldn't do that because of the starting dose, I highlighted. We see that most of our international affiliates have market shares in the mid-teens in some cases in the low 20s. And so the ability to bring a comparative study that's directly linked to the U.S. label and show the physicians how you can get to higher levels of control and really patients want -- they want no disease on their skin and they really don't want itch if they can get there. And that's what we studied in Level Up. So we think it's certainly going to help with both market expansion and in particular, around the world with our ability to capture some more share. So I hope that helps. Yes. I think we'll probably pass on the number of lives locked up. I mean we are confident, given the market position TAM of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I think, in particular around the momentum that we have across the Skyrizi indication that we're going to have very favorable access in 2025 and beyond. I think the other thing that we've highlighted is I'm very pleased with how the adoption of Skyrizi is going in IBD. I mean it's very, very clear that we're taking significant share from Stelara and the doctors are voting with their pen, or they're basically electronic prescribing because the ability to get these very sensitive patients under significant control, the world's really never seen anything like the sequence trial in terms of the ability to control the most difficult aspect of this challenging disease. So as time goes by, we think that differentiation is going to aid us significantly as we think about the formulary positions relative to not only Humira, but also to Stelara. And it's Jeff. What we also see in the marketplace, a big catalyst that we saw in the first quarter was the movement from the accelerated approval to the full approval that Roopal highlighted with the MIRASOL data. So we were rapidly able to basically integrate that into all the material of the medical liaisons and certainly account managers and sales folks. And having that definitive table in the label and the ability to go deeper into our call plan is going to be very positive to continue the growth rates through the rest of the year. In terms of off-label, that's difficult to say. We think that the majority of the sales thus far are in that platinum-resistant population. However, the guidelines do allow for reimbursement with different levels of FRA alpha some of the updates that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So we'll continue to monitor it, but there's certainly a significant headroom in terms of the populations that are coming in terms of the ovarian cancer marketplace. It's Jeff. I'll take the competitiveness comment in terms of what we're looking at. We're very pleased with the competitive -- our ability to gain market share in these segments. I'll start off with migraine. We continue to be the new to brand share leader in Botox for chronic migraine, and we see that Qulipta is accelerating significantly. So Qulipta is now the leading preventative agent. And what's nice is there's very little interaction with Botox because if you're an injector, you use Botox, if you're not an injector, you have access to a fantastic drug with Qulipta. So Qulipta is really clearly taking over the market leadership position among the injectable and the oral CGRPs. Ubrelvy continues to have a very meaningful and substantial lead over the main competitor, Nurtec and we are seeing some increased penetration into the larger triptan segment, which is key to our long-term growth. Vraylar continues to perform very well, ongoing market growth. And it's really because we have -- if we look at our perceptions, Gary, of our key prescribers, you're at the very, very top of the table, the league table in terms of perceptions around the efficacy around adjunctive major depression, which is our most recent indication and we have probably the best scope of indications for bipolar 1. And so both of those are allowing us to continue to gain share. So we're in a pretty good position. We also feel that the gross to net our vouchers, our co-pay, which sometimes can get a little funky in the first quarter. We have strong controls there and we're seeing a lot of stability. So overall, those businesses are performing very well Yes. So it's Jeff. So I'll try to take that. So the first part was the first quarter. I mean, it was marginally better in terms of overall performance because we didn't see -- obviously, we didn't see any volume disruption until 401. Now when you look at 401 and we look after three weeks, we look at our model in terms of the expectation around retention of Humira with the CVS template, that's largely tracking in line with what our expectations were with a bit of the surprise that some of that Humira is not going to the biosimilar, as I mentioned, is going to other mechanisms including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So overall, as we look to the balance of the -- really the first quarter, what we're seeing play out in the second quarter and look to the full year, our commentary, and I'll ask Rob to highlight if he has anything to add is very much in line with what we've guided at the beginning of the year. So no material change in what we're seeing in the marketplace. Yes. And in terms of what we see going forward, as I highlighted, we don't see a significant exclusionary action where Humira would be removed from a formulary going forward. We did plan for, obviously, that smaller plans may make some adjustments to their formularies. That's all within the volume degradation and the pricing dynamics that we put into our guidance. And as I mentioned in one of the comments, some of the payers, not super large would maybe consider this idea of starting new patients on the biosimilars versus maintaining all the existing patients on Humira. So if you were to see that, you shouldn't be surprised about that and that would be within the contemplated approaches that we're taking as we look across '24 with our knowledge of what's happening in the marketplace."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeff. First quarter global aesthetic sales were over $1.2 billion, reflecting a modest decline on an operational basis. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $776 million were roughly flat versus the prior year. We continue to see sustained momentum in the facial injectable market recovery that emerged in the back half of last year. Consistent with the past few quarters, the toxin market grew by a mid-single-digit percentage. We saw similar year-over-year increases in the number of facial filler procedures, representing a return to quarterly market growth for the first time since early 2022. From a competitive perspective, our U.S. aesthetics portfolio continues to perform well. Market share for both Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm was stable in the first quarter as these assets remain the clear market leaders. While we're pleased that the market and share trends across U.S. facial injectables are aligned with our previous expectations, our first quarter results were impacted by customers holding lower than normal inventory levels at quarter end. This dynamic relates to a decision made during the quarter to shift the timing of certain promotional activities into the second quarter. We therefore expect inventory levels to normalize in the second quarter and remain on track to deliver full year aesthetics sales growth in the U.S. Internationally, first quarter aesthetic sales were $473 million reflecting an operational decline of 5.5%. Consistent with our expectations, growth in China was impacted by persistent economic headwinds as well as a challenging comparison versus the first quarter of last year, which benefited from a robust recovery post-COVID. We are monitoring the economic developments across China and continue to anticipate a recovery in the second half of this year. Our pipeline continues to generate important new assets. Uptake of our recently launched Volux and SkinVive products remain strong, underscoring the importance of innovation within aesthetics. Given this context, we are excited for the upcoming launch of Juvederm Voluma XC for the treatment of temple hollows. As the only dermal filler approved for use in the upper face, we anticipate the Voluma XC introduction will activate more consumers and support the long-term growth of our filler portfolio. And within our toxin pipeline, we continue to expect FDA approval of the platysma prominence indication for Botox near the end of this year, enhancing Botox growth potential as a noninvasive treatment to reduce the appearance of vertical neck bands and improve jawline definition. We also remain on track to submit a new drug application for our short acting toxin, BoNT/E, before the end of this year. This novel toxin has demonstrated a rapid onset of action as well as a short duration of effect, meaningfully lowering the barrier for toxin adoption across consumers who have been considering but hesitant to try Botox. Given this profile, BoNT/E has significant market expansion potential as satisfied patients would naturally convert to Botox. Overall, the underlying trends across our aesthetics portfolio align well with our previous expectations and we remain on track to deliver high-single-digit global aesthetics growth this year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal. This is Carrie. So first, I'll give a little bit of context to the fundamentals in terms of market growth and market share, which were in line with our expectations. So our market share continues to be strong and stable. For Botox Cosmetic, despite a new competitor, strong stable share at high levels. And then for our Juvederm line continued share strength, even some share pickup in in the past few quarters, as we launch our new products. So like you said, those fundamentals are in line with our expectations. As we were going through the quarter, we really realized that the aesthetics market is quite sensitive to seasonality with Q2 and Q4 typically having the highest volume. And after a few years of COVID and economic disruption, we're now anticipating a return to that typical seasonality. So we shifted investment in some of our sales and marketing efforts into Q2, which impacted customer and sales promotional timing and activities, which then resulted in lower inventory held by our customers in Q1. And we do expect that to come back in Q2 and the rest year. And I'll let Scott address the rest of that question. This is Carrie. I'll address your question on aesthetics in China. And we do expect economic headwinds that we're seeing in China to persist over the near-term with the China aesthetics market flat overall for 2024. So the way to think about it is to expect negative market until the recovery starts to begin in the second half of 2024. China does remain a very important market for our aesthetics business. And as the market there starts to recover, we will continue to invest in consumer activation, injector training and continue to launch new products in the support market."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick. Before I comment on our first quarter performance, I want to congratulate Rick on his exceptional leadership of AbbVie over the past 11 years. During his tenure, Rick made several strategic moves that have positioned AbbVie to have a bright future beyond Humira, consistently drove the organization to deliver very strong performance and demonstrated the genuine care for our employees, patients, shareholders and communities that has defined who we are as a company today. It has been my privilege to work closely with Rick over many years, and I look forward to working with him in his role as Executive Chairman. AbbVie's outlook is very strong and I am excited about the remarkable impact that we the remarkable impact that we will continue to have on patients' lives. Turning to first quarter performance, we're off to an excellent start to the year with strong top and bottom-line results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations. This overachievement was driven by our ex-Humira growth platform, which delivered revenue growth of more than 15% this quarter and includes continued robust sales from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, with combined growth above 50% in their fifth full year on the market, as well as double-digit revenue growth from several other key products including Venclexta, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and Qulipta. This broad based sales momentum clearly demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio with multiple growth drivers to support our long-term outlook. We are also making excellent progress with several of our near-term priorities. We recently completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, which accelerates our entry into the solid tumor market and strengthens our oncology pipeline. The integration has been seamless and we are impressed by the caliber of talent we have welcomed into AbbVie. We also remain on track with the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which we anticipate will close in the middle of the year. Cerevel's pipeline of differentiated assets will further augment our neuroscience portfolio. In addition, we continue to advance our R&D pipeline and invest for long-term growth. This progress includes the FDA's full approval of Elahere for FR alpha positive platinum resistant ovarian cancer, a meaningful first in class treatment for patients and a significant long-term growth opportunity for AbbVie in solid tumors. We also gained U.S. approval of Juvederm Voluma XC for temple hollows, further strengthening our leadership in aesthetic fillers, and we executed several business development opportunities adding novel early stage programs and partnerships in oncology and immunology. Given the strong results this quarter, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.16 and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.13 and $11.33. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie and I am extremely pleased with the momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're off to an excellent start to the year and we are well positioned to deliver a high-single-digit revenue CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?"
