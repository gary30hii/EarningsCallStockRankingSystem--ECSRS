For our prepared remarks, I’m pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Good evening. As all of us know, 2020 was a difficult year for all of those affected by COVID-19, including our company. Even with the unprecedented operating environment, we accomplished a great deal. We earned $9.11 per diluted share and funds from operation for the full-year, which includes $0.06 per share dilution from our recent equity offering in November. We generated over $2.3 billion in operating cash flow. We acquired an 80% interest in The Taubman Realty Group, made strategic investments in several widely recognized retail brands at attractive valuations, and have already made significant progress in repositioning each brand and increasing their operating cash flow. We raised over $13 billion in debt and equity markets, opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others, completed three domestic redevelopments, abated rent for thousands of small and local businesses, regional entrepreneurs, and restaurateurs who frankly needed our help to survive, paid $700 million in real estate taxes, which unbelievably was an increase from 2019 despite losing approximately 13,500 shopping days in our domestic portfolio during the year due to the restrictive governmental orders placed upon us, and that's roughly 20% of the whole year, to put it in perspective, and we returned $2 billion in cash to our shareholders in dividends. These results and frankly, these accomplishments are a testament to the entire team, Simon team for the resilience, relentless focus on operations and cost structure, and the safety of the communities we serve, and obviously, focused on giving back to the communities in terms of what we did from abatement and real estate tax point of view. Now, let's go to the fourth quarter and then we're going to turn the page. Fourth quarter FFO was $787 million, that’s $2.17 per share, obviously, that was affected by the dilution of our equity offering that I mentioned. I'm pleased that to report that with the solid profitability and the $900 million in operating cash flow we generated in the fourth quarter, our domestic international operations in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately a net $0.95 per diluted share, primarily due to the reduced lease income, including sales base rents and other property revenues caused by COVID-19 disruption and $0.06 also from the international operations due to various restrictions placed upon those properties. Collection from our U.S. retail portfolio continue to improve. As of last week, we've collected 90% of our net build rents for the second, third, and fourth quarters combined. We made significant progress in the fourth quarter and addressing previously unresolved amounts with certain large tenants. We still, even to this day, have a handful of large tenants. Unfortunately, we've yet to resolve their receivables and we are hopeful that - and we anticipate resolving those certainly in the next few weeks. And you can review the collection details in our press release that we issued. Now, let me walk through as I have for Q2, Q3 and Q4, the year-over-year change for the fourth quarter in the context of our portfolio NOI presentation, which you can find on Page 17. Again, to remind you, these are on a gross basis and not a company share. Last year, our NOI was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. This year, it's $1.2 billion, that's a decrease of 23.9%, or approximately $380 million. And here are the components of the decline: $220 million in aggregate from domestic rent abatements and higher uncollectable rents, primarily associated with retail bankruptcies. And this is an important reminder, we do not amortize any of the abatements even though through FASB, you could, we chose to write those off in the period that they were granted. And hence, they affect our lease income in the period that we decided to go ahead and grant the abatement. Approximately, $205 million from lower minimum rents reimbursement short-term leasing, ancillary property revenues, and terminations associated with bankruptcy, tenants and lower sales volume due to COVID-19 disruption, obviously, lots of government restrictions on restaurants and amount of people we could have in the properties. And just as a reminder to you, we have a great deal of seasonality in the fourth quarter. So obviously, the card kiosk overage rent was impacted by, again, the immense restrictions that we had in terms of operating our portfolio by government mandates. And then we offset some of that decline by our diligent cost reduction initiatives. Operating metrics at the fourth quarter was basically flat compared to the third quarter 2020, and we were down year-over-year. Average base minimum rent was $55.80, up 2.2% for the year. Leasing spreads declined primarily as a function of mix. We had some boxes last year that rolled out and are no longer in the 12-month reporting period. Good news is leasing momentum is continuing. We signed over 1,400 leases representing 6 million square feet and have a number of significant - number of leases in our pipeline. And that's a testament to our quality of our real estate. And I do think we're starting to see our retailers get back to what they do best, and that is operate stores. We opened two new outlets, frankly, in Spain and Bangkok, which we're proud of. We have an outlet under construction in England, which will open this spring. Redevelopments, as I mentioned to you, we completed a number of properties. We also added, which is essentially the Woodbury of Asia, Gotemba Outlet expansion, another 178,000 square feet, and another property in Japan, adding another 110,000 square feet. So look for those to add to our cash flow in future years. We continue to densify our centers with the opening of a multi-family residential complex and hotel. We also have three hotels under construction. We completed the redevelopment and - of another Northshore mall and we started construction on expansion in Naples. So we're back to focused on continuing to add improvements across our portfolio worldwide. We also have a pipeline as you know, redevelopment, new development that is under consideration. Now, let me just turn to our retail investments. And I think and I hope this puts all of this in proper perspective. Obviously, we have an unbelievable track record in capital allocation, making significant returns on investment. During the year, we capitalized on buying four recognized retail brands in bankruptcy, so we bought them at attractive valuations. They include Forever 21, Lucky Brands, Brooks Brothers and Penney, each of these brands we believe presents a very interesting repositioning opportunity and each investment has completed at attractive valuations and we’ve made significant progress improving the positioning and operating results of the company. And let me just give Forever 21 as an example. And as you know, we bought it in February pre-COVID, well before we knew COVID would have the impact it did on 2020. And despite all of that, despite all of that, Forever 21, both in the company, generated a positive EBITDA, pre-royalties, of approximately $75 million in 2020, and we basically paid $67 million for that. So our share of that is $30 million, and you can divide it by $67 million to give you our return on investment in COVID 2020. Now, you could probably conclude that that's a pretty good return on investment. Now, if you put all of our retail brand investments in context, we have approximately $330 million remaining invested capital net of cash distributions and the value of appreciation of our ABG investment, which has just had a recent trade. And so, in marking that to market, our net investment in all of these activities is $330 million, and all of these brands will generate for us in 2021, our share, $260 million of EBITDA, so you can take $260 million divided by $330 million, will give you sets of our return on investment. Now, I want to remind everyone that we do not add back depreciation associated with these retailer investments to our FFO because it's not real property. So the contribution of that from an earnings point of view will obviously be much less with the EBITDA, is the EBITDA. So the other point to make in these retail investments is all of these brands generate $3.5 billion in digital sales, $3.5 billion in digital sales. And all we have to do is look at how e-commerce brands are being valued today and I think you could all conclude, we hope you do, that we've been making some wise investments here. Now, with respect to Taubman, I'm very pleased to have completed the transaction for 80% TRG and their premier retail portfolio, asset portfolio, our teams have worked - started working together. In fact, I'm up, I can't wait to go to Detroit tomorrow night in the cold and snow, it's slightly colder than Indianapolis but I'm sure I'll be welcome. And we're off to a very productive good spirited start. I really do look forward to the partnership and growth inherent in the portfolio and I think we'll all work very well together. As many of you know, we recently filed the Form S-1 with the SEC to raise $300 million and a Simon sponsored Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation i.e. SPAC. We are currently in a quiet period for the filing and are unable to speak to it about the proposed offering at this time. We've been very active in the debt and equity capital markets raising $13 billion in the last 12 or so months. And just some highlights, amended and extended our credit facility with a $6 billion facility that included a $2 billion term loan which was used to fund the Taubman transaction, issued $3.5 billion of senior notes including the recent $1.5 billion offer in January. Addressing all of our 21 unsecured maturities and obviously before the treasury really moved up. We completed seven 15 secured loan financings, refinancings for $2 billion. And again in November we completed the common stock issuance of 22 million shares for $1.56 billion. Debt to the term loan funded the Taubman deal. And our net debt was flat compared to last year exclusive of the properties that we added with the Taubman transaction and the term loan drawdown. Fourth quarter, we ended our liquidity with $8.2 billion consisting about a $1,005 billion of cash including our share of joint venture, and $6.7 billion available credit facility. This is net of $623 million of commercial paper outstanding quarter end. Dividend, we paid our fourth quarter dividend of $1.30 per share which is $6 in total for the year. We paid more than $2 billion in 2020, we're up to over $34 billion in dividends of our history as a public company and we're really proud that we paid the cash dividend when many of our other companies either suspended or completely eliminated or dramatically reduced their dividend. Now, finally, let's move on to 2021 because I do frankly want to turn the page on 2020 as I'm sure we all - as you all do, we feel confident we've turned the corner. We expect growth in cash flow and earnings in 2021. Our guidance is $9.50 to $9.75 per share. This range includes approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share from our retailer investments. Again, keep in mind that we can't add back or we don't add back depreciation for those investments. That's our growth range of 4.3% to 7% compared to our full year of 9.11% and just no more - our diluted share count will be 3.76%, no significant acquisition or disposition activity and no further government mandate shutdown of our domestic retail properties is in that guidance. As you know, we are dealing certain shutdowns in Europe as we speak. So, let me just conclude. One heck of a year, let's not repeat it in any stretch of our imagination. Let's turn the corner. And I want to thank my Simon colleagues for their continued resolve in running our business under these trying circumstances in a very tough environment. We dealt with just basically about everything. And I want to thank them. And again thank our shareholders for their support. And everyone out there be well. And we're ready for any and all questions though, I'm sure people want to go home and warm up because it's cold.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good afternoon, David, or good evening.\nDavid Simon: Good, good.\nSteve Sakwa: I guess, first, I just wanted to maybe talk a little bit about the leasing momentum and pipeline that you talked about. And just - given that things are moving forward, the economy seems to be getting better. Vaccines are getting rolled out. We're not completely out of the woods, but certainly, there's light at the end of the tunnel here. What sort of discussions are you and the retailers having about unresolved leases, and maybe more importantly, new leases to backfill the vacancy that got created over the last sort of 12 to 18 months?\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I think we’re - as I said to you, we’re expecting to grow our cash flow. Are we back to normal? Not yet, but we're working our way back. Generally, it's still a very serious, intense negotiation on renewals. Retailers are generally cautious. But the ones that want to grow their business are excited, and we hope to be able to certainly increase our occupancy for 2021. And it's going to take some time to obviously get back to where we were in 2019. But the healthy retailers that believe in their business and believe in their plan are making deals, and that we have such a high-quality portfolio between what we have and what we've acquired with respect to TRG that we're going to be - we're going to get our fair share of open-to-buys.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay, thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up, I appreciate some of the comments you made around the guidance which I was a little surprised at the tightness of the range just given the uncertainties out there. But is there anything else you can sort of provide? And I realize there is a lot of inputs that go into that number or in that range of numbers? But anything just on same-store growth or occupancy or lease spreads just to give us a little bit of a feel for how much of the deferrals that you provided or abatements kind of come back on line in 2021?\nDavid Simon: Well, certainly, the abatements better not repeat, okay? So that's step one. I would say to you generally, again, it's - our portfolio NOI growth will be 4% to 5%. We have taken a further reserve, but I'm not going to give you a number as to what we think should be a cushion to whether whatever it is further bankruptcies, additional abatements to the extent that we cut an appropriate deal, we still have some large retailers frustratingly we have not solved. Not because of us, we've tried, but we haven't gotten into the finish line. So I'd say generally around 5% in the comp NOI number. We have a reserve. Sales are really all over the place, so it's really hard to give you a good number there. And we would expect occupancy to edge up. And I gave you - people wanted to hear about how much was retail or I gave you that and we have TRG factored in there. Obviously, we made our financing assumptions. Those were pretty straightforward. We have our share count increased because of the offering. And then we roll it into the blender and that's kind of what's spit out. We have some variability. You're right, the range is tight, but we did - I mean, we did add a reserve to it based upon gut feel that we're, like you said, not - we're turning the corner, it's kind of my phrase, but are we completely out of the woods? Not yet, but well on our way.\nSteve Sakwa: That’s great. Thanks very much.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: Hey, good evening, David. Thanks for your time this evening. I want to maybe just spend a little bit more time walking through the line item where Taubman and some of your other investments are held, not because I'm questioning them. I actually think they're becoming increasingly important. So could you just maybe walk us through how we're supposed to think about that line item relative to the full FFO guide for 2021? And maybe how you think you can grow that line item even after 2021 and 2022 and 2023? Because I recognize there's just a lot in there and it seems increasingly important?\nDavid Simon: Well, look, it flows through - listen, I used to - I'm still pretty good at it, but it flows through our equity. They're all equity accounted, so now in - we show a couple of different things. So we do separate out our retail NOI in our supplemental, so we do, do that. TRG will be in our property NOI next year. We had - we took no financial implications for TRG in the fourth quarter, obviously, I think we owned it for like 12 minutes, right? When did it close?\nBrian McDade: 29th.\nAdam Reuille: 29th.\nDavid Simon: 29th all right, I see. I'm always faster than what it is. We took no other than, obviously, our debt increase at the year-end, because we drew down on the term loan to fund it. But from a GAAP point of view, it will be in the equity, all lumped together with our other equity investments. But in our supplemental, we’ll have TRG in our portfolio NOI, and the retailer will be in that separate line item. Guys, you want to add anything else?\nBrian McDade: No, that’s exactly right. You'll see the retailer results that David mentioned come through the NOI from retailers at this line item, Rick.\nRich Hill: Okay. I think I understand that.\nBrian McDade: Yes.\nRich Hill: And, David, obviously, as you said, 2020 has been a remarkably abnormal year. But you've been in a really interesting position whereby you've been able to buy some retailers and negotiate retailers - with retailers. Could you maybe just walk through some of the biggest lessons learned about who you want to be your tenants, how you negotiate with them, how they negotiate with you? I just think it's important as we think about how to model cash flows in the out years?\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, that's a tough one, Rich. I mean I could go in a lot of different directions. Listen, when you end up in bankruptcy or near bankruptcy, you've obviously made a lot of mistakes. It just doesn't happen overnight. And by and large, the ones that we bought, retailers that we have bought in bankruptcy. So then we go in there and just run it like we run Simon Property Group, obviously, with the help of our partners.  And we make fast, commonsensical cash flow-oriented decisions and return on investments, et cetera. And we have a sense of, just because of our experience in the retail real estate world, what makes it successful, what success real estate they should be in, what's the right rent to pay in spaces and we bring all those - all that to bear. And then obviously, when you're in bankruptcy, you have the chance to deal with leases or other contracts, other contracts that are wildly expensive that you might be able to change. I mean, the most amazing thing, I shouldn't really say this, but there - the most amazing thing is that every retailer that we purchased in bankruptcy, the one - all the tech companies get $0.100 on the $1, okay, that they pay for whether it's services, whether it's for the e-commerce business, whatever it is. And the landlords ended up us included end up getting it in the shorts that's an interesting thing. That would be great to like rethink that whole process. But there - those tech companies are so powerful that they can check you off if you don't play ball with them. So landlords, us included, don't have that kind of power. So I mean, I don't know if I've answered your question. It probably is. You probably have a lot of nuances to it but it's probably I could go on for hours. If you don't mind, let's go on to your next question or another question.\nRich Hill: Yes, no. That's it for me, David. We can discuss offline. Just seems like there's a lot of really interesting drivers of growth here and we're trying to get our arms around it. So thank you. I'll get back in the queue. I don’t have any questions. So, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Good evening David and hope you're enjoying the snow out there.\nDavid Simon: It's pretty. It gets less pretty when it gets closer to March let me assure. Yes.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes. The skiing gets better or so, that’s positive. And so two questions here. First, in the fourth quarter it looks like on your - on that rent collections you have a 90% table that you guys have. It looks like the bankruptcy is leveled off the deferrals, leveled off. And it looks like you guys took about $141 million of abatements in the quarter. Also I noticed that your - you had a big straight line right off and then you had a big lease term. So it seems like there was a lot of cleanup in the fourth quarter. Is that the way that we should interpret it, like basically you guys got to the end of the year, you shouted up and down the hall, say, what do we got here. Let's clean the books and start 2021 in a good way. Or is that not the right interpretation, because you didn't say what the actual operating guidance for this year, you just said you're lobbying for it. But it does seem like you guys cleaned up a lot at year end.\nDavid Simon: Well, the bottom line is, when it came to abatements we took it in the period that we actually made the deal. And if we had done everything in the second quarter, we would have done it then in the Q3 with. It just took an unbelievable amount of time to get - I mean there was a lot of horse trading, a lot of big accounts got settled as you know in Q4. And it really, I mean, we - it really was when the deal was done. So that's the - yes, we certainly want to go into 2021 and we did as much as we could to finish 2020, but those abatements were done in the period at which we cut the deal and signed up the retailer.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So we shouldn't interpret the acceleration in the fourth quarter as lingering into this year, it was just stuff done in the quarter?\nDavid Simon: As I think I said there is some negotiations that we still have left to do but I think we dealt with that in a sense in 2020 based on kind of where the deal was headed. So we did use some judgment at year-end in a couple of these cases. But it isn’t done until the cash comes into my bank account, not mine, that was terrible. My bank account at the Simon Property Group representative, okay, so make that perfectly clear, okay?\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes. It's just as clear. Second question is you always treasure your balance sheet and Moody's already downgraded you back ahead of the third quarter earnings. S&P still has you on negative watch. So just the question here as you guys think about your balance sheet. I mean, on one hand, your debt trades wider than what the ratings would indicate. Obviously, the bond guys want to get the best deal that they can. At the other hand, you guys can access the market. But still how - I mean, if something were to happen, you've got like a two-notch downgrade. Is that - I mean, it almost seems like the market is pricing that in. But on the other hand, you guys got a ton of debt that you were able to issue. So can you just give us some color on, like, the buyers of the debt and how the debt people are looking at it? Are they just trying to get their ounce of flesh while they can? And the way that you've outlined your plan to the rating agencies you'll be able to maintain something that starts with an A, or are there other concerns out there that people are or that the rating agencies are talking to you about that you need to address?\nBrian McDade: Alex, this is Brian. Look, I think the last debt deal we just did in here at the beginning of January is representative of where we've seen our spreads go. I mean, spreads were in 100 basis points since the summertime. And so I think that the market is representing and supporting time and kind of going forward. With respect to the agencies, we are certainly in deep dialogue with them on regular basis and are comfortable with what they've done thus far, and I think they're looking at our deals and our ability to raise capital, to David's point, in excess of $13 billion last year, as a testament to the company's balance sheet. So I think they're comfortable. Won’t speak for them, but I believe they're comfortable where they're at right now.\nDavid Simon: Yes.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay.\nBrian McDade: There's just no way we're going to get downgraded, not a chance. So next question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: So what have you learned about traffic, your tenants, and demand and most specifically in the centers within space that have less mandate restrictions? Are there any inspiring read-throughs or green shoots for those centers with tighter restrictions, let’s say California or North East that you can pinpoint or share?\nDavid Simon: Well, I would say, you take a state like Florida as a pretty good example. And I mean, you are getting - the one element that's missing is international tourism. But if you put that aside, you're getting some real domestic traffic increases and you're getting - and sales aren't quite what they were last year. But at this time, what you're seeing - I would say to you that like a state like Florida is really showing green shoots, vibrant economy. The only element that's missing to make that really hot would be international tourism. But everything else is kind of clicking along and it’s pretty good. Texas is probably the next closest, but again, it depends. I mean, they're - that also somewhat dependent upon whether it's near the border or not. And what is such a big state that do you have COVID in this one area versus that area. But I'd say Texas is showing green shoots as well. But Florida is a great example of I would say to you that you can - you can’t get on with goodness and you start to see green shoots and the - there's a lot of energy there. And no, I did not get on Super Bowl, okay.\nDerek Johnston: So we did go back, David, to 3Q 2019 and this was the last quarter before the pandemic was known. At that time, the redevelopment buzz and pivot to experiential and mixed use concepts. It was really high and that's the redevelopment pipeline stood at the record $1.8 billion. So how is this pipeline and redevelopment priorities changed besides being much lower? And how do you stack or prioritize redevelopment spend, especially as we see the pandemic escape velocity in front of us later this year? Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Yes, sure. I'd say simplistically, as we look at restarting the pipe, the pipe didn't go away. We just put it in the freezer. Now we're thawing it out. And I would say to you the biggest change Derek is that we believe in the mixed use component pretty, pretty significantly to the extent that we were adding what I'd call retail. We're probably looking at those plans again to make sure that we're adding the appropriate amount, that's kind of the biggest change. But I would tell you this, I do feel very strongly about this that the high quality suburbs are going to be where the action is in the future. And all of the urbanization two, three, four years ago, the question was why are the suburbs going to exist. Everybody is going to live in urban environment, yadda yadda, yadda, yadda. I'm telling you the suburbs are going to be hot, and our quality real estate is going to be where the action is for those well located suburban centers of commerce. And that's going to be the big change coming out of the pandemic. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: David, my first question is just sort of just talking more broadly about vertical integration. And I know you can't talk about the fact that's been under review right now. But can you talk just a little bit broadly about doing things on balance sheet versus in joint ventures or other structures. And maybe just provide, give an update on some of the retail investments, and maybe give an update too on shopping outlets and how that was set up conveniently before the pandemic and how that has happened. And maybe just tie everything together to the vertical integration and being able to control a little bit more of your own destiny.\nDavid Simon: Well, listen, I would say that we - whatever we do we look at return on investment and cash flow potential - shareholder value potential and cash flow growth, and obviously top line growth. And each business is evaluated based upon what those particular characteristics are important to that investment. But there’s no reason. You know we’re in a REIT format. There's no reason why we can't make money in other areas that are consistent with what we've been doing. I think we've proven that time and again. Have we made mistakes? Yes, we have. But we've been pretty good investors, and we hope to do that in the future. We're pretty good sponsors, and we have - our relationships between the brands and our partners and - spans the globe, essentially. From a real estate footprint, we're in Europe and Asia, and obviously domestic. The only place I'd say we're really not in is South America. But our retail brands span a lot of places, and we're focused on value. And at the end of the day, Michael, I look at our retail footprint. It does $3.5 billion of commerce, and I look at the value we get for it, and it's probably nothing, and in some cases people view it as a negative, which I can't understand, but they do. That's their prerogative. Maybe there's something maybe we should unlock that value, we’re absolutely going to look at every opportunity to unlock value to the extent we can but we - and figure out the right structure. But the most important thing is to make a good investment. The second thing that is where it should reside, how do you get the value, how do you grow it? And all of those are in the works. Spark is a great example. We believe in the model. We can - we believe that we can run brands across it common infrastructure. We know that e-commerce brands, they spend a lot of money on infrastructure. We know that if you combine those into one entity, you're bound to save a ton of money. We've seen it in the overhead in retail companies, so you know we're at the early days of figuring out what the right structure is. But in the meantime, we're going to make investments that make us money. And believe me, there is value there that will unlock or we'll get the credit for.\nMichael Bilerman: And then just the same question just in terms of guidance and I greatly appreciate the transparency of actually putting out a number of guidance which didn't have an answer going on, it's great. If you think about just sort of the building blocks to that guidance, if you look at 2019 relative to 2020, right, you had that $2.50 per share or almost $3 a share, well over a $1 billion decline. You’re picking up at least $200 million going from 2021. But I almost want to think a couple of years of getting back to NOI and FFO and bridging that gap. You threw out $0.15 to $0.20 of retailer investments per page 17. It looks like that was pre-DNA about $0.06. So call it 10 of the 50 increase is coming at least from the retailer side and the positive investments you've made. But maybe you can just sort of break down some of the other bigger components of what's coming back. I'm not - I don't need specific G&A guidance or NOI but there's obviously a pretty big moat of earnings to get back. And maybe you can just share some of the bigger piece of those.\nBrian McDade: I mean, look, I think the biggest thing is not to replicate the abatements and the bankruptcies. I mean that's the biggest component. But look, our portfolio, again at gross not at share, did over $6 billion in 2019. Right? We lost a $1 billion. And all of the stuff that we did net. And again we’ve worked our unit to what off to mitigate that through cost savings. What's not going to replicate or the cost savings in a sense and the abatements. And we were pretty aggressive in running the ship as lean and as high as we could. And we had no choice even though people across the street were open, we weren't allowed. So we have a $1 billion to make up. Again, this is pre-TRG and I think the biggest thing is going to be the campaigns of the big unknown is how long is it going to take to get lease up, we lost 3 - 350 basis points, 3, what, 380 basis points?\nDavid Simon: 380 basis points.\nBrian McDade: 380 basis points, so we loss 380 basis points on occupancy sales in our vaccine rollout and everything else. I mean, we did our roll up our best guess, our comp NOI is going to be positive. And we've got a reserve but at the end of the day, we're going to make the $1 billion up over time. We're also going to - some of the properties we're going to sell, go away, so that's in there, too. I can't give you - Steve Sakwa kind of poured out and we already gave you - he gave me more - he's got a nicer voice than you do. So I gave him more information than I probably normally would. I'm not kidding. But I mean, that's kind of where we are. We also - we're also dealing with the international shutdown. I mean, they're picking on malls like what happened in the U.S., again without science. But they're also shutting down outlets. But yet they high street open, so go figure it out.\nMichael Bilerman: Yes.\nBrian McDade: So we're still dealing with some crap everywhere. But I mean, I'd say the big thing that won't replicate. We hope is in the abatements, but it's taking on the cost savings and sales and then build up the lease income and bad debt, we put all these numbers in. We also put a reserve just because we have a lot of uncertainty, and we put it in the blender, and that spits out. Can’t add much more than that?\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.\nCraig Schmidt: I had a question about the redevelopments in the U.S. Should you put your [Rick Sokolov] and kind of run through who you're thinking is possible anchor replacements I realized they may not be retail. They could be wellness, healthcare or e-sports, or whoever. But who are some of the replacement anchors you're thinking in terms of your U.S. redevelopments?\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, Craig, that’s a retail - yes I mean, I'm sorry, real estate-specific. But I think what I said earlier is the most important thing. I think some of these we’re re-looking at, with the idea toward reducing the amount of new retail that we might put on board. But also the restaurants and we're making up for that with what I'd call the opportunity for suburbs to get exciting again, and I think that's going to be through a lot of the mixed-use efforts that were already under way. But I think will be accelerated. So, some of the anchors are doing - new deals. I mean, we're talking to Kohl’s. We're talking to [Buy More]. We’re talking to all sorts of those kind of guys, to Dick’s. We still are making new - we've got a couple of Dick’s under way. So and I would hope that some of the more thoughtful entertainment-oriented retailers once the COVID restrictions get back, would also continue to be in our property. So it’s still at work, but I'm hopeful we'll have a lot more of the mixed SKU stuff that we're doing and we're in some hot what I'll call very strong markets for that. Like with TRG in Nashville, we're in Austin. We're very strong in South Florida, obviously Texas. So we're in some of these markets that rent growth and are looking to facilitate growth and we're going to go and make the next evolution of our real estate that's much more interesting with time.\nCraig Schmidt: And then I'm just curious how are you interacting with the Taubman management given their properties? And how are they interfacing with the Simon people?\nDavid Simon: I’d say fantastic. We are on the leasing side talking significantly, both on COVID-related issues, renewal-related issues, new business, as you know, Craig we’ve got new business group dedicated kind of up and coming retailers which by the way, it’s exciting. All of those retailers and this is where I do miss Rick. He could start and your kind to mention him. But I will never do his list. I could never do adjust this. But most of those retailers are looking to grow. And they include from the Warby Parker to Shake Shack on and on. So that's very encouraging. We're talking to the TRG, about that relationship between Bobby and myself is great. In fact well Bobby, he figures out how to get to me very easily. He makes me look a lot with - which is fantastic. I look forward to having some tomorrow night. And I think it's going to be a great partnership. I mean they're dealing with what we've dealt with. In terms of COVID it’s been a tough year for them, but I think we're all looking forward to the future. And we'll go from there. And as you know, they've got - the families got a lot of capital tied up from the TRG and believe me they want to grow that. And to me that's a win-win.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Maybe just on the balance sheet side, could you clarify whether the Taubman debt is included in the debt metrics on Page 29 of the supplement? And if it's not, is it just because it happened so close to the quarter end or something else?\nBrian McDade: Hi Caitlin, this is Brian. It is not included. The only debt that will be included relative to Taubman will be $2 billion term loan that we drew down ahead of the closure.\nCaitlin Burrows: And then going forward will it be reflected more similar to other joint ventures that we have or not?\nBrian McDade: Yes, it absolutely will.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. And then this quarter the metric you guys had shown in the past on debt NOI looks like that's not there anymore. But I think it's about seven times using the net debt from Page 28 and the NOI from Page 17. So I'm wondering, A) would it be higher when including the Taubman portion of those metrics and also what’s your near and medium term targets for leverage?\nDavid Simon: Yes, that well, the fact of the matter is, I think that statistic you have to be very careful with. And I personally chose that I think we need to look at it again because as you know many of those properties are non-recourse and it overstates leverage. And I think part of our job is to educate the investment community how we look at the business. And Brian and myself, we'll begin that effort this year. But you know look EBITDA - debt to EBITDA, if you look at our - it's not in our financial covenants anywhere. So it's a gratuitous metric that is not as thoughtful as refined as it should be. And we're in the process of refining it to clearly articulate what it is. But you've got to separate what's recourse, non-recourse. What’s in JV, what’s not in JV in a more thoughtful manner, which we’ll embark upon in 2021 so you’ll have a better understanding of it.\nCaitlin Burrows: And then I guess just considering where that leverage is and you'll educate us on how we should think about it. What's your current interest in making property-level acquisitions in 2021 or under what conditions would you consider raising additional equity?\nDavid Simon: We have no need for raising additional equity. The balance sheet is in very good shape. Rating agencies are very comfortable with the transaction that we did both to finance, Taubman and the equity deal. Obviously, they put us on watch just because of COVID. It had nothing to do with Taubman or the financial metrics. And I think as we get - as we go beyond the shutdown - remember, we lost 20%. We lost 20% of our ability to operate in the year which is material. And then obviously a lot - not counting the, restrictions that we had to endure coming out of it. I think once we show that we're - we've turned the corner in terms of that, you'll see that negative watch go away. No issue not worried about it one [iota]. And on the property acquisition side, A) if I can buy it at a good value and it's a great asset and a guy wants to sell and if that’s meaningful to our portfolio, we'll take a serious look. But we’re in no - there's no need to do one thing or another, if it's accretive to our portfolio and our financial wherewithal, we’re happy to look at it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just a question on sources and used cases, you continue to pay the dividend but at a lower rate than previously, you expect cash flows to go up. So any color or thoughts you can give us around the dividend going forward and other maybe use of the capital? I'm not sure if you have a sense of what could be contributed or used to further invest in retailers at this point, so maybe just a general conversation in sources and uses and then touching on the dividend.\nBrian McDade: Well, again, our net investment in retail is $330 million. So I think when we have properties that were worth a $1 billion plus, it is what it is. I think it's important to note that we are 400 basis points below our mean FFO multiple as a history of being a public company. And if you look at our retail or what we've seen from retailers and the correlation, they've all had a much greater bounce back in terms of performance on the in terms of performance on the - on their stock year-to-date for the last few quarters than we have. So, we're optimistic that the future will begin to - that are our value will begin to be appreciated again which has been in the past. And frankly, there's no reason why it won't in the future. With respect to this - and the reason I bring up the past is as follows. If you'll look, we work the best case analogy that we're looking at. Again, no one has really dealt with COVID before. And as you know what happened in 2008, 2009 where we had - don't hold exactly to those - these numbers. But in 2008 we were earning around $6 a share. Our 2008, 2009 bankruptcies delusion that we had on issuing stock, high interest rates, I think we earned in the $3.50, $4 range. And then we ended up rolling out of that earning $12 dollars. Okay. Now we're at $9 - we are $9.11. We're saying we're going to earn $9.50 to $9.75. And I'm hopeful that will replicate what we did in 2008, 2009. And not only that we do in 2008 and 2009, but we added immensely to the quality of the real estate. We separated ourselves from our peer group dramatically. The balance sheet got better. All of these same - we diversified, we did this, that, and the other, we grew international - I truly believe all of these things will happen again. That’s what we’re made for, and this is a long way of saying that the dividend tracked basically what we did in earnings. We actually paid scrip dividend in 2009, if you believe it or not. We cut it and scripted it and did all this crazy stuff. And that was - all of that in 2008-2009. I feel like if history repeats itself, given the quality of the real estate, the team, the balance sheet, the diversity, we are going to replicate the same good work we did coming out of that, and we'll do it coming out of COVID. We're already beginning to do it, and that's the important thing. So I think that's a long way of saying, assuming we can completely get out of COVID, you're going to see increases in earnings which beget increases in dividends. And we have the history that ultimately should repeat itself.\nJuan Sanabria: Thanks for that. And then just my follow-up on the lease term, can you give us any sense on how lease terms have changed, if at all, during the last few months in your discussions with retailers either for new or renewals, and how maybe that trended over periods of past dislocation, whether it be the financial crisis or the tech wrecking? Just the perspective historically would be helpful.\nDavid Simon: Yes, sure. I would say, simplistically, certainly prior to COVID, there were more or less the same. There is certainly more of an interest to go a little bit shorter term. So three years and by the way, we're okay with that because I'd rather negotiate two or three years from now than right now. So the lease in 2020, the new stuff that we did in 2020 and some of those renewals, some of the renewals we're doing 20 21 are shorter two, three years. But I think actually that could be in our best interest too because obviously, we've had being shut down and restricted and all this other stuff. We don't have quite the ability to point to sales as a way to increase rent. So I think we’re - and I think it's actually a two-way street. It's working out fine with the vast majority of our retailers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point.\nFloris van Dijkum: Thanks for taking my question. David and Brian, maybe, if you could talk a little bit about your debt philosophy, in particular, your mortgage profile - your mortgage maturity profile significantly shorter than your unsecured debt maturity profile. And presumably some of that is due to the fact that mortgage debt these days is less readily available. Maybe if you can talk about some of your upcoming mortgage debt that's coming - as in the fashion center, Pentagon, the Fashion Valley in San Diego, Florida Mall, some of these big JVs, how are your partners talking about the funding of those mortgages and/or the re-upping of the mortgages there? How are the banks doing that? And also I think you've qualified that or you've indicated you've got about $714 million of mortgage debt that's probably in fact we know some of this is already in the news is being handed back. Those are not obviously those premium centers. But talk about - if you can walk us through some of the - your thinking regarding your mortgage debt and do you think you'll have less or more mortgage debt after this year?\nDavid Simon: I'd say pretty similar are the couple like the Florida Mall Fashion Valley, pretty straightforward doing it. In some cases, it's got 10-year deals and maybe a little shorter. We did what 15 secure refinancing even in this period of time. So I don't find it overly complicated or overly concerning or any risk that there's not the ability, any risk that there's not the ability to refinance stuff. On nonrecourse, there's certain debt that's nonrecourse that may be in professional servicing. That's kind of a contractual right for the borrower which is a standalone entity that’s nonrecourse to SPG. It’s also the right from the special servicer right. So we’ve done - we’ve dealt with those for a number of years. In some cases, they’ll be restructured, mutually agreed to; and if not, and the special servicer would like to own the real estate, we're more than happy to cooperate and do it in a professional manner. We did one just recently, and it's absolutely in the best interest of Simon Property Group shareholders those decisions that we're making on that front. So very straightforward, very professional, honoring the contracts, rights on both sides. Make - hope to make deals in some; if not, then they'll no longer be part of our portfolio, and we wish that new owner the best of luck.\nFloris van Dijkum: Great.\nBrian McDade: Maybe a quick one from me, on the duration here. Obviously, our unsecured portfolio benefits from the ability to issue 30-year debt. So that's going to naturally drive the duration higher on a weighted basis.\nFloris van Dijkum: The other question I guess I have, one of the unknowns from the market is what are the right cap rates for malls in particular? What are the right cap rates for A malls? I mean, I think the market sort of has gone down on the fact that C malls are worth very little and the size is very high cap rates in low values. But the question is more regarding your portfolio. And you've mentioned your low FFO multiple. We've seen you know the Brookfield transaction at a much, much lower cap rate than where you're trading at. As you look at and we also know that there’s a large portfolio owned by West or the Westfield portfolio owned by unified potentially that that could be in play as well. How should the market think about cap rates for malls and maybe give your view on that?\nDavid Simon: This is a known unknown, right, as opposed to an unknown, unknown, right.\nFloris van Dijkum: Yes, of course.\nDavid Simon: I would simply say there's - the cap rate is what we want it to be because I think we're the only buyer out there. So, and I'll look in the mirror and I'll decide what the right cap rates are. I think Brookfield is busy buying out, [indiscernible] busy buying up EPY. And I think we're the only buyer as far as I know. Everybody as herd mentality one way or another, we are buyers of high quality real estate. And the funny thing is, when we decide to buy something that doesn't count as to what cap rate it should be, now we're the only buyer. So, go figure that out. I don't know if that's a known unknown or a, you know, whatever. But the fact of the matter is we're really the only - I mean we're really the only buyer. And yet, everybody wants to point to a cap rate that we're not the buyer. But I don't - I never understood why we're not good enough to be the arbiter of what cap rates should be. But I'll let you figure that out for us. I can't figure that out.\nFloris van Dijkum: But also presumably, as we've seen a lot in the tech businesses, when you buy something, obviously then that reinforces what the right, so you actually can determine what the right cap rate for your own value can be based on the value you're willing to pay for somebody else?\nDavid Simon: Well, listen, we did close just a recent transaction and in that - that's a pretty good indication.\nFloris van Dijkum: Of the transaction?\nDavid Simon: That's correct. That's correct. So…\nFloris van Dijkum: Right.\nDavid Simon: …and any of that. But I want you, Floris, I want you to get back to me and explain why we can't be the arbiter of cap rates. Why it has to be a state pension fund, why it can't be Simon Property Group? I don't get it, okay. Anyway, I'm kidding, but not really. But I'm kidding, mostly.\nFloris van Dijkum: So you think if I were - sorry, I guess I'm slightly going over.\nDavid Simon: Yes. You’re over your allotted time. Call anytime.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Just a quick one. You mentioned boxes were skewing the 2020 releasing spreads. Could you tell us if they would have been positive if you strip those out and just give us any color on 2021 activity as well?\nDavid Simon: Tom Ward is shaking his head. Yes, and for those of you who know Tom Ward, you can count on it. They would have been positive, yes.\nMike Mueller: Got it. And any color on 2021 expirations?\nDavid Simon: In terms of renewals or appraisal or…\nMike Mueller: Yes, exactly. Yes, all of the above, yes.\nDavid Simon: In terms of what percent were done yet or not?\nMike Mueller: Percentage done, if the trends are consistent. Is there still renewing at positive rates as well?\nDavid Simon: Well, I don't - I mean, that's factored in. I don't know what - I don't know - I can't really answer off the top of my head on spreads. But what - we have a percent done. Does anybody know off the top of their head?\nBrian McDade: Like I say, we’re 50% done.\nDavid Simon: Yes, over 50%, but we can get you more. I've seen it, but I'm sorry to tell you I just don't remember.\nMike Mueller: No, that’s fine.\nDavid Simon: Tom could give that to you, the percent done.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: I just want to clarify, in terms of the 4% to 5% portfolio growth, this is overall NOI, right, not same-store?\nBrian McDade: Correct. We are - given the - I don't know how they show comp anymore given that we were shut down with restrictions. So I made the decision that we're just going to show you portfolio NOI, all-in, because you could argue that none of it is comp because, I mean, how do you - or all of it is comp. I don't really know what to do. So the simple thing is we're just going to show you our portfolio NOI without the comp distinction. So it’s all the real estate, all of the NOI, and hopefully that'll be helpful to you.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks. It looks like U.S. gross contractual rents went down 2% to 3% each quarter from 2Q to 4Q. What accounted for this fluctuation?\nBrian McDade: Which, Linda?\nLinda Tsai: I'm just looking at like when you take the 3Q sup and you look at the reconciliation page with - and like the first line is U.S. gross contractual rents, it's the same that on the 4Q supp.\nBrian McDade: Yes. It would have gone down to the bankruptcies, yeah, for sure.\nLinda Tsai: Okay. So the $165 million versus $159.91 million versus…\nBrian McDade: Yes. I don’t…\nLinda Tsai: Okay.\nBrian McDade: I mean - why don’t you talk to Tom, I'll give you the more detail but instinctually, I would just say you - it had to go down because of bankruptcies, I mean– but he can fill that in.\nLinda Tsai: But sorry, one last one. You mentioned that the ABG brands generated $3.5 billion in digital sales…\nBrian McDade: Not ABG. Not ABG, all of our retail brands, okay?\nLinda Tsai: Okay.\nBrian McDade: So our investment in Penney, Aero, [indiscernible] Brooks Brothers, Forever 21, put it all and $3.5 billion.\nLinda Tsai: Okay. And any sense of what this growth rate looks like going forward?\nBrian McDade: Well, I mean, I'm kind of torn because it's been pretty quick with COVID, right. Our stores aren’t open but we're shut down for a long time. But it's growing reasonably well.\nLinda Tsai: Okay.\nBrian McDade: But we have - I think the important thing here is we have embedded in our company an e-commerce company, okay? Now, again I know it's - we've got a complicated structure. We don't own 100% of everything, but we are in at a pretty reasonable scale. We have an e-commerce company that does $3.5 million of digital sales. That’s the most important point. Now it’s up to us and the management team to how to put it all together so the market recognizes the value.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street.\nVince Tibone: I just had a follow-up to Linda's question on the comp NOI piece. I just want to make sure I understand the guidance you stated correctly. So the 5% increase in portfolio NOI for next year, is that number inclusive of incremental NOI from Taubman? Because based on my math that would make most or all of that 5% increase that you do with Taubman and the legacy Simon assets with either flat or slightly down? Is that fair in clarifying that?\nDavid Simon: Vince, you’re trying to paint a negative picture my friend. That's just no metric. That's just Simon's portfolio, it doesn't include the Taubman.\nVince Tibone: Does that work out…\nDavid Simon: …for the guidance piece.\nBrian McDade: For the guidance piece. Correct.\nVince Tibone: No, that I want to make sure I clarify that.\nBrian McDade: Yes. I accept that. It's a fair question. It's just our existing portfolio does not have anything to do with TRG.\nVince Tibone: And then in the fourth quarter, is it fair to say the domestic portfolio NOI is pretty close to the old comp NOI definition then?\nBrian McDade: It's always been, yes. I mean, it’s always been - as you know, our comp NOI is - has been 95% - been frankly 90% - 90%, 95% of the portfolio. So we sat here and I looked at and I go why do we put comp NOI? What do we take out? What do we don’t take out? It's just - it's more - there's just no need for it, especially given what we endured in 2020. We'll just give you the number, portfolio whether it has a redevelopment that's taking the NOI down or we added something to take it - the NOI up, it’s almost irrelevant, it's all on the margin. And again, I know that - I'm glad you clarified that, that does not include TRG and we'll figure out exactly how to portray it for 2021.\nVince Tibone: Okay. I’ll go with my next question, is going forward, I mean, it totally makes sense from the redevelopment piece just to lump it together but I think next year with Taubman getting added, it would be helpful to have some sense of ongoing operations versus the incremental NOI from Taubman at this point?\nBrian McDade: Yes. I think that's a fair statement. So we'll - we will figure out if we lost it, we'll make sure that we highlight what the number is.\nVince Tibone: And then maybe just one more quick one for me. Just can you provide a little additional color on the leasing spreads, specifically maybe comparing or providing a little commentary on malls versus outlets today?\nDavid Simon: That's a good one. I don't know, do you know off the top of your head?\nBrian McDade: So there's - malls was - obviously we recorded number of minus 6.8%. I talked about the fact that mix, you think about some of those acres that were in the mix previously, now were driving the mall spread negative, but the preliminary point is positive.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: So I guess a question for you on the outlook for retail sales more broadly. We’ve talked to some people who express concern that as COVID subsides, that retail sales from malls and outlets specifically could be negatively impacted because there will be an outsized demand for travel, entertainment, and social gatherings, and that's where consumers will be spending their dollars. And additionally, because of COVID, there's been a lack of new fashion trends outside of leisure, sweats for us to wear comfortably at home, which could make apparel sales challenging for a while. And then there is the concern of the further e-commerce share again. So I guess I'm curious how you're thinking about the near-term opportunity and risk for retail sales here, how that plays into your expectations for rent, and also the projects you're starting and how you're populating those redevelopment projects. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Yes. Listen, I can't sit here and make a prediction other than what I said earlier. So I think suburbia is going to be - really make a major comeback. It was all about street retail. It was all about urbanization. I think you're going to see a movement towards suburbs, and that'll be - that’ll spell good opportunity for us. And I'm not overly concerned about people are going to have their disposable income and go here and there. I think we'll get our fair share of the growth that's expected when we get past COVID and resume our normal lives. Not overly worried about it.\nHaendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Just following up on spread, I know you’ve been asked this question several different ways, but I’m curious overall. Is there anything here in the recent leases you're signing or aren't you seeing the numbers that suggest that spreads could cross here in 2021? I'm curious what your assessment of the prospect of your…\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I think, I mean, again I think we are - if I could put a lot of these recent questions in perspective, I mean, in evaluating what we think we're going to earn next year is there's science but there's an element of art because we are dealing with a very uncertain macroenvironment predominantly because of COVID and the impacts that it has on the psyche and how much stimulus we're going to have. There's a lot of uncertainties there, so we try to do the best we can to kind of give you a portrait of what we're going to earn. And there's a lot that goes into it. I think it's hopefully we'll be in that range and we’ll execute like we have historically and we'll be in that range. But it's really hard to pinpoint a specific statistic one way or another because there's just so many variables out there and we try to put it all together in this range to give you a sense of what we think the earnings will be next year or this year, I should say.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Just talk about your development pipeline, the yield of 8%, I don’t think that's changed over the past couple quarters. I'm just curious is that because the projects are pretty much leased and ready to go so there's not much risk to that yield? And secondly, if you had to put new dollars to work, is 8% on development or redevelopment enough to justify it?\nBrian McDade: Well, the answer is it hasn't changed much because the development - I mean, not much has changed. I mean, it's been in lockdown as you know, in dealing with COVID. So we hope to look at where we can accretively add, and the answer is no. 8%, there is - no guide it’s got to be over 8% or 9%. It’s got to be what's the value of the property, what it's going to do to the property. I mean, if the property is an 8% cap rate property. And you get an 8% return, you're essentially treading water unless you think you're going to suddenly make it a 6% property which is possible in certain redevelopments. On the other hand, if you spend an 8% on a 5%, then you’ve made a lot of money. So it - everything boils down to the specific real estate that we're trying to create over a long-term basis. Now remember, we give you these numbers kind of more or less out of the box. But if you get 8% with growth, I mean, that's a pretty good return, unlevered return going forward. So again, it depends on the real estate.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And just last question from me, how do you think about - any early thoughts on the kitchen dollar minimum wage and how do you think your retails can handle it and at the end of the day like how much exposure you might be - you might have at Simon as a company?\nDavid Simon: Yes, I really don't, you know. I'm going to stay out of politics. And we'll - I mean I think we all were frustrated with the - what was trust upon us last year because of the - the way that we got treated versus other boxes and other warehouses. The mall seemed to get the brunt of a lot of the restrictions. We would seem more symbolic than inside. Now the reality is, all I want is a level playing field. Just level it for everybody and we'll figure out how to operate in that environment. And I would just say, if it's level and make sense, then great. Then - I could look at that from two, three, four different vantage points and as long as it's a level playing field. Then that's all of it that I'm focused on - and beyond that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: David I just had - just two other questions. If you talk about sort of the retailers now that you own and obviously with the amount of closures and the malls had obviously their e-commerce sales were rising pretty significantly. You and I have talked over the years about how so much of a retailer's brand was driven by the physical footprint and how you as a landlord, weren't sharing in those e-commerce sales? Especially when your assets were serving as the reason why some of those people may go online and you had expressed a lot of frustration about not getting your fair share of that. I guess now that you're sitting on both sides, can you comment a little bit about how you may be restructuring your leases with those retailers to be able to A) share in those e-commerce sales and what you're doing to benefit from that?\nDavid Simon: Well, there's no real - I mean it's - there's no real change. I mean, we discuss with a lot of retailers what happens if they buy online return to store. What happens if it shifts from store? What happens if they pick up and reserve it in store? And those are all - we have a pretty consistent approach to it. Even with the pandemic and all the - all of the pressures that we've had to deal with and where it still more or less sticking to what we think is the right approach on that front. So I mean, I’ll never - we're not looking to get our fair share of their e-commerce sales. So I think you mischaracterized it. I think we're just looking to not get hurt when they do sales. But somehow the store is involved in that sale and that’s all that we’re looking for. We’re not - as they do all their business online God bless them, but if the store interaction is important to them we don’t want our sales to be reduced. Because the store is providing a service and they’re in lies in a discussion and it really said that’s ongoing and it’s - and I think we’re making a lot of progress on that front.\nMichael Bilerman: Right, if now owning more of the brands, owning more retailers as you sort of get involved and figuring out what is the right split and how would all be handled. And I understand the credit aspect those - where those sales and how it happened whether its returns, but I would imagine that obviously your assets serves a good marketing for those brands? And in calculating what rent you want that retailer to pay based on the sales that they generate within that trade area is something that you would want for Simon shareholders. As I'm trying to figure out how you balance the two sides today?\nDavid Simon: We've been balancing things for years and years and years that’s what we do. Look I would say for most retailers having the store is extremely important because if they're in a market out of sight, out of mind they're certainly retailers that are going to experiment with shrinking their store print - store footprint dramatically and assuming that they're going to pick up online. Maybe they - maybe it works I think it won't, but we'll see. Some will take their chance and they certainly have that right to do whatever they want as leases expire. But I don't think they'll make it up on the Internet. And the most and the best successful retailers are ones that really figure out how to do both really well and that's the ones that we want to do business with. And our brands we want to be in that category and in some cases we're not quite there. I mean I would tell you that Penney’s e-commerce business is not where it needs to be. On the same thing their store business isn't either. But we're going to mutually go after both elements. I would tell you that the Aero store business is terrific and they're picking up their e-commerce business. I would tell you that Forever 21 doesn't quite have a fully developed e-commerce business. And we want that to happen because we think that makes the store business better.\nMichael Bilerman: Right.\nDavid Simon: Not that complicated. There'll be some folks that are in our industry that will say I've got 300 stores. I've got 400 stores, I can do it a 100 and all the growth will come online. My personal view is I don't think they'll succeed. It's really hard to shrink to grow. That really - that's a really hard thing to do. Now, maybe you have to shrink to survive. But shrink to grow would be a better company that's a tough one. It's few and far between but maybe some can make it work. And if they do God bless. And if they do then they’ll probably want stores to grow again so that we’ll be back at it and we’ll see.\nMichael Bilerman: That’s helpful.\nDavid Simon: But I mean I don’t know if I’ve answered your question. But there’s really - in our frustration is we just want the recognition that - we certainly don’t want to get penalized if the store is a critical component for that transaction to have taken place.\nMichael Bilerman: Great, thanks for the color, David.\nDavid Simon: Sure. Okay, we’ve lost - me and the whole team and our time. So thank you. Happy New Year even though you're not supposed to do it in February and we'll talk soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian McDade",
            "content": "29th. No, that's exactly right. You'll see the retailer results that David mentioned come through the NOI from retailers at this line item, Rick. Yes. Alex, this is Brian. Look, I think the last debt deal we just did in here at the beginning of January is representative of where we've seen our spreads go. I mean, spreads were in 100 basis points since the summertime. And so I think that the market is representing and supporting time and kind of going forward. With respect to the agencies, we are certainly in deep dialogue with them on regular basis and are comfortable with what they've done thus far, and I think they're looking at our deals and our ability to raise capital, to David's point, in excess of $13 billion last year, as a testament to the company's balance sheet. So I think they're comfortable. Won't speak for them, but I believe they're comfortable where they're at right now. There's just no way we're going to get downgraded, not a chance. So next question. I mean, look, I think the biggest thing is not to replicate the abatements and the bankruptcies. I mean that's the biggest component. But look, our portfolio, again at gross not at share, did over $6 billion in 2019. Right? We lost a $1 billion. And all of the stuff that we did net. And again we've worked our unit to what off to mitigate that through cost savings. What's not going to replicate or the cost savings in a sense and the abatements. And we were pretty aggressive in running the ship as lean and as high as we could. And we had no choice even though people across the street were open, we weren't allowed. So we have a $1 billion to make up. Again, this is pre-TRG and I think the biggest thing is going to be the campaigns of the big unknown is how long is it going to take to get lease up, we lost 3 - 350 basis points, 3, what, 380 basis points? 380 basis points, so we loss 380 basis points on occupancy sales in our vaccine rollout and everything else. I mean, we did our roll up our best guess, our comp NOI is going to be positive. And we've got a reserve but at the end of the day, we're going to make the $1 billion up over time. We're also going to - some of the properties we're going to sell, go away, so that's in there, too. I can't give you - Steve Sakwa kind of poured out and we already gave you - he gave me more - he's got a nicer voice than you do. So I gave him more information than I probably normally would. I'm not kidding. But I mean, that's kind of where we are. We also - we're also dealing with the international shutdown. I mean, they're picking on malls like what happened in the U.S., again without science. But they're also shutting down outlets. But yet they high street open, so go figure it out. So we're still dealing with some crap everywhere. But I mean, I'd say the big thing that won't replicate. We hope is in the abatements, but it's taking on the cost savings and sales and then build up the lease income and bad debt, we put all these numbers in. We also put a reserve just because we have a lot of uncertainty, and we put it in the blender, and that spits out. Can't add much more than that? Hi Caitlin, this is Brian. It is not included. The only debt that will be included relative to Taubman will be $2 billion term loan that we drew down ahead of the closure. Yes, it absolutely will. Well, again, our net investment in retail is $330 million. So I think when we have properties that were worth a $1 billion plus, it is what it is. I think it's important to note that we are 400 basis points below our mean FFO multiple as a history of being a public company. And if you look at our retail or what we've seen from retailers and the correlation, they've all had a much greater bounce back in terms of performance on the in terms of performance on the - on their stock year-to-date for the last few quarters than we have. So, we're optimistic that the future will begin to - that are our value will begin to be appreciated again which has been in the past. And frankly, there's no reason why it won't in the future. With respect to this - and the reason I bring up the past is as follows. If you'll look, we work the best case analogy that we're looking at. Again, no one has really dealt with COVID before. And as you know what happened in 2008, 2009 where we had - don't hold exactly to those - these numbers. But in 2008 we were earning around $6 a share. Our 2008, 2009 bankruptcies delusion that we had on issuing stock, high interest rates, I think we earned in the $3.50, $4 range. And then we ended up rolling out of that earning $12 dollars. Okay. Now we're at $9 - we are $9.11. We're saying we're going to earn $9.50 to $9.75. And I'm hopeful that will replicate what we did in 2008, 2009. And not only that we do in 2008 and 2009, but we added immensely to the quality of the real estate. We separated ourselves from our peer group dramatically. The balance sheet got better. All of these same - we diversified, we did this, that, and the other, we grew international - I truly believe all of these things will happen again. That's what we're made for, and this is a long way of saying that the dividend tracked basically what we did in earnings. We actually paid scrip dividend in 2009, if you believe it or not. We cut it and scripted it and did all this crazy stuff. And that was - all of that in 2008-2009. I feel like if history repeats itself, given the quality of the real estate, the team, the balance sheet, the diversity, we are going to replicate the same good work we did coming out of that, and we'll do it coming out of COVID. We're already beginning to do it, and that's the important thing. So I think that's a long way of saying, assuming we can completely get out of COVID, you're going to see increases in earnings which beget increases in dividends. And we have the history that ultimately should repeat itself. Maybe a quick one from me, on the duration here. Obviously, our unsecured portfolio benefits from the ability to issue 30-year debt. So that's going to naturally drive the duration higher on a weighted basis. Like I say, we're 50% done. Correct. We are - given the - I don't know how they show comp anymore given that we were shut down with restrictions. So I made the decision that we're just going to show you portfolio NOI, all-in, because you could argue that none of it is comp because, I mean, how do you - or all of it is comp. I don't really know what to do. So the simple thing is we're just going to show you our portfolio NOI without the comp distinction. So it's all the real estate, all of the NOI, and hopefully that'll be helpful to you. Which, Linda? Yes. It would have gone down to the bankruptcies, yeah, for sure. Yes. I don't... I mean - why don't you talk to Tom, I'll give you the more detail but instinctually, I would just say you - it had to go down because of bankruptcies, I mean– but he can fill that in. Not ABG. Not ABG, all of our retail brands, okay? So our investment in Penney, Aero, [indiscernible] Brooks Brothers, Forever 21, put it all and $3.5 billion. Well, I mean, I'm kind of torn because it's been pretty quick with COVID, right. Our stores aren't open but we're shut down for a long time. But it's growing reasonably well. But we have - I think the important thing here is we have embedded in our company an e-commerce company, okay? Now, again I know it's - we've got a complicated structure. We don't own 100% of everything, but we are in at a pretty reasonable scale. We have an e-commerce company that does $3.5 million of digital sales. That's the most important point. Now it's up to us and the management team to how to put it all together so the market recognizes the value. For the guidance piece. Correct. Yes. I accept that. It's a fair question. It's just our existing portfolio does not have anything to do with TRG. It's always been, yes. I mean, it's always been - as you know, our comp NOI is - has been 95% - been frankly 90% - 90%, 95% of the portfolio. So we sat here and I looked at and I go why do we put comp NOI? What do we take out? What do we don't take out? It's just - it's more - there's just no need for it, especially given what we endured in 2020. We'll just give you the number, portfolio whether it has a redevelopment that's taking the NOI down or we added something to take it - the NOI up, it's almost irrelevant, it's all on the margin. And again, I know that - I'm glad you clarified that, that does not include TRG and we'll figure out exactly how to portray it for 2021. Yes. I think that's a fair statement. So we'll - we will figure out if we lost it, we'll make sure that we highlight what the number is. So there's - malls was - obviously we recorded number of minus 6.8%. I talked about the fact that mix, you think about some of those acres that were in the mix previously, now were driving the mall spread negative, but the preliminary point is positive. Well, the answer is it hasn't changed much because the development - I mean, not much has changed. I mean, it's been in lockdown as you know, in dealing with COVID. So we hope to look at where we can accretively add, and the answer is no. 8%, there is - no guide it's got to be over 8% or 9%. It's got to be what's the value of the property, what it's going to do to the property. I mean, if the property is an 8% cap rate property. And you get an 8% return, you're essentially treading water unless you think you're going to suddenly make it a 6% property which is possible in certain redevelopments. On the other hand, if you spend an 8% on a 5%, then you've made a lot of money. So it - everything boils down to the specific real estate that we're trying to create over a long-term basis. Now remember, we give you these numbers kind of more or less out of the box. But if you get 8% with growth, I mean, that's a pretty good return, unlevered return going forward. So again, it depends on the real estate."

            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "Okay. Good evening. As all of us know, 2020 was a difficult year for all of those affected by COVID-19, including our company. Even with the unprecedented operating environment, we accomplished a great deal. We earned $9.11 per diluted share and funds from operation for the full-year, which includes $0.06 per share dilution from our recent equity offering in November. We generated over $2.3 billion in operating cash flow. We acquired an 80% interest in The Taubman Realty Group, made strategic investments in several widely recognized retail brands at attractive valuations, and have already made significant progress in repositioning each brand and increasing their operating cash flow. We raised over $13 billion in debt and equity markets, opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others, completed three domestic redevelopments, abated rent for thousands of small and local businesses, regional entrepreneurs, and restaurateurs who frankly needed our help to survive, paid $700 million in real estate taxes, which unbelievably was an increase from 2019 despite losing approximately 13,500 shopping days in our domestic portfolio during the year due to the restrictive governmental orders placed upon us, and that's roughly 20% of the whole year, to put it in perspective, and we returned $2 billion in cash to our shareholders in dividends. These results and frankly, these accomplishments are a testament to the entire team, Simon team for the resilience, relentless focus on operations and cost structure, and the safety of the communities we serve, and obviously, focused on giving back to the communities in terms of what we did from abatement and real estate tax point of view. Now, let's go to the fourth quarter and then we're going to turn the page. Fourth quarter FFO was $787 million, that's $2.17 per share, obviously, that was affected by the dilution of our equity offering that I mentioned. I'm pleased that to report that with the solid profitability and the $900 million in operating cash flow we generated in the fourth quarter, our domestic international operations in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately a net $0.95 per diluted share, primarily due to the reduced lease income, including sales base rents and other property revenues caused by COVID-19 disruption and $0.06 also from the international operations due to various restrictions placed upon those properties. Collection from our U.S. retail portfolio continue to improve. As of last week, we've collected 90% of our net build rents for the second, third, and fourth quarters combined. We made significant progress in the fourth quarter and addressing previously unresolved amounts with certain large tenants. We still, even to this day, have a handful of large tenants. Unfortunately, we've yet to resolve their receivables and we are hopeful that - and we anticipate resolving those certainly in the next few weeks. And you can review the collection details in our press release that we issued. Now, let me walk through as I have for Q2, Q3 and Q4, the year-over-year change for the fourth quarter in the context of our portfolio NOI presentation, which you can find on Page 17. Again, to remind you, these are on a gross basis and not a company share. Last year, our NOI was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. This year, it's $1.2 billion, that's a decrease of 23.9%, or approximately $380 million. And here are the components of the decline: $220 million in aggregate from domestic rent abatements and higher uncollectable rents, primarily associated with retail bankruptcies. And this is an important reminder, we do not amortize any of the abatements even though through FASB, you could, we chose to write those off in the period that they were granted. And hence, they affect our lease income in the period that we decided to go ahead and grant the abatement. Approximately, $205 million from lower minimum rents reimbursement short-term leasing, ancillary property revenues, and terminations associated with bankruptcy, tenants and lower sales volume due to COVID-19 disruption, obviously, lots of government restrictions on restaurants and amount of people we could have in the properties. And just as a reminder to you, we have a great deal of seasonality in the fourth quarter. So obviously, the card kiosk overage rent was impacted by, again, the immense restrictions that we had in terms of operating our portfolio by government mandates. And then we offset some of that decline by our diligent cost reduction initiatives. Operating metrics at the fourth quarter was basically flat compared to the third quarter 2020, and we were down year-over-year. Average base minimum rent was $55.80, up 2.2% for the year. Leasing spreads declined primarily as a function of mix. We had some boxes last year that rolled out and are no longer in the 12-month reporting period. Good news is leasing momentum is continuing. We signed over 1,400 leases representing 6 million square feet and have a number of significant - number of leases in our pipeline. And that's a testament to our quality of our real estate. And I do think we're starting to see our retailers get back to what they do best, and that is operate stores. We opened two new outlets, frankly, in Spain and Bangkok, which we're proud of. We have an outlet under construction in England, which will open this spring. Redevelopments, as I mentioned to you, we completed a number of properties. We also added, which is essentially the Woodbury of Asia, Gotemba Outlet expansion, another 178,000 square feet, and another property in Japan, adding another 110,000 square feet. So look for those to add to our cash flow in future years. We continue to densify our centers with the opening of a multi-family residential complex and hotel. We also have three hotels under construction. We completed the redevelopment and - of another Northshore mall and we started construction on expansion in Naples. So we're back to focused on continuing to add improvements across our portfolio worldwide. We also have a pipeline as you know, redevelopment, new development that is under consideration. Now, let me just turn to our retail investments. And I think and I hope this puts all of this in proper perspective. Obviously, we have an unbelievable track record in capital allocation, making significant returns on investment. During the year, we capitalized on buying four recognized retail brands in bankruptcy, so we bought them at attractive valuations. They include Forever 21, Lucky Brands, Brooks Brothers and Penney, each of these brands we believe presents a very interesting repositioning opportunity and each investment has completed at attractive valuations and we've made significant progress improving the positioning and operating results of the company. And let me just give Forever 21 as an example. And as you know, we bought it in February pre-COVID, well before we knew COVID would have the impact it did on 2020. And despite all of that, despite all of that, Forever 21, both in the company, generated a positive EBITDA, pre-royalties, of approximately $75 million in 2020, and we basically paid $67 million for that. So our share of that is $30 million, and you can divide it by $67 million to give you our return on investment in COVID 2020. Now, you could probably conclude that that's a pretty good return on investment. Now, if you put all of our retail brand investments in context, we have approximately $330 million remaining invested capital net of cash distributions and the value of appreciation of our ABG investment, which has just had a recent trade. And so, in marking that to market, our net investment in all of these activities is $330 million, and all of these brands will generate for us in 2021, our share, $260 million of EBITDA, so you can take $260 million divided by $330 million, will give you sets of our return on investment. Now, I want to remind everyone that we do not add back depreciation associated with these retailer investments to our FFO because it's not real property. So the contribution of that from an earnings point of view will obviously be much less with the EBITDA, is the EBITDA. So the other point to make in these retail investments is all of these brands generate $3.5 billion in digital sales, $3.5 billion in digital sales. And all we have to do is look at how e-commerce brands are being valued today and I think you could all conclude, we hope you do, that we've been making some wise investments here. Now, with respect to Taubman, I'm very pleased to have completed the transaction for 80% TRG and their premier retail portfolio, asset portfolio, our teams have worked - started working together. In fact, I'm up, I can't wait to go to Detroit tomorrow night in the cold and snow, it's slightly colder than Indianapolis but I'm sure I'll be welcome. And we're off to a very productive good spirited start. I really do look forward to the partnership and growth inherent in the portfolio and I think we'll all work very well together. As many of you know, we recently filed the Form S-1 with the SEC to raise $300 million and a Simon sponsored Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation i.e. SPAC. We are currently in a quiet period for the filing and are unable to speak to it about the proposed offering at this time. We've been very active in the debt and equity capital markets raising $13 billion in the last 12 or so months. And just some highlights, amended and extended our credit facility with a $6 billion facility that included a $2 billion term loan which was used to fund the Taubman transaction, issued $3.5 billion of senior notes including the recent $1.5 billion offer in January. Addressing all of our 21 unsecured maturities and obviously before the treasury really moved up. We completed seven 15 secured loan financings, refinancings for $2 billion. And again in November we completed the common stock issuance of 22 million shares for $1.56 billion. Debt to the term loan funded the Taubman deal. And our net debt was flat compared to last year exclusive of the properties that we added with the Taubman transaction and the term loan drawdown. Fourth quarter, we ended our liquidity with $8.2 billion consisting about a $1,005 billion of cash including our share of joint venture, and $6.7 billion available credit facility. This is net of $623 million of commercial paper outstanding quarter end. Dividend, we paid our fourth quarter dividend of $1.30 per share which is $6 in total for the year. We paid more than $2 billion in 2020, we're up to over $34 billion in dividends of our history as a public company and we're really proud that we paid the cash dividend when many of our other companies either suspended or completely eliminated or dramatically reduced their dividend. Now, finally, let's move on to 2021 because I do frankly want to turn the page on 2020 as I'm sure we all - as you all do, we feel confident we've turned the corner. We expect growth in cash flow and earnings in 2021. Our guidance is $9.50 to $9.75 per share. This range includes approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share from our retailer investments. Again, keep in mind that we can't add back or we don't add back depreciation for those investments. That's our growth range of 4.3% to 7% compared to our full year of 9.11% and just no more - our diluted share count will be 3.76%, no significant acquisition or disposition activity and no further government mandate shutdown of our domestic retail properties is in that guidance. As you know, we are dealing certain shutdowns in Europe as we speak. So, let me just conclude. One heck of a year, let's not repeat it in any stretch of our imagination. Let's turn the corner. And I want to thank my Simon colleagues for their continued resolve in running our business under these trying circumstances in a very tough environment. We dealt with just basically about everything. And I want to thank them. And again thank our shareholders for their support. And everyone out there be well. And we're ready for any and all questions though, I'm sure people want to go home and warm up because it's cold. Good, good. Well, look, I think we're - as I said to you, we're expecting to grow our cash flow. Are we back to normal? Not yet, but we're working our way back. Generally, it's still a very serious, intense negotiation on renewals. Retailers are generally cautious. But the ones that want to grow their business are excited, and we hope to be able to certainly increase our occupancy for 2021. And it's going to take some time to obviously get back to where we were in 2019. But the healthy retailers that believe in their business and believe in their plan are making deals, and that we have such a high-quality portfolio between what we have and what we've acquired with respect to TRG that we're going to be - we're going to get our fair share of open-to-buys. Well, certainly, the abatements better not repeat, okay? So that's step one. I would say to you generally, again, it's - our portfolio NOI growth will be 4% to 5%. We have taken a further reserve, but I'm not going to give you a number as to what we think should be a cushion to whether whatever it is further bankruptcies, additional abatements to the extent that we cut an appropriate deal, we still have some large retailers frustratingly we have not solved. Not because of us, we've tried, but we haven't gotten into the finish line. So I'd say generally around 5% in the comp NOI number. We have a reserve. Sales are really all over the place, so it's really hard to give you a good number there. And we would expect occupancy to edge up. And I gave you - people wanted to hear about how much was retail or I gave you that and we have TRG factored in there. Obviously, we made our financing assumptions. Those were pretty straightforward. We have our share count increased because of the offering. And then we roll it into the blender and that's kind of what's spit out. We have some variability. You're right, the range is tight, but we did - I mean, we did add a reserve to it based upon gut feel that we're, like you said, not - we're turning the corner, it's kind of my phrase, but are we completely out of the woods? Not yet, but well on our way. Sure. Well, look, it flows through - listen, I used to - I'm still pretty good at it, but it flows through our equity. They're all equity accounted, so now in - we show a couple of different things. So we do separate out our retail NOI in our supplemental, so we do, do that. TRG will be in our property NOI next year. We had - we took no financial implications for TRG in the fourth quarter, obviously, I think we owned it for like 12 minutes, right? When did it close? 29th all right, I see. I'm always faster than what it is. We took no other than, obviously, our debt increase at the year-end, because we drew down on the term loan to fund it. But from a GAAP point of view, it will be in the equity, all lumped together with our other equity investments. But in our supplemental, we'll have TRG in our portfolio NOI, and the retailer will be in that separate line item. Guys, you want to add anything else? Well, I mean, that's a tough one, Rich. I mean I could go in a lot of different directions. Listen, when you end up in bankruptcy or near bankruptcy, you've obviously made a lot of mistakes. It just doesn't happen overnight. And by and large, the ones that we bought, retailers that we have bought in bankruptcy. So then we go in there and just run it like we run Simon Property Group, obviously, with the help of our partners.  And we make fast, commonsensical cash flow-oriented decisions and return on investments, et cetera. And we have a sense of, just because of our experience in the retail real estate world, what makes it successful, what success real estate they should be in, what's the right rent to pay in spaces and we bring all those - all that to bear. And then obviously, when you're in bankruptcy, you have the chance to deal with leases or other contracts, other contracts that are wildly expensive that you might be able to change. I mean, the most amazing thing, I shouldn't really say this, but there - the most amazing thing is that every retailer that we purchased in bankruptcy, the one - all the tech companies get $0.100 on the $1, okay, that they pay for whether it's services, whether it's for the e-commerce business, whatever it is. And the landlords ended up us included end up getting it in the shorts that's an interesting thing. That would be great to like rethink that whole process. But there - those tech companies are so powerful that they can check you off if you don't play ball with them. So landlords, us included, don't have that kind of power. So I mean, I don't know if I've answered your question. It probably is. You probably have a lot of nuances to it but it's probably I could go on for hours. If you don't mind, let's go on to your next question or another question. It's pretty. It gets less pretty when it gets closer to March let me assure. Yes. Well, the bottom line is, when it came to abatements we took it in the period that we actually made the deal. And if we had done everything in the second quarter, we would have done it then in the Q3 with. It just took an unbelievable amount of time to get - I mean there was a lot of horse trading, a lot of big accounts got settled as you know in Q4. And it really, I mean, we - it really was when the deal was done. So that's the - yes, we certainly want to go into 2021 and we did as much as we could to finish 2020, but those abatements were done in the period at which we cut the deal and signed up the retailer. As I think I said there is some negotiations that we still have left to do but I think we dealt with that in a sense in 2020 based on kind of where the deal was headed. So we did use some judgment at year-end in a couple of these cases. But it isn't done until the cash comes into my bank account, not mine, that was terrible. My bank account at the Simon Property Group representative, okay, so make that perfectly clear, okay? Yes. Well, I would say, you take a state like Florida as a pretty good example. And I mean, you are getting - the one element that's missing is international tourism. But if you put that aside, you're getting some real domestic traffic increases and you're getting - and sales aren't quite what they were last year. But at this time, what you're seeing - I would say to you that like a state like Florida is really showing green shoots, vibrant economy. The only element that's missing to make that really hot would be international tourism. But everything else is kind of clicking along and it's pretty good. Texas is probably the next closest, but again, it depends. I mean, they're - that also somewhat dependent upon whether it's near the border or not. And what is such a big state that do you have COVID in this one area versus that area. But I'd say Texas is showing green shoots as well. But Florida is a great example of I would say to you that you can - you can't get on with goodness and you start to see green shoots and the - there's a lot of energy there. And no, I did not get on Super Bowl, okay. Yes, sure. I'd say simplistically, as we look at restarting the pipe, the pipe didn't go away. We just put it in the freezer. Now we're thawing it out. And I would say to you the biggest change Derek is that we believe in the mixed use component pretty, pretty significantly to the extent that we were adding what I'd call retail. We're probably looking at those plans again to make sure that we're adding the appropriate amount, that's kind of the biggest change. But I would tell you this, I do feel very strongly about this that the high quality suburbs are going to be where the action is in the future. And all of the urbanization two, three, four years ago, the question was why are the suburbs going to exist. Everybody is going to live in urban environment, yadda yadda, yadda, yadda. I'm telling you the suburbs are going to be hot, and our quality real estate is going to be where the action is for those well located suburban centers of commerce. And that's going to be the big change coming out of the pandemic. Next question. Well, listen, I would say that we - whatever we do we look at return on investment and cash flow potential - shareholder value potential and cash flow growth, and obviously top line growth. And each business is evaluated based upon what those particular characteristics are important to that investment. But there's no reason. You know we're in a REIT format. There's no reason why we can't make money in other areas that are consistent with what we've been doing. I think we've proven that time and again. Have we made mistakes? Yes, we have. But we've been pretty good investors, and we hope to do that in the future. We're pretty good sponsors, and we have - our relationships between the brands and our partners and - spans the globe, essentially. From a real estate footprint, we're in Europe and Asia, and obviously domestic. The only place I'd say we're really not in is South America. But our retail brands span a lot of places, and we're focused on value. And at the end of the day, Michael, I look at our retail footprint. It does $3.5 billion of commerce, and I look at the value we get for it, and it's probably nothing, and in some cases people view it as a negative, which I can't understand, but they do. That's their prerogative. Maybe there's something maybe we should unlock that value, we're absolutely going to look at every opportunity to unlock value to the extent we can but we - and figure out the right structure. But the most important thing is to make a good investment. The second thing that is where it should reside, how do you get the value, how do you grow it? And all of those are in the works. Spark is a great example. We believe in the model. We can - we believe that we can run brands across it common infrastructure. We know that e-commerce brands, they spend a lot of money on infrastructure. We know that if you combine those into one entity, you're bound to save a ton of money. We've seen it in the overhead in retail companies, so you know we're at the early days of figuring out what the right structure is. But in the meantime, we're going to make investments that make us money. And believe me, there is value there that will unlock or we'll get the credit for. 380 basis points. Well, I mean, Craig, that's a retail - yes I mean, I'm sorry, real estate-specific. But I think what I said earlier is the most important thing. I think some of these we're re-looking at, with the idea toward reducing the amount of new retail that we might put on board. But also the restaurants and we're making up for that with what I'd call the opportunity for suburbs to get exciting again, and I think that's going to be through a lot of the mixed-use efforts that were already under way. But I think will be accelerated. So, some of the anchors are doing - new deals. I mean, we're talking to Kohl's. We're talking to [Buy More]. We're talking to all sorts of those kind of guys, to Dick's. We still are making new - we've got a couple of Dick's under way. So and I would hope that some of the more thoughtful entertainment-oriented retailers once the COVID restrictions get back, would also continue to be in our property. So it's still at work, but I'm hopeful we'll have a lot more of the mixed SKU stuff that we're doing and we're in some hot what I'll call very strong markets for that. Like with TRG in Nashville, we're in Austin. We're very strong in South Florida, obviously Texas. So we're in some of these markets that rent growth and are looking to facilitate growth and we're going to go and make the next evolution of our real estate that's much more interesting with time. I'd say fantastic. We are on the leasing side talking significantly, both on COVID-related issues, renewal-related issues, new business, as you know, Craig we've got new business group dedicated kind of up and coming retailers which by the way, it's exciting. All of those retailers and this is where I do miss Rick. He could start and your kind to mention him. But I will never do his list. I could never do adjust this. But most of those retailers are looking to grow. And they include from the Warby Parker to Shake Shack on and on. So that's very encouraging. We're talking to the TRG, about that relationship between Bobby and myself is great. In fact well Bobby, he figures out how to get to me very easily. He makes me look a lot with - which is fantastic. I look forward to having some tomorrow night. And I think it's going to be a great partnership. I mean they're dealing with what we've dealt with. In terms of COVID it's been a tough year for them, but I think we're all looking forward to the future. And we'll go from there. And as you know, they've got - the families got a lot of capital tied up from the TRG and believe me they want to grow that. And to me that's a win-win. Yes, that well, the fact of the matter is, I think that statistic you have to be very careful with. And I personally chose that I think we need to look at it again because as you know many of those properties are non-recourse and it overstates leverage. And I think part of our job is to educate the investment community how we look at the business. And Brian and myself, we'll begin that effort this year. But you know look EBITDA - debt to EBITDA, if you look at our - it's not in our financial covenants anywhere. So it's a gratuitous metric that is not as thoughtful as refined as it should be. And we're in the process of refining it to clearly articulate what it is. But you've got to separate what's recourse, non-recourse. What's in JV, what's not in JV in a more thoughtful manner, which we'll embark upon in 2021 so you'll have a better understanding of it. We have no need for raising additional equity. The balance sheet is in very good shape. Rating agencies are very comfortable with the transaction that we did both to finance, Taubman and the equity deal. Obviously, they put us on watch just because of COVID. It had nothing to do with Taubman or the financial metrics. And I think as we get - as we go beyond the shutdown - remember, we lost 20%. We lost 20% of our ability to operate in the year which is material. And then obviously a lot - not counting the, restrictions that we had to endure coming out of it. I think once we show that we're - we've turned the corner in terms of that, you'll see that negative watch go away. No issue not worried about it one [iota]. And on the property acquisition side, A) if I can buy it at a good value and it's a great asset and a guy wants to sell and if that's meaningful to our portfolio, we'll take a serious look. But we're in no - there's no need to do one thing or another, if it's accretive to our portfolio and our financial wherewithal, we're happy to look at it. Yes, sure. I would say, simplistically, certainly prior to COVID, there were more or less the same. There is certainly more of an interest to go a little bit shorter term. So three years and by the way, we're okay with that because I'd rather negotiate two or three years from now than right now. So the lease in 2020, the new stuff that we did in 2020 and some of those renewals, some of the renewals we're doing 20 21 are shorter two, three years. But I think actually that could be in our best interest too because obviously, we've had being shut down and restricted and all this other stuff. We don't have quite the ability to point to sales as a way to increase rent. So I think we're - and I think it's actually a two-way street. It's working out fine with the vast majority of our retailers. I'd say pretty similar are the couple like the Florida Mall Fashion Valley, pretty straightforward doing it. In some cases, it's got 10-year deals and maybe a little shorter. We did what 15 secure refinancing even in this period of time. So I don't find it overly complicated or overly concerning or any risk that there's not the ability, any risk that there's not the ability to refinance stuff. On nonrecourse, there's certain debt that's nonrecourse that may be in professional servicing. That's kind of a contractual right for the borrower which is a standalone entity that's nonrecourse to SPG. It's also the right from the special servicer right. So we've done - we've dealt with those for a number of years. In some cases, they'll be restructured, mutually agreed to; and if not, and the special servicer would like to own the real estate, we're more than happy to cooperate and do it in a professional manner. We did one just recently, and it's absolutely in the best interest of Simon Property Group shareholders those decisions that we're making on that front. So very straightforward, very professional, honoring the contracts, rights on both sides. Make - hope to make deals in some; if not, then they'll no longer be part of our portfolio, and we wish that new owner the best of luck. This is a known unknown, right, as opposed to an unknown, unknown, right. I would simply say there's - the cap rate is what we want it to be because I think we're the only buyer out there. So, and I'll look in the mirror and I'll decide what the right cap rates are. I think Brookfield is busy buying out, [indiscernible] busy buying up EPY. And I think we're the only buyer as far as I know. Everybody as herd mentality one way or another, we are buyers of high quality real estate. And the funny thing is, when we decide to buy something that doesn't count as to what cap rate it should be, now we're the only buyer. So, go figure that out. I don't know if that's a known unknown or a, you know, whatever. But the fact of the matter is we're really the only - I mean we're really the only buyer. And yet, everybody wants to point to a cap rate that we're not the buyer. But I don't - I never understood why we're not good enough to be the arbiter of what cap rates should be. But I'll let you figure that out for us. I can't figure that out. Well, listen, we did close just a recent transaction and in that - that's a pretty good indication. That's correct. That's correct. So... ...and any of that. But I want you, Floris, I want you to get back to me and explain why we can't be the arbiter of cap rates. Why it has to be a state pension fund, why it can't be Simon Property Group? I don't get it, okay. Anyway, I'm kidding, but not really. But I'm kidding, mostly. Yes. You're over your allotted time. Call anytime. Tom Ward is shaking his head. Yes, and for those of you who know Tom Ward, you can count on it. They would have been positive, yes. In terms of renewals or appraisal or... In terms of what percent were done yet or not? Well, I don't - I mean, that's factored in. I don't know what - I don't know - I can't really answer off the top of my head on spreads. But what - we have a percent done. Does anybody know off the top of their head? Yes, over 50%, but we can get you more. I've seen it, but I'm sorry to tell you I just don't remember. Tom could give that to you, the percent done. Vince, you're trying to paint a negative picture my friend. That's just no metric. That's just Simon's portfolio, it doesn't include the Taubman. ...for the guidance piece. That's a good one. I don't know, do you know off the top of your head? Yes. Listen, I can't sit here and make a prediction other than what I said earlier. So I think suburbia is going to be - really make a major comeback. It was all about street retail. It was all about urbanization. I think you're going to see a movement towards suburbs, and that'll be - that'll spell good opportunity for us. And I'm not overly concerned about people are going to have their disposable income and go here and there. I think we'll get our fair share of the growth that's expected when we get past COVID and resume our normal lives. Not overly worried about it. Well, look, I think, I mean, again I think we are - if I could put a lot of these recent questions in perspective, I mean, in evaluating what we think we're going to earn next year is there's science but there's an element of art because we are dealing with a very uncertain macroenvironment predominantly because of COVID and the impacts that it has on the psyche and how much stimulus we're going to have. There's a lot of uncertainties there, so we try to do the best we can to kind of give you a portrait of what we're going to earn. And there's a lot that goes into it. I think it's hopefully we'll be in that range and we'll execute like we have historically and we'll be in that range. But it's really hard to pinpoint a specific statistic one way or another because there's just so many variables out there and we try to put it all together in this range to give you a sense of what we think the earnings will be next year or this year, I should say. Yes, I really don't, you know. I'm going to stay out of politics. And we'll - I mean I think we all were frustrated with the - what was trust upon us last year because of the - the way that we got treated versus other boxes and other warehouses. The mall seemed to get the brunt of a lot of the restrictions. We would seem more symbolic than inside. Now the reality is, all I want is a level playing field. Just level it for everybody and we'll figure out how to operate in that environment. And I would just say, if it's level and make sense, then great. Then - I could look at that from two, three, four different vantage points and as long as it's a level playing field. Then that's all of it that I'm focused on - and beyond that. Well, there's no real - I mean it's - there's no real change. I mean, we discuss with a lot of retailers what happens if they buy online return to store. What happens if it shifts from store? What happens if they pick up and reserve it in store? And those are all - we have a pretty consistent approach to it. Even with the pandemic and all the - all of the pressures that we've had to deal with and where it still more or less sticking to what we think is the right approach on that front. So I mean, I'll never - we're not looking to get our fair share of their e-commerce sales. So I think you mischaracterized it. I think we're just looking to not get hurt when they do sales. But somehow the store is involved in that sale and that's all that we're looking for. We're not - as they do all their business online God bless them, but if the store interaction is important to them we don't want our sales to be reduced. Because the store is providing a service and they're in lies in a discussion and it really said that's ongoing and it's - and I think we're making a lot of progress on that front. We've been balancing things for years and years and years that's what we do. Look I would say for most retailers having the store is extremely important because if they're in a market out of sight, out of mind they're certainly retailers that are going to experiment with shrinking their store print - store footprint dramatically and assuming that they're going to pick up online. Maybe they - maybe it works I think it won't, but we'll see. Some will take their chance and they certainly have that right to do whatever they want as leases expire. But I don't think they'll make it up on the Internet. And the most and the best successful retailers are ones that really figure out how to do both really well and that's the ones that we want to do business with. And our brands we want to be in that category and in some cases we're not quite there. I mean I would tell you that Penney's e-commerce business is not where it needs to be. On the same thing their store business isn't either. But we're going to mutually go after both elements. I would tell you that the Aero store business is terrific and they're picking up their e-commerce business. I would tell you that Forever 21 doesn't quite have a fully developed e-commerce business. And we want that to happen because we think that makes the store business better. Not that complicated. There'll be some folks that are in our industry that will say I've got 300 stores. I've got 400 stores, I can do it a 100 and all the growth will come online. My personal view is I don't think they'll succeed. It's really hard to shrink to grow. That really - that's a really hard thing to do. Now, maybe you have to shrink to survive. But shrink to grow would be a better company that's a tough one. It's few and far between but maybe some can make it work. And if they do God bless. And if they do then they'll probably want stores to grow again so that we'll be back at it and we'll see. But I mean I don't know if I've answered your question. But there's really - in our frustration is we just want the recognition that - we certainly don't want to get penalized if the store is a critical component for that transaction to have taken place. Sure. Okay, we've lost - me and the whole team and our time. So thank you. Happy New Year even though you're not supposed to do it in February and we'll talk soon. Thank you."

For our prepared remarks, I’m pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Good evening and thank you for joining us today. Our results this quarter reflect continued progress in tenant reopenings and rent collections. All of our U.S. retail properties are currently open with nearly 25,000 tenants across our portfolio open and operating, and welcoming shoppers to this year’s extended holiday shopping season. Collections from our U.S. retail portfolio have continued to improve. As of November 6, we have collected 85% of third quarter net build rents. Second quarter collections are now 72% and including the deferred amounts in the calculation, the second quarter collection rate increases to 78%. The details of our collection percentages are clearly laid out in our press release issued this evening. While we’ve made significant progress in addressing collections, we still have some unresolved amounts with certain larger national tenants, who unfortunately are refusing to pay their contractual rent even though they are open and operating. Let me turn to our results. Third quarter reported FFO was $723 million or $2.05 per share. I am pleased with the solid profitability of the quarter and $600 million in cash flow we generated for the third quarter. Our domestic and international operations in the quarter, however, were negatively impacted by approximately $1.10 per diluted share primarily due to reduced lease income, including sales base rents or ancillary property revenues caused by the COVID-19 disruption partially offset by $0.23 per share from cost reduction initiatives or a net $0.87 per diluted share and then another $0.05 from our international operations as well. And the third quarter also includes our FFO $0.10 per share of lower straight line rent and $0.06 and the litigation expenses and $0.01 lower lease settlement income compared to Q3 of 2019. Now, like I did last quarter for Q2, let me walk through the components of the year-over-year change in the context of portfolio NOI presentation, which you can find on Page 17 supplement issued today and as a reminder, the following amounts are on a gross basis and are not at company share. Total portfolio NOI decreased from $1.5 billion in the third quarter of last year to $1.2 billion this year, a decrease of 22% or approximately $338 million. The year-over-year decline for the third quarter was primarily due to the following approximately $270 million in total from both domestic rent abatements and higher provisions for credit losses, primarily associated with retail bankruptcies. It is important to note we did not amortize any of the abatements granted. We recorded the abatement as negative lease income in the period, in which the abatement terms were agreed with the tenant. The majority of the abatements that were granted were to the thousands of local, small business – small businesses, entrepreneurs, and restauranteurs, who have been suffering immensely with COVID. Our efforts to support local tenants in our centers were resoundingly appreciated as nearly 95% of our local tenants reopened their stores and additional $165 million of the reduction was due to lower minimum rents and reimbursements. Sales-based and short-term leasing due to the – and ancillary property revenues as a reduction from COVID, as well as lease terminations from our bankrupt retailers, and as I mentioned to you before lower sales volume, due to a lingering COVID impact. These decreases were partially offset by $100 million of our cost reduction initiatives. Now, operating metrics, Mall and Premium outlet occupancy at third quarter was 91.4% down 150 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. All of that is essentially a function of tenant bankruptcies, which caused 120 basis-point reduction. Our average base rent was $56.13, up 2.9% year-over-year and we are pleased to report shopper traffic and total sales volume continue to improve with each sequential month and throughout the third quarter, quarter-over-quarter sales that’s Q3 of 2019 compared to Q3 of 2020 were down 10% leasing spreads decline for the trailing 12 months, primarily due to the mix of deals from the prior year period that had fallen out of the rent spread calculation. The leasing environment is improving. In the third quarter, we signed 600 leases for nearly two million square feet, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. We are pleased to see a continued long interest, for spaces across our differentiated portfolio. Demand for space in our premium outlet portfolio has been really strong with the space that has become available as a result of recent tenant bankruptcies. We are signing deals with the best new and exciting brands who want access to our highly productive outlets and an ode to Rick who’s not here, but listening uncertain, we are executing both long-term and pop-up deals with leading brands, including names like Prada, Ferrari, Allbirds and UGG, just to name a few and many, many more. During the quarter, we also resumed construction on the redevelopment of the Macy’s Men’s Store at Stanford Shopping Center with a RH mansion and we started construction of a former Bloomingdale store for the falls and at The Shops at Mission Viejo. Our net – the good news with this diligent focus on capital spend, all approved projects right now through 2020, our net cash funding is $140 million. Now, let me turn to brand and retail investments Spark, as you know, is our 50/50 joint venture with Authentic Brands Group, acquired Brooks and Lucky Brand’s out of bankruptcies. Both are storied and widely recognized brands with combined global sales of over $1.5 billion. We acquire companies cheaply and we believe we can grow the EBITDA and achieve a significant return on our investment. Both brands have been integrated into the Spark platform, and we’re very pleased with the progress we’ve made in such a short period of time. We recently partnered with Brookfield as you know and are in contract to acquire the operations, intellectual property and certain real estate of the J.C. Penney Company in a going concern transaction under Section 363 of the bankruptcy code. We believe in the Penney’s brand, the company did over $9 billion in sales pre-COVID. We believe, we can return the company to increasing sales and grow the EBITDA. The company has a loyal core diverse and inclusive cost base concentrated in a moderate to higher aspirational category. This customer is important to the community as is J.C. Penney and to us, and we expect we will continue to grow this customer over time, and we’re extremely proud to serve the community in that capacity. We believe that with us in Brookfield, bringing focus the passion, ownership, enhanced financial discipline to the operations, we’ll have the opportunity to earn a significant return on our investment. And as part of that, we also anticipate our good partner; Authentic Brands Group will become an investor in the buying group. And as importantly, we’re very pleased to say for 60,000 jobs in our country, we continue to do our part to support the local community in our efforts. now, balance sheet; at the end of the third quarter, our total liquidity was more than $9.7 billion consisting of $8.2 billion of available credit facility, borrowing capacity $1.5 billion, for a total of $9.7 billion. And this is, as a reminder, net of $623 million of quarter-end commercial paper outstanding. We’ve been active in the secure debt markets and have addressed all of our remaining loan maturities for the year, including a refinancing of the mills at Jersey Gardens through a single asset CMBS securitization, which has been priced and scheduled to fund next week. Our debt covenants have – are well above required levels, well above it with significant headroom and our balance sheet, financial flexibility, our distinct advantages in our retail real estate industry that cannot and I’m sure are not overlooked and the dividends we paid a common stock dividend of $1.30 in cash. And then finally, before we open it up to any questions, I again want to thank my Simon colleagues for their continued result in running our business under often trying circumstances, the environment that has been constantly changing. We withstood COVID. We have withstood government shutdowns. We have withstood lack of federal and state health, especially in real estate taxes. We have withstood fires in Northern California, hurricanes in Louisiana and elsewhere, and civil unrest and we’re pleased with the cash flow we’re generating and I want to thank my colleagues for busting their hump and things are looking up. We’re ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from bank of America. Your question, please.\nCraig Schmidt: Great, thank you. I guess, given the acceleration of COVID cases and the possibility of future mandated closings, I wonder if you’re seeing greater consistency concerning store opening orders or store closing orders from state and local governments, particularly with the regards to the demands made on standalone retailers versus mall operated properties?\nDavid Simon: Well, the only situation that we have right now is in El Paso, where an enclosed mall is been asked to essentially shut down, that is of recent, that happened over the weekend. Again, I think enclosed malls are being treated unfairly and inconsistently, but we deal with what we deal with right now. That’s the only one Craig, we’re hopeful that that will reopen. And listen, I think the consumer obviously is cautious. Our quarter-over-quarter sales decrease is only 10%. So, the consumer is starting to come back. They’re wearing masks and with all our protocols, we’re – we’re hopeful that – that trend will continue, but there’s certainly no guarantees. And as far as predicting the government and state and local actions, I mean obviously, the level of inconsistency, it’s been very frustrating. It’s been state-by-state, city-by-city, county-by-county. It is a testament and often on look – often overlook that enable to deal with this as well as we have, and we’ve done it, when I’ve asked people to take pay cuts, and they’ve done it. They’ve shown up to work every day. You’ve seen the collection – the improvement in collections. I think we’re making basically all the right moves and – but we can only deal with what we can deal with. I have no – I don’t know if further restrictions will be in order, we have yet to see any evidence that our environment spreads anything. obviously, the outlets and outdoor centers are doing better. But as you know, we have 50% of our portfolio NOI dedicated to that. That’s kind of why I think you see our performance the way it is, and the one line item that’s up, if you looked at our financials, is real estate taxes, when are local jurisdictions going to start giving relief to retail real estate taxes, compared to distribution warehouses and the like. It’s completely opposite. We do more for the communities than other property types and I am hopeful that at one point in the near future that that they – these communities will recognize it.\nCraig Schmidt: Great. And then just as a follow-up, we’ve noticed the store closing cadence has slowed since Labor Day. I’m wondering if the occupancy number in 3Q 2020 could be the trough, or do you still expect maybe some lower occupancy in first quarter 2021?\nDavid Simon: Well, I think it’ll – that’ll be a function of whether we have further bankruptcies or not, Craig. I think based on what it is, we should be fine, but I mean, it is possible that we’ll have further bankruptcies and we’ll have to – when that happens, obviously, we’ll deal with that. But there’s certainly some bankruptcies that are potential out there in the next few months.\nCraig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nRich Hill: Hey, good evening, David. Thanks for taking my question. first of all, thank you very much for the transparency on the bridge to rent collections. I think that’s top-notch and best-in-class. So, thank you for doing it. I want to ask a strategy question and maybe, think about your portfolio. One of the things I think is misunderstood about Simon is that you’re not – you own a diversified portfolio of retail real estate across property types in the quality spectrum. So, I’m curious as you think about your portfolio on the other side of COVID-19, or do you like, are you comfortable with having, call it 46% to 49% of your total NOI coming from malls? Do you like – do you want less, do you want more outlets? Do you want more international? I’m just really curious about how you think about your portfolio, maybe over the next decade.\nDavid Simon: Listen, I think the – we’re a strong believer in the outlet business, as you know and especially, with retailers and brands moving more and more toward direct to consumer. And so I think that plays well into that and obviously, the outdoor environment continues to be an advantage certainly with the COVID [indiscernible] much part of our lives. So, I like where we are. I think, over time our portfolio, non-core assets will be shed, usually those don’t have a material impact on our NOI or cash flow. And so I kind of like where we are – we’ll probably shed some more properties. I think international is intriguing now. There’s value that we’ve added, the outlet business there that we have is very good. The outlet business in Asia is strong. So, we’re going to want to grow that, but I feel kind of like the diversity by region, by product type and by – certainly, by domestic versus international. So, our international results were pretty good. They were down though; we had some new properties open up and some expansion. So, it’s hard to see that, but the core number was down a little bit, but they came back pretty strong. Obviously, there’s a big wave going on now in Europe. So, they’re starting some more restrictions, but I think the direct to consumer from the brands is really important and I think that plays well in the outlet business. by the way, it’s helping shop premium outlets. It’s been an hour and a half with my partners, both at Rue La La, Gilt and the kinetic folks going through a [indiscernible] that want to be hooked up. So, this vision that we had is actually going to come to fruition, I hope, knock on wood. So, I like where we are. But we’re always looking at quality real estate and I look at the quality more – quality is more important than potentially, the property type and I think that’s the big focus and there’s going to be obsolescent retail real estate. And so I think owning the best of the best is going to be a key to our success in the future.\nRich Hill: Yes. That’s really helpful, David. And the reason I was asking the question is just – it just seems to me that on this other COVID-19 world, whatever it is, that the retailer itself is probably, like you, agnostic, of the type and it’s just looking for the best quality. So, I’m curious is that beginning to resonate with retailers, as you think about – as they think about their footprint and how Simon Property Group can help fulfill those footprints, or is it still too early?\nDavid Simon: No, no, no, absolutely. And I would say that trend is happened completely. I mean we – in the mall – the mall is always competed with the guy across the streets for the retailers that competition still exists. It’s certainly only going to be exacerbated by what’s happened over the last six, seven, eight months and you’ve got to own quality, and it’s somewhat – today, it’s somewhat irrelevant whether it’s this kind of asset or that it’s really, doesn’t have critical mass. Is it well located? Does it serve the customer the way they want to be served?\nRich Hill: Got it. Thanks, David. Look forward to chatting more.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. your question, please.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good evening. Good evening out there and handy. How’s that David?\nDavid Simon: We’re out – we’re definitely out here, man. Okay.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Well look, your center of the biotech and health world. So, we appreciate everything that the biotechs are doing.\nDavid Simon: Because when Lilly gets their vaccine, I hope, my team is first in line, just because we’re there across the street from us. Okay. So, we’ll see.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Excellent, excellent. So, two questions; first again, appreciate the breakout and actually, this provides clarity, so that people can see the collections on a net basis, or if you want to do collections on a gross basis, it’s helpful. You’d mentioned the abatements were basically expensed in the period granted. So, on a go-forward basis, as we think about fourth quarter and the ramp up, does this mean that, we should see fourth quarter earnings jumped by $200 million, or how should we think about the impact of the deferrals and the impact of the abatements on a go-forward, so that we can think about the progression of Simon. I’m not asking for guidance, but I’m just trying to get a ramp of how much kind of…\nDavid Simon: You’re asking for guidance cleverly. But I – listen, I would, everything is very still up in the air and obviously, we had – the worlds had this positive news today about the vaccine, but the fact is COVID is spiking. So, we have to be very serious that I would hope Alex. I mean, the big issue, the big thing that we’ve confronted aggressively in Q2 and Q3, and the way I look at it, frankly, there’s almost put those two quarters together, because you’re right in a – we took the P&L hit when we granted the abatement and that’s the right way to look at it, but I would think that the vast majority of any abatements are behind us. That’s though to be clear, that’s not to say that if there’s an appropriate trade with a retailer that’s a win-win for us, that we won’t do more. And what does that really mean? it’s new deals lease extent, it’s the normal stuff to do. But I would literally hope that the worst is behind us. But listen, I don’t know what the new COVID cases today was. I was a little busy, but I’m sure it’s well over 100,000. And I can’t guarantee that, but I would say between the credit provisions and the bankruptcies. I’m sorry – the credit provisions, including the bankruptcies are kind of all melded in that number and the abatements that we went out of our way to do, we weren’t legally required to do, but we did for people that were; one, on the local front, very sensitive to their plight; and two, there was a decent trade for us and the retailer, and we want them to prosper, frankly. I would hope that the vast majority of those two numbers, credit loss permissions, as well as abatements are behind us.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. But David, as you said earlier, the abatements were largely your local tenants. So, they’ve either made it or they haven’t. So…\nDavid Simon: I said that majority of it, we did grant abatements to others. So, there’s other abatements that have been in there. I mean – but that, again, that’s a – it’s a pretty big number in terms of that we didn’t have to do. And like I said, I hope that it’s behind us. We’ll have more in the Q4, but what we’re projecting is a lot lower than what we’ve had in Q2 and Q3 together.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. So, correct, so basically, you’ve taken the hard approach with both for all of the abatements in 2Q and 3Q. So hopefully, going forward is less. Okay. I got it. The second question, David is on the retailer front. Brooks Brothers, Lucky Brand, you did Aeropostale, Now you’re going to do J.C. Penney. You highlighted the sales; you highlighted this customer base, that’s loyal to the brand. What are – I mean, what are the elements without giving away totally the secret sauce? What are the elements that give you confidence when you look at trouble retailers and bankrupt ones, hey, what the core shopper for this brand is still there, despite that the retailers had trouble and is in bankruptcy, we feel that the core shopper is substantially still in place that we’ve – that we can recover. Because it’s certainly not just buying something cheap enough, anything can be cheap. there’s got to be something tangible that makes you feel like you can get these customers to really come back and do it in a profitable way. So, what is it that gives you that confidence?\nDavid Simon: Well first of all, we’re – we do, don’t underestimating buying things cheap. Okay, Alex. So, that’s always, it’s always good to do that regardless. Listen, I just think based on the sales that we’re seeing from the brands, we do a lot of brand research and then we attacked the problems with the profitability, given I won’t name names, but Brooks brothers is a great example. It’s got a great following. It had the strangest real estate footprint. They were – they had single stores that were paying $3 million a year in rent. I won’t name names and the ability to reject those leases and create profitability there, get out of bad stores, reduce the overhead and then do all this special marketing and with ABG has been a winning formula. In addition to that, we source it better and since we have this platform, where we can leverage our base off of, it’s just like – it’s been a very profitable thing. I will tell you one day spark will be worth. I mean, this isn’t my style, but it’s going to be worth, we’re going to make a plus on that investment without question. And it’s just – we know the brands, we do a lot of research. ABG has been a very good partner. They know how to blow out the license aspect of it, which we’re a partner in. We get out of bad stores. We buy the inventory at a discount. We right-size the overhead and we’re just – and with better business judgment and lo and behold, you suddenly have a business that’s got positive – significant positive EBITDA and you haven’t paid much for it that and I think when you put it all together, we’ll have something that’ll have great positive EBITDA and we’ll end up making $1 billion plus out of it.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Whether we look forward to you thinks…\nDavid Simon: Well, my partner thinks a lot more, but I’ll give you that number.\nAlexander Goldfarb: We look forward to the exit and seeing that billion dollars crystallized.\nDavid Simon: I mean, yes. I don’t – it’s been a good, it’s been a great investment, so why – I don’t know that we’ll exit anytime soon.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi. Maybe, just following up on Alex’s question more on the near to medium-term then. So, you’ve mentioned that your investments in the retailers have been at inexpensive prices allowing you to earn a significant return in terms of how this ends up impacting Simon’s own earnings in the near to medium-term. Do you expect the contribution to be meaningful itself? And if so, like by how much, and when, or is it that the investments generally support Simon’s core business, or I guess both?\nDavid Simon: Well, I think it’s the above. It will be profitable. We have that separate line item in our 8-K, what page is that?\nCaitlin Burrows: 17?\nDavid Simon: It’s a little, the only thing, Caitlin, it is a little – obviously, it’s more volatile than the rent aspect of our business. But you’ll – because it’s getting a little bit bigger, not materially bigger, but a little bigger, we decided to outline that separately. So, you can look at it as a standalone on its own. And then obviously, don’t forget, they do pay us contracted rent to – Spark is a rent payer to the Simon Property Group and it’s a property. So, we get the added benefit of the cash flow from running the business operate and then obviously, we get the added benefit of the rent, that’s collected from the entity with the stores that we have.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. And then maybe, on the dividends, I know it’s up to the board, but given the $1.30 per share dividend for 3Q, the historical dividend rate, current FFO and cash flow, what metrics or drivers will be most important in establishing the 4Q dividend and that of future quarters?\nDavid Simon: Well listen, I think, I think we still are very, very cautious in the sense of the dividend, just with respect to COVID. So, once we, I mean, I feel like at least that the worst is behind us, but we don’t know for sure. So, I think we’ll continue to be conservative in that. Obviously, you see our cap spend a way down a new development or redevelopment, that may pick up a little bit next year. So, we’ll balance that obviously, we got to deal with our taxable income as well, but I can’t give you a real through run rate yet and I think we’ll be in a better position in 2021 to explain that when we do our earnings guidance, which we will reinstate in our earnings call, I mean, we have a pretty good idea what we expect from next year. But we’d like to go ahead and finish the year as well, given all the volatility out there, but we’re confident of dividend and the cash paying aspects of it and the cash flow generation from our company. And I think if you saw that in the Q3, a reasonably healthy pickup from Q2 and when we were really in the midst of trying to figure out COVID.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citi. your question, please.\nMichael Bilerman: Great, thank you. Good evening, David. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the leasing pipeline. You’ve talked about the leasing that you accomplished in the third quarter, that two million square feet and a very large pipeline that you’re working on. And I was wondering if you can provide us maybe with some a little bit more granularity about that pipeline, how much of it is new leasing for vacant space, new leasing for tenants that are going to be vacating [ph] and also potential renewal activity. And within that, maybe you can sort of just highlight the changing nature of maybe, the leases. I don’t know if there’s differences in term or TIs or anything, just to give us a little bit more flavor for what the current environment is like.\nDavid Simon: Well again, that’s, I’m not going to get into the – as much as you want. I’m not going to – that’s not really the purpose of the call to go through the granularity of all the leases. But I would say generally, the lease terms have not changed. TAs have not really increased and we’re seeing more box activity. There’s a number of retailers that want to grow their footprint in the outlet business, a number of the better and the higher brands. We’re also seeing that the Parkers of the world wanting to grow their footprint and the internet oriented companies then you see companies like American Eagle and others that are growing their footprint. There’s a well-known retailer that has their kind of casual wear business that’s growing their footprint significantly. I think we’ve got 20 deals in the works for them. So, it’s across the board and I would say, we’re mostly replacing spaces that we got back from bankruptcies, leases that have terminated and the renewals are – a lot of the renewals we’re doing now, we’re doing as part of our COVID initiation. So to the extent that we did a deal in abatement, we may have addressed 2020 and 2021 renewals, and it’s a judgement retailer by retailer and it’s working it, I mean, obviously the nations aren’t easy, because I mean, COVID has made them nervous and obviously, there’s a lot of excess capacity in our retail real estate industry. But I think we’ll hold our own and I – and look, I think the cash flow, we’ll see improvements for cash flow next year. And again, – and that will be a combination of lease renewals, new business, better sales, we lost a lot of income just, because we were shut down with all of our Simon brand venture income, all the stuff that’s traffic-driven. So, I think we’ll make a rebound along all those lines. And no, we’re not doing just percentage rent deals. The outlet business has had historically; some of the lead anchors have had percent rent deals only. to the extent that we do it, we have a floor in there and a clearly defined definition of sales, but it’s all over the board, but it’s – I guess, what we’re trying to convey to you, Michael, is that we are open and doing your business, and that’s support, and I think we’ll have a better, we’ll get more granular next quarter, but we’re open to doing new business and the retailers are – sure there are a number of closing stores. There are a number of bankruptcies, but the ones that are out there are looking to grow their footprint.\nMichael Bilerman: That’s helpful color. And then just as a follow-up on capital deployment obviously, the big focus of yours has been a lot of these innovative transactions buying some brand named retailers, but you also talked on the call in response to a previous question about buying high-quality real estate and I wanted to better understand what sort of opportunities may be out there, either buying from your joint venture partners, which may want to reduce their retail, or maybe, they don’t and they want to go further in, but you also have a transaction that you’re having over, that’s very high-quality real estate. So, I’m just trying to understand how all of this fits together.\nDavid Simon: Well, Michael, again, I respect you immensely and we really – I’m not going to not going to get into the tailwind situation; obviously, you saw our litigation expense with it. But we’re not out of – I’d say if there is quality real estate, we’re going to look at it and much like – and it, but there’s got to be bargains that can be had. And so we’ll see what that transpires, but nothing really, I want to – and also want to be, because we’ve been asked this. I mean, we’re not between the penney and closing of Brooks and lucky. There’s really nothing else on the spark or the retail front that we see right now clearly, for the rest of the year. So that business is all about integrating Brooks and lucky into spark. And then obviously, we have a tremendous amount of work to do partner, Brookfield and the management team at penney to sustain their turnaround. And so we’ve – our plate is full in that category. There won’t be anything going on, on that front. And we’re really – right now, we haven’t really looked at anything external, because obviously, we got our hands full, but it is a testament to the company that, we can do penney, we can do our debt deal. We can shut down our properties, open them up deal with we’ve done 14,000 lease amendments. right, Brian?\nBrian McDade: Yes.\nDavid Simon: we’ve collected rent, that hasn’t been easy. Okay. It’s not like they just suddenly said, okay, I’m going to send you a rent check that it hadn’t been that easy. So, I mean, we’ve been busy, obviously, we’ve done a lot of refinancings on the secured front. We’ve been doing just about – there we shut down the pipeline in terms of redevelopment. development brought it back up to some extent. So, I mean, we are – we got our hands full, I think we’ve been executing unbelievably with all the – all of the things that have been thrown at us. So, we’re really not looking externally at this moment.\nMichael Bilerman: It sounds like Brian has less hair now.\nDavid Simon: he – by the way, I think between Tom and Brian and Adam here, I’m the only one with hair; however, depending on your vantage point, you may accuse me of being in the thoughts. So, okay. Let’s move on. Let’s move on.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche bank. Your question, please.\nDerek Johnston: Hi everyone. Good evening. Allied Esports, PARM, pinstripes, Soho House, and Nobu Hotels, how do you guys view these earlier pre-COVID investments and/or partnerships, and do you still believe them to be a viable path forward posting them and as we emerge from the pandemic or in effect, has the merchandising approach actually changed?\nDavid Simon: No. Look, obviously we wish – good question, and we obviously wish that the pandemic hasn’t – didn’t hit us, but – and hit those businesses, but Soho has a great brand and ultimately, will be stronger and gets everything back online. So, the reality is very comfortable and they actually brought in some new capitals at the price that we did a couple of months ago, I think. So, Soho is great. PARM, we actually have Woodbury and Burlington opening next year, I think Woodbury’s opening in January and Burlington in the spring, and my son and I and if Jeff Rosnick’s [ph] listening, which I doubt he is, but we had a great carried out dinner at PARM. So, I’d encourage everybody to go eat there, it was really good, chicken PARM dinner. I think it’s a great brand; lifetime will be the survivor in that industry. I have all the confidence in the world, a great CEO, entrepreneur, great brand, great customer base. So, I think by and large, we feel like we’re a pretty good spot. I don’t think – I think what’s changed there, because I don’t think we’ll do the little venture deals the way we did, even though we’ve had some recent pops in those, meaning we got some, we’re going to – we’re selling our interest in the MDs at a profit and we’ve – there’s some new capital that’s come into some of those businesses at prices higher than what came in. but I don’t think we’ll do those little deals anymore. I think we’ve got too much too much to say grace over. But I think all of that we’ve invested in, we feel generally pretty good though. They’ve all frankly – they’re all fit the flywheel that we were creating. We just didn’t anticipate, the black swans of black swans, and – but all of those companies are alive and I expect them to come out of it, okay.\nDerek Johnston: Okay, great. And sticking on some larger brands, are some of the brands you recently made lifeline investments? I know they were mentioned briefly lucky, Brooks Brothers, Forever 21. Will any merchandising additions and perhaps with Authentic drive a focused remerchandising mix at J. C. Penney and hopes to accelerate sales, is that on the table?\nDavid Simon: Great insight and the answer is absolutely. So that’s one of the interesting things that we found is, we do think that the combination of our relationships with a direct-to-consumer crowd, as well as all the brands that either we control or that ABG does, that those products will find a home in Penney. And there’s a lot of intense discussions going on. So, we would expect to enhance the Penney vendor matrix with the brands that ABG controls as well as ours. So very, very astute and the answer is without question.\nDerek Johnston: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\nMike Mueller: Thanks. Can you tell us what the pro rata uncollectable reserve is that’s in minimum rent for the quarter?\nDavid Simon: The pro-rata minimum rent in our joint ventures? Not sure.\nMike Mueller: No. The pro rata, the uncollectable reserve, what it is our pro rata basis in the quarter?\nDavid Simon: We’re really doing this on a gross basis, because that’s how we look at it.\nMike Mueller: Okay. And can you talk about how similar or different traffic and sales are at the outlets versus the malls?\nDavid Simon: The outlets are performing, I don’t want to necessarily get into the specifics, but the outlets are performing better. What we’ve seen across the board though, whether it’s an outlet or an enclosed, if it does cater to tourism, those are ones that are continued to be – continued to underperform our average. So, whether it’s in Orlando, enclosed or outlet, in Orlando, we have an enclosed mall there, we have the outlet centers that market both are underperforming with because of the lack of tourism and obviously, Universal and Disney operating at much less than full capacity.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum from Compass Point. Your question, please.\nFloris van Dijkum: Thanks for taking my question, David.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nFloris van Dijkum: I had a question on Authentic Brands; you suggested they’re going to step into the J. C. Penney deal with Brookfield and yourself. Would they be an equal partner or – and what pricing would they step in at the same price you guys bought?\nDavid Simon: Yes. the same price they will not be an equal partner, but they’ll put in – we’ll do see in our investment both us and Brookfield based upon the contribution they make.\nFloris van Dijkum: Great. And so how do you look at Authentic Brands, particularly, I mean, you talked a little bit about having their brands – selling their brands exclusively through the J.C. Penney outlets and increasing the J.C. Penney private sales it sounds like?\nDavid Simon: Well, I didn’t say that’s exclusive, but they have a – they control a number of brands, like Juicy Couture as an example. And they’re – Juicy Couture is not in J.C. Penney. And so we’re going through the vendor matrix now, to eventually, I think Penney will end up distributing those kinds of brands that ABG controls, J.C. Penney department store. So, it’ll be a win-win for everybody.\nFloris van Dijkum: Okay. Maybe, my follow-up question with some of those brands as well, particularly as it relates to the outlet business. So, you mentioned your outlet business is doing quite well; obviously they’re open air. So, they don’t have quite the same restrictions. Maybe, if you can talk a little bit about how you think the outlet business could – is it still going to be as reliant on apparel going forward and how does Authentic Brands fit in and is Authentic Brands a tenant right now, or a large tenant in your outlet business and could they be in the future?\nDavid Simon: Authentic Brands is not really, I mean, they had some brands that we don’t – we’re not invested in, but they do have outlet stores now. They don’t necessarily operate those stores, but take an example, Volcom, where they’re a partner with Volcom. We don’t – we’re not Simon Property is not investor in that, but they own the IP and they own part of the operations. But it’s really; Volcom is used to be owned by Kering Group and then sold it. But they operate Volcom itself, operates outlet stores in our portfolio. So, they are not an operator of “stores.” ABG, but they do have – they do own intellectual property of certain brands that do operate stores in our outlets and that will continue, but that’s been that way for years. So again, but we’re not involved in everything that ABG does, like Joe and others. I mean, I do think a number of their brands do have store potential. And they’ll either operate or find an operator operate those stores. And what was your other question? I’m sorry. I forgot it.\nFloris van Dijkum: Yes. The other question David was in regards to the apparel, the severance of apparel and – do you see that changing overtime?\nDavid Simon: Look I think, generally, we’re seeing a lot more interest in home furnishings and the life we’re doing a lot more deals in the outlet sector with that – without naming names, but all the home furnishing and furniture folks. And so I think as you’ve seen that shift generally speaking, I think we’re seeing a lot of that pickup in the outlet business as well.\nFloris van Dijkum: Those typically would have the lower sales. Is that a concern for you, or do you think it’s all about driving traffic at the center?\nDavid Simon: I think it’s all about driving the traffic. I have no concern about that at all. And usually, those are a little big boxes, so that the rent that’s leaving versus, what I’d rather have a dress barn or an RH. okay. That’s right. So, would I rather have – so that it says kind of trade-offs that I think are available to us. I think the mix actually will significantly impact – improve, because we’re going to end up reclaiming some of the older less relevant brands for some of the good or the better brands.\nFloris van Dijkum: Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nLinda Tsai: Hi. Your overall leverage is much better than your peers, but net debt to NOI is a term understandably since 2019. What sort of leverage do you want to target and how would you expect this to trend in 2021?\nDavid Simon: Well, our leverage should – debt-to-EBTIDA should decrease, right. So, we’re generating cash. Our development spend is modest and the excess cash other than dividend will ultimately, go to reduce our indebtedness, so – and we’re also sell – we’ll sell assets. So, we’re still looking to essentially maintain our balance sheet. I mean, that’s an advantage that we’ve worked very hard to achieve, hasn’t been easy and I would not – we’re not going to blow that. Brian, you want to add anything?\nBrian McDade: No. We don’t naturally come down next year, Linda, just given the recoup of NOI relative year-over-year. So, you will see us come back down to a more normalistic or a level consistent with prior periods is our expectation.\nLinda Tsai : Thanks. And then in terms of the non-core assets that will be shed, albeit not a material impact, over what timeframe would this happen? Like, would you wait for some stabilization in NOI?\nDavid Simon: Well, I just think it’s going to, we’re – in fact, we’re – we’ve got an asset now we’re about the market. I mean, we’re going to try and do it. I mean, we’ll see, it’s not – this isn’t, this is not earth-shattering big projects, but there’s – respect to shed, some non-core assets that won’t have a – not going to have a material impact, but just it’ll help us run the company better, because we won’t have to focus on it.\nLinda Tsai : Thanks. And then just one last one, in terms of the 85% collections in 3Q, do you think this will stay neutral in the neutral territory in your term, or would you expect bigger improvements?\nDavid Simon: Well, I would expect it to be hopefully, better in Q4. But we’re just – we’re similar in October and – but obviously, I would hope that we – as I mentioned to you before we still got some bigger accounts that we have not made a lot of progress with. I’m hopeful that something positive will happen there. So, once that happens, then it’ll jump up.\nLinda Tsai : Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Your question, please.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So David, I was hoping you could talk a bit more about the environment for larger anchor box space; specifically, I’m curious where it’s coming from and how the spreads compared to the rest of you overall leasing? And now, are you able to run any commentary at all whether you’ve leased any of that space to Amazon? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Yes. Believe it or not, there are still deals to be done. I mean, we’re talking to a department store to take a couple of boxes over, there’s not going to be 30 to 40 deals, but there’ll be 15 and I think our retail community is generally, the healthier companies are looking towards the future and believe in the – in having the right footprint and we’re going to shrink the bad stores, but I think they’re going to look at new opportunities. It’s not going to – we still believe in the mixed use effort that we’re undertaking. Obviously, we don’t have to be in a rush to do it. And we’re not going to build, we’re looking at plans that maybe, had a 60,00, 70,000, a 100,000 square feet of new retail, small shop space, or you’re not going to program that, but we’ll make it up with boxes and the lower investment, and still manage the appropriate returns. So, there’s still opportunity to release the space. Fact of the matter is we still don’t own a lot of it that we want, but we’re not going to pay appropriate prices for it and there’s certainly a gap between the bid and the ask. We’re really not bidding, and they’re really not asking, but if we were to bid and they were to ask, it would be a big gap, but good real estate will survive. But it’s going to take capital, great operator and it’s not going to be for the faint of heart and – but it’s going to be reprogrammed. So, just something jumps out like a Brea, we’ll probably have, we always had two anchors, but we had this is the old Sears store that we control. We’ll still do the two anchors there. But we probably programmed a 100,000 square feet of restaurants, small shops, and we’re not going to do it. We’ll probably do 2030, but the costs will go down and we still think we’ll have the appropriate returns on investment. So, there’s still stuff to do to improve our portfolio and there’s still some decent demand on just box for box.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it, got it. That’s helpful. Are you able or willing to say if any of that leasing has been with Amazon specifically?\nDavid Simon: I didn’t hear you well. Could you repeat it, please?\nHaendel St. Juste: Apologies. I was curious if you’re able or willing to share any of that leasing has been specifically with Amazon.\nDavid Simon: There – we have no signed deal with Amazon. No.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. And a follow-up on the leasing spreads in the quarter down another 400 basis sequentially minus 4% second quarter in a row. Was there anything having a disproportionate in that calculation during the quarter, when do you think that trough and I guess more broadly, how importantly, do you think having a vaccine effectively at hand will be during the ongoing lease negotiations and the near-term trajectory of leases as we build back to pre-COVID cash flow? Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Yes. I think the spread is really mixed, because we had some boxes that rolled out last year compared to this year. So, I wouldn’t – that’s a number I wouldn’t jump up and down whether it’s really good or not so good as in this quarter, it’s really a mix issue. Because we had a lot of box activity last year that we rolled out and this year, it’s 12 months later. So, it’s really more of a mixed issue and you could see that in our base rents increasing, which is probably a little more important stat.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay.\nDavid Simon: Okay.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone from Green Street. Your question, please.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good evening. I have a few questions related to co-tenancy clauses, when an anchor is tenant temporarily closed, like the movie theaters today, could that trigger a co-tenancy cause at your center? And then also more broadly, just can you help us understand what impact co-tenancy clauses have had on financials this year, if any?\nDavid Simon: Very little Vince, this year and we don’t expect it to be meaningful or immaterial, let me restate it and say it better. It’ll be in material next year.\nVince Tibone: Yes. Okay. And then on this temporary point, like if the theater is temporary closed, is that potentially an issue on that front or what – I know it’s hard to obtain much.\nDavid Simon: No, no. it’s a more appropriate question. I think, of all of the theater closures at one deal and I can’t remember which one that it may affect a co-tenancy at one of the mills for a few of the boxes. It’s essentially immaterial.\nVince Tibone: Okay. Thank you for that. And then I’ll let you control J.C. Penney, and you’re clearly bullish on the future there, but how are you thinking about the pace of potential story captured there some of your better centers and even in order to pursue redevelopment opportunities in the next few years?\nDavid Simon: Well, it hasn’t closed. And in fact there was a hearing today, which I did not hear. I did not hear what happened, but to approve our – it’s still not done yet. So, it hasn’t closed assuming it gets approved. It’ll be sometime later in the month. Look, it’s complicated way. It’s split up between what the operating company owns in the real estate and what the POSCO loans. We have rights. We, being Simon, have rights to recapture certain assets. So, does Brookfield, but I think we’re going to be patient about it, because I think the most important thing right now is just to get it stabilized and positioned for the future, but eventually, there are certainly some stores that probably are not maybe, properly positioned with us, where we do want to recapture the space. And I think that’s an opportunity, but you’re not under – we don’t feel the pressure to do that anytime soon. But that’ll be next year’s business. And then when that happens, I get to negotiate, I guess I don’t really know what to do. Maybe risk, maybe our guys, maybe Brookfield. I’m not really sure how it works, but we will, we will, we will appropriately do it fairly with all the constituencies involved.\nVince Tibone: Okay. Thank you for that.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, thanks for the time. I was just wondering how discussions are going with grocers given how strongly they performed in kind of their space to date with the COVID and how that’s transpired. Have you seen traction in the various different format or kind of what is, are they most attracted to from the different types of assets that Simon owns and controls?\nDavid Simon: It’s still reopened one in a specialty grocer in Boca. Just recently, that’s doing very well. We just made a deal that I don’t know that I can announce it that we just signed the lease this week to replace fairway, the fairway market grocer in Nanuet with a great grocer. So, there are – what we’re really focused on is the specialty grocers as opposed to the big mammoth ones and I think there’ll be a handful of deals. It’s not going to be 50, but I think it will be over the next couple of years. There’s no way we can’t get 10 to 20 to specialty ones, like the one we did a bulk is great. It’s sort of an end cap of kind of the lifestyle center that we did it Boca and high-end grocer in, come in, get your prepared foods, quality. You still have the Italy’s of the world that are out there looking to do a business. I had a comment with them recently, that’s the same kind of category, prepared foods, specialty grocer, not necessarily a place; I guess you could pick up milk, but, more of prepared foods, dining or get your special consumable. So, I do think that’ll continue to grow.\nJuan Sanabria: Great. And a follow-up from me. You kind of talked about acquiring some assets, high quality retail. Have you looked at, or any interest in some of the Westfield centers given what they’re trying to do at the corporate level?\nDavid Simon: No. I mean, they’re doing what they’re doing, so nothing there to report.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Truist. Your question, please.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. You’ve provided a helpful bridge looking at the portfolio NOI from last year to this year? One of the biggest components of that was that $270 million you mentioned. And it’s a big number. I was just wondering if there’s any kind of breakdown you can provide on the call?\nDavid Simon: Well, it’s a combination, as I said, of abatements and credit provisions. The credit provisions are mostly bankruptcies. How is it split, it’s – I don’t know, 60/40 somewhere in that range. Is that – if that’s helpful to you, again, I don’t – I view this as kind of a one – this is not going to be routine, but it’s kind of a one-time between the COVID impact, so to speak between Q2 and Q3, but it’s split roughly between abatements and credit provisions, which are mostly bankruptcies and abatements, and maybe, it’s 60/40 in that range. Is that helpful?\nKi Bin Kim: It is. And are you incorporating tenants on the watch list that are not being corrupt or not near-term bankrupt?\nDavid Simon: Credit provisions include lots of things beyond prepetition rent or anything else associated with a bankruptcy.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And just given the news today about the vaccine from Pfizer, does that make any kind of impact in terms of your mentality when it comes to lease negotiations? I know it’s early, but just curious.\nDavid Simon: Not really. I mean, listen, I – before the news today, I mean, we were feeling better that we had dealt with a lot of crap in Q2 and Q3, and we’re here to – and we’re here and our cash flows dramatically up and our collections are up, and we’re getting our business back to normal. So, we were headed that way anyway. But obviously, it’s – just I mean, this situation, is it black swan times two or three and it’s been sad for all of us to have to see what’s happened to the country good solid businesses beforehand that we’ve had to deal with our employees, obviously, all the people, in fact, – just maybe, there’s a little more of what’s the trays of peppermint – what’s that?\nBrian McDade: Pep in the step.\nDavid Simon: Pep in the step, I just think it’s good news. Let’s hope we can – let’s hope we can get out and get done. But now, it’s not going to – it’s not going to affect us, because we’re mostly dealing with COVID-oriented shutdowns or impact of those shutdowns. And listen I hope it gives our client face more confidence and that that’s fine. That’s good. It should, it should. And hopefully, we’ll see some benefits from that into 2021 and beyond.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question edition of today’s program. I’d like to hand the program back to David Simon for any further remarks.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Thank you and thanks for staying late on a Monday night. be well.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "Good evening and thank you for joining us today. Our results this quarter reflect continued progress in tenant reopenings and rent collections. All of our U.S. retail properties are currently open with nearly 25,000 tenants across our portfolio open and operating, and welcoming shoppers to this year's extended holiday shopping season. Collections from our U.S. retail portfolio have continued to improve. As of November 6, we have collected 85% of third quarter net build rents. Second quarter collections are now 72% and including the deferred amounts in the calculation, the second quarter collection rate increases to 78%. The details of our collection percentages are clearly laid out in our press release issued this evening. While we've made significant progress in addressing collections, we still have some unresolved amounts with certain larger national tenants, who unfortunately are refusing to pay their contractual rent even though they are open and operating. Let me turn to our results. Third quarter reported FFO was $723 million or $2.05 per share. I am pleased with the solid profitability of the quarter and $600 million in cash flow we generated for the third quarter. Our domestic and international operations in the quarter, however, were negatively impacted by approximately $1.10 per diluted share primarily due to reduced lease income, including sales base rents or ancillary property revenues caused by the COVID-19 disruption partially offset by $0.23 per share from cost reduction initiatives or a net $0.87 per diluted share and then another $0.05 from our international operations as well. And the third quarter also includes our FFO $0.10 per share of lower straight line rent and $0.06 and the litigation expenses and $0.01 lower lease settlement income compared to Q3 of 2019. Now, like I did last quarter for Q2, let me walk through the components of the year-over-year change in the context of portfolio NOI presentation, which you can find on Page 17 supplement issued today and as a reminder, the following amounts are on a gross basis and are not at company share. Total portfolio NOI decreased from $1.5 billion in the third quarter of last year to $1.2 billion this year, a decrease of 22% or approximately $338 million. The year-over-year decline for the third quarter was primarily due to the following approximately $270 million in total from both domestic rent abatements and higher provisions for credit losses, primarily associated with retail bankruptcies. It is important to note we did not amortize any of the abatements granted. We recorded the abatement as negative lease income in the period, in which the abatement terms were agreed with the tenant. The majority of the abatements that were granted were to the thousands of local, small business – small businesses, entrepreneurs, and restauranteurs, who have been suffering immensely with COVID. Our efforts to support local tenants in our centers were resoundingly appreciated as nearly 95% of our local tenants reopened their stores and additional $165 million of the reduction was due to lower minimum rents and reimbursements. Sales-based and short-term leasing due to the – and ancillary property revenues as a reduction from COVID, as well as lease terminations from our bankrupt retailers, and as I mentioned to you before lower sales volume, due to a lingering COVID impact. These decreases were partially offset by $100 million of our cost reduction initiatives. Now, operating metrics, Mall and Premium outlet occupancy at third quarter was 91.4% down 150 basis points from the second quarter of 2020. All of that is essentially a function of tenant bankruptcies, which caused 120 basis-point reduction. Our average base rent was $56.13, up 2.9% year-over-year and we are pleased to report shopper traffic and total sales volume continue to improve with each sequential month and throughout the third quarter, quarter-over-quarter sales that's Q3 of 2019 compared to Q3 of 2020 were down 10% leasing spreads decline for the trailing 12 months, primarily due to the mix of deals from the prior year period that had fallen out of the rent spread calculation. The leasing environment is improving. In the third quarter, we signed 600 leases for nearly two million square feet, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. We are pleased to see a continued long interest, for spaces across our differentiated portfolio. Demand for space in our premium outlet portfolio has been really strong with the space that has become available as a result of recent tenant bankruptcies. We are signing deals with the best new and exciting brands who want access to our highly productive outlets and an ode to Rick who's not here, but listening uncertain, we are executing both long-term and pop-up deals with leading brands, including names like Prada, Ferrari, Allbirds and UGG, just to name a few and many, many more. During the quarter, we also resumed construction on the redevelopment of the Macy's Men's Store at Stanford Shopping Center with a RH mansion and we started construction of a former Bloomingdale store for the falls and at The Shops at Mission Viejo. Our net – the good news with this diligent focus on capital spend, all approved projects right now through 2020, our net cash funding is $140 million. Now, let me turn to brand and retail investments Spark, as you know, is our 50/50 joint venture with Authentic Brands Group, acquired Brooks and Lucky Brand's out of bankruptcies. Both are storied and widely recognized brands with combined global sales of over $1.5 billion. We acquire companies cheaply and we believe we can grow the EBITDA and achieve a significant return on our investment. Both brands have been integrated into the Spark platform, and we're very pleased with the progress we've made in such a short period of time. We recently partnered with Brookfield as you know and are in contract to acquire the operations, intellectual property and certain real estate of the J.C. Penney Company in a going concern transaction under Section 363 of the bankruptcy code. We believe in the Penney's brand, the company did over $9 billion in sales pre-COVID. We believe, we can return the company to increasing sales and grow the EBITDA. The company has a loyal core diverse and inclusive cost base concentrated in a moderate to higher aspirational category. This customer is important to the community as is J.C. Penney and to us, and we expect we will continue to grow this customer over time, and we're extremely proud to serve the community in that capacity. We believe that with us in Brookfield, bringing focus the passion, ownership, enhanced financial discipline to the operations, we'll have the opportunity to earn a significant return on our investment. And as part of that, we also anticipate our good partner; Authentic Brands Group will become an investor in the buying group. And as importantly, we're very pleased to say for 60,000 jobs in our country, we continue to do our part to support the local community in our efforts. now, balance sheet; at the end of the third quarter, our total liquidity was more than $9.7 billion consisting of $8.2 billion of available credit facility, borrowing capacity $1.5 billion, for a total of $9.7 billion. And this is, as a reminder, net of $623 million of quarter-end commercial paper outstanding. We've been active in the secure debt markets and have addressed all of our remaining loan maturities for the year, including a refinancing of the mills at Jersey Gardens through a single asset CMBS securitization, which has been priced and scheduled to fund next week. Our debt covenants have – are well above required levels, well above it with significant headroom and our balance sheet, financial flexibility, our distinct advantages in our retail real estate industry that cannot and I'm sure are not overlooked and the dividends we paid a common stock dividend of $1.30 in cash. And then finally, before we open it up to any questions, I again want to thank my Simon colleagues for their continued result in running our business under often trying circumstances, the environment that has been constantly changing. We withstood COVID. We have withstood government shutdowns. We have withstood lack of federal and state health, especially in real estate taxes. We have withstood fires in Northern California, hurricanes in Louisiana and elsewhere, and civil unrest and we're pleased with the cash flow we're generating and I want to thank my colleagues for busting their hump and things are looking up. We're ready for questions. Well, the only situation that we have right now is in El Paso, where an enclosed mall is been asked to essentially shut down, that is of recent, that happened over the weekend. Again, I think enclosed malls are being treated unfairly and inconsistently, but we deal with what we deal with right now. That's the only one Craig, we're hopeful that that will reopen. And listen, I think the consumer obviously is cautious. Our quarter-over-quarter sales decrease is only 10%. So, the consumer is starting to come back. They're wearing masks and with all our protocols, we're – we're hopeful that – that trend will continue, but there's certainly no guarantees. And as far as predicting the government and state and local actions, I mean obviously, the level of inconsistency, it's been very frustrating. It's been state-by-state, city-by-city, county-by-county. It is a testament and often on look – often overlook that enable to deal with this as well as we have, and we've done it, when I've asked people to take pay cuts, and they've done it. They've shown up to work every day. You've seen the collection – the improvement in collections. I think we're making basically all the right moves and – but we can only deal with what we can deal with. I have no – I don't know if further restrictions will be in order, we have yet to see any evidence that our environment spreads anything. obviously, the outlets and outdoor centers are doing better. But as you know, we have 50% of our portfolio NOI dedicated to that. That's kind of why I think you see our performance the way it is, and the one line item that's up, if you looked at our financials, is real estate taxes, when are local jurisdictions going to start giving relief to retail real estate taxes, compared to distribution warehouses and the like. It's completely opposite. We do more for the communities than other property types and I am hopeful that at one point in the near future that that they – these communities will recognize it. Well, I think it'll – that'll be a function of whether we have further bankruptcies or not, Craig. I think based on what it is, we should be fine, but I mean, it is possible that we'll have further bankruptcies and we'll have to – when that happens, obviously, we'll deal with that. But there's certainly some bankruptcies that are potential out there in the next few months. Sure. Listen, I think the – we're a strong believer in the outlet business, as you know and especially, with retailers and brands moving more and more toward direct to consumer. And so I think that plays well into that and obviously, the outdoor environment continues to be an advantage certainly with the COVID [indiscernible] much part of our lives. So, I like where we are. I think, over time our portfolio, non-core assets will be shed, usually those don't have a material impact on our NOI or cash flow. And so I kind of like where we are – we'll probably shed some more properties. I think international is intriguing now. There's value that we've added, the outlet business there that we have is very good. The outlet business in Asia is strong. So, we're going to want to grow that, but I feel kind of like the diversity by region, by product type and by – certainly, by domestic versus international. So, our international results were pretty good. They were down though; we had some new properties open up and some expansion. So, it's hard to see that, but the core number was down a little bit, but they came back pretty strong. Obviously, there's a big wave going on now in Europe. So, they're starting some more restrictions, but I think the direct to consumer from the brands is really important and I think that plays well in the outlet business. by the way, it's helping shop premium outlets. It's been an hour and a half with my partners, both at Rue La La, Gilt and the kinetic folks going through a [indiscernible] that want to be hooked up. So, this vision that we had is actually going to come to fruition, I hope, knock on wood. So, I like where we are. But we're always looking at quality real estate and I look at the quality more – quality is more important than potentially, the property type and I think that's the big focus and there's going to be obsolescent retail real estate. And so I think owning the best of the best is going to be a key to our success in the future. No, no, no, absolutely. And I would say that trend is happened completely. I mean we – in the mall – the mall is always competed with the guy across the streets for the retailers that competition still exists. It's certainly only going to be exacerbated by what's happened over the last six, seven, eight months and you've got to own quality, and it's somewhat – today, it's somewhat irrelevant whether it's this kind of asset or that it's really, doesn't have critical mass. Is it well located? Does it serve the customer the way they want to be served? Sure. We're out – we're definitely out here, man. Okay. Because when Lilly gets their vaccine, I hope, my team is first in line, just because we're there across the street from us. Okay. So, we'll see. You're asking for guidance cleverly. But I – listen, I would, everything is very still up in the air and obviously, we had – the worlds had this positive news today about the vaccine, but the fact is COVID is spiking. So, we have to be very serious that I would hope Alex. I mean, the big issue, the big thing that we've confronted aggressively in Q2 and Q3, and the way I look at it, frankly, there's almost put those two quarters together, because you're right in a – we took the P&L hit when we granted the abatement and that's the right way to look at it, but I would think that the vast majority of any abatements are behind us. That's though to be clear, that's not to say that if there's an appropriate trade with a retailer that's a win-win for us, that we won't do more. And what does that really mean? it's new deals lease extent, it's the normal stuff to do. But I would literally hope that the worst is behind us. But listen, I don't know what the new COVID cases today was. I was a little busy, but I'm sure it's well over 100,000. And I can't guarantee that, but I would say between the credit provisions and the bankruptcies. I'm sorry – the credit provisions, including the bankruptcies are kind of all melded in that number and the abatements that we went out of our way to do, we weren't legally required to do, but we did for people that were; one, on the local front, very sensitive to their plight; and two, there was a decent trade for us and the retailer, and we want them to prosper, frankly. I would hope that the vast majority of those two numbers, credit loss permissions, as well as abatements are behind us. I said that majority of it, we did grant abatements to others. So, there's other abatements that have been in there. I mean – but that, again, that's a – it's a pretty big number in terms of that we didn't have to do. And like I said, I hope that it's behind us. We'll have more in the Q4, but what we're projecting is a lot lower than what we've had in Q2 and Q3 together. Well first of all, we're – we do, don't underestimating buying things cheap. Okay, Alex. So, that's always, it's always good to do that regardless. Listen, I just think based on the sales that we're seeing from the brands, we do a lot of brand research and then we attacked the problems with the profitability, given I won't name names, but Brooks brothers is a great example. It's got a great following. It had the strangest real estate footprint. They were – they had single stores that were paying $3 million a year in rent. I won't name names and the ability to reject those leases and create profitability there, get out of bad stores, reduce the overhead and then do all this special marketing and with ABG has been a winning formula. In addition to that, we source it better and since we have this platform, where we can leverage our base off of, it's just like – it's been a very profitable thing. I will tell you one day spark will be worth. I mean, this isn't my style, but it's going to be worth, we're going to make a plus on that investment without question. And it's just – we know the brands, we do a lot of research. ABG has been a very good partner. They know how to blow out the license aspect of it, which we're a partner in. We get out of bad stores. We buy the inventory at a discount. We right-size the overhead and we're just – and with better business judgment and lo and behold, you suddenly have a business that's got positive – significant positive EBITDA and you haven't paid much for it that and I think when you put it all together, we'll have something that'll have great positive EBITDA and we'll end up making $1 billion plus out of it. Well, my partner thinks a lot more, but I'll give you that number. I mean, yes. I don't – it's been a good, it's been a great investment, so why – I don't know that we'll exit anytime soon. Well, I think it's the above. It will be profitable. We have that separate line item in our 8-K, what page is that? It's a little, the only thing, Caitlin, it is a little – obviously, it's more volatile than the rent aspect of our business. But you'll – because it's getting a little bit bigger, not materially bigger, but a little bigger, we decided to outline that separately. So, you can look at it as a standalone on its own. And then obviously, don't forget, they do pay us contracted rent to – Spark is a rent payer to the Simon Property Group and it's a property. So, we get the added benefit of the cash flow from running the business operate and then obviously, we get the added benefit of the rent, that's collected from the entity with the stores that we have. Well listen, I think, I think we still are very, very cautious in the sense of the dividend, just with respect to COVID. So, once we, I mean, I feel like at least that the worst is behind us, but we don't know for sure. So, I think we'll continue to be conservative in that. Obviously, you see our cap spend a way down a new development or redevelopment, that may pick up a little bit next year. So, we'll balance that obviously, we got to deal with our taxable income as well, but I can't give you a real through run rate yet and I think we'll be in a better position in 2021 to explain that when we do our earnings guidance, which we will reinstate in our earnings call, I mean, we have a pretty good idea what we expect from next year. But we'd like to go ahead and finish the year as well, given all the volatility out there, but we're confident of dividend and the cash paying aspects of it and the cash flow generation from our company. And I think if you saw that in the Q3, a reasonably healthy pickup from Q2 and when we were really in the midst of trying to figure out COVID. Sure. Well again, that's, I'm not going to get into the – as much as you want. I'm not going to – that's not really the purpose of the call to go through the granularity of all the leases. But I would say generally, the lease terms have not changed. TAs have not really increased and we're seeing more box activity. There's a number of retailers that want to grow their footprint in the outlet business, a number of the better and the higher brands. We're also seeing that the Parkers of the world wanting to grow their footprint and the internet oriented companies then you see companies like American Eagle and others that are growing their footprint. There's a well-known retailer that has their kind of casual wear business that's growing their footprint significantly. I think we've got 20 deals in the works for them. So, it's across the board and I would say, we're mostly replacing spaces that we got back from bankruptcies, leases that have terminated and the renewals are – a lot of the renewals we're doing now, we're doing as part of our COVID initiation. So to the extent that we did a deal in abatement, we may have addressed 2020 and 2021 renewals, and it's a judgement retailer by retailer and it's working it, I mean, obviously the nations aren't easy, because I mean, COVID has made them nervous and obviously, there's a lot of excess capacity in our retail real estate industry. But I think we'll hold our own and I – and look, I think the cash flow, we'll see improvements for cash flow next year. And again, – and that will be a combination of lease renewals, new business, better sales, we lost a lot of income just, because we were shut down with all of our Simon brand venture income, all the stuff that's traffic-driven. So, I think we'll make a rebound along all those lines. And no, we're not doing just percentage rent deals. The outlet business has had historically; some of the lead anchors have had percent rent deals only. to the extent that we do it, we have a floor in there and a clearly defined definition of sales, but it's all over the board, but it's – I guess, what we're trying to convey to you, Michael, is that we are open and doing your business, and that's support, and I think we'll have a better, we'll get more granular next quarter, but we're open to doing new business and the retailers are – sure there are a number of closing stores. There are a number of bankruptcies, but the ones that are out there are looking to grow their footprint. Well, Michael, again, I respect you immensely and we really – I'm not going to not going to get into the tailwind situation; obviously, you saw our litigation expense with it. But we're not out of – I'd say if there is quality real estate, we're going to look at it and much like – and it, but there's got to be bargains that can be had. And so we'll see what that transpires, but nothing really, I want to – and also want to be, because we've been asked this. I mean, we're not between the penney and closing of Brooks and lucky. There's really nothing else on the spark or the retail front that we see right now clearly, for the rest of the year. So that business is all about integrating Brooks and lucky into spark. And then obviously, we have a tremendous amount of work to do partner, Brookfield and the management team at penney to sustain their turnaround. And so we've – our plate is full in that category. There won't be anything going on, on that front. And we're really – right now, we haven't really looked at anything external, because obviously, we got our hands full, but it is a testament to the company that, we can do penney, we can do our debt deal. We can shut down our properties, open them up deal with we've done 14,000 lease amendments. right, Brian? we've collected rent, that hasn't been easy. Okay. It's not like they just suddenly said, okay, I'm going to send you a rent check that it hadn't been that easy. So, I mean, we've been busy, obviously, we've done a lot of refinancings on the secured front. We've been doing just about – there we shut down the pipeline in terms of redevelopment. development brought it back up to some extent. So, I mean, we are – we got our hands full, I think we've been executing unbelievably with all the – all of the things that have been thrown at us. So, we're really not looking externally at this moment. he – by the way, I think between Tom and Brian and Adam here, I'm the only one with hair; however, depending on your vantage point, you may accuse me of being in the thoughts. So, okay. Let's move on. Let's move on. No. Look, obviously we wish – good question, and we obviously wish that the pandemic hasn't – didn't hit us, but – and hit those businesses, but Soho has a great brand and ultimately, will be stronger and gets everything back online. So, the reality is very comfortable and they actually brought in some new capitals at the price that we did a couple of months ago, I think. So, Soho is great. PARM, we actually have Woodbury and Burlington opening next year, I think Woodbury's opening in January and Burlington in the spring, and my son and I and if Jeff Rosnick's [ph] listening, which I doubt he is, but we had a great carried out dinner at PARM. So, I'd encourage everybody to go eat there, it was really good, chicken PARM dinner. I think it's a great brand; lifetime will be the survivor in that industry. I have all the confidence in the world, a great CEO, entrepreneur, great brand, great customer base. So, I think by and large, we feel like we're a pretty good spot. I don't think – I think what's changed there, because I don't think we'll do the little venture deals the way we did, even though we've had some recent pops in those, meaning we got some, we're going to – we're selling our interest in the MDs at a profit and we've – there's some new capital that's come into some of those businesses at prices higher than what came in. but I don't think we'll do those little deals anymore. I think we've got too much too much to say grace over. But I think all of that we've invested in, we feel generally pretty good though. They've all frankly – they're all fit the flywheel that we were creating. We just didn't anticipate, the black swans of black swans, and – but all of those companies are alive and I expect them to come out of it, okay. Great insight and the answer is absolutely. So that's one of the interesting things that we found is, we do think that the combination of our relationships with a direct-to-consumer crowd, as well as all the brands that either we control or that ABG does, that those products will find a home in Penney. And there's a lot of intense discussions going on. So, we would expect to enhance the Penney vendor matrix with the brands that ABG controls as well as ours. So very, very astute and the answer is without question. The pro-rata minimum rent in our joint ventures? Not sure. We're really doing this on a gross basis, because that's how we look at it. The outlets are performing, I don't want to necessarily get into the specifics, but the outlets are performing better. What we've seen across the board though, whether it's an outlet or an enclosed, if it does cater to tourism, those are ones that are continued to be – continued to underperform our average. So, whether it's in Orlando, enclosed or outlet, in Orlando, we have an enclosed mall there, we have the outlet centers that market both are underperforming with because of the lack of tourism and obviously, Universal and Disney operating at much less than full capacity. Sure. Yes. the same price they will not be an equal partner, but they'll put in – we'll do see in our investment both us and Brookfield based upon the contribution they make. Well, I didn't say that's exclusive, but they have a – they control a number of brands, like Juicy Couture as an example. And they're – Juicy Couture is not in J.C. Penney. And so we're going through the vendor matrix now, to eventually, I think Penney will end up distributing those kinds of brands that ABG controls, J.C. Penney department store. So, it'll be a win-win for everybody. Authentic Brands is not really, I mean, they had some brands that we don't – we're not invested in, but they do have outlet stores now. They don't necessarily operate those stores, but take an example, Volcom, where they're a partner with Volcom. We don't – we're not Simon Property is not investor in that, but they own the IP and they own part of the operations. But it's really; Volcom is used to be owned by Kering Group and then sold it. But they operate Volcom itself, operates outlet stores in our portfolio. So, they are not an operator of “stores.” ABG, but they do have – they do own intellectual property of certain brands that do operate stores in our outlets and that will continue, but that's been that way for years. So again, but we're not involved in everything that ABG does, like Joe and others. I mean, I do think a number of their brands do have store potential. And they'll either operate or find an operator operate those stores. And what was your other question? I'm sorry. I forgot it. Look I think, generally, we're seeing a lot more interest in home furnishings and the life we're doing a lot more deals in the outlet sector with that – without naming names, but all the home furnishing and furniture folks. And so I think as you've seen that shift generally speaking, I think we're seeing a lot of that pickup in the outlet business as well. I think it's all about driving the traffic. I have no concern about that at all. And usually, those are a little big boxes, so that the rent that's leaving versus, what I'd rather have a dress barn or an RH. okay. That's right. So, would I rather have – so that it says kind of trade-offs that I think are available to us. I think the mix actually will significantly impact – improve, because we're going to end up reclaiming some of the older less relevant brands for some of the good or the better brands. Sure. Well, our leverage should – debt-to-EBTIDA should decrease, right. So, we're generating cash. Our development spend is modest and the excess cash other than dividend will ultimately, go to reduce our indebtedness, so – and we're also sell – we'll sell assets. So, we're still looking to essentially maintain our balance sheet. I mean, that's an advantage that we've worked very hard to achieve, hasn't been easy and I would not – we're not going to blow that. Brian, you want to add anything? Well, I just think it's going to, we're – in fact, we're – we've got an asset now we're about the market. I mean, we're going to try and do it. I mean, we'll see, it's not – this isn't, this is not earth-shattering big projects, but there's – respect to shed, some non-core assets that won't have a – not going to have a material impact, but just it'll help us run the company better, because we won't have to focus on it. Well, I would expect it to be hopefully, better in Q4. But we're just – we're similar in October and – but obviously, I would hope that we – as I mentioned to you before we still got some bigger accounts that we have not made a lot of progress with. I'm hopeful that something positive will happen there. So, once that happens, then it'll jump up. Sure. Yes. Believe it or not, there are still deals to be done. I mean, we're talking to a department store to take a couple of boxes over, there's not going to be 30 to 40 deals, but there'll be 15 and I think our retail community is generally, the healthier companies are looking towards the future and believe in the – in having the right footprint and we're going to shrink the bad stores, but I think they're going to look at new opportunities. It's not going to – we still believe in the mixed use effort that we're undertaking. Obviously, we don't have to be in a rush to do it. And we're not going to build, we're looking at plans that maybe, had a 60,00, 70,000, a 100,000 square feet of new retail, small shop space, or you're not going to program that, but we'll make it up with boxes and the lower investment, and still manage the appropriate returns. So, there's still opportunity to release the space. Fact of the matter is we still don't own a lot of it that we want, but we're not going to pay appropriate prices for it and there's certainly a gap between the bid and the ask. We're really not bidding, and they're really not asking, but if we were to bid and they were to ask, it would be a big gap, but good real estate will survive. But it's going to take capital, great operator and it's not going to be for the faint of heart and – but it's going to be reprogrammed. So, just something jumps out like a Brea, we'll probably have, we always had two anchors, but we had this is the old Sears store that we control. We'll still do the two anchors there. But we probably programmed a 100,000 square feet of restaurants, small shops, and we're not going to do it. We'll probably do 2030, but the costs will go down and we still think we'll have the appropriate returns on investment. So, there's still stuff to do to improve our portfolio and there's still some decent demand on just box for box. I didn't hear you well. Could you repeat it, please? There – we have no signed deal with Amazon. No. Yes. I think the spread is really mixed, because we had some boxes that rolled out last year compared to this year. So, I wouldn't – that's a number I wouldn't jump up and down whether it's really good or not so good as in this quarter, it's really a mix issue. Because we had a lot of box activity last year that we rolled out and this year, it's 12 months later. So, it's really more of a mixed issue and you could see that in our base rents increasing, which is probably a little more important stat. Okay. Sure. Very little Vince, this year and we don't expect it to be meaningful or immaterial, let me restate it and say it better. It'll be in material next year. No, no. it's a more appropriate question. I think, of all of the theater closures at one deal and I can't remember which one that it may affect a co-tenancy at one of the mills for a few of the boxes. It's essentially immaterial. Well, it hasn't closed. And in fact there was a hearing today, which I did not hear. I did not hear what happened, but to approve our – it's still not done yet. So, it hasn't closed assuming it gets approved. It'll be sometime later in the month. Look, it's complicated way. It's split up between what the operating company owns in the real estate and what the POSCO loans. We have rights. We, being Simon, have rights to recapture certain assets. So, does Brookfield, but I think we're going to be patient about it, because I think the most important thing right now is just to get it stabilized and positioned for the future, but eventually, there are certainly some stores that probably are not maybe, properly positioned with us, where we do want to recapture the space. And I think that's an opportunity, but you're not under – we don't feel the pressure to do that anytime soon. But that'll be next year's business. And then when that happens, I get to negotiate, I guess I don't really know what to do. Maybe risk, maybe our guys, maybe Brookfield. I'm not really sure how it works, but we will, we will, we will appropriately do it fairly with all the constituencies involved. Sure. It's still reopened one in a specialty grocer in Boca. Just recently, that's doing very well. We just made a deal that I don't know that I can announce it that we just signed the lease this week to replace fairway, the fairway market grocer in Nanuet with a great grocer. So, there are – what we're really focused on is the specialty grocers as opposed to the big mammoth ones and I think there'll be a handful of deals. It's not going to be 50, but I think it will be over the next couple of years. There's no way we can't get 10 to 20 to specialty ones, like the one we did a bulk is great. It's sort of an end cap of kind of the lifestyle center that we did it Boca and high-end grocer in, come in, get your prepared foods, quality. You still have the Italy's of the world that are out there looking to do a business. I had a comment with them recently, that's the same kind of category, prepared foods, specialty grocer, not necessarily a place; I guess you could pick up milk, but, more of prepared foods, dining or get your special consumable. So, I do think that'll continue to grow. No. I mean, they're doing what they're doing, so nothing there to report. Well, it's a combination, as I said, of abatements and credit provisions. The credit provisions are mostly bankruptcies. How is it split, it's – I don't know, 60/40 somewhere in that range. Is that – if that's helpful to you, again, I don't – I view this as kind of a one – this is not going to be routine, but it's kind of a one-time between the COVID impact, so to speak between Q2 and Q3, but it's split roughly between abatements and credit provisions, which are mostly bankruptcies and abatements, and maybe, it's 60/40 in that range. Is that helpful? Credit provisions include lots of things beyond prepetition rent or anything else associated with a bankruptcy. Not really. I mean, listen, I – before the news today, I mean, we were feeling better that we had dealt with a lot of crap in Q2 and Q3, and we're here to – and we're here and our cash flows dramatically up and our collections are up, and we're getting our business back to normal. So, we were headed that way anyway. But obviously, it's – just I mean, this situation, is it black swan times two or three and it's been sad for all of us to have to see what's happened to the country good solid businesses beforehand that we've had to deal with our employees, obviously, all the people, in fact, – just maybe, there's a little more of what's the trays of peppermint – what's that? Pep in the step, I just think it's good news. Let's hope we can – let's hope we can get out and get done. But now, it's not going to – it's not going to affect us, because we're mostly dealing with COVID-oriented shutdowns or impact of those shutdowns. And listen I hope it gives our client face more confidence and that that's fine. That's good. It should, it should. And hopefully, we'll see some benefits from that into 2021 and beyond. Sure. Okay. Thank you and thanks for staying late on a Monday night. be well."

For prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Good evening and thank you for joining us this evening. Before I turn to our second quarter results, I really just want to again express my gratitude to the entire Simon team for their tireless work they continue to do for our shoppers, communities, and retailers. As we said previously, the safety of our communities in which we serve is our top priority, and the team has managed unprecedented circumstances in dealing with the pandemic, certain recent natural disasters, obviously the unfortunate rioting that also occurred. So we've been dealing with obviously a lot. And frankly I'm extremely proud, grateful for the dedication and commitment of our team as they've demonstrated during these challenging times, from opening – from closing to opening to securing our buildings. They've done a heck of a job. So let's go to the numbers. Second quarter reported funds from operation was $746.5 million, or $2.12 per share. I'm pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and the solid profitability and positive cash flow we achieved in the second quarter. Keep in mind, please, our profitability was achieved despite our US portfolio being closed to the public for nearly 10,500 shopping days during the second quarter. Our domestic and international operations in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $1.13 per diluted share primarily due to reduced lease income and ancillary property revenues as a result of the COVID-19 disruption, partially offset by approximately $0.36 per diluted share from cost reduction initiatives or a net $0.77 per diluted share in the second quarter. Now, let me walk you through the components of the year-over-year change in the context of our portfolio NOI. I think the best way to do that is on page 17 of our supplement that we issued today. This will help you understand the impact of COVID-19. First of all, total portfolio NOI or net operating income decreased from $1.5 billion in the second quarter last year to approximately $1.2 billion this year, a decrease of 21%, or approximately $315 million. The year-over-year decline for the second quarter was due primarily to the following: approximately $215 million from domestic rent abatements and a higher provision for credit losses. Given the lack of local, state and federal government support for our industry, we went out of our way to abate rent for thousands of local small businesses, entrepreneurs and restaurateurs and other retailers for the period they were closed. Approximately $145 million from lower sales based rents, short-term leasing and Simon brand venture income solely due to the fact that our properties were closed and approximately $60 million of lower income from our international outlet portfolio, again due to the fact that they were closed as well during the second quarter. So that's $215 million, $145 million and $60 million, these decreases were partially offset by approximately $105 million from our cost reduction initiatives. As a reminder the variances I just explained do not include the negative impact of $36 million from a straight line increase deduction – straight line impact has always been excluded from portfolio NOI. Our operating statistics metrics were as follows, Mall and Premium outlet occupancy at quarter-end was 92.9%, down approximately 110 basis points from the first quarter of 2020, standard bankruptcies and lower specialty leasing during the second quarter due to COVID-19 impacted occupancy approximately 60 basis points. Average base minimum rent was $56.02, up 2.8% year-over-year and our leasing spreads were essentially flat for the trailing 12-month period. Now regarding collections. We have collected from our US retail portfolio including some level of rent deferrals approximately 51% of our contractual build rent for April and May combined, approximately 69% for June and approximately 73% for July with only de minimis deferrals. These percentages are not reduced for any of abatement granted during the period that I previously talked about. Now prior to reopening our properties, we implemented a series of robust safety protocols to ensure the highest possible safety and cleanliness standards. We reopened our US properties starting in early May. And our entire portfolio for July 10 has permitted even with the ever-changing governmental orders that frankly have been in a constant state of flux in 37 states and 150 different counties all with different protocols. On July 15th, the California Governor issued a new restrictive order requiring us to close seven of our properties in the state. So we're all open except for the seven recent closings in California. We've been generally encouraged by the shopper response to our reopening particularly in certain locations where there's been a steady improvement in traffic with many tenants reporting sales better than their initial expectations. Just a little color on that and the centers that reopened in early May, tenants who reported sales, reported May was approximately 50% of their previous year volume for the same period. And in June, that increased to more than 80% of prior-year volumes. Tenants continued to reopen, and we currently had 91% of all tenants, or nearly 23,000 tenants across our US portfolio are open and operating. Of the remaining tenants that have not opened – not reopened, more than half of those are closed because of the remaining restrictive governmental orders limiting or prohibiting their operations. Included in that category would be movie theaters, fitness facilities and, in some instances, restaurants. Internationally, all of our designer and international premium outlets are open and operating. 100% of all those stores and our designer outlets are open and operating with shopper traffic and retail sales at approximately 90% of prior-year levels. And we continue to see steady improvement in traffic and sales at our international premium outlets with all retail stores open and sales across that portfolio nearing last year's levels. With our partner, Siam Piwat, we opened Siam Premium Outlets in Bangkok, our first Premium Outlet Center in Thailand. The center is approximately 90% leased. It's extremely well located and has an unrivalled premium shopping experience featuring leading brands such as Burberry, Balenciaga, Coach, Ferragamo, and many more. We also completed several redevelopments, including phase IV of Gotemba Premium Outlets, which is 100% leased. Gotemba Premium Outlets is the largest outlet center in Asia ex-China, and we project annual retail sales to be in excess of $1 billion. Our net investment focus continues to be on those projects nearing completion, and our share of the remaining net cash funding required to complete the projects currently under construction is approximately $140 million through 2021. We have a track record on capitalizing on various value-creating opportunities. As you know, Sparc Group, our 50/50 joint venture with Authentic Brands Group, submitted stalking horse bids to acquire Brooks Brothers and Lucky Brand jeans under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. Just a few things, I think is really important to keep in mind on this potential deal. First, Sparc is buying them out of bankruptcy, so it is acquiring the inventory at or below cost, and to the extent we buy the intellectual property, we are doing so at attractive values. Second, when Sparc integrates acquisitions in its platform, it reduces the acquired companies overhead significantly. And third, Sparc is able – because of the bankruptcy code and designation rights, able to reject any leases that do not meet its criteria. And all stores are projected to have a four-wall EBITDA upon assumption of lease. These investments are expected to generate positive EBITDA. Soon after their integration in the Sparc we expect any equity investments should be returned within a year after integration of operations. And as I have mentioned previously, we have created real value already in our investments in Sparc and of course ABG and we continue to look forward to other opportunities. Just a few words on the balance sheet, again active. As you might imagine, at the end of the quarter, our liquidity was approximately $8.5 billion consisting of $4.9 billion of available credit facility, borrowing capacity and $3.6 billion of cash including our share of joint venture cash. As a reminder, the $8.5 billion of liquidity is net of the $700 million of US commercial paper that's outstanding at quarter-end. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we paid down a total of $2 5 billion under our credit facilities. We also completed the optional redemption at par of $500 million in 2.5% notes and €370 million in 2.3% notes. Both of those notes had maturity dates later this year. And I'm also pleased to note that our net debt has not increased by the end of the second quarter through this pandemic period. So, important to note, and our debt covenants remain well above the required levels with significant headroom. As you know, dividend we paid, our second quarter dividend of $1.30 per share in cash on July 24. The board will declare third quarter dividend by September 30, and we expect in total for 2020 to pay at least $6 per share in cash for dividends. Conclusion would be simply, again, I want to thank my colleagues for their continued resolve during this tragic set of events for the entire country. Our results are only possible through the ongoing ingenuity, flexibility and dogged determination of the Simon team. We're proud to play our small part in helping local small businesses, entrepreneurs and communities work their way through this recovery by continuing to help them get back so that they can open their business and move forward. So with that, we're ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. First question we have on the line will be coming from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCaitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Good evening, everyone. I guess as of August 9 you mentioned 91% of tenants were reopened but then July collection was around 73%. So just wondering if you could go through kind of why that amount isn't closer to 91%. Obviously it's better than the previous few months and how quickly you think you could get to a point where rents being paid is more similar to the amount of stores open?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, July is at 73% and why because certain tenants haven't pay rent. They have contracts they're obligated to but certain tenants haven't paid.\nCaitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And I just – when you think you about the amount that hasn't yet paid, I know, on the May call you had a good sense of just kind of making that point that those who have leases unless their bankrupt you expect them to be paying. So, I guess could you just go through the status of the portion from Q2 that weren't paid whether it sounds like there are minimal amounts of abatements kind of what portion is still under discussion versus rent deferrals you did give or other categories?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, as you might imagine we're in active negotiations with all of our retailers. We did provide abatement for primarily the local businesses, and entrepreneurs, restauranteurs during the abatement period, so – or I'm sorry, the closure period. And we're finalizing a number of our remaining open issues with our retailers. Again, I mentioned to you that we took a hit of $215 million, which is a combination of abatements and write-offs from bankrupt tenants, et cetera. We're not going to go through the percentages of each category primarily because we're still in active negotiations with tenants regarding April-May, and we don't think – that information, we believe, is proprietary, and it puts us in a awkward position as we finalize our negotiation. We've done over 9,000 amendments. I think we're in very good shape. We're certainly pretty much on -for not being essential, remember, we were deemed, for whatever reason, non-essential retail. So we lost 10,500 shopping days, and we're going through an orderly process. So we've taken the hit that we think is going to show up in Q2, and we're processing the balance but hopefully that will all be behind us here in the near future. We're making very good progress on, as I mentioned in July, being at over 73%. But we still got retailers that we need to deal with, and we're going through the process in an orderly, thoughtful fashion, like we do everything else.\nCaitlin Burrows - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon out there. David, how are you?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Out here is going to be the resurgence of the Midwest is around the corner, my friend, okay? So just remember that. Go ahead.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: By the way, careful what you look for because all the fleeing New Yorkers will end up moving in next door to you in Carmel. So just be careful what you wish for about the Midwest. So two questions. Just following up on Caitlin's, I understand your hesitation but still, if we look at your accounts receivable, it definitely jumped from first quarter to second quarter meaningfully. So it sounds like you probably had not that much straight line rent write-offs and you think that most of this is money good. So is there a way for one...\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: But also remember that's quarter-end. A lot of collections. We made a lot of collections in July applying to Q2. And so just that's a moment in time you got to be very careful about drawing any conclusion. But again – and we're continuing to obviously finish a number of deals. So just don't – you can't go from that point to the other point without knowing this isn't – everyday, it changes.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay. But still can you just give us some flavor even without the numbers but just like percentages, just some color. You had a bunch of tenants who – people weren't paying. Then people started to pay. Your tenants who asked you for, hey, can we make a deal? Some of those were flat out rejected, some you worked with, some you obviously have brought to court. But can you just give us a flavor like on the shopping center side, they've been pretty detailed as far as the percentages of who've asked, percentage of asked versus who's abated, who deferral and the amounts that they've said no and the amount that are remaining to be negotiated with. So can you at least give some framework around that just to help us understand better?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I guess, Alex, I have such a different philosophical difference. For me to air my – let's just think hypothetical. Let's say I deferred half a guy's rent and the guy that I didn't defer any rent, and I told you I deferred half his rent, he's going to end up saying why didn't you do this for me when you did it for other people. So I think this is proprietary information. Obviously, all of this flows through our income statement. It's all GAAP. We did tell you we took a bunch of abatements and we did have a negative $36 million straight line rent variance. Again that's not in that $215 million because portfolio NOI as you know we always excluded straight line. But in this case this is the first quarter we've ever had negative straight line as far as I can tell, so it's a pretty big gap. But I don't – I just don't want to kind of go through that beyond what we've told you. I mean, we told you collections. We told you, we did do some level of deferrals, nothing out of the ordinary. The deferrals in July were de minimis. Deferrals in June were less than April and May. So it's all moving in the right direction, and the collections are – we haven't given up on April-May as Q2 collections. We expect to – other than what we abated and wrote off through bankruptcy, we expect to reach a deal on the vast majority of it. And you're right. Some of – we have a one really big receivable out there that is of public record. And obviously that's out there as a big receivable. We think that's going to get collected, but that's a big increase in our accounts receivable. So the deferrals and the abatements were clearly under – not anywhere near the majority of our rental rent roll, and we still have what I'd say about 28% to 30% of our negotiations still to be done.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay. That's helpful, the 28% still to be done. Okay. And then the...\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Still to be done. Yeah.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: 28% still to be done. Okay. The second question is...\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And that's moving down. I'm looking at some numbers here. We've got 20% in July that's still under negotiation. But at the end of the day, we expect roughly, with abatements and everything else, to collect 85% roughly of Q2 and 93% of July and then hopefully get back to kind of the normal run rate which has been in the 97%, 98% level.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay The second question is from – your hallmark apart from cash flow is your balance sheet.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yes.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: And I see that a few of the rating agencies I think have you guys on negative, but you're doing a lot more with ABG. Obviously, there's litigation with Taubman. There was the discussion in the Journal today with Amazon. I'll let someone else ask that question. And then you did continue to pay a dividend, albeit at a reduced level, but still you're paying still with a hefty dividend. How do the rating agencies view all of these transactions? Have they viewed all of these as favorable or they're comfortable or have you had to alter some of your plans based on your desire which I assume is to maintain your current rating?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. We're not concerned about that. I mean, just even with all of the closures, again 10,000 days, we were cash flow positive this quarter. Now, we were obviously aggressive in our – not many folks that I've read have shared their reductions in costs, but we took out $105 million of costs across corporate in the portfolio, but we're cash flow positive. Our ratios are – our covenants are well-covered. And again, I mean, I see the narrative out there. The amount of equity in both the Lucky and Brooks Brothers investments is – I don't want to say de minimis, but it's what would make – what would you think would be a non-event from our standpoint in terms of what we have to invest either directly or in Sparc? What would you say, Alex?\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: In the two, I'm going to guess maybe at $100 million, maybe $100 million to $150 million in aggregate between the two.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. It's going to be half of that.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay. So $75 million between the two?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: No, no, no. I'd say half of the $100 million. Okay.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: And that's only in a short period of time until we refinance the whole thing. And again – remember when you buy the inventory at cost or below and then you sell it for a gross margin which you're supposed to, we're not buying it at retail. We're buying at cost. So if you have a 35%, 40% gross margin, you're going to make 35%, 40% on your – we're not buying the inventory at a retail cost to the consumer. We're buying it at basically the cost that the retailer has and then we sell it. So there's profit in there. That's why people – that's why you see ABL financed left and right because they're buying at a cost and there is a gross margin in there. So that's where the market doesn't really get it but those two investments either directly or through capital contribution to Sparc will be $150 million from us.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Okay.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: There's just no way and let me repeat, no way that the rating agencies are going to think twice about it, no way.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Right. But JCPenney would be different.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, again, I'm not going to respond to market rumors or speculation. But what's out there in the public is that Penney is likely, if they are to restructure to do an Opco/Propco and the amount of equity required to do the operating company is going to be a lot less than you would think. So, again, it's not overly complicated but there are facts that just aren't out there that if we thought, first of all Lucky and Brooks Brothers to the extent that we get this – and by the way, the one thing we should talk about is the fact that we're saving in the case of Brooks Brothers 4,000 jobs, okay? I mean, that's what we should talk about. I mean, we're doing our fair share for trying to keep this world as normal as we can. But going back, I mean, if Brooks Brothers or Lucky or even Sparc or even ABG were material to our financial situation then we would disclose it but it's not material. It's a sideline business and I do see the narrative that and I don't buy into this, and, Alex, you and I have had this discussion – that we're buying into these retailers to pay us rent. We're doing it because we, for one reason only, we believe in the brand, and we think we can make money. If we didn't believe in the brand and we didn't think we could make money, we wouldn't do it. And if – those same people are probably the same people that told Amazon to stay just in the book business, okay? So, let's just think a little bit – there's just nothing out there that says you can't make smart investments outside of your core businesses which is what we do all the time. And, look, Kimco did it with Albertsons. They did a pretty damn good job, and kudos to them.\nAlexander Goldfarb - Piper Sandler & Co.: Thank you, David.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRichard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, David. Good afternoon. Hey, I wanted to maybe just chat with you about the return to normal from a cash flow standpoint, obviously something you focus on a lot. And in many respects, this environment is different from the GFC given the headwinds facing retail real estate before thinking about the implications of COVID-19. But I'm sure there's some lessons learned from the GFC as well, and you were obviously very successful in navigating the GFC. So I think what a lot of us are trying to understand is what does that return to normal look like? And you mentioned, when speaking to Alex, rent collections in the high 90s relatively soon. But like when does cash flow, from the way you look at it, return to where it was last year? How long does it take to get there?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's a fair question and a good question. But I don't have an answer. Look, I do think without question, the pandemic has obviously had a dramatic impact much greater – and I've experienced a lot of volatility in my career. The Great Recession frankly doesn't – it pales in comparison to what we're dealing with. Obviously, the amount of bankruptcies in our sector is tremendous and it's more reminiscent to me of what we're dealing with, of what we dealt with in the early 1090s than the Great Recession. And frankly the early 1990s took some time. I mean, it was – and again, if I say something you're going to think I'm saying something but I'm just using that as an example. I mean in the early 1990s, the real estate recession there took frankly two, three, four years to overcome. And again, I'm not making that prediction here, but I don't think it's going to be an immediate snapback. That doesn't mean our company can do great work. The important player in getting the country back, help the local communities and all that stuff. But it's going to take time. There's no doubt about it. And this is different. This is not your grandmother's recession. I mean, when you have GDP drop 30%, whatever it was, 34%, I mean, that's not normal. We're doing a lot more bankruptcies and this is going to have more of a duration – durational impact than what we've experienced probably since the early 1990s. Now, the reality is in the early1990s, for those that survived, we're able to prosper after that period of time lapsed. But when you – in order to really answer that question, it's – you've got to have a medical – you've got to tie it to a medical and I am nowhere in a position to respond to that. I mean, you got to have a country moving more or less together and obviously, that's not happening. So I wish I could pinpoint it, but we're not – we're anticipating more of a durational impact here and our planning has been very conservative. And that's why we cut our CapEx, that's why we cut our overhead, that's why we're working with our local entrepreneurs in abating rent because, frankly, if we force the issue, they wouldn't open the doors again and that's why we're trying to be – if our retailers are willing to work with us, we're willing to work with them. If they're not and we continue to try to work with them and they're still not working with us then that's when we have to look at – unfortunately look at other options. So I wish I could pinpoint it. It's a fair question. I think we'll have a better – I think as every month and quarter goes on, I'll have a better impact certainly would be our view by the end of this year to like lay out what we see in 2021. I think we're getting closer to that. I have in my own mind what it will be but I'm not willing to share it with you not because I don't like you. I do. I'm just not willing to share it.\nRichard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's all fair. I would hope for more but I completely understand that, David. I do want to have one follow-up question if I may. And you alluded to this. Look, I think there's a lot of media headlines that retail real estate is dying and malls are dying, I pushed back on that for a variety of reasons. I think we have too much retail real estate in the United States. So, on the other side of this once retail real estate rationalizes, I would agree with you that we're going to be stronger. So, I guess I would ask you, how much do you think has to rationalize given what you know about COVID-19? Is it 10%, 20%, 40%? I think in the past, you've talked about a 20% to 30% number like go back many years. How do you think about that because I could see the industry post rationalization being a lot stronger footing than it is this today?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, there's no question there's going to be material rationalization across the whole spectrum. And that's all the product categories within our retail sector. So, it will be malls, strip centers, certain outlets, power centers, lifestyle centers. Look, it's hard to – again, it's hard to put a handle on it. I think the bigger thing will not be so much whether it's 20% or 30%, but just it's going to happen like now. It's not – a lot of the time when you had a product that was limping along, it could limp for a while. That half-life has shortened over the last five, six, seven years. Now, it's like immediately shortened. So, you're going to see rationalization, without question, and it's going to happen quicker. But again, I'd be reluctant to give you a real number to hang your hat on. But your number that you mentioned certainly sounds within the realm of possibilities.\nRichard Hill - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you, David. That's it for me.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. No worries.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nHaendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Hello out there.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: How are you?\nHaendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Hey, David. So, I'm going to ask the question that Alex left off of his laundry list of questions earlier about Amazon. So, I'm curious, and I know a lot of investors are as well, on your thoughts on the idea of Amazon potentially taking up space at malls and former anchor boxes. Do you think it would work from a practical sense? Would it add any value to or benefit to the centers' shoppers or the retailers, and could it even potentially – does it even work from an economic perspective?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I'm really not in any position to respond to market rumors or speculation. So, that's really with respect to that. I mean, generally, I'd say, the important thing going on that we're seeing is that more and more retailers are distributing their e-commerce orders from their stores. And so, they're fulfilling from their stores and they're also – the curbside pickup or all sorts of fulfillment options are available. That's a good trend long-term for us. But beyond that, I don't want to get into logistics or any kind of speculation really around JCPenney and/or Amazon, and we should leave it at there.\nHaendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Fair enough. Thank you for that. My second question is really a question on the spreads turning flat here in the quarter implying there's a meaningful decline in second quarter. Curious how we should think about the leases signed during the quarter. Any big deals of note there having a disproportional impact? Were these leases generally signed pre- or post-COVID? And how should we think about the near-term trajectory of spread near-term, if it's roughly what we saw in 2Q? Thank you.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, it's a good question. Obviously, Q2, we did not do a lot of new business. Okay. So, we were in mostly triage levels. I mean, I hope everybody appreciates what we had to deal from a – this pales in comparison. I'm not putting our slice of the world anywhere near the health and welfare of people and the hospitals and all that, but we were dealing with a very difficult environment. We had to close pretty quickly. We reopened. We had all sorts of different rules across all sorts of different counties. We tried to manage that process the best of our abilities. We've got very little, if any, help on either real estate tax, sales tax, we had a lot of guidelines. We had then reinforced our buildings when we had the tragic consequences of the problems at the end of May, which cost us several million dollars, which kind of ended up in our numbers as well in fortifying our stuff. We had to work remotely, and then we had to help a lot of our local tenants in our – and lot of the local restauranteurs and so on. So, we've been drinking from the fire hose trying to. All of these things are unbelievable, every day is a judgment call. What do you do? Do you do this? Do you do that? You're not going to get perfect. You're not going to have – you're going to offend somebody, somewhere, sometime, and you just try to be level-headed and do it. So, with all that said, we went after trying to stabilize our tenant base the best that we could. We tried to reach out. We made a corporate decision to abate all local tenants as much – again, I'm sure there was a mistake somewhere, somehow. But we tried to do that immediately because we knew they were under a lot more pressure than we were. And the new business just wasn't there for Q2. What I'm told by our new business group is that people are starting to think about new business. Most of that's going to – if it does surface, most of them will be in 2021. I do think we'll see the benefit of a number of popups in our portfolio, both primarily in the outlet business from a number of great brands because they're sitting on excess merchandise. We think that's a great opportunity. Hopefully, they'll do great business and they will stay longer. And so, I think this spreads this year is going to be whacky enough to like, discount them. And because I don't think we're going to do as much new business, obviously renewals are going to be – we didn't finish all of our 2020 renewals, so that's going to be another judgment call about what the right level of rent is. That's going to be a retailer by retail decision. That's going to be whether they – US is a good partner or not. There will be a number of cases where we'll work out something acceptable to both parties. There will be some that we won't. We hope that will be in the minority. And frankly, we're – I'm not going to spend much time worrying about spreads this year. I just think we're just focused on getting our retailers open, getting traffic back, creating a safe environment for the communities to shop, feel comfortable again, and that kind of math, I'll worry about next year.\nHaendel St. Juste - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Thank you for the thoughts. Good luck out there.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMichael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC: I was curious how much of the second quarter cost reductions should we see continue in the second half?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's hard to say. I mean, corporately, I must admit I have not had a mutiny yet, but at some point, it's around the corner. Okay. So, the executives here are still at reduced salaries and reduced comp. That's a tough one for me. I think about it a lot. So, I don't have an answer for that. So, there will be some of that obviously on the operating expenses, not as much because the standards of which – not that we – I mean, I hope everyone appreciates that we've always run our properties – again, we're not perfect. I'm sure there's mistakes, potholes here and there. But we have a new standard that we have to produce that's going to be more expensive. So, from a property level, we probably won't see a lot of benefit in forward – it would be great if we got some help. If you look at our P&L, the one area we did not get any help and it's retail real estate tax. So, I would hope that these local municipalities would look favorably on what we deliver to the community, what the ad valorem taxes are for retail real estate compared to other forms of real estate, and give us a break. We deserve it. We're not treated fairly, and we need it. So, I don't think we'll get it, but that's where we should get it.\nMichael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Okay. And just as a follow-up, what percentage of ABR is tied to entertainment, dining, and fitness?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: That's a good question. I don't know. Anybody know off the top of my head? No. I don't know – you mean in general, just in...\nMichael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, in general.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I'm going to say probably 5%, but Tom will give you the exact number.\nMichael W. Mueller - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Your line is open.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: The dog needs to be walked or fed.\nKi Bin Kim - Truist Securities: So, I wanted to go back to the kind of high-level rent collection data that you provided. So, it looks like you collected about 57% of rents in 2Q. Without going category by category, just high level, what percent of the rent that did you not collect, did you actually write off or reserve for?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, again, I don't want to get too much, but it's in the – I mean, we're probably in the 15% to 20% range, somewhere in that range, okay?\nKi Bin Kim - Truist Securities: Okay.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Again, I don't want to get too much on this because all of this will eventually come out, and you have to make – as you know, we have the new rules and all of this will be out with the wash by year end, but that's kind of where we think. We took a pretty big hit this quarter as you know, I mean, we had roughly $215 million between abatements and write-offs. So, on the portfolio-wide kind of gives you the number for the quarter.\nKi Bin Kim - Truist Securities: And do you have any data on like what percent of your tenants do you deem as local tenants? And if you're thinking about actually providing loans for these tenants besides those abatements or deferrals?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We don't really give out the local number and we don't provide any real loans. If they are, its maybe – historically, we might get notes with a local tenant if they've had a problem with their business. But it's not something that we do upfront and maybe a note because rent has been paid over time, but we don't loan – we rarely loan tenants' money to the point of kind of a non-event for us.\nKi Bin Kim - Truist Securities: And would that be the same for restaurants too?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Correct.\nKi Bin Kim - Truist Securities: I'm assuming that if restaurants go dark it might be hard to bring it (00:55:11) back.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I mean, we'll do tenant allowance for retailers and restaurants, but we won't loan money. And again, we're pretty good on credit, making sure that if we are providing some form of the build-out, one that the retailers providing the bulk of that and that they have credit stand behind it.\nKi Bin Kim - Truist Securities: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nLinda Tsai - Jefferies LLC: Hi. In terms of buying out the bankrupt retailers, you talked through some hypothetical numbers, buying at or below cost generating gross margins of 35% to 40%. I would think there's a lot of opportunities that exist. How do you go about picking and choosing?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Great question. And it's not like we want a huge portfolio of this. But listen, ABG, Authentic Brands Group, is a fantastic intellectual property group, does business throughout the world and has a ton of brands. So, normally – and they provide a lot of value on sourcing, marketing, international operations, et cetera. So, normally, when we're doing that, we work with them. They're very, very good about understanding where there is value in the brand because they know how they can monetize that intellectual property. Obviously, we have a point of view because we know what the consumer likes. So, you put the two of us together in a room and that's how we do it. So, we rarely play. I mean, there have been unfortunately a lot of bankruptcies this year. It's not like we're playing in a lot of them. And the other thing I'd point out, Linda, is that we get rumors we're playing, and we are not playing and again because we don't want to talk about market rumors and speculation. We don't deny rumors as well, but we're very selective in what we look at. And again, the brands got to have value. We got to believe we can – without trying to hit an inside straight, we better believe we can make it EBITDA positive pretty easily. We're not into miracle worker here. We want to be able to do it like what we've done in the past.\nLinda Tsai - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for that. And then could you discuss how COVID impacts varied across your different property types. Maybe say the Mills, Premium Outlets, enclosed malls as it relates to rent collections and then traffic upon reopening.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I would say generally and again it depends on location. But I think it's undeniable at this point that it's a little bit location oriented. And a lot of that is kind of where we see stability maybe in that market and lack of a rise in COVID cases. In addition to that, I mean I do think the consumer generally feels a little more comfortable in the outdoor environment. But I would also really underline that a lot of it is just tied to where these cases ebb and flow. And that right now is a big determinant.\nLinda Tsai - Jefferies LLC: Did rent collections vary at all across property types?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: They have – but since we deal with these retailers basically across the board, it's not like they can pay us in this center or not pay us in that center because one's enclosed and one is open. And when we're talking to them, we're talking to them across the portfolio. So, you may see different trends if you only have this kind of product versus that kind of product. But since we're dealing with these retailers across our portfolio, for us, it hasn't – there's no differential. For others, it might be a different case.\nLinda Tsai - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Just one last one. In terms of the $215 million in abatements and write-offs, how would you expect that number to trend in 3Q and 4Q?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: My guess, it'll – again, it's a little bit unpredictable. But there'll be some – I'm sure we'll deal with some more in August, September. We do have, as I mentioned, properties closed again. I hope, for all sorts of reasons, primarily because COVID is not rising, that would be great for all of us. But we still – there's still a risk that we might – because we're in this weird dilemma that we're not considered essential, we run the risk. So, it's hard to predict. I can't make a prediction on that. I was feeling pretty good in June about finally getting back to work, and I feel less good in July, and now I'm totally confused. But I am sure we are still going to deal with issues going forward. And so, there'll be – I'm sure there'll be some level abatements and some collection issues as we move forward for the rest of the year.\nLinda Tsai - Jefferies LLC: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNicholas Yulico - Scotiabank: Thank you. I'm just trying to reconcile a couple of numbers here. I know you gave the collection data, which is inclusive of deferrals for April, May, June. They ran between 50% of contractual rent to 70%. And in those months yet, if we look at your cash flow statement in the 10-Q, it's showing that your quarterly cash flow from operations were down over 90% if you just try and figure out what the quarter number is, not the six-month number. So, I mean that would presumably mean a pretty low cash collections number. I know you guys haven't given the cash collection number, but is there anything more you can explain on this issue as we're looking at these items?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I think frankly, Nick, you're maybe having a hard time with our income statement, we're happy to talk to you offline. But again, we had a lot of deals were done at the end of the quarter and processed in early July. So, we had a lot of collections in July all the way through July. The numbers are the numbers. So, if there's a particular number – we do have some retailers that haven't paid period and we're still under negotiation with a good chunk of our retailers to find out kind of where that stands. So, we haven't pressed the bruise (01:04:22) on everyone at this point. We certainly have the option to do so. We can't find a satisfactory deal. And so, I'm not sure what you're referring to, but we're happy to walk through it with you in more detail.\nNicholas Yulico - Scotiabank: Yeah. No, I was specifically looking at the cash flow statement, not the income statement, which you're showing your cash flow down a lot from a cash from operations standpoint in the second quarter versus a year ago. And so, that's – I guess, what...\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I mean, we did have abatement. Okay. And we did have a reduction in our – I mean I don't know if you were here earlier, but I laid out how we went from property NOI to kind of where we were. We did lose roughly $460 million less our savings. So, I'm sure no one on this call wants me to repeat that, but it's available there for you on the transcript.\nNicholas Yulico - Scotiabank: Okay. Yeah. I can follow up offline.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. There's no denying we have reduction in our cash flow from operations. We went through that earlier.\nNicholas Yulico - Scotiabank: I guess what I'm trying to understand is what exactly we should be – what's the takeaway from the fact that you're saying that your collections are improving in July versus the second quarter? Is that a function of – just to be clear, does it mean your cash collections are improving? Or are you just now have more deferral agreement?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Nick, unfortunately, I've said a lot of this. So, I don't think you've – maybe you weren't on the early part. Yes, I said our cash collections – it was clear in the teleconference text that our cash collections in July improved to 73% with de minimis level of deferrals. I said that earlier. Okay?\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDerek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, David. Hi, everyone. Thank you. What was your process in determining the level of abatements granted? And to us, what is seemingly a kind shared pain approach, could you take us through the decision process in granting abatements?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Only if you have time for me to talk about 9,000 lease amendments, okay? So, Derek, a lot goes into that. I mentioned earlier, it's a lot of judgment calls. It's all about the relationship. We went out of our way universally. Again, now, I'm sure there'll be some local retailer or restaurateur where something got lost in translation with our field. But we went out of our way universally to abate all local entrepreneurs and businesses, and I'm sure there'll be somebody that said, hey, I didn't get it, but that was the message from top. And then, there were other retailers and it was all a function of understanding their credit, understanding whether there were some potential trades. Every situation was different. Again, that's why we don't like to get into the granularity of every deal because I certainly don't want one retailer say, I didn't get that, why did you do that versus this. But it's years – it's been in business almost 60 years. And me personally, have been doing this for 30 years that ends up saying grace over what's the right way to proceed is with a retailer. And again, let me reinforce, I'm sure we made mistakes, I'm sure we didn't handle everything right, but we did the best that we could with the set of circumstances that we were dealing with.\nDerek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks. And what does the return to development plan at Phipps Plaza? Could you guys quantify the likely timeline or what you need to see happen in order to resume instruction, and really how far is completion kind of pushed off at this point?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah, that's a good question. So, on Phipps, we are getting very close to resuming and finishing the hotel. We have the building called the anchor building, which we're currently evaluating what our options there are. And then we also have a office building that was part of that that we could sit on that for a while. We're seeing – the good news about that is we're really never going to start that till next year anyway. So we're going to – we have the chance to kind of give it a few months to see. But I'm expecting the hotel to resume construction here in the near future and ultimately the anchor building probably within the next two to three months. And then the office building will be market-dependent, and we'll probably not know that until early next year, the timing, that is.\nDerek Johnston - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you, David.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Thank you. Good afternoon. David you provided the monthly trajectory of both rent collections and deferrals which have been improving sequentially. I was wondering if you could provide the same details about how rent abatements have been trending over the past few months?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. I would say way down and the fact is since we're not closed, the rent abatement was around the period of time we were closed. So now that essentially other than the California situation we're not closed. There might be an abatement here or there, but it's generally I would hope well past this.\nJohn P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. So this is not a case where the collections were favorably reported because of the abatements going up as well?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. Now, I said that in my text and I think that's very important to reinforce. So, our collections that I quoted you were based on our rent roll that we sent out – that we built. So we took abatements that percent would be dramatically increased, okay? We gave you the rent roll period end of story pre-abatement. So if you took the abatement our collections would – as a percent would be much higher but we chose not to do it on that basis.\nJohn P. Kim - BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. Thanks for the clarity.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.\nVince Tibone - Green Street Advisors: Hi, good afternoon. Could you share how...\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Hi. How are you doing?\nVince Tibone - Green Street Advisors: Good. Could you share how shopper traffic and tenant sales at your domestic centers was in July compared to the prior year?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We don't get July until basically August 20. So we don't get that near until the end of the month.\nVince Tibone - Green Street Advisors: Is there any color you could provide on maybe just near-term since reopening? Like is tenant – is foot traffic down 50%? Is it down 20%? Any ballpark figure you could provide us where the traffic is domestically?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's all over the board. And again, I said earlier, Vince, that when we first opened it actually we were – traffic was down but conversion was high. And as cases rise, frankly the consumers being cautious and traffic is down. I mean overall traffic is down, but it's so location driven and geographic driven that I hate to give you a national average. It really is a function of when we open and whether or not COVID resurfaced in those markets.\nVince Tibone - Green Street Advisors: Fair enough. And then just is there more color you can provide on the geographic differences like which regions are performing much closer to normal and where is it still a lot slower?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, I think when we first opened – look, I think the hardest hit areas continue are in the tourism areas. That is – and as you know that's important to our industry in totality. That's been and continues to be the worst performing. Frankly, the locations in early when we got opened, the consumer was excited to get out of their house. We saw basically the Sunbelt, Southwest, West was not too bad outside of the tourist areas. COVID obviously increased in those areas and that had a slowdown for sure. Northeast was late to open. I mean, frankly, we just opened the Northeast basically the end of June and, in some cases, New York in July. So it's – we really don't have a lot to tell you on that. But traffic's been slowly building ex the tourist areas.\nVince Tibone - Green Street Advisors: I appreciate that color. One more quick one for me. What percentage of your contractual rent is current [technical difficulty] (01:15:48) second quarter occupancy?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I'm sorry. You broke up there.\nVince Tibone - Green Street Advisors: Oh, I'm sorry. I asked what percentage of your contractual rent is currently in bankruptcy, included in second quarter occupancy?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Around 4%-ish that's in bankruptcy that flew through the second quarter.\nVince Tibone - Green Street Advisors: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Sure.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Your line is open.\nFloris van Dijkum - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. David, clearly, the retail industry is facing some headwinds right now, and you've seen the non-essential retail center being mandated shut. As you look forward, does this change your thinking on how your malls are going to look? And also how your outlets are going to look? And in particular, obviously in Europe and in Asia, what you see in a lot of the malls more than in the US is grocer anchors. Do you envision more grocers at Simon malls in three years' time? And maybe also comment on your view particularly regarding the outlets and maybe reducing the prevalence of apparel and maybe adding other things to your outlet properties.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, look, I'm a big believer in the outlets, and if Europe is any indication, the outlets across Europe and in Asia are basically almost back to where they were. And so I think the big issue on generally the outlets is just, we don't have COVID yet stabilized. Obviously, we've got some retailer bankruptcies and whatnot that we're going to have to deal with that they affect all of retail real estate and affect the outlets as well. But I don't think there's anything dramatically broken with the outlet business. I think it's just a function of getting people back to where they feel comfortable of getting out of their houses and shopping, and they really like the outlet product. So I'm not overly worried about it. Obviously, outlets that are in tourism areas are going to be harder hit or just whether it's domestic or international tourism just because lack of general mobility. I'm hopeful that, yes, that may take some time but eventually we will get past that. The duration of that could be some time, could be a year or two but we'll be past that. Listen – and then the -there will be a continual change with the mall product. I mean we do think that's going to present some opportunities. We probably have too many department stores per big mall. But generally, the real estate is really good and we're going to densify it. I think the idea that what we had was working on over time will be – will continue. I mean, we may have to get through this rough patch that the industry is going through. But this is good real estate that can be redeveloped. Our basis is very, very low. Our basis in the department stores whether through leases or – is very low. So I think there will be a number of opportunities for us to redevelop that real estate. So I do think earlier question was do we have too many malls? Sure. But they'll be – the malls that ultimately survive will benefit from that contraction. And, look, who knows? I mean, there's all sorts of ideas floating around about what the mall can do and how it can service the community. And we continue to work on a lot of those things. So I think great real estate will always weigh out, and I just think we've got to continue to evolve the product, which we were making very good progress on and will continue to do so.\nFloris van Dijkum - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC: And would that potentially include enhanced or increased grocery exposure in malls, in your view?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I'm hopeful. I hope so. I mean, their real estate requirements are – obviously, you have a lot of constraints to them. So – but, yes, I am hopeful that we can certainly do more business with that category.\nFloris van Dijkum - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC: Great. And if I can have a follow-up question maybe regarding your investment in retailers, and clearly it's – some people seem to be somewhat concerned about going outside the – or off the fairway, if you will, in some of your investments, whether it's Brooks Brothers, Lucky Brand, or Forever 21, and obviously the big one potentially, JCPenney. Presumably, the return expectation for you to do something outside of your core business has got to be higher. What gets you – what deals get you most excited, and where do you think you're going to make the highest returns, if you can share some of that with us?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, again, on – we're not going to comment on market rumors, public rumors, et cetera. We did mention Brooks and Lucky because those are out there in the public through the bankruptcy process. I'd say the very simple thing is, I want to see in retail – there is more volatility in retail for sure. So the pay back is got to be immediate. We're hopeful to buy these things at least on the equity, I mean in some cases 1 to 2 times EBITDA, get our investment back immediately. And it's got to be really cheap. And we're not buying these retailers, both Aero and Forever 21. And if we were awarded the stalking horse in Brooks Brothers but we'll see if we win. We'll see what happens. Lucky is in the same spot. We're buying these in bankruptcy. So I think that we're not buying these at retail. Retailer today would trade at, who knows, but trade at 5, maybe 5 or 6 times EBITDA, I don't know. I mean it's all over the place. But we're buying these things that basically if we have to put equity in, if we have to, we're going to get our investment back in year one. So then everything else is on – and then if you have a great brand, listen, we could end up taking Sparc and selling it through a spec (01:24:30) for $4 billion and then you'll say, hey, what a good idea, just give us time to prove our thesis right. Or at the end of the day, if we screw up, we will have the loss, a de minimis amount of money given our market cap.\nFloris van Dijkum - Compass Point Research & Trading LLC: Thanks, David.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. No worries.\nOperator: Next question will be coming from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks and good evening, David. And hopefully, someone has brought you a glass of water after 90 minutes. So I appreciate you sticking around. The first question was around corporate structure. A number of years ago, and we sort of had this conversation off and on over many years, about REIT versus de-REIT. And I don't know if you saw, one of the present REITs decided to de-REIT. But just given the evolution of your business and where the puck is going, becoming a little bit more vertically integrated, how do you think about being a REIT versus not being a REIT and obviously the dividend that comes with that?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, no real change. I mean, we study that at least once a year. What's the likely prospect of corporate income taxes going up is probably pretty high. So obviously, we are committed to paying a very meaningful dividend. Our yield is scrumptious. So we study it. No real intention. There are certain limitations because of the REIT structure in – all new retailers even though we own through joint ventures that we're working with the legislators that's hopefully they'll see the benefit of it. I mean, we are literally saving jobs. We save a gazillion – not a gazillion, I mean that's silly, but we save a ton of jobs at Forever 21, a ton of jobs at Aero. We're going to save a bunch of jobs at Lucky and Brooks. And the reality is the legislators, there are these restrictions on bad income which we are big enough that doesn't really restrict us, at some point it could give us a headache. We're hopeful that the government is focused on jobs. We know that regardless of the side of the aisle you're on and we're hopeful that common sense will prevail. This rule is from the 1960 REIT legislation. It's irrelevant today. It's good for the economy if we're in a position with our partners to save jobs. I'm hopeful common sense will prevail.\nMichael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: But you don't feel that given the liquidity and just you've managed your balance sheet exceptionally well going into this, and you have a ton of liquidity. But having that dividend obligation and not having complete clarity of how deep you can go in the vertical integration, it doesn't sound like that's altered your thinking of REIT versus not REIT.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Not at this time.\nMichael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: It's a very good question. We think about it, like I said, once a year. But I do think, Michael – I mean, look, who knows? But the corporate tax rates could go back up and obviously makes that equation. Even in today's world, we're still profitable. We still have – even with all the abatements and all of the problems we're dealing with, we're going to have taxable income. So, I mean we'd be a tax-paying entity. And, we are hopeful that even though we're completely out of favor as an investment fit and it is what it is that obviously there is some attraction to our dividend-paying abilities.\nMichael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And you talked about jobs and saving jobs in terms of the investments you're making in the retailers. Why hasn't there been widespread government support at the federal level, at the state level, at the local level for the retail industry as a whole? Where is it breaking down? Is it the animosity between the landlords and the tenants who just can't get together? Is it the leadership of the government in relations that at the retail industry? I was like, why – like what's going on? Like why hasn't it been done for an industry that's so critical to so many jobs in this country?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Well, just to be clear, we are not looking for federal government help. Our biggest frustration is how we get taxed, real estate tax, ad valorem tax. Our biggest frustration historically, as you know, was the moratorium, on the Internet sales taxation. Thankfully, the Supreme Court overruled the Quale (01:30:40) decision. I forget – it's been so long though, I forgot the name. But thankfully, we could never get legislators to treat commerce fairly, whether it's brick-and-mortar Internet without – as you know, unless – wherever they had (01:31:02). So now that, that is more or less – and they left it to the states which I'm fine with. Pretty much everything is taxed on an equal playing field. But my biggest frustration is we are the golden goose when it comes to real estate tax payments compared to other real estate properties. Whether you look at how we're assessed per value versus warehouse, industrial. That needs to be addressed, but that's a local game. I mean, there's nothing nationally that's going to be done. Obviously, there's been a lot of jurisdictions in the COVID scenario that has treated enclosed malls a lot differently than enclosed retail even when they open. Forget essential – by the way, I get essential. I had no problem with essential, and both the federal and the state governments had to do what they had to do. But when they opened back up, a number of states dealt with the enclosed mall a lot differently than other retailers, and we were cleaner, had better protocols. We had better air and all those other stuff. But that was a high level of frustration, continues to be the case as we see what's going on in California. So trying to restructure the CMBS and that, we're not expecting that. Let the documents be the documents. I've got no problem with that. But it would be nice that we just got a little bit of the benefit on the real estate tax. And treating retailer – there's not a lot of difference, frankly, between a Costco store and a Simon mall when it comes to protocols and cleanliness and air quality, and by and large, man, let us compete.\nMichael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: We suffered two months, 10,500 days where we could not compete, and that's what – that's just not fair. So I don't want anything other than the ability to compete.\nMichael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Last question, if I may, just your reference to the early 1990s made me think to – we took a lot of those companies public, right? It was Chapter 11 or S-11 for the REIT industry. And you think about where other retail landlords are today relative to your position where they don't have the balance sheet, they don't have the capital, they don't have as much institutional knowledge, they don't have the operating history and know-how that you have. I guess, they're reacting, does that competitive pressure on you because they're just trying to survive where so many others within this vertical are so much more balance sheet challenged and have weaker assets that they may be doing uneconomical transactions. Does that roll over to you or impede any of your negotiations with tenants?\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: I don't worry about that one iota. We do – I'm sure we're going to make mistakes but we have to look at it from our standpoint and a lot less what others are doing. I don't think about it at all.\nMichael Jason Bilerman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the time, David.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Michael.\nDavid E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.: Okay. I'm sorry. We are warbled on there but thanks for your calls and be safe, everyone.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you everyone for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David E. Simon - Simon Property Group, Inc.",
            "content": "Good evening and thank you for joining us this evening. Before I turn to our second quarter results, I really just want to again express my gratitude to the entire Simon team for their tireless work they continue to do for our shoppers, communities, and retailers. As we said previously, the safety of our communities in which we serve is our top priority, and the team has managed unprecedented circumstances in dealing with the pandemic, certain recent natural disasters, obviously the unfortunate rioting that also occurred. So we've been dealing with obviously a lot. And frankly I'm extremely proud, grateful for the dedication and commitment of our team as they've demonstrated during these challenging times, from opening – from closing to opening to securing our buildings. They've done a heck of a job. So let's go to the numbers. Second quarter reported funds from operation was $746.5 million, or $2.12 per share. I'm pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and the solid profitability and positive cash flow we achieved in the second quarter. Keep in mind, please, our profitability was achieved despite our US portfolio being closed to the public for nearly 10,500 shopping days during the second quarter. Our domestic and international operations in the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $1.13 per diluted share primarily due to reduced lease income and ancillary property revenues as a result of the COVID-19 disruption, partially offset by approximately $0.36 per diluted share from cost reduction initiatives or a net $0.77 per diluted share in the second quarter. Now, let me walk you through the components of the year-over-year change in the context of our portfolio NOI. I think the best way to do that is on page 17 of our supplement that we issued today. This will help you understand the impact of COVID-19. First of all, total portfolio NOI or net operating income decreased from $1.5 billion in the second quarter last year to approximately $1.2 billion this year, a decrease of 21%, or approximately $315 million. The year-over-year decline for the second quarter was due primarily to the following: approximately $215 million from domestic rent abatements and a higher provision for credit losses. Given the lack of local, state and federal government support for our industry, we went out of our way to abate rent for thousands of local small businesses, entrepreneurs and restaurateurs and other retailers for the period they were closed. Approximately $145 million from lower sales based rents, short-term leasing and Simon brand venture income solely due to the fact that our properties were closed and approximately $60 million of lower income from our international outlet portfolio, again due to the fact that they were closed as well during the second quarter. So that's $215 million, $145 million and $60 million, these decreases were partially offset by approximately $105 million from our cost reduction initiatives. As a reminder the variances I just explained do not include the negative impact of $36 million from a straight line increase deduction – straight line impact has always been excluded from portfolio NOI. Our operating statistics metrics were as follows, Mall and Premium outlet occupancy at quarter-end was 92.9%, down approximately 110 basis points from the first quarter of 2020, standard bankruptcies and lower specialty leasing during the second quarter due to COVID-19 impacted occupancy approximately 60 basis points. Average base minimum rent was $56.02, up 2.8% year-over-year and our leasing spreads were essentially flat for the trailing 12-month period. Now regarding collections. We have collected from our US retail portfolio including some level of rent deferrals approximately 51% of our contractual build rent for April and May combined, approximately 69% for June and approximately 73% for July with only de minimis deferrals. These percentages are not reduced for any of abatement granted during the period that I previously talked about. Now prior to reopening our properties, we implemented a series of robust safety protocols to ensure the highest possible safety and cleanliness standards. We reopened our US properties starting in early May. And our entire portfolio for July 10 has permitted even with the ever-changing governmental orders that frankly have been in a constant state of flux in 37 states and 150 different counties all with different protocols. On July 15th, the California Governor issued a new restrictive order requiring us to close seven of our properties in the state. So we're all open except for the seven recent closings in California. We've been generally encouraged by the shopper response to our reopening particularly in certain locations where there's been a steady improvement in traffic with many tenants reporting sales better than their initial expectations. Just a little color on that and the centers that reopened in early May, tenants who reported sales, reported May was approximately 50% of their previous year volume for the same period. And in June, that increased to more than 80% of prior-year volumes. Tenants continued to reopen, and we currently had 91% of all tenants, or nearly 23,000 tenants across our US portfolio are open and operating. Of the remaining tenants that have not opened – not reopened, more than half of those are closed because of the remaining restrictive governmental orders limiting or prohibiting their operations. Included in that category would be movie theaters, fitness facilities and, in some instances, restaurants. Internationally, all of our designer and international premium outlets are open and operating. 100% of all those stores and our designer outlets are open and operating with shopper traffic and retail sales at approximately 90% of prior-year levels. And we continue to see steady improvement in traffic and sales at our international premium outlets with all retail stores open and sales across that portfolio nearing last year's levels. With our partner, Siam Piwat, we opened Siam Premium Outlets in Bangkok, our first Premium Outlet Center in Thailand. The center is approximately 90% leased. It's extremely well located and has an unrivalled premium shopping experience featuring leading brands such as Burberry, Balenciaga, Coach, Ferragamo, and many more. We also completed several redevelopments, including phase IV of Gotemba Premium Outlets, which is 100% leased. Gotemba Premium Outlets is the largest outlet center in Asia ex-China, and we project annual retail sales to be in excess of $1 billion. Our net investment focus continues to be on those projects nearing completion, and our share of the remaining net cash funding required to complete the projects currently under construction is approximately $140 million through 2021. We have a track record on capitalizing on various value-creating opportunities. As you know, Sparc Group, our 50/50 joint venture with Authentic Brands Group, submitted stalking horse bids to acquire Brooks Brothers and Lucky Brand jeans under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. Just a few things, I think is really important to keep in mind on this potential deal. First, Sparc is buying them out of bankruptcy, so it is acquiring the inventory at or below cost, and to the extent we buy the intellectual property, we are doing so at attractive values. Second, when Sparc integrates acquisitions in its platform, it reduces the acquired companies overhead significantly. And third, Sparc is able – because of the bankruptcy code and designation rights, able to reject any leases that do not meet its criteria. And all stores are projected to have a four-wall EBITDA upon assumption of lease. These investments are expected to generate positive EBITDA. Soon after their integration in the Sparc we expect any equity investments should be returned within a year after integration of operations. And as I have mentioned previously, we have created real value already in our investments in Sparc and of course ABG and we continue to look forward to other opportunities. Just a few words on the balance sheet, again active. As you might imagine, at the end of the quarter, our liquidity was approximately $8.5 billion consisting of $4.9 billion of available credit facility, borrowing capacity and $3.6 billion of cash including our share of joint venture cash. As a reminder, the $8.5 billion of liquidity is net of the $700 million of US commercial paper that's outstanding at quarter-end. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we paid down a total of $2 5 billion under our credit facilities. We also completed the optional redemption at par of $500 million in 2.5% notes and €370 million in 2.3% notes. Both of those notes had maturity dates later this year. And I'm also pleased to note that our net debt has not increased by the end of the second quarter through this pandemic period. So, important to note, and our debt covenants remain well above the required levels with significant headroom. As you know, dividend we paid, our second quarter dividend of $1.30 per share in cash on July 24. The board will declare third quarter dividend by September 30, and we expect in total for 2020 to pay at least $6 per share in cash for dividends. Conclusion would be simply, again, I want to thank my colleagues for their continued resolve during this tragic set of events for the entire country. Our results are only possible through the ongoing ingenuity, flexibility and dogged determination of the Simon team. We're proud to play our small part in helping local small businesses, entrepreneurs and communities work their way through this recovery by continuing to help them get back so that they can open their business and move forward. So with that, we're ready for questions. Well, July is at 73% and why because certain tenants haven't pay rent. They have contracts they're obligated to but certain tenants haven't paid. Well, as you might imagine we're in active negotiations with all of our retailers. We did provide abatement for primarily the local businesses, and entrepreneurs, restauranteurs during the abatement period, so – or I'm sorry, the closure period. And we're finalizing a number of our remaining open issues with our retailers. Again, I mentioned to you that we took a hit of $215 million, which is a combination of abatements and write-offs from bankrupt tenants, et cetera. We're not going to go through the percentages of each category primarily because we're still in active negotiations with tenants regarding April-May, and we don't think – that information, we believe, is proprietary, and it puts us in a awkward position as we finalize our negotiation. We've done over 9,000 amendments. I think we're in very good shape. We're certainly pretty much on -for not being essential, remember, we were deemed, for whatever reason, non-essential retail. So we lost 10,500 shopping days, and we're going through an orderly process. So we've taken the hit that we think is going to show up in Q2, and we're processing the balance but hopefully that will all be behind us here in the near future. We're making very good progress on, as I mentioned in July, being at over 73%. But we still got retailers that we need to deal with, and we're going through the process in an orderly, thoughtful fashion, like we do everything else. Sure. Out here is going to be the resurgence of the Midwest is around the corner, my friend, okay? So just remember that. Go ahead. But also remember that's quarter-end. A lot of collections. We made a lot of collections in July applying to Q2. And so just that's a moment in time you got to be very careful about drawing any conclusion. But again – and we're continuing to obviously finish a number of deals. So just don't – you can't go from that point to the other point without knowing this isn't – everyday, it changes. Yeah. I guess, Alex, I have such a different philosophical difference. For me to air my – let's just think hypothetical. Let's say I deferred half a guy's rent and the guy that I didn't defer any rent, and I told you I deferred half his rent, he's going to end up saying why didn't you do this for me when you did it for other people. So I think this is proprietary information. Obviously, all of this flows through our income statement. It's all GAAP. We did tell you we took a bunch of abatements and we did have a negative $36 million straight line rent variance. Again that's not in that $215 million because portfolio NOI as you know we always excluded straight line. But in this case this is the first quarter we've ever had negative straight line as far as I can tell, so it's a pretty big gap. But I don't – I just don't want to kind of go through that beyond what we've told you. I mean, we told you collections. We told you, we did do some level of deferrals, nothing out of the ordinary. The deferrals in July were de minimis. Deferrals in June were less than April and May. So it's all moving in the right direction, and the collections are – we haven't given up on April-May as Q2 collections. We expect to – other than what we abated and wrote off through bankruptcy, we expect to reach a deal on the vast majority of it. And you're right. Some of – we have a one really big receivable out there that is of public record. And obviously that's out there as a big receivable. We think that's going to get collected, but that's a big increase in our accounts receivable. So the deferrals and the abatements were clearly under – not anywhere near the majority of our rental rent roll, and we still have what I'd say about 28% to 30% of our negotiations still to be done. Still to be done. Yeah. And that's moving down. I'm looking at some numbers here. We've got 20% in July that's still under negotiation. But at the end of the day, we expect roughly, with abatements and everything else, to collect 85% roughly of Q2 and 93% of July and then hopefully get back to kind of the normal run rate which has been in the 97%, 98% level. Yes. Yeah. We're not concerned about that. I mean, just even with all of the closures, again 10,000 days, we were cash flow positive this quarter. Now, we were obviously aggressive in our – not many folks that I've read have shared their reductions in costs, but we took out $105 million of costs across corporate in the portfolio, but we're cash flow positive. Our ratios are – our covenants are well-covered. And again, I mean, I see the narrative out there. The amount of equity in both the Lucky and Brooks Brothers investments is – I don't want to say de minimis, but it's what would make – what would you think would be a non-event from our standpoint in terms of what we have to invest either directly or in Sparc? What would you say, Alex? Okay. It's going to be half of that. No, no, no. I'd say half of the $100 million. Okay. And that's only in a short period of time until we refinance the whole thing. And again – remember when you buy the inventory at cost or below and then you sell it for a gross margin which you're supposed to, we're not buying it at retail. We're buying at cost. So if you have a 35%, 40% gross margin, you're going to make 35%, 40% on your – we're not buying the inventory at a retail cost to the consumer. We're buying it at basically the cost that the retailer has and then we sell it. So there's profit in there. That's why people – that's why you see ABL financed left and right because they're buying at a cost and there is a gross margin in there. So that's where the market doesn't really get it but those two investments either directly or through capital contribution to Sparc will be $150 million from us. There's just no way and let me repeat, no way that the rating agencies are going to think twice about it, no way. Well, again, I'm not going to respond to market rumors or speculation. But what's out there in the public is that Penney is likely, if they are to restructure to do an Opco/Propco and the amount of equity required to do the operating company is going to be a lot less than you would think. So, again, it's not overly complicated but there are facts that just aren't out there that if we thought, first of all Lucky and Brooks Brothers to the extent that we get this – and by the way, the one thing we should talk about is the fact that we're saving in the case of Brooks Brothers 4,000 jobs, okay? I mean, that's what we should talk about. I mean, we're doing our fair share for trying to keep this world as normal as we can. But going back, I mean, if Brooks Brothers or Lucky or even Sparc or even ABG were material to our financial situation then we would disclose it but it's not material. It's a sideline business and I do see the narrative that and I don't buy into this, and, Alex, you and I have had this discussion – that we're buying into these retailers to pay us rent. We're doing it because we, for one reason only, we believe in the brand, and we think we can make money. If we didn't believe in the brand and we didn't think we could make money, we wouldn't do it. And if – those same people are probably the same people that told Amazon to stay just in the book business, okay? So, let's just think a little bit – there's just nothing out there that says you can't make smart investments outside of your core businesses which is what we do all the time. And, look, Kimco did it with Albertsons. They did a pretty damn good job, and kudos to them. Sure. It's a fair question and a good question. But I don't have an answer. Look, I do think without question, the pandemic has obviously had a dramatic impact much greater – and I've experienced a lot of volatility in my career. The Great Recession frankly doesn't – it pales in comparison to what we're dealing with. Obviously, the amount of bankruptcies in our sector is tremendous and it's more reminiscent to me of what we're dealing with, of what we dealt with in the early 1090s than the Great Recession. And frankly the early 1990s took some time. I mean, it was – and again, if I say something you're going to think I'm saying something but I'm just using that as an example. I mean in the early 1990s, the real estate recession there took frankly two, three, four years to overcome. And again, I'm not making that prediction here, but I don't think it's going to be an immediate snapback. That doesn't mean our company can do great work. The important player in getting the country back, help the local communities and all that stuff. But it's going to take time. There's no doubt about it. And this is different. This is not your grandmother's recession. I mean, when you have GDP drop 30%, whatever it was, 34%, I mean, that's not normal. We're doing a lot more bankruptcies and this is going to have more of a duration – durational impact than what we've experienced probably since the early 1990s. Now, the reality is in the early1990s, for those that survived, we're able to prosper after that period of time lapsed. But when you – in order to really answer that question, it's – you've got to have a medical – you've got to tie it to a medical and I am nowhere in a position to respond to that. I mean, you got to have a country moving more or less together and obviously, that's not happening. So I wish I could pinpoint it, but we're not – we're anticipating more of a durational impact here and our planning has been very conservative. And that's why we cut our CapEx, that's why we cut our overhead, that's why we're working with our local entrepreneurs in abating rent because, frankly, if we force the issue, they wouldn't open the doors again and that's why we're trying to be – if our retailers are willing to work with us, we're willing to work with them. If they're not and we continue to try to work with them and they're still not working with us then that's when we have to look at – unfortunately look at other options. So I wish I could pinpoint it. It's a fair question. I think we'll have a better – I think as every month and quarter goes on, I'll have a better impact certainly would be our view by the end of this year to like lay out what we see in 2021. I think we're getting closer to that. I have in my own mind what it will be but I'm not willing to share it with you not because I don't like you. I do. I'm just not willing to share it. Well, there's no question there's going to be material rationalization across the whole spectrum. And that's all the product categories within our retail sector. So, it will be malls, strip centers, certain outlets, power centers, lifestyle centers. Look, it's hard to – again, it's hard to put a handle on it. I think the bigger thing will not be so much whether it's 20% or 30%, but just it's going to happen like now. It's not – a lot of the time when you had a product that was limping along, it could limp for a while. That half-life has shortened over the last five, six, seven years. Now, it's like immediately shortened. So, you're going to see rationalization, without question, and it's going to happen quicker. But again, I'd be reluctant to give you a real number to hang your hat on. But your number that you mentioned certainly sounds within the realm of possibilities. Sure. Yeah. No worries. How are you? Well, I'm really not in any position to respond to market rumors or speculation. So, that's really with respect to that. I mean, generally, I'd say, the important thing going on that we're seeing is that more and more retailers are distributing their e-commerce orders from their stores. And so, they're fulfilling from their stores and they're also – the curbside pickup or all sorts of fulfillment options are available. That's a good trend long-term for us. But beyond that, I don't want to get into logistics or any kind of speculation really around JCPenney and/or Amazon, and we should leave it at there. Well, it's a good question. Obviously, Q2, we did not do a lot of new business. Okay. So, we were in mostly triage levels. I mean, I hope everybody appreciates what we had to deal from a – this pales in comparison. I'm not putting our slice of the world anywhere near the health and welfare of people and the hospitals and all that, but we were dealing with a very difficult environment. We had to close pretty quickly. We reopened. We had all sorts of different rules across all sorts of different counties. We tried to manage that process the best of our abilities. We've got very little, if any, help on either real estate tax, sales tax, we had a lot of guidelines. We had then reinforced our buildings when we had the tragic consequences of the problems at the end of May, which cost us several million dollars, which kind of ended up in our numbers as well in fortifying our stuff. We had to work remotely, and then we had to help a lot of our local tenants in our – and lot of the local restauranteurs and so on. So, we've been drinking from the fire hose trying to. All of these things are unbelievable, every day is a judgment call. What do you do? Do you do this? Do you do that? You're not going to get perfect. You're not going to have – you're going to offend somebody, somewhere, sometime, and you just try to be level-headed and do it. So, with all that said, we went after trying to stabilize our tenant base the best that we could. We tried to reach out. We made a corporate decision to abate all local tenants as much – again, I'm sure there was a mistake somewhere, somehow. But we tried to do that immediately because we knew they were under a lot more pressure than we were. And the new business just wasn't there for Q2. What I'm told by our new business group is that people are starting to think about new business. Most of that's going to – if it does surface, most of them will be in 2021. I do think we'll see the benefit of a number of popups in our portfolio, both primarily in the outlet business from a number of great brands because they're sitting on excess merchandise. We think that's a great opportunity. Hopefully, they'll do great business and they will stay longer. And so, I think this spreads this year is going to be whacky enough to like, discount them. And because I don't think we're going to do as much new business, obviously renewals are going to be – we didn't finish all of our 2020 renewals, so that's going to be another judgment call about what the right level of rent is. That's going to be a retailer by retail decision. That's going to be whether they – US is a good partner or not. There will be a number of cases where we'll work out something acceptable to both parties. There will be some that we won't. We hope that will be in the minority. And frankly, we're – I'm not going to spend much time worrying about spreads this year. I just think we're just focused on getting our retailers open, getting traffic back, creating a safe environment for the communities to shop, feel comfortable again, and that kind of math, I'll worry about next year. Sure. It's hard to say. I mean, corporately, I must admit I have not had a mutiny yet, but at some point, it's around the corner. Okay. So, the executives here are still at reduced salaries and reduced comp. That's a tough one for me. I think about it a lot. So, I don't have an answer for that. So, there will be some of that obviously on the operating expenses, not as much because the standards of which – not that we – I mean, I hope everyone appreciates that we've always run our properties – again, we're not perfect. I'm sure there's mistakes, potholes here and there. But we have a new standard that we have to produce that's going to be more expensive. So, from a property level, we probably won't see a lot of benefit in forward – it would be great if we got some help. If you look at our P&L, the one area we did not get any help and it's retail real estate tax. So, I would hope that these local municipalities would look favorably on what we deliver to the community, what the ad valorem taxes are for retail real estate compared to other forms of real estate, and give us a break. We deserve it. We're not treated fairly, and we need it. So, I don't think we'll get it, but that's where we should get it. That's a good question. I don't know. Anybody know off the top of my head? No. I don't know – you mean in general, just in... I'm going to say probably 5%, but Tom will give you the exact number. Sure. The dog needs to be walked or fed. Well, again, I don't want to get too much, but it's in the – I mean, we're probably in the 15% to 20% range, somewhere in that range, okay? Again, I don't want to get too much on this because all of this will eventually come out, and you have to make – as you know, we have the new rules and all of this will be out with the wash by year end, but that's kind of where we think. We took a pretty big hit this quarter as you know, I mean, we had roughly $215 million between abatements and write-offs. So, on the portfolio-wide kind of gives you the number for the quarter. We don't really give out the local number and we don't provide any real loans. If they are, its maybe – historically, we might get notes with a local tenant if they've had a problem with their business. But it's not something that we do upfront and maybe a note because rent has been paid over time, but we don't loan – we rarely loan tenants' money to the point of kind of a non-event for us. Correct. I mean, we'll do tenant allowance for retailers and restaurants, but we won't loan money. And again, we're pretty good on credit, making sure that if we are providing some form of the build-out, one that the retailers providing the bulk of that and that they have credit stand behind it. Sure. Great question. And it's not like we want a huge portfolio of this. But listen, ABG, Authentic Brands Group, is a fantastic intellectual property group, does business throughout the world and has a ton of brands. So, normally – and they provide a lot of value on sourcing, marketing, international operations, et cetera. So, normally, when we're doing that, we work with them. They're very, very good about understanding where there is value in the brand because they know how they can monetize that intellectual property. Obviously, we have a point of view because we know what the consumer likes. So, you put the two of us together in a room and that's how we do it. So, we rarely play. I mean, there have been unfortunately a lot of bankruptcies this year. It's not like we're playing in a lot of them. And the other thing I'd point out, Linda, is that we get rumors we're playing, and we are not playing and again because we don't want to talk about market rumors and speculation. We don't deny rumors as well, but we're very selective in what we look at. And again, the brands got to have value. We got to believe we can – without trying to hit an inside straight, we better believe we can make it EBITDA positive pretty easily. We're not into miracle worker here. We want to be able to do it like what we've done in the past. Well, I would say generally and again it depends on location. But I think it's undeniable at this point that it's a little bit location oriented. And a lot of that is kind of where we see stability maybe in that market and lack of a rise in COVID cases. In addition to that, I mean I do think the consumer generally feels a little more comfortable in the outdoor environment. But I would also really underline that a lot of it is just tied to where these cases ebb and flow. And that right now is a big determinant. They have – but since we deal with these retailers basically across the board, it's not like they can pay us in this center or not pay us in that center because one's enclosed and one is open. And when we're talking to them, we're talking to them across the portfolio. So, you may see different trends if you only have this kind of product versus that kind of product. But since we're dealing with these retailers across our portfolio, for us, it hasn't – there's no differential. For others, it might be a different case. My guess, it'll – again, it's a little bit unpredictable. But there'll be some – I'm sure we'll deal with some more in August, September. We do have, as I mentioned, properties closed again. I hope, for all sorts of reasons, primarily because COVID is not rising, that would be great for all of us. But we still – there's still a risk that we might – because we're in this weird dilemma that we're not considered essential, we run the risk. So, it's hard to predict. I can't make a prediction on that. I was feeling pretty good in June about finally getting back to work, and I feel less good in July, and now I'm totally confused. But I am sure we are still going to deal with issues going forward. And so, there'll be – I'm sure there'll be some level abatements and some collection issues as we move forward for the rest of the year. Yeah. I think frankly, Nick, you're maybe having a hard time with our income statement, we're happy to talk to you offline. But again, we had a lot of deals were done at the end of the quarter and processed in early July. So, we had a lot of collections in July all the way through July. The numbers are the numbers. So, if there's a particular number – we do have some retailers that haven't paid period and we're still under negotiation with a good chunk of our retailers to find out kind of where that stands. So, we haven't pressed the bruise (01:04:22) on everyone at this point. We certainly have the option to do so. We can't find a satisfactory deal. And so, I'm not sure what you're referring to, but we're happy to walk through it with you in more detail. I mean, we did have abatement. Okay. And we did have a reduction in our – I mean I don't know if you were here earlier, but I laid out how we went from property NOI to kind of where we were. We did lose roughly $460 million less our savings. So, I'm sure no one on this call wants me to repeat that, but it's available there for you on the transcript. Yeah. There's no denying we have reduction in our cash flow from operations. We went through that earlier. Nick, unfortunately, I've said a lot of this. So, I don't think you've – maybe you weren't on the early part. Yes, I said our cash collections – it was clear in the teleconference text that our cash collections in July improved to 73% with de minimis level of deferrals. I said that earlier. Okay? Only if you have time for me to talk about 9,000 lease amendments, okay? So, Derek, a lot goes into that. I mentioned earlier, it's a lot of judgment calls. It's all about the relationship. We went out of our way universally. Again, now, I'm sure there'll be some local retailer or restaurateur where something got lost in translation with our field. But we went out of our way universally to abate all local entrepreneurs and businesses, and I'm sure there'll be somebody that said, hey, I didn't get it, but that was the message from top. And then, there were other retailers and it was all a function of understanding their credit, understanding whether there were some potential trades. Every situation was different. Again, that's why we don't like to get into the granularity of every deal because I certainly don't want one retailer say, I didn't get that, why did you do that versus this. But it's years – it's been in business almost 60 years. And me personally, have been doing this for 30 years that ends up saying grace over what's the right way to proceed is with a retailer. And again, let me reinforce, I'm sure we made mistakes, I'm sure we didn't handle everything right, but we did the best that we could with the set of circumstances that we were dealing with. Yeah, that's a good question. So, on Phipps, we are getting very close to resuming and finishing the hotel. We have the building called the anchor building, which we're currently evaluating what our options there are. And then we also have a office building that was part of that that we could sit on that for a while. We're seeing – the good news about that is we're really never going to start that till next year anyway. So we're going to – we have the chance to kind of give it a few months to see. But I'm expecting the hotel to resume construction here in the near future and ultimately the anchor building probably within the next two to three months. And then the office building will be market-dependent, and we'll probably not know that until early next year, the timing, that is. Sure. Yeah. I would say way down and the fact is since we're not closed, the rent abatement was around the period of time we were closed. So now that essentially other than the California situation we're not closed. There might be an abatement here or there, but it's generally I would hope well past this. Okay. Yeah. Now, I said that in my text and I think that's very important to reinforce. So, our collections that I quoted you were based on our rent roll that we sent out – that we built. So we took abatements that percent would be dramatically increased, okay? We gave you the rent roll period end of story pre-abatement. So if you took the abatement our collections would – as a percent would be much higher but we chose not to do it on that basis. Sure. Hi. How are you doing? We don't get July until basically August 20. So we don't get that near until the end of the month. It's all over the board. And again, I said earlier, Vince, that when we first opened it actually we were – traffic was down but conversion was high. And as cases rise, frankly the consumers being cautious and traffic is down. I mean overall traffic is down, but it's so location driven and geographic driven that I hate to give you a national average. It really is a function of when we open and whether or not COVID resurfaced in those markets. Well, I think when we first opened – look, I think the hardest hit areas continue are in the tourism areas. That is – and as you know that's important to our industry in totality. That's been and continues to be the worst performing. Frankly, the locations in early when we got opened, the consumer was excited to get out of their house. We saw basically the Sunbelt, Southwest, West was not too bad outside of the tourist areas. COVID obviously increased in those areas and that had a slowdown for sure. Northeast was late to open. I mean, frankly, we just opened the Northeast basically the end of June and, in some cases, New York in July. So it's – we really don't have a lot to tell you on that. But traffic's been slowly building ex the tourist areas. I'm sorry. You broke up there. Around 4%-ish that's in bankruptcy that flew through the second quarter. Sure. Well, look, I'm a big believer in the outlets, and if Europe is any indication, the outlets across Europe and in Asia are basically almost back to where they were. And so I think the big issue on generally the outlets is just, we don't have COVID yet stabilized. Obviously, we've got some retailer bankruptcies and whatnot that we're going to have to deal with that they affect all of retail real estate and affect the outlets as well. But I don't think there's anything dramatically broken with the outlet business. I think it's just a function of getting people back to where they feel comfortable of getting out of their houses and shopping, and they really like the outlet product. So I'm not overly worried about it. Obviously, outlets that are in tourism areas are going to be harder hit or just whether it's domestic or international tourism just because lack of general mobility. I'm hopeful that, yes, that may take some time but eventually we will get past that. The duration of that could be some time, could be a year or two but we'll be past that. Listen – and then the -there will be a continual change with the mall product. I mean we do think that's going to present some opportunities. We probably have too many department stores per big mall. But generally, the real estate is really good and we're going to densify it. I think the idea that what we had was working on over time will be – will continue. I mean, we may have to get through this rough patch that the industry is going through. But this is good real estate that can be redeveloped. Our basis is very, very low. Our basis in the department stores whether through leases or – is very low. So I think there will be a number of opportunities for us to redevelop that real estate. So I do think earlier question was do we have too many malls? Sure. But they'll be – the malls that ultimately survive will benefit from that contraction. And, look, who knows? I mean, there's all sorts of ideas floating around about what the mall can do and how it can service the community. And we continue to work on a lot of those things. So I think great real estate will always weigh out, and I just think we've got to continue to evolve the product, which we were making very good progress on and will continue to do so. I'm hopeful. I hope so. I mean, their real estate requirements are – obviously, you have a lot of constraints to them. So – but, yes, I am hopeful that we can certainly do more business with that category. Well, again, on – we're not going to comment on market rumors, public rumors, et cetera. We did mention Brooks and Lucky because those are out there in the public through the bankruptcy process. I'd say the very simple thing is, I want to see in retail – there is more volatility in retail for sure. So the pay back is got to be immediate. We're hopeful to buy these things at least on the equity, I mean in some cases 1 to 2 times EBITDA, get our investment back immediately. And it's got to be really cheap. And we're not buying these retailers, both Aero and Forever 21. And if we were awarded the stalking horse in Brooks Brothers but we'll see if we win. We'll see what happens. Lucky is in the same spot. We're buying these in bankruptcy. So I think that we're not buying these at retail. Retailer today would trade at, who knows, but trade at 5, maybe 5 or 6 times EBITDA, I don't know. I mean it's all over the place. But we're buying these things that basically if we have to put equity in, if we have to, we're going to get our investment back in year one. So then everything else is on – and then if you have a great brand, listen, we could end up taking Sparc and selling it through a spec (01:24:30) for $4 billion and then you'll say, hey, what a good idea, just give us time to prove our thesis right. Or at the end of the day, if we screw up, we will have the loss, a de minimis amount of money given our market cap. Yeah. No worries. Well, no real change. I mean, we study that at least once a year. What's the likely prospect of corporate income taxes going up is probably pretty high. So obviously, we are committed to paying a very meaningful dividend. Our yield is scrumptious. So we study it. No real intention. There are certain limitations because of the REIT structure in – all new retailers even though we own through joint ventures that we're working with the legislators that's hopefully they'll see the benefit of it. I mean, we are literally saving jobs. We save a gazillion – not a gazillion, I mean that's silly, but we save a ton of jobs at Forever 21, a ton of jobs at Aero. We're going to save a bunch of jobs at Lucky and Brooks. And the reality is the legislators, there are these restrictions on bad income which we are big enough that doesn't really restrict us, at some point it could give us a headache. We're hopeful that the government is focused on jobs. We know that regardless of the side of the aisle you're on and we're hopeful that common sense will prevail. This rule is from the 1960 REIT legislation. It's irrelevant today. It's good for the economy if we're in a position with our partners to save jobs. I'm hopeful common sense will prevail. Not at this time. It's a very good question. We think about it, like I said, once a year. But I do think, Michael – I mean, look, who knows? But the corporate tax rates could go back up and obviously makes that equation. Even in today's world, we're still profitable. We still have – even with all the abatements and all of the problems we're dealing with, we're going to have taxable income. So, I mean we'd be a tax-paying entity. And, we are hopeful that even though we're completely out of favor as an investment fit and it is what it is that obviously there is some attraction to our dividend-paying abilities. Well, just to be clear, we are not looking for federal government help. Our biggest frustration is how we get taxed, real estate tax, ad valorem tax. Our biggest frustration historically, as you know, was the moratorium, on the Internet sales taxation. Thankfully, the Supreme Court overruled the Quale (01:30:40) decision. I forget – it's been so long though, I forgot the name. But thankfully, we could never get legislators to treat commerce fairly, whether it's brick-and-mortar Internet without – as you know, unless – wherever they had (01:31:02). So now that, that is more or less – and they left it to the states which I'm fine with. Pretty much everything is taxed on an equal playing field. But my biggest frustration is we are the golden goose when it comes to real estate tax payments compared to other real estate properties. Whether you look at how we're assessed per value versus warehouse, industrial. That needs to be addressed, but that's a local game. I mean, there's nothing nationally that's going to be done. Obviously, there's been a lot of jurisdictions in the COVID scenario that has treated enclosed malls a lot differently than enclosed retail even when they open. Forget essential – by the way, I get essential. I had no problem with essential, and both the federal and the state governments had to do what they had to do. But when they opened back up, a number of states dealt with the enclosed mall a lot differently than other retailers, and we were cleaner, had better protocols. We had better air and all those other stuff. But that was a high level of frustration, continues to be the case as we see what's going on in California. So trying to restructure the CMBS and that, we're not expecting that. Let the documents be the documents. I've got no problem with that. But it would be nice that we just got a little bit of the benefit on the real estate tax. And treating retailer – there's not a lot of difference, frankly, between a Costco store and a Simon mall when it comes to protocols and cleanliness and air quality, and by and large, man, let us compete. We suffered two months, 10,500 days where we could not compete, and that's what – that's just not fair. So I don't want anything other than the ability to compete. I don't worry about that one iota. We do – I'm sure we're going to make mistakes but we have to look at it from our standpoint and a lot less what others are doing. I don't think about it at all. Yeah. Thank you, Michael. Okay. I'm sorry. We are warbled on there but thanks for your calls and be safe, everyone."

For our prepared remarks, I’m pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid E. Simon: Good evening, and thank you for joining us today. I wish everyone listening today the best in these challenging times. Before I turn over to our first quarter results, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the entire Simon team for the work they have done and continue to do since the COVID-19 crisis began. The team has adapted to a constantly changing environment. We made difficult decisions and successfully transitioned to a remote work environment in our corporate and regional offices. We implemented new protocols to adapt how we operate our properties for the safety of our shoppers, employees and tenants. And I’m frankly very proud of the entire team, Simon team. Now turning to our first quarter results, they were largely in line with our expectations. Reported FFO, funds from operation, was $980.6 million or $2.78 per share. As a reminder, the prior year period included $0.24 per diluted share from insurance settlement proceeds and a gain on a sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property. In the current period, the operations of our investment in retailers were negatively impacted by approximately $0.06 per share pre-tax due to store closures as a result of the COVID-19 government shutdown. Adjusting the current period for the COVID-19 impact, our investment in retailers and the prior year period for the insurance proceeds and the residential asset sale gain that I mentioned above, comparable funds from operation for the current year period is $2.83 compared to last year of $2.80. Comp NOI was flat in the quarter and portfolio NOI decreased 20 basis points year-over-year. Occupancy for our premium and mall portfolio at quarter end was 94% average base minimum rent was $55.76. And our mall and outlet portfolio recorded leasing spreads of $2.80 per square foot or an increase of 4.6%. Reported retailer sales per square foot for our malls and outlets were $703 for the trailing 12 months ended February 29 compared to $660 in the prior-year period, an increase of 6.5%. When you include March, even though we were shut down since March 18, reported retailer sales still increased 2.1%. Our portfolio was performing well. We saw solid trends in shopper traffic, tenant demand, retail sales and our results including our retail investments until the COVID-19 stay-at-home recommendations and orders began to be issued in the middle of March. Now let’s talk about some of the actions we’ve taken. We were the first large retail owner and operator to close our property system-wide to address the spread of the pandemic. We’re the first to reopen our properties, of course subject to government stay-at-home orders and restrictions. We took immediate and decisive actions to aggressively reduce our operating costs and increase our financial resources, including but not limited to some of the following: suspended or eliminated more than $1 billion of capital for redevelopment and new development projects in the US and internationally. Our current investment focus is on projects nearing completion. We will re-evaluate all suspended projects over time. Importantly, our share of remaining net cash funding required to complete the new development and redevelopment projects under construction is approximately $160 million. We significantly reduced property operating expenses and all non-essential corporate spending. We also made some very, very difficult decisions regarding our employees, including a reduction in force and furloughed a certain of our field and corporate personnel due to closures of our properties as a result of government stay-at-home orders. We implemented a freeze on all hiring efforts. We lowered base salaries across the senior executive team and implemented a shared salary reduction plan for higher compensated employees and deferred certain executive bonuses. Our board also played their part by agreeing to temporarily reducing their cash retainer fees. And we drew down $3.75 billion under our revolving credit facility, which increased our cash position including our share of joint venture cash to over $4 billion at the end of March. Now some positive news on reopening, the health and safety of our communities of course will always be our highest priority. Last week, we started reopening our properties in markets where local and state closures orders have been lifted and where retail restrictions have been eased. As part of the ongoing reopening process, we published our comprehensive COVID-19 Exposure Control Policy that was developed in connection with the leading experts in the field of Epidemiology and Environmental Health and Safety experts in order to ensure the highest possible safety standards at our properties. You can see these on online, but let me just name a few. Our safety protocols include pre-emptive employee health screening, employee safety protections, promotion and enforcement of social distancing practices, enhanced sanitizing and disinfecting and of course shopper safeguards. These protocols meet or exceed the guidelines published by the CDC and are more robust and many of the measures deployed by essential businesses and online fulfillment centers that have remained opened during this pandemic. We implemented the temporary closures of our centers to protect our shoppers and the communities in which we serve from the spread of the coronavirus. We are now leading the effort for these local economies to get back to business while delivering a new elevated standard of safety for all. Now, we have opened, as of today, 77 of our properties and are planning to have approximately half of our US portfolio opened within the next week. We are, of course, working in conjunction with state and local governments on our reopening plans. Shopper response to our re-openings has been positive. And sales of many tenants have been better than their initial expectations. Additionally, we have opened 12 of our designer and international premium outlets. Now, let me turn to our tenant update. Of course, we’re in the midst of discussions with our tenants regarding their individual situation. And as such, it is not appropriate to comment on specific details or terms at this point due to the confidential nature of those discussions. Each situation is analyzed individually based upon our tenants’ market position, their financial status and the history and depth of our relationship. I am sure you can respect this. These discussions are ongoing. And as we complete them, we are more than prepared to share the appropriate information. Our tenants are eager to reopen their stores and we are working with them to do so. We are also very focused on helping local entrepreneurs reopen and are also supporting our restaurant operators both nationally and locally. Now, let me turn to the balance sheet. We have always maintained a strong balance sheet in order to capitalize on opportunities, but also to withstand economic downturns. On March 16, two days before we shut down our portfolio, we amended and extended our $4 billion credit facility with a $6 billion facility that includes a $2 billion delayed draw term loan. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $8.7 billion consisting of $4.6 billion of available credit facility, borrowing capacity and the $4.1 billion of cash mentioned earlier. As a reminder, the $8.7 billion is net of $1 billion of US and Euro commercial paper that was outstanding at quarter end. Commercial paper market is open and continues to find stability. Investment demand for our paper has increased allowing us to successfully issue over $375 million during the last couple weeks. We currently have approximately $500 million outstanding between our US and Euro CP programs. For the remainder of the year, we have $900 million of unsecured notes maturing and a limited number of maturing non-recourse secured loans to single purpose entity borrowers. Our debt covenants remain well above, well above the required levels with significant headroom. Now, given the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the global economic disruption it has caused, it is not currently possible to predict with certainty the pandemics impact on the rest of our year’s financial results. As a result, we are withdrawing our full-year 2020 guidance for estimated net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share, estimated FFO per diluted share and comparable property NOI growth, which we provided on February 4, 2020. As of today, over 700 public companies have withdrawn their full-year guidance. Let me turn to the dividend. The board will declare a second quarter dividend before the end of June and that dividend will be paid in cash. We expect to pay out at least 100% of our taxable income in 2020 in cash. As a point of reference, there had been over 175 public companies who have either suspended or reduced their common stock dividend by 50% or more. We will not be one of those companies. Let me turn to the Taubman transaction. As you know, we announced a transaction with Taubman on February 10, 2020 and we will not make any comments or provide any updates on this call about the status of the Taubman transaction. We will provide information as and when appropriate. Finally, concluding before we turn it over to Q&A, most importantly, I want to thank all of my colleagues for busting their ass. I also reflect on the last few weeks and how our company has responded two words come to mind, resilience and innovation. We have managed through many severe crisis over the decades whether natural disasters, bubble burst, numerous recessions, et cetera. Each crisis had its own unique circumstances just as we face today with this pandemic. Well, one thing I know with certain is Simon team will be focused on the long-term needs of our stakeholders and once again will come out ahead. And we’re now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Good evening. Good evening, David, out there. So, two questions from us. And first, David, on the dividend, good to hear you talk about cash given what we’ve heard from others on the whole offset between accrued rents still mandating taxable income versus cash. So, good to hear that you guys are going to pay cash. Just a question, as you guys have seen re-openings in Asia and your overseas centers, what lessons have you learned there and what have you seen as far as shopper rebound? Has it been more the core shopper coming back? Have people been pretty open to accepting all the accommodations and getting back to sort of normalcy or your view is from what you’ve seen overseas it may take longer for the shopper and the tenant to rebound?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, I think, it’s actually, we’ve been pleasantly surprised. We would like, I think, the retail community in Europe was a little bit more prepared to open. So, they’ve had a higher percentage of retailers open, Alex. And I think the biggest reason has been the rules there have been a little clearer. And they don’t have different municipalities basically directing different rules so to speak. So, they were a little bit more prepared, plus in a lot of cases their employees were not on furlough, so it was easier for them to get up, but I think our sales have been somewhat better than what we’re seeing in Europe. And in Asia, we’ve been basically open except recently Japan closed. But we were doing, believe it or not, reasonably well in Asia until kind of the last month when both Malaysia and Japan had to shut down. South Korea has been fine. So, I think as - I think the retail community didn’t anticipate we were going to open. We kept telling them we were going to open. We opened, but the consumers actually been very supportive. Obviously, they want to see more stores open as do we. But I think it’s a process and you got to get started and you go from there. So, some of the sales have been much better than what we expected and in some cases comped higher than last year. But that - I do think for the retailers that are opening, they’re gaining market share, they’re taking advantage of pent-up demand and I think others that aren’t ready are missing that opportunity. But that’s up for them. We’re not forcing the issue at all, but in terms of whether retailers open or not, but we want to help these local communities because frankly they depend on our sales tax and our real estate tax. I think the municipalities and the government ultimately are going to appreciate what we’ve done over year-after-year delivering sales and property tax payments and they don’t have that at the rate that they’re used to, and I think finally we’ll garner some respect that we deserve.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, obviously a lot of tenants, I guess, have not paid, you haven’t disclosed the level, but I’ll let that be. But have you noticed your tenants reaching out to their banks, their lenders, to get default waivers? So, if they’re not paying you, the landlord, they’re not being in default of their own lending standards or have you seen most of your tenants not applied for those waivers from their end?\nDavid E. Simon: I think they generally what I hear for the financially solid retailers, there’s not an issue in terms of them getting the capital. And, look, I will tell you, I mean, we’re not giving a percent of what we’ve collected. And let me just expand on it for a second if I could. First of all, we’re much better than what the prognosticators - I’ve read some things thinking, well, this is where we’re at. We’re doing better than that. But I also don’t think it’s appropriate to air our discussions in the public format. And also, you have to put in mind what percent we collect in April or May. It almost, in a sense, it’s not something overly to focus on because the reality is, we have a lease and they have to pay. So, we don’t have to give semantics. And the way I also think about it, obviously if they decide they are in bankruptcy, then that’s when they get the right to reject a lease. But here is also how I think about, and I just want you to understand this, Alex, say we got 50% and it’s a hypothetical. If I was a retailer and I paid the 50%, I’d be basically upset that there were 50% that didn’t pay on one hand. On the other hand, if I didn’t pay the 50%, I’d almost feel justified in not paying because the reality is, I’ve got another 50% of the retailers that didn’t pay. So, we know what we’re doing here. We will navigate this. It is not easy, but I just think it’s better to have our discussion directly with the retailers. And the bottom line is, we do have a contract and we do expect to get paid. And that I know somehow the market morphed into this number. But the reality is, our business is a lot more complex than some of these others. And remember, our rent roll is - a month of our rental roll is sometimes greater than these guys for the entire year. So, we’re a little more complicated, a little bigger and I think we’re navigating it appropriately. So, again, I wanted to give you context to that and I hope that was helpful.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you, David.\nDavid E. Simon: I also want to say the only reason I’m yelling is because I’m far away from the speaker in this social distancing, in our board room, for whatever reason the guy put me away from the speaker.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Can imagine why they did that.\nDavid E. Simon: Okay next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open.\nChristy McElroy: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. Understanding that you have significant liquidity through your cash balance in your expanded credit facility, as you get closer to the expected closing date of the Taubman merger, can you talk about your desire to issue longer term debt? We’ve seen some of the other higher rated REITs access the unsecured bond market. Is that something that you would pursue near-term and where do you think that you could issue that today in terms of accessing permanent capital in this market?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, again, I don’t know if you heard my opening remarks, but I...\nChristy McElroy: I did.\nDavid E. Simon: Okay. So, I have nothing to say on the further on Taubman. We’ll let you know when we have information to provide. So, there’s not much more I can say on that front.\nChristy McElroy: Well, I guess, just in terms of accessing debt capital in this market, have you looked at during the bond deal?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, at some point, we’re going to do a bond deal because it’s natural for us to do one every year. So, we’re in a rush to do one. We’re constantly marketing or reviewing the market. We can issue paper, but we’re going to be smart about it. We’re certainly not under the gun to issue any paper. Our ratios are as strong as anybody that’s out there. And we’ll just continue to monitor it. The good news is, the market’s there. And that’s why in a company like ours to have access to both private capital unsecured public debt market, mortgage market have all of those available to us is a real advantage.\nChristy McElroy: And then your contribution from straight-line rent, it looks like it was down from the recent quarterly run rate. To what extent was that impacted by a write-off of straight-line rent receivables? To what extent have you moved any of your tenants to cash basis accounting? And how are you thinking about that collectability assessment in the current environment versus previously?\nDavid E. Simon: Yeah. That’s essentially the new accounting rules that we enacted last year. And we don’t get into specifics about writing off straight-line rent receivables.\nBrian J. McDade: There wasn’t.\nDavid E. Simon: And there wasn’t any. Okay.\nChristy McElroy: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRichard Hill: Hey. Good evening, David. Two questions for me. First, I noticed in your supplement that you did not discuss occupancy costs. So, I was hoping you could maybe update on what you saw in the first quarter.\nThomas Ward: 15%.\nDavid E. Simon: Brian?\nBrian J. McDade: It was above 13%.\nRichard Hill: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nDavid E. Simon: Yeah.\nRichard Hill: Perfect. Thank you very much, Brian. Hey, David, and I wanted to maybe take a bigger picture question. Look, in the past, you’ve been active with retailers both Aéropostale and Forever 21. There’s obviously some distress in the retail market right now. I can’t help but think that you see this as a medium to long-term opportunity. Could you maybe update us on your thinking on retail investments at this point in time?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, look, I think our number one priority, if you saw or you listened to the early the call, I mean, our retailer investments were significantly impacted because of having to close stores. And I mean, the companies Nautica, Aéropostale and F 21 are in good shape. We have plenty of liquidity to manage the situation. But if not, I mean, our focus is to make sure that they’re doing what they need to do to position their business for profitability. They were not profitable in the first quarter. That’s why we pointed that out, last year was basically breakeven. So, we had basically a $0.06 change year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. I think our focus right now is on, Rich, is on those operations. We’re not going to rule it out. We’re only taking inbound calls. So, if people want us to think about something, we’re happy to do it. But we’re not out there running around soliciting investments. Priority is on what we got across the board, but I’m sure there will be opportunities and we’re in a position to be opportunistic if we think it helps our business.\nRichard Hill: Got it. That’s helpful. And maybe just one more quick question if I may.\nDavid E. Simon: Sure.\nRichard Hill: Do you have a sense to pay 100% of your taxable income, what percentage of your rent you need to collect in 2Q?\nBrian J. McDade: Well, I mean, frankly, we don’t collect a nickel. I mean, but we are, but we don’t - obviously it’s going to impact our taxable income over the year, it’s not a quarter-to-quarter issue. We’re going to make an estimate by basically June-ish, mid-June, what our taxable income looks and we’ll be smarter a month from now and that’s basically why we’re doing what we’re doing. And I think we will have been through most of whatever discussions we’re doing with our retailers. We’ll know at that point how many properties are not open. So, we’ll be able to narrow that down. We have a decent handle on it now, but the fact of the matter is, as long as we declare it in the second quarter I’d rather be smarter on it. And we think another month of making sure we know what’s going to open when, will give us a chance to really fine tune that, and then we’ll go from there.\nDavid E. Simon: In our...\nRichard Hill: All right.\nDavid E. Simon: And again, in my text, I gave you an indication of what it won’t be. Okay. So I’m not really certain what it will be, but I gave you a really good hint of what it won’t be. So, I hope you understand that. It’s there for people to consume, I guess. But put yourself in our shoes. I mean, today, we still don’t have half of portfolio up and running. So, it’s a little unusual, but I think in another month or so, we’ll be able to fine tune it.\nRichard Hill: Got it. David, thank you very much.\nDavid E. Simon: Sure.\nRichard Hill: Good luck. And I hope you and your team and your families are all safe and healthy.\nDavid E. Simon: You as well. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nMichael W. Mueller: Yeah, hi. I guess, thanks, first, what are the reopening expectations for the tenants that are on month-to-month leases in carts and kiosks?\nDavid E. Simon: I’m sorry, we didn’t get all of it, Mike. Can you - something about...\nMichael W. Mueller: Yeah.\nDavid E. Simon: Say it one more time.\nMichael W. Mueller: Yeah, I was going to say. Yeah. What are your expectations for the tenants that are on month-to-month leases and them reopening?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, most of those are local and entrepreneurs. And actually, I mean that’s the great thing about America. They want to open. They want to go to work. They want to open. We’re very focused on helping them. I mean, obviously, we’ll screw somebody up somewhere just because of our - we won’t do everything perfect, but we’re going to help that group. They want to open. And I’ve been very pleased and our team has been very pleased by the amount of local and month-to-month people that want to open. So, I think that’s their livelihood, and boy, do we appreciate that. And we want them now. Again, some are waiting for PPP and so on and so forth, but pretty good interest on that front.\nMichael W. Mueller: Got it. And for the centers that you reopened, about what percentage of the tenants opened up as well?\nDavid E. Simon: It varies all over the place. And every week, we’ll get better. Again, it was very interesting. I don’t think the community - even though we were trying to keep them up to speed and even though some days we had to change what we thought was going to happen because it changed and there was a very chaotic up and down waiting for governors to order real actions, some doing it, some not doing it, some deferring it to municipalities, I think we managed it as well. I can’t tell you how across the board the many states that really were impressed by our COVID response efforts across the board, and I talked to many governors, many chiefs of staff, and I think it was universal and praise and frankly our team worked very hard to do that. But I think our retail community just was waiting a little bit and now it’s coming, and I’m feeling good about it. But every property is different. I don’t have a number that says, of the 77 here it is, but it’ll get better each week. And the good news is, our department stores - I will tell you, our department stores were actually [ph] Dillard’s (00:35:30) department stores was ready with us. Macy’s is there with us. Belk is opening, Nordstrom is going to be opening in the next few weeks, even Neiman Marcus is opening. So that whole group - Kohl’s, we saw really good reception, communication and wanting to get open. I think I think people want to get open. They want - look, we have a job to do and how we operate differently than what it was a year ago. We understand that, we got to monitor that. But people are ready to open and compete with the broad array of options that the consumer has. The biggest misnomer in this whole thing was that industry was shut down not really, just certain industries were shut down. And I think our folks are ready to compete and we’ll see what happens.\nMichael W. Mueller: Got it. Thanks, David.\nDavid E. Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nLinda Tsai: Hi. Given where your stock trades on an implied cap rate basis, what’s your willingness to buy back shares at the current levels?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, I think, we’re going to be relatively conservative just given kind of the nature of the pandemic and making sure we get the portfolio open. Look, we did buy shares back in Q1 early, so we believe in our business. We also will say that when we look at what we’re planning to earn and again this is subject to change, but what we’re looking to probably earn this year and next year obviously is subject to fine tuning. We are tremendously undervalued, but we get it right now, we’re going to be conservative and there’s just no reason why we should be trading at this multiple. But we get it and we’ll be conservative and it is what it is. That’s not our primary focus right now. Getting the portfolio open, taking care of our employees, dealing with the retailers and the communities that’s the primary focus.\nLinda Tsai: That makes sense. And then, I realize you’re doing the bulk of redevelopment spend, but how do you feel about 7% to 9% yields on redevelopments longer term?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, I still feel reasonably good that our pipeline that we had was something that would be beneficial to the company and its shareholders. Obviously, we’ve got to see where we are. And we’re still early in this, even though I think we’ve turned the corner because we’re almost half open. But we still got a lot of properties to open. We do think this pandemic will affect certain properties differently. Obviously, you’ve got the Northeast where we don’t know when we’re going to open there. And some of those projects that were focused on will be - might change a property. And Oklahoma maybe office since go, a property somewhere else because of various factors we may put on hold for a while. So, it’s really going to be like it always has been, but even more today than ever. It’s going to be really focused on the nature of the particular property, where it’s located, the consumer demographics, all of this stuff is changing and we’ll just have to see it’s also going to be impacted by is it an indoor center or an outdoor center. So, all these things are at least currently with the pandemic, all basically things that we’re going to have to take into account for the future, and things are different. We recognize that.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks for those additional insight. I just have one last one. What are your expectations for remaining 2020 lease expirations?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, I mean, it’s going to be a retailer by retailer. I’m sure we’ll have some follow-up, but generally we have a prosperous portfolio for the retailer. I think the big issue is, what they estimate their sales to be this year. And obviously, the more they get comfort in that I think that the higher probability that we’ll have the success that we’ve had historically.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks.\nDavid E. Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nDerek Johnston: Hi. Hi, everyone. Good evening. So, David, your subsector has endured a heavy toll. And being at-home for a while, I think people probably do want to get out and hopefully shop. So, I mean, the question is, how does your cycle tested keen pull us out of this? And what are the plans to make customers and retailers comfortable, and I guess more importantly excited to get back to malls?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, obvious, Derek, when you say subsector, what are you referring to?\nDerek Johnston: I just mean malls in general, have really taken a heavy stall.\nDavid E. Simon: Derek, we are not a mall company. We are predominantly a retail real estate company, but we’re not - I wouldn’t, by any stretch of the imagination, consider us a mall company. So that’s essentially how I would answer. I mean, we are focused on retail real estate, but we are not a mall company, and I think we’ve been consistent on that for years.\nDerek Johnston: Okay. And second...\nDavid E. Simon: And I think the other point on your answer is, I think it’s going to - certain properties in certain areas are going to be just fine you know, and then others might take longer to get up to speed. And indoor, outdoor centers in that are dependent on tourism could be different. I think every property - you cannot, first of all, you got to understand we’re not a mall company. And number one, we’ve never said that even for years and years and years. And number two, every property is going to be somewhat affected differently and the demographics of what happens in that local trade area, is this oil go back up to $50. Again there’s no blanket statement, everything looks really has to be looked at in kind of a regionally and so on.\nDerek Johnston: Okay. Understood, and thank you. So, a lot of investors are going to bring negative assumptions and speculation from your lack of commentary on the Taubman merger. So, without talking about Taubman at all, what would you say to those investors here and now directly?\nDavid E. Simon: I said what I have to say, Derek.\nDerek Johnston: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid E. Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good afternoon. What was the rationale for reducing the redevelopment pipeline so drastically? Was it primarily a balance sheet related decision? And how do you think about the impact of taking a pause in redevelopment could have on the long-term positioning on some of these properties?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, Vince, believe it or not, I’m a grizzly veteran and I’ve seen - I am proud that we’ve always been able to flip or toggle switch on and off depending upon economic scenarios. And the reality is, we have a great type, it’ll end up being dependent upon the particular property. And we can switch it on completely, also remember that fact is construction was in a lot of places forced to shut down. And we felt it was appropriate to be conservative in the spend. And the reality is, we can turn it off, we can turn it on, we’re never going to get over our seat on that front, as I think about it, we’ll have two or three bigger decisions to make in Q3, Q4 on a couple projects, one internationally, two domestically and the rest of them will restart when we feel good about the environment.\nVince Tibone: That makes sense. So, just staying on redevelopment for a second, I mean, how do you see [ph] anchor (00:46:54) redevelopments changing post-COVID and when the economy starts to rebound? Can you just discuss kind of some high-level back selling plan, if there was an acceleration of department store closures?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, I mean, this, you guys are smart. I’m not sure I agree with a lot of your research, but I do appreciate you do a great job. What is variable that there will be some and it all depends on the opportunity, it all depends on property-specific information. We do think that department stores still play a meaningful role in a number of properties. They also whether through lease or not, there’s some good real-estate there. And we were, as you know, very focused on redeveloping those boxes that will continue to be a long-term focus for us without question. We have great real estate. We’re more than a mall company, and the ability to redevelop our great real estate is a hallmark of this company and something we will continue. There’s nothing wrong, we’ve taken a pause while we sort our way through a pandemic and we’ve dealt with a lot, I honestly say, I haven’t dealt with this, but we’re back up and running almost half the portfolio. We’re feeling good about what we’ve done, feel good about the balance sheet, feel good about our people and what they’re trying to accomplish. And again, I think the ability to redevelop real estate that we get back will be an important component of what we do to add value going forward. So, we’re not deterred by the current events, but we’re taking a pause as it sorts its way through.\nVince Tibone: Okay. That makes senses. Appreciate the color.\nDavid E. Simon: No worries.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCraig Schmidt: Thank you. You’ve been opened for two weekends. I wonder if you could comment on how consumers are being received by the different formats, outlet, malls, whatever and by the different geographies.\nDavid E. Simon: Well, I would certainly say, outdoor centers feel a little bit more comfortable. And I, obviously, would say that the states that we’re opening that it is so dependent upon the kind of the states and where things are. And generally, the suburban outside kind of the major dense areas seem to be doing better. I do think there’s pent up demand. I’d say the consumer is probably a little more moderate as opposed to high-end. Regarding our outlets, we’re seeing some really good traction with some of the higher-end brands as they sell their goods. So, I do think that maybe from a moderate customer that’s having the ability to shop there. But it’s a little early to say that some of our good bread and butter states, we feel pretty encouraged by.\nCraig Schmidt: Great. And then I just wondered if there were any plans to expand or extend curbside shopping helping the consumers transition to shopping in-store again.\nDavid E. Simon: Well, sure. I mean, in some cases that’s all that you can do. And we’re there to help the retailer if they need our help. But in a lot of cases, they’ve already have their own protocols. So, look, I think it’s helpful and beneficial, but it’s more important ultimately for us to get our properties open fully.\nCraig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid E. Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nR. Jeremy Metz: Hey, thank you. David, I was hoping you can maybe discuss the reduction in the operating costs a little more in terms of what you’ve been able to do and if you can quantify the actual savings that you expect here on the full year of operations versus maybe your initial budget? And along those same lines with most of your tenants on fixed cam reimbursement, is there any carry through there or no and maybe you can just also quantify the reduction in the corporate spending just help us get a better feel to what that actually looks like? Thanks.\nDavid E. Simon: Yeah. Jeremy, as you know we went through guidance so we really can’t do that. But obviously when your property is not allowed to operate and open and we have the ability to reduce all sorts of costs and that’s really on one hand, on the other hand if you take and if you see in our protocols and we do open, we’re going to have an additional cost of running the centers. And it’s hard for me to give you a number because the reality is I don’t know when we’re going to be able to open the entire portfolio. But as soon as we do that we’ll try to give you the new normal. But when we are opening, we are one shift. So that does save us. I’m hopeful that at some point we will come away with that because that’s a good sign, but we’re not quite there yet. But when we do open, we have extra maintenance cleaning et cetera. So there’s so many variables right now it’s just I can’t really do it and it’s hard to do it right now without knowing when the entire system opens up and how it opens up and what our restrictions are going to be. By the way we don’t think they should be just to be go on the record, we do think we should be able to be open. We have terrific protocols. They are as good as any of our other competitors which are the online only operators and the big boxes and so on that continue to operate. We have the same distancing. We’re limiting the amount of personnel. We’re handing out mask. We’re doing everything that all of the other competitors are doing including the major online competitors. So, we do think, we should hope - I mean, I want to go on record saying that and we do think we should calibrate that obviously. We’re prepared to operate clearly within any government protocols but we do feel like we should open. And that clearly our outdoor centers should clearly open, but main event, I just can’t give you the number because I don’t really know when we’re opening. We are saving some money but as we get open a lot of that will go back into the property to maintain the protocols that we’re helping to - what we’re doing our share in those communities. I hope the communities appreciate what we’re doing. I hope they appreciate what we do not only in sales tax, but in property tax. My favorite obviously is in Long Island, where I won’t name them all but we can probably in total over $60 million in property taxes for a couple of properties. My guess is, with right protocols, we ought to get a chance to see what we can do especially as our competitors are open and selling stuff that’s clearly more than non-essential. A long-winded answer to your answer to your very straight forward question, which is I can’t really give you that, okay.\nR. Jeremy Metz: I think that’s fair. And just are you willing to comment on the employee side as you’ve reopened properties and taken employees off furlough? Have you seen any attrition or employees simply not returning and that’s something that’s kind of percolated out there as a possible concern?\nDavid E. Simon: Yeah. Listen, I think just the whole employee thing, even in the - when I went back to Indianapolis, was 1990. And obviously retail real estate - that was a serious recession, and we had to go through very painful downsizing. This is since that, basically 30 years ago, we’ve never really had a reduction in force even in the recession. The Great Recession in 2008-2009, we didn’t have a reduction in force. So, we went through that. I feel personally terrible for it. And then, you couple that with the furlough that we had to do. So, just a very painful scenario. And I do think, as soon as we get our system open, I’m hopeful that we’re going to call as many people back as we can from furlough, I hope they - not that they should, but I hope they at least can understand why we did what we had to do and I hope they do come back. I do think we’ve been pretty good so far on what we’ve opened. And I think as our level of activity increases, we’re going to bring as many folks back as we can. We did have a permanent reduction in force. We do not plan on bringing those folks back. And obviously that’s not something we wanted to do. I didn’t think I had to do that again. We built this company not to do that, but we felt like we had to do that. And I apologize to the folks that were impacted by it. There’s no good excuse.\nR. Jeremy Metz: Yeah. No. And the second one for me, just a little more positive, to go back to your opening comments about innovation coming to mind the last few weeks. Maybe you can just expand a little bit more what that means, what you’re doing differently? And then just what else maybe bigger picture you’re looking to do as you start to think about potential changes to the model and how to adapt your centers and curate them possibly differently including just you were going down the path of adding some mixed use. Does this change that aspect at all, or just too early to make some of those calls? Thanks, Dave.\nDavid E. Simon: No. As I mentioned earlier, Jeremy, I do think the whole redevelopment of our properties will continue to be very important. I would look at what we’re doing now as a pause making sure that we have a better feel for the landscape. And the fact is, you can’t redevelop anything if you can’t open your property. Okay? So, please understand we’re still confronted with that dilemma. I think we’ve just been so innovative on how we opened the portfolio. I mean, the ability to do what we did as fast as we did as high level as we did. I don’t think anybody really could appreciate that in scale and scope. I think and what we’re trying to do with our retailers again, I’m sure there’ll be a difference of opinion on that. But what we’re trying to do in terms of listening to what their issues are, maybe not agreeing, but certainly trying to have a constructive dialogue, segmenting the retailers out in various categories, putting the right people involved. Again, we’re not going to bat 1.000, we’re going to have some conflicts because we do believe in our contracts. But we’re clearly trying to do that innovatively, we’re really focused on the local community trying to be innovative there and then just listening to consumer on what we can do and learn from there. And then I think technology will be added to our properties to enhance the consumer experience and certainly to keep them safe. So, there’s a lot more to come, but we are basically eight weeks into this, right, almost eighth week.\nBrian J. McDade: Yeah.\nDavid E. Simon: And we’re learning a lot and doing a lot. I expect that to continue.\nR. Jeremy Metz: Okay. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Good afternoon. So, David, whether a mall or a retail real estate center is open or not, one of the challenges that you face is just diminished capacity, right, just less traffic than normal. So, I’m just curious conceptually, I don’t really care about the April or May rent collection, but just conceptually how are you thinking about what rents should be during this kind of transitional phase? And is your approach more along the lines of A, if the city is open and the mall is opened safely, rent is due or something a little bit more accommodating?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, again, I think the short answer is, I think I’ve addressed a lot of this, but the short answer is, it’s very much a property by property and a retail by retail process that we go through. We use the judgment that we’ve had 60 years of experience. We will not always get it right, but we try to rely on that. We also, from the retailer, how they’re treating us. I mean, it’s a two-way street. And we try to put it in a blender and find out a solution. I’m hopeful we can do that, but there’s no guarantee that that we can. And I think the receptivity from our properties is really going to be, I mean, I do think it’s going to be a lot of it will depend on the consumer demographics and where that property is, and what the psyche of that consumer really has been affected. I can assure you at least based on what I’m seeing that in certain properties that reopen, the psyche of that consumer hasn’t really been affected. It may be affected elsewhere.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And you’ve talked about the benefits of the [ph] finance (01:05:09) platform and the scale that you have and how much of an advantage it is. Just broadly speaking, do you think in this type of environment where there’s going to be some economic challenges, companies that don’t have the same scale, may be smaller, could be disproportionately impacted?\nDavid E. Simon: Yes, without question.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. I just wanted to go back to this topic of rent deferrals. I mean, you do in the 10-K disclose that you have given some rent deferrals, you’re not saying what they were or not, but I guess I’m just wondering what drove the decision to do rent deferrals, which you did do some so far versus conversations that you still have with tenants where you haven’t made a decision yet what the outcome is going to be?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, it’s a retailer by retailer discussion. I mean, we went out our way knowing the extraordinary changes that this pandemic has created. And given our financial wherewithal, we went out of the way to offer deferral for a lot of our retailers. And we felt that was we had the balance sheet and the cash flow and everything else to do it and we just felt it was the right thing to do. Even though there’s nothing in the contract that alleviates their contractual life to pay rent in the 95% trial of our leases. So, we just felt like we can help, simple as that.\nNicholas Yulico: And in terms of just going back to the timing of, I think you said by the time June comes around, the board is going to have more information on taxable income, other items I guess about ultimate collection of rents. How much though is that going to depend on the reopening of your centers? And I guess, as well how much of your - if you had already given some deferrals, I mean, how much of the portfolio is kind of in question right now in terms of where ultimate rent collection is going to be and why is it that when you get to June you think you’re going to have, the board is going to have more confidence in ultimately where your income may settle out this year?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, I mean, because the reality for opening centers now which was the first hurdle will know, every week we’re all opening more centers. We’ll make further progress on where we are with our retailers. At the amount of information that I have today versus what I had a month ago is exponentially high. I would expect the same thing to occur. And it’s the most thoughtful thing to do since it will still be declared in our second quarter is to have another month of information or thereabouts on all the factors that go into our taxable income. And again, I mean, I indicated earlier I don’t know if you listened to my opening remarks where we think it is today, but another month, five weeks from now or no more, not that complicated.\nNicholas Yulico: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nWes Golladay: Hi, guys. Just have a few quick modeling questions. First one is, you have much exposure to hotels. I imagine it’s pretty small, but with RevPAR down 90%, it might start to show up in the numbers.\nDavid E. Simon: Very small, the ones that we do have are not open. I think one is actually, but yeah it’s very small, very small.\nWes Golladay: Yeah. Okay. And then going into your accounting expertise here, now that the pipeline is smaller, will you be capitalizing cost going forward or with the projects in a suspension mode, can you still capitalize the costs?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, you can’t capitalize the cost if it’s suspended. It’s not going to be a material change one way or another.\nBrian J. McDade: Wes, you would keep capitalizing costs on those projects that are still active as of right now.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thank you very much.\nDavid E. Simon: No worries.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is now open.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: Hey, it’s Michael Bilerman with Christy. David, I think we all want to know how you do the homeschooling rather than what you’re doing on the business side.\nDavid E. Simon: Homeschooling?\nMichael Jason Bilerman: Yeah. What you’re doing - how you are as a teacher rather than you are as a CEO?\nDavid E. Simon: That’s very good. I’m not sure what I do well. Okay.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: So, as you think about on the dividend, can you talk about the June making decision, why not wait until the end of the year because it’s an annual election on the quarterly election and sort of figure out when all said and done, because I don’t think any of us know the depths and lengths of this pandemic and things we could get a resurgence in the fall. We may get a resurgence from all the re-openings right now. So, why not wait until there is perfect clarity for annual taxable income?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, I think, we’ll be in a pretty good spot. I mean, we’re bucketing it now. We just want to reaffirm our buckets and get more information. I want to - you did say something about our openings unequivocally, you’re not going to increase in my opinion the potential spread of COVID. And communities may go up, but don’t blame - unless you have science, don’t blame it, don’t blame our openings on an increase and that community is COVID. I’m not sure that I would create that causation, okay.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: No, I’m not saying if your asset...\nDavid E. Simon: I guess, you said something and I just wanted to make it clear.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: No, I was saying just generally, yeah. Generally...\nDavid E. Simon: Yeah, generally. Okay, look, I think it’s possible, right. I mean, there could be markets where there is a spike and it’s reduced, but I mean, common sense would indicate we’re just going to have to figure out how to live with this threat for a while. And again, I mean, I’m not in-charge, but we’ll do what we need to do. And if there’s better technology or if there’s a better idea, our protocols and I said to state, municipalities and we study what everybody is doing but the reality is if there’s a better way to do what we’re doing, we’ll do it. That’s simple. And because it will change, I mean, there will be better protocols than what we initially set forth.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: Right.\nDavid E. Simon: But, Michael, look, I think it’s important to the best in the community to do the core - I mean, it goes back to your first part. I mean, I do think it’s good to have a quarterly cadence. We’re in a position financially to do that. And the reality is, we think it’s the right thing to do just to fine tune it, get more data over the next four to five weeks and go from there.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: Right. And pay it in cash greater than 50% of where it was before, which was in your opening comments.\nDavid E. Simon: Well, I think we said, we won’t be like probably by the time it’s June, it’ll be over 200. I said it won’t be at least 200 companies that will be less than 50% based on what we know today on our modeling. So, I will pay it in cash and we’re going to pay our taxable income and we’re not going to do that weird stuff that whatever they call it, what do they call it, I think the strangling of one tax year to the next.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: As you think about going into this pandemic, obviously the retailers a number of them were struggling. And I think one of the frustrations you had was on the e-commerce businesses that a lot of these retailers are operating were generated a lot of the sales by your assets. And so, while the sales didn’t take place at your mall or outlet or mill center, they were developed from that interaction. As you think about where we are today with most of the retailers not having access to their store front, obviously the e-com activities are growing pretty substantially in getting a lot bigger adoption by consumers. Is there an opportunity as you go forward in these restructurings or deferrals or whatever you’re dealing with your tenants to restructure all of the leases with the retailers to bring things to sort of the current marketplace relative to when those leases were first signed?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, look, I think that, let’s just say this. The internet for retail whether it’s a marketplace or direct-to-consumer or any other method is a big competitor to our entire industry. It is part of our industry. And we always have to compete with it. And our greatest asset is the physical one and service, and those kind of things. And we will have to see how that evolves. I do think a number of retailers are frankly shipping right now even if we’re in a place where we’re not allowed to operate, a lot of retailers were accessing their store and shipping directly from that store. So, it’ll be interesting to see what happens with that even though we were not able to operate, they’re in their operating, I’m sure they’re social distancing and all that stuff. But there’re in their operating selling e-commerce. So, look, it is the internet certainly it would be hard to intellectually argue that it’s this scenario has increased adoption for it and though we compete, we’ll figure out how to compete. The stores are important to the retailers that have both. And I think that will remain the same. I do think perhaps there is some thinking out there that they don’t need as big a storefront or store network. I think that could backfire on them in the long run because it’s kind of out of sight, out of mind.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: Yeah.\nDavid E. Simon: And but we’ll see. I am sure there will be some retailers that will get the sense that the fleet, the store network is not as important as it was three months ago.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: Right.\nDavid E. Simon: I think that - we’ll see how that shakes out, and what role we can play in that. I think they might be making a wrong decision, but that’s not for me to say. That’s just my own instinct.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: I mean, look, do you hear about people saying with office space we now have to go back to the office. There’s not going to be any stores. So, I don’t see us being in our homes 100% of the time working and shopping. I do think we live in a society that crave some of that. But there’s going to be significant change as we come through this because a lot of your tenants unfortunately don’t have the wherewithal to get through, a lot of tenants just don’t have the wherewithal whether they’re office tenants living in an apartment, I mean it’s a real recession going on. And so, it’s just getting from point A to point B.\nDavid E. Simon: We are clearly aware of that for sure.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: Yeah. Last question and I get your comment. No comment, status update from Tom, and the question I have is, why? So what is the rationale? You don’t have a shareholder vote. So, I didn’t think there would be anything restrictive on that. You talked a lot about the decisive actions you’re taking, immediate actions you’re taking, aggressive actions that you’ve taken to protect your enterprise. Why not mention anything about pretty sizable deal that you entered into where there is a proxy upstanding? What’s the rationale for not providing any updates?\nDavid E. Simon: Look, Michael, the only reason why I let you get back on the call is because you make me laugh and you’re a good guy, but the reality is I’ve already answered this question. And do you have anything else let me know.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: Right. No, it was just more so I didn’t want to get - I just didn’t know if there was a legal reason why, that’s the only thing I didn’t know if it was a legality thing you can speak about it, that’s why I asked in that way.\nA - David E. Simon:\nMichael Jason Bilerman: All right. I appreciate the time, David, as always.\nDavid E. Simon: Thank you. Be well.\nMichael Jason Bilerman: You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, good evening out there. Thanks for accommodating my question. David what can you tell us, what update can you provide us on Forever 21 specifically. I understand your earlier comments on liquidity and you’re not making any new retail level investments here, but I’m curious if you’ve been investing capital today in the Forever 21 platform specifically for the long-term is still worthwhile in this environment?\nDavid E. Simon: We actually capitalize it pretty reasonably well. So we’re in good shape right now and there’s no need for additional capital. So obviously it’s important for them to get the stores up and running and operating, but it’s between us and our partners of Authentic Brands group in Brookfield, we’re in pretty good shape to weather the storm.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Helpful. What can you tell us about the Carson outlet joint venture project you have with Macerich? I understand it’s a bit of a court battle with the city going on there and that the project you did is in bit of a standstill. But I’m curious if you think the project is on in the future and if you still be willing to pursue this project once normalcy return to the world and it might be a project you’d be willing to pursue on your own if need be?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, look, the only - since it’s in litigation, I really can’t comment, but I encourage you to read the complaint that we and Macerich filed against the agency. And...\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay.\nDavid E. Simon: And it’s all, I mean, it’s a lot, but it’s all spelled out and plenty of time is passed. This was - this has nothing to do with the pandemic. This was going on for several months, but I encourage you to read the complaint. It’s all spelled out black and white lots of pictures too. I think the colored actually I’m not even sure but some are colored. Okay.\nHaendel St. Juste: Sure. Sure. We’ve taken a look. We’re just curious if there is something that perhaps has a long term future. But I understand what’s going on. So, lastly how should we think - I’m wondering, I guess, how your redevelopment approach overall might change your post COVID 19, are going to require more of a premium spread that the yield spread versus the cap rates even matter. And any thoughts on what a more appropriate measure or how you would focus quantitatively in determining which project to pursue versus the others?\nDavid E. Simon: Well, I mean it’s a lot of it’s based on our years of experience in judgment. It’s interesting, the cap rates matter. That’s a very good question. Okay. Put that aside. We look at return on investment and obviously if it’s too low you’re not creating any value for the shareholders. So cap rates are and are not necessarily a science. We tend to look on return on equity, return on investment. But look I think right now we’re just we’re focused on finishing what’s really almost ready to complete. We have and then we’re focused obviously on getting our portfolio up and running and that those are the priorities right now.\nHaendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Thank you.\nDavid E. Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.\nDavid E. Simon: Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate your allowing us to move the call. We changed it up because we have our shareholder meeting tomorrow. And that was the only way we could pull everybody together in the remote office. So thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "content": "Good evening, and thank you for joining us today. I wish everyone listening today the best in these challenging times. Before I turn over to our first quarter results, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the entire Simon team for the work they have done and continue to do since the COVID-19 crisis began. The team has adapted to a constantly changing environment. We made difficult decisions and successfully transitioned to a remote work environment in our corporate and regional offices. We implemented new protocols to adapt how we operate our properties for the safety of our shoppers, employees and tenants. And I'm frankly very proud of the entire team, Simon team. Now turning to our first quarter results, they were largely in line with our expectations. Reported FFO, funds from operation, was $980.6 million or $2.78 per share. As a reminder, the prior year period included $0.24 per diluted share from insurance settlement proceeds and a gain on a sale of our interest in a multi-family residential property. In the current period, the operations of our investment in retailers were negatively impacted by approximately $0.06 per share pre-tax due to store closures as a result of the COVID-19 government shutdown. Adjusting the current period for the COVID-19 impact, our investment in retailers and the prior year period for the insurance proceeds and the residential asset sale gain that I mentioned above, comparable funds from operation for the current year period is $2.83 compared to last year of $2.80. Comp NOI was flat in the quarter and portfolio NOI decreased 20 basis points year-over-year. Occupancy for our premium and mall portfolio at quarter end was 94% average base minimum rent was $55.76. And our mall and outlet portfolio recorded leasing spreads of $2.80 per square foot or an increase of 4.6%. Reported retailer sales per square foot for our malls and outlets were $703 for the trailing 12 months ended February 29 compared to $660 in the prior-year period, an increase of 6.5%. When you include March, even though we were shut down since March 18, reported retailer sales still increased 2.1%. Our portfolio was performing well. We saw solid trends in shopper traffic, tenant demand, retail sales and our results including our retail investments until the COVID-19 stay-at-home recommendations and orders began to be issued in the middle of March. Now let's talk about some of the actions we've taken. We were the first large retail owner and operator to close our property system-wide to address the spread of the pandemic. We're the first to reopen our properties, of course subject to government stay-at-home orders and restrictions. We took immediate and decisive actions to aggressively reduce our operating costs and increase our financial resources, including but not limited to some of the following: suspended or eliminated more than $1 billion of capital for redevelopment and new development projects in the US and internationally. Our current investment focus is on projects nearing completion. We will re-evaluate all suspended projects over time. Importantly, our share of remaining net cash funding required to complete the new development and redevelopment projects under construction is approximately $160 million. We significantly reduced property operating expenses and all non-essential corporate spending. We also made some very, very difficult decisions regarding our employees, including a reduction in force and furloughed a certain of our field and corporate personnel due to closures of our properties as a result of government stay-at-home orders. We implemented a freeze on all hiring efforts. We lowered base salaries across the senior executive team and implemented a shared salary reduction plan for higher compensated employees and deferred certain executive bonuses. Our board also played their part by agreeing to temporarily reducing their cash retainer fees. And we drew down $3.75 billion under our revolving credit facility, which increased our cash position including our share of joint venture cash to over $4 billion at the end of March. Now some positive news on reopening, the health and safety of our communities of course will always be our highest priority. Last week, we started reopening our properties in markets where local and state closures orders have been lifted and where retail restrictions have been eased. As part of the ongoing reopening process, we published our comprehensive COVID-19 Exposure Control Policy that was developed in connection with the leading experts in the field of Epidemiology and Environmental Health and Safety experts in order to ensure the highest possible safety standards at our properties. You can see these on online, but let me just name a few. Our safety protocols include pre-emptive employee health screening, employee safety protections, promotion and enforcement of social distancing practices, enhanced sanitizing and disinfecting and of course shopper safeguards. These protocols meet or exceed the guidelines published by the CDC and are more robust and many of the measures deployed by essential businesses and online fulfillment centers that have remained opened during this pandemic. We implemented the temporary closures of our centers to protect our shoppers and the communities in which we serve from the spread of the coronavirus. We are now leading the effort for these local economies to get back to business while delivering a new elevated standard of safety for all. Now, we have opened, as of today, 77 of our properties and are planning to have approximately half of our US portfolio opened within the next week. We are, of course, working in conjunction with state and local governments on our reopening plans. Shopper response to our re-openings has been positive. And sales of many tenants have been better than their initial expectations. Additionally, we have opened 12 of our designer and international premium outlets. Now, let me turn to our tenant update. Of course, we're in the midst of discussions with our tenants regarding their individual situation. And as such, it is not appropriate to comment on specific details or terms at this point due to the confidential nature of those discussions. Each situation is analyzed individually based upon our tenants' market position, their financial status and the history and depth of our relationship. I am sure you can respect this. These discussions are ongoing. And as we complete them, we are more than prepared to share the appropriate information. Our tenants are eager to reopen their stores and we are working with them to do so. We are also very focused on helping local entrepreneurs reopen and are also supporting our restaurant operators both nationally and locally. Now, let me turn to the balance sheet. We have always maintained a strong balance sheet in order to capitalize on opportunities, but also to withstand economic downturns. On March 16, two days before we shut down our portfolio, we amended and extended our $4 billion credit facility with a $6 billion facility that includes a $2 billion delayed draw term loan. At quarter end, our total liquidity was $8.7 billion consisting of $4.6 billion of available credit facility, borrowing capacity and the $4.1 billion of cash mentioned earlier. As a reminder, the $8.7 billion is net of $1 billion of US and Euro commercial paper that was outstanding at quarter end. Commercial paper market is open and continues to find stability. Investment demand for our paper has increased allowing us to successfully issue over $375 million during the last couple weeks. We currently have approximately $500 million outstanding between our US and Euro CP programs. For the remainder of the year, we have $900 million of unsecured notes maturing and a limited number of maturing non-recourse secured loans to single purpose entity borrowers. Our debt covenants remain well above, well above the required levels with significant headroom. Now, given the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the global economic disruption it has caused, it is not currently possible to predict with certainty the pandemics impact on the rest of our year's financial results. As a result, we are withdrawing our full-year 2020 guidance for estimated net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share, estimated FFO per diluted share and comparable property NOI growth, which we provided on February 4, 2020. As of today, over 700 public companies have withdrawn their full-year guidance. Let me turn to the dividend. The board will declare a second quarter dividend before the end of June and that dividend will be paid in cash. We expect to pay out at least 100% of our taxable income in 2020 in cash. As a point of reference, there had been over 175 public companies who have either suspended or reduced their common stock dividend by 50% or more. We will not be one of those companies. Let me turn to the Taubman transaction. As you know, we announced a transaction with Taubman on February 10, 2020 and we will not make any comments or provide any updates on this call about the status of the Taubman transaction. We will provide information as and when appropriate. Finally, concluding before we turn it over to Q&A, most importantly, I want to thank all of my colleagues for busting their ass. I also reflect on the last few weeks and how our company has responded two words come to mind, resilience and innovation. We have managed through many severe crisis over the decades whether natural disasters, bubble burst, numerous recessions, et cetera. Each crisis had its own unique circumstances just as we face today with this pandemic. Well, one thing I know with certain is Simon team will be focused on the long-term needs of our stakeholders and once again will come out ahead. And we're now ready for questions. Well, I think, it's actually, we've been pleasantly surprised. We would like, I think, the retail community in Europe was a little bit more prepared to open. So, they've had a higher percentage of retailers open, Alex. And I think the biggest reason has been the rules there have been a little clearer. And they don't have different municipalities basically directing different rules so to speak. So, they were a little bit more prepared, plus in a lot of cases their employees were not on furlough, so it was easier for them to get up, but I think our sales have been somewhat better than what we're seeing in Europe. And in Asia, we've been basically open except recently Japan closed. But we were doing, believe it or not, reasonably well in Asia until kind of the last month when both Malaysia and Japan had to shut down. South Korea has been fine. So, I think as - I think the retail community didn't anticipate we were going to open. We kept telling them we were going to open. We opened, but the consumers actually been very supportive. Obviously, they want to see more stores open as do we. But I think it's a process and you got to get started and you go from there. So, some of the sales have been much better than what we expected and in some cases comped higher than last year. But that - I do think for the retailers that are opening, they're gaining market share, they're taking advantage of pent-up demand and I think others that aren't ready are missing that opportunity. But that's up for them. We're not forcing the issue at all, but in terms of whether retailers open or not, but we want to help these local communities because frankly they depend on our sales tax and our real estate tax. I think the municipalities and the government ultimately are going to appreciate what we've done over year-after-year delivering sales and property tax payments and they don't have that at the rate that they're used to, and I think finally we'll garner some respect that we deserve. I think they generally what I hear for the financially solid retailers, there's not an issue in terms of them getting the capital. And, look, I will tell you, I mean, we're not giving a percent of what we've collected. And let me just expand on it for a second if I could. First of all, we're much better than what the prognosticators - I've read some things thinking, well, this is where we're at. We're doing better than that. But I also don't think it's appropriate to air our discussions in the public format. And also, you have to put in mind what percent we collect in April or May. It almost, in a sense, it's not something overly to focus on because the reality is, we have a lease and they have to pay. So, we don't have to give semantics. And the way I also think about it, obviously if they decide they are in bankruptcy, then that's when they get the right to reject a lease. But here is also how I think about, and I just want you to understand this, Alex, say we got 50% and it's a hypothetical. If I was a retailer and I paid the 50%, I'd be basically upset that there were 50% that didn't pay on one hand. On the other hand, if I didn't pay the 50%, I'd almost feel justified in not paying because the reality is, I've got another 50% of the retailers that didn't pay. So, we know what we're doing here. We will navigate this. It is not easy, but I just think it's better to have our discussion directly with the retailers. And the bottom line is, we do have a contract and we do expect to get paid. And that I know somehow the market morphed into this number. But the reality is, our business is a lot more complex than some of these others. And remember, our rent roll is - a month of our rental roll is sometimes greater than these guys for the entire year. So, we're a little more complicated, a little bigger and I think we're navigating it appropriately. So, again, I wanted to give you context to that and I hope that was helpful. I also want to say the only reason I'm yelling is because I'm far away from the speaker in this social distancing, in our board room, for whatever reason the guy put me away from the speaker. Okay next question. Well, again, I don't know if you heard my opening remarks, but I... Okay. So, I have nothing to say on the further on Taubman. We'll let you know when we have information to provide. So, there's not much more I can say on that front. Well, at some point, we're going to do a bond deal because it's natural for us to do one every year. So, we're in a rush to do one. We're constantly marketing or reviewing the market. We can issue paper, but we're going to be smart about it. We're certainly not under the gun to issue any paper. Our ratios are as strong as anybody that's out there. And we'll just continue to monitor it. The good news is, the market's there. And that's why in a company like ours to have access to both private capital unsecured public debt market, mortgage market have all of those available to us is a real advantage. Yeah. That's essentially the new accounting rules that we enacted last year. And we don't get into specifics about writing off straight-line rent receivables. And there wasn't any. Okay. Brian? Yeah. Well, look, I think our number one priority, if you saw or you listened to the early the call, I mean, our retailer investments were significantly impacted because of having to close stores. And I mean, the companies Nautica, Aéropostale and F 21 are in good shape. We have plenty of liquidity to manage the situation. But if not, I mean, our focus is to make sure that they're doing what they need to do to position their business for profitability. They were not profitable in the first quarter. That's why we pointed that out, last year was basically breakeven. So, we had basically a $0.06 change year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. I think our focus right now is on, Rich, is on those operations. We're not going to rule it out. We're only taking inbound calls. So, if people want us to think about something, we're happy to do it. But we're not out there running around soliciting investments. Priority is on what we got across the board, but I'm sure there will be opportunities and we're in a position to be opportunistic if we think it helps our business. Sure. In our... And again, in my text, I gave you an indication of what it won't be. Okay. So I'm not really certain what it will be, but I gave you a really good hint of what it won't be. So, I hope you understand that. It's there for people to consume, I guess. But put yourself in our shoes. I mean, today, we still don't have half of portfolio up and running. So, it's a little unusual, but I think in another month or so, we'll be able to fine tune it. Sure. You as well. Thank you. I'm sorry, we didn't get all of it, Mike. Can you - something about... Say it one more time. Well, most of those are local and entrepreneurs. And actually, I mean that's the great thing about America. They want to open. They want to go to work. They want to open. We're very focused on helping them. I mean, obviously, we'll screw somebody up somewhere just because of our - we won't do everything perfect, but we're going to help that group. They want to open. And I've been very pleased and our team has been very pleased by the amount of local and month-to-month people that want to open. So, I think that's their livelihood, and boy, do we appreciate that. And we want them now. Again, some are waiting for PPP and so on and so forth, but pretty good interest on that front. It varies all over the place. And every week, we'll get better. Again, it was very interesting. I don't think the community - even though we were trying to keep them up to speed and even though some days we had to change what we thought was going to happen because it changed and there was a very chaotic up and down waiting for governors to order real actions, some doing it, some not doing it, some deferring it to municipalities, I think we managed it as well. I can't tell you how across the board the many states that really were impressed by our COVID response efforts across the board, and I talked to many governors, many chiefs of staff, and I think it was universal and praise and frankly our team worked very hard to do that. But I think our retail community just was waiting a little bit and now it's coming, and I'm feeling good about it. But every property is different. I don't have a number that says, of the 77 here it is, but it'll get better each week. And the good news is, our department stores - I will tell you, our department stores were actually [ph] Dillard's (00:35:30) department stores was ready with us. Macy's is there with us. Belk is opening, Nordstrom is going to be opening in the next few weeks, even Neiman Marcus is opening. So that whole group - Kohl's, we saw really good reception, communication and wanting to get open. I think I think people want to get open. They want - look, we have a job to do and how we operate differently than what it was a year ago. We understand that, we got to monitor that. But people are ready to open and compete with the broad array of options that the consumer has. The biggest misnomer in this whole thing was that industry was shut down not really, just certain industries were shut down. And I think our folks are ready to compete and we'll see what happens. Sure. Well, I think, we're going to be relatively conservative just given kind of the nature of the pandemic and making sure we get the portfolio open. Look, we did buy shares back in Q1 early, so we believe in our business. We also will say that when we look at what we're planning to earn and again this is subject to change, but what we're looking to probably earn this year and next year obviously is subject to fine tuning. We are tremendously undervalued, but we get it right now, we're going to be conservative and there's just no reason why we should be trading at this multiple. But we get it and we'll be conservative and it is what it is. That's not our primary focus right now. Getting the portfolio open, taking care of our employees, dealing with the retailers and the communities that's the primary focus. Well, I still feel reasonably good that our pipeline that we had was something that would be beneficial to the company and its shareholders. Obviously, we've got to see where we are. And we're still early in this, even though I think we've turned the corner because we're almost half open. But we still got a lot of properties to open. We do think this pandemic will affect certain properties differently. Obviously, you've got the Northeast where we don't know when we're going to open there. And some of those projects that were focused on will be - might change a property. And Oklahoma maybe office since go, a property somewhere else because of various factors we may put on hold for a while. So, it's really going to be like it always has been, but even more today than ever. It's going to be really focused on the nature of the particular property, where it's located, the consumer demographics, all of this stuff is changing and we'll just have to see it's also going to be impacted by is it an indoor center or an outdoor center. So, all these things are at least currently with the pandemic, all basically things that we're going to have to take into account for the future, and things are different. We recognize that. Well, I mean, it's going to be a retailer by retailer. I'm sure we'll have some follow-up, but generally we have a prosperous portfolio for the retailer. I think the big issue is, what they estimate their sales to be this year. And obviously, the more they get comfort in that I think that the higher probability that we'll have the success that we've had historically. Sure. Well, obvious, Derek, when you say subsector, what are you referring to? Derek, we are not a mall company. We are predominantly a retail real estate company, but we're not - I wouldn't, by any stretch of the imagination, consider us a mall company. So that's essentially how I would answer. I mean, we are focused on retail real estate, but we are not a mall company, and I think we've been consistent on that for years. And I think the other point on your answer is, I think it's going to - certain properties in certain areas are going to be just fine you know, and then others might take longer to get up to speed. And indoor, outdoor centers in that are dependent on tourism could be different. I think every property - you cannot, first of all, you got to understand we're not a mall company. And number one, we've never said that even for years and years and years. And number two, every property is going to be somewhat affected differently and the demographics of what happens in that local trade area, is this oil go back up to $50. Again there's no blanket statement, everything looks really has to be looked at in kind of a regionally and so on. I said what I have to say, Derek. Thank you. Well, Vince, believe it or not, I'm a grizzly veteran and I've seen - I am proud that we've always been able to flip or toggle switch on and off depending upon economic scenarios. And the reality is, we have a great type, it'll end up being dependent upon the particular property. And we can switch it on completely, also remember that fact is construction was in a lot of places forced to shut down. And we felt it was appropriate to be conservative in the spend. And the reality is, we can turn it off, we can turn it on, we're never going to get over our seat on that front, as I think about it, we'll have two or three bigger decisions to make in Q3, Q4 on a couple projects, one internationally, two domestically and the rest of them will restart when we feel good about the environment. Well, I mean, this, you guys are smart. I'm not sure I agree with a lot of your research, but I do appreciate you do a great job. What is variable that there will be some and it all depends on the opportunity, it all depends on property-specific information. We do think that department stores still play a meaningful role in a number of properties. They also whether through lease or not, there's some good real-estate there. And we were, as you know, very focused on redeveloping those boxes that will continue to be a long-term focus for us without question. We have great real estate. We're more than a mall company, and the ability to redevelop our great real estate is a hallmark of this company and something we will continue. There's nothing wrong, we've taken a pause while we sort our way through a pandemic and we've dealt with a lot, I honestly say, I haven't dealt with this, but we're back up and running almost half the portfolio. We're feeling good about what we've done, feel good about the balance sheet, feel good about our people and what they're trying to accomplish. And again, I think the ability to redevelop real estate that we get back will be an important component of what we do to add value going forward. So, we're not deterred by the current events, but we're taking a pause as it sorts its way through. No worries. Well, I would certainly say, outdoor centers feel a little bit more comfortable. And I, obviously, would say that the states that we're opening that it is so dependent upon the kind of the states and where things are. And generally, the suburban outside kind of the major dense areas seem to be doing better. I do think there's pent up demand. I'd say the consumer is probably a little more moderate as opposed to high-end. Regarding our outlets, we're seeing some really good traction with some of the higher-end brands as they sell their goods. So, I do think that maybe from a moderate customer that's having the ability to shop there. But it's a little early to say that some of our good bread and butter states, we feel pretty encouraged by. Well, sure. I mean, in some cases that's all that you can do. And we're there to help the retailer if they need our help. But in a lot of cases, they've already have their own protocols. So, look, I think it's helpful and beneficial, but it's more important ultimately for us to get our properties open fully. Sure. Yeah. Jeremy, as you know we went through guidance so we really can't do that. But obviously when your property is not allowed to operate and open and we have the ability to reduce all sorts of costs and that's really on one hand, on the other hand if you take and if you see in our protocols and we do open, we're going to have an additional cost of running the centers. And it's hard for me to give you a number because the reality is I don't know when we're going to be able to open the entire portfolio. But as soon as we do that we'll try to give you the new normal. But when we are opening, we are one shift. So that does save us. I'm hopeful that at some point we will come away with that because that's a good sign, but we're not quite there yet. But when we do open, we have extra maintenance cleaning et cetera. So there's so many variables right now it's just I can't really do it and it's hard to do it right now without knowing when the entire system opens up and how it opens up and what our restrictions are going to be. By the way we don't think they should be just to be go on the record, we do think we should be able to be open. We have terrific protocols. They are as good as any of our other competitors which are the online only operators and the big boxes and so on that continue to operate. We have the same distancing. We're limiting the amount of personnel. We're handing out mask. We're doing everything that all of the other competitors are doing including the major online competitors. So, we do think, we should hope - I mean, I want to go on record saying that and we do think we should calibrate that obviously. We're prepared to operate clearly within any government protocols but we do feel like we should open. And that clearly our outdoor centers should clearly open, but main event, I just can't give you the number because I don't really know when we're opening. We are saving some money but as we get open a lot of that will go back into the property to maintain the protocols that we're helping to - what we're doing our share in those communities. I hope the communities appreciate what we're doing. I hope they appreciate what we do not only in sales tax, but in property tax. My favorite obviously is in Long Island, where I won't name them all but we can probably in total over $60 million in property taxes for a couple of properties. My guess is, with right protocols, we ought to get a chance to see what we can do especially as our competitors are open and selling stuff that's clearly more than non-essential. A long-winded answer to your answer to your very straight forward question, which is I can't really give you that, okay. Yeah. Listen, I think just the whole employee thing, even in the - when I went back to Indianapolis, was 1990. And obviously retail real estate - that was a serious recession, and we had to go through very painful downsizing. This is since that, basically 30 years ago, we've never really had a reduction in force even in the recession. The Great Recession in 2008-2009, we didn't have a reduction in force. So, we went through that. I feel personally terrible for it. And then, you couple that with the furlough that we had to do. So, just a very painful scenario. And I do think, as soon as we get our system open, I'm hopeful that we're going to call as many people back as we can from furlough, I hope they - not that they should, but I hope they at least can understand why we did what we had to do and I hope they do come back. I do think we've been pretty good so far on what we've opened. And I think as our level of activity increases, we're going to bring as many folks back as we can. We did have a permanent reduction in force. We do not plan on bringing those folks back. And obviously that's not something we wanted to do. I didn't think I had to do that again. We built this company not to do that, but we felt like we had to do that. And I apologize to the folks that were impacted by it. There's no good excuse. No. As I mentioned earlier, Jeremy, I do think the whole redevelopment of our properties will continue to be very important. I would look at what we're doing now as a pause making sure that we have a better feel for the landscape. And the fact is, you can't redevelop anything if you can't open your property. Okay? So, please understand we're still confronted with that dilemma. I think we've just been so innovative on how we opened the portfolio. I mean, the ability to do what we did as fast as we did as high level as we did. I don't think anybody really could appreciate that in scale and scope. I think and what we're trying to do with our retailers again, I'm sure there'll be a difference of opinion on that. But what we're trying to do in terms of listening to what their issues are, maybe not agreeing, but certainly trying to have a constructive dialogue, segmenting the retailers out in various categories, putting the right people involved. Again, we're not going to bat 1.000, we're going to have some conflicts because we do believe in our contracts. But we're clearly trying to do that innovatively, we're really focused on the local community trying to be innovative there and then just listening to consumer on what we can do and learn from there. And then I think technology will be added to our properties to enhance the consumer experience and certainly to keep them safe. So, there's a lot more to come, but we are basically eight weeks into this, right, almost eighth week. And we're learning a lot and doing a lot. I expect that to continue. Well, again, I think the short answer is, I think I've addressed a lot of this, but the short answer is, it's very much a property by property and a retail by retail process that we go through. We use the judgment that we've had 60 years of experience. We will not always get it right, but we try to rely on that. We also, from the retailer, how they're treating us. I mean, it's a two-way street. And we try to put it in a blender and find out a solution. I'm hopeful we can do that, but there's no guarantee that that we can. And I think the receptivity from our properties is really going to be, I mean, I do think it's going to be a lot of it will depend on the consumer demographics and where that property is, and what the psyche of that consumer really has been affected. I can assure you at least based on what I'm seeing that in certain properties that reopen, the psyche of that consumer hasn't really been affected. It may be affected elsewhere. Yes, without question. Well, it's a retailer by retailer discussion. I mean, we went out our way knowing the extraordinary changes that this pandemic has created. And given our financial wherewithal, we went out of the way to offer deferral for a lot of our retailers. And we felt that was we had the balance sheet and the cash flow and everything else to do it and we just felt it was the right thing to do. Even though there's nothing in the contract that alleviates their contractual life to pay rent in the 95% trial of our leases. So, we just felt like we can help, simple as that. Well, I mean, because the reality for opening centers now which was the first hurdle will know, every week we're all opening more centers. We'll make further progress on where we are with our retailers. At the amount of information that I have today versus what I had a month ago is exponentially high. I would expect the same thing to occur. And it's the most thoughtful thing to do since it will still be declared in our second quarter is to have another month of information or thereabouts on all the factors that go into our taxable income. And again, I mean, I indicated earlier I don't know if you listened to my opening remarks where we think it is today, but another month, five weeks from now or no more, not that complicated. Very small, the ones that we do have are not open. I think one is actually, but yeah it's very small, very small. Well, you can't capitalize the cost if it's suspended. It's not going to be a material change one way or another. No worries. Homeschooling? That's very good. I'm not sure what I do well. Okay. Well, I think, we'll be in a pretty good spot. I mean, we're bucketing it now. We just want to reaffirm our buckets and get more information. I want to - you did say something about our openings unequivocally, you're not going to increase in my opinion the potential spread of COVID. And communities may go up, but don't blame - unless you have science, don't blame it, don't blame our openings on an increase and that community is COVID. I'm not sure that I would create that causation, okay. I guess, you said something and I just wanted to make it clear. Yeah, generally. Okay, look, I think it's possible, right. I mean, there could be markets where there is a spike and it's reduced, but I mean, common sense would indicate we're just going to have to figure out how to live with this threat for a while. And again, I mean, I'm not in-charge, but we'll do what we need to do. And if there's better technology or if there's a better idea, our protocols and I said to state, municipalities and we study what everybody is doing but the reality is if there's a better way to do what we're doing, we'll do it. That's simple. And because it will change, I mean, there will be better protocols than what we initially set forth. But, Michael, look, I think it's important to the best in the community to do the core - I mean, it goes back to your first part. I mean, I do think it's good to have a quarterly cadence. We're in a position financially to do that. And the reality is, we think it's the right thing to do just to fine tune it, get more data over the next four to five weeks and go from there. Well, I think we said, we won't be like probably by the time it's June, it'll be over 200. I said it won't be at least 200 companies that will be less than 50% based on what we know today on our modeling. So, I will pay it in cash and we're going to pay our taxable income and we're not going to do that weird stuff that whatever they call it, what do they call it, I think the strangling of one tax year to the next. Well, look, I think that, let's just say this. The internet for retail whether it's a marketplace or direct-to-consumer or any other method is a big competitor to our entire industry. It is part of our industry. And we always have to compete with it. And our greatest asset is the physical one and service, and those kind of things. And we will have to see how that evolves. I do think a number of retailers are frankly shipping right now even if we're in a place where we're not allowed to operate, a lot of retailers were accessing their store and shipping directly from that store. So, it'll be interesting to see what happens with that even though we were not able to operate, they're in their operating, I'm sure they're social distancing and all that stuff. But there're in their operating selling e-commerce. So, look, it is the internet certainly it would be hard to intellectually argue that it's this scenario has increased adoption for it and though we compete, we'll figure out how to compete. The stores are important to the retailers that have both. And I think that will remain the same. I do think perhaps there is some thinking out there that they don't need as big a storefront or store network. I think that could backfire on them in the long run because it's kind of out of sight, out of mind. And but we'll see. I am sure there will be some retailers that will get the sense that the fleet, the store network is not as important as it was three months ago. I think that - we'll see how that shakes out, and what role we can play in that. I think they might be making a wrong decision, but that's not for me to say. That's just my own instinct. We are clearly aware of that for sure. Look, Michael, the only reason why I let you get back on the call is because you make me laugh and you're a good guy, but the reality is I've already answered this question. And do you have anything else let me know. Thank you. Be well. We actually capitalize it pretty reasonably well. So we're in good shape right now and there's no need for additional capital. So obviously it's important for them to get the stores up and running and operating, but it's between us and our partners of Authentic Brands group in Brookfield, we're in pretty good shape to weather the storm. Well, look, the only - since it's in litigation, I really can't comment, but I encourage you to read the complaint that we and Macerich filed against the agency. And... And it's all, I mean, it's a lot, but it's all spelled out and plenty of time is passed. This was - this has nothing to do with the pandemic. This was going on for several months, but I encourage you to read the complaint. It's all spelled out black and white lots of pictures too. I think the colored actually I'm not even sure but some are colored. Okay. Well, I mean it's a lot of it's based on our years of experience in judgment. It's interesting, the cap rates matter. That's a very good question. Okay. Put that aside. We look at return on investment and obviously if it's too low you're not creating any value for the shareholders. So cap rates are and are not necessarily a science. We tend to look on return on equity, return on investment. But look I think right now we're just we're focused on finishing what's really almost ready to complete. We have and then we're focused obviously on getting our portfolio up and running and that those are the priorities right now. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate your allowing us to move the call. We changed it up because we have our shareholder meeting tomorrow. And that was the only way we could pull everybody together in the remote office. So thank you."

I mean, but we are, but we don't - obviously it's going to impact our taxable income over the year, it's not a quarter-to-quarter issue. We're going to make an estimate by basically June-ish, mid-June, what our taxable income looks and we'll be smarter a month from now and that's basically why we're doing what we're doing. And I think we will have been through most of whatever discussions we're doing with our retailers. We'll know at that point how many properties are not open. So, we'll be able to narrow that down. We have a decent handle on it now, but the fact of the matter is, as long as we declare it in the second quarter I'd rather be smarter on it. And we think another month of making sure we know what's going to open when, will give us a chance to really fine tune that, and then we'll go from there. Yeah. Wes, you would keep capitalizing costs on those projects that are still active as of right now."

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect the request to limit yourself to one question. I’m pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: We had a very busy and productive quarter to end a very successful year. We recorded occupancy gains, record retail sales, and demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is robust, and our other platform investments had strong results. We generated nearly $4.5 billion in funds from operation in ‘21 or $11.94 per share. The $4.5 billion is a record amount for our Company for the year, and coming off a difficult year of 2020, these results are a testament to our relentless focus on operations, cost structure, active portfolio management, smart investments coupled with coherent strategy. Fourth quarter funds from operations were $1.16 billion or $3.09 per share. Included in the fourth quarter results was a net loss of $0.10 per share from a loss on extinguishment of debt and a write-off of predevelopment cost, partially offset by an after-tax gain on the sale of equity interest. Our domestic operations had another excellent quarter to conclude the year. Our international operations improved in the quarter. Domestic property NOI increased 22.4% year-over-year -- I’m sorry, for the quarter, and 12% for the year, including our share of NOI from TRG and our international properties. Portfolio NOI increased 33.6% for the quarter and 22.3% for the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 93.4%, an increase sequentially of 60 basis points and 260 basis points year-over-year. Average base minimum rent was $53.91, add $8 to that if you included variable rent. For the year, we signed more than 4,100 leases for a total of more than 15 million square feet. This was the highest amount of leasing activity we have done over the last six years. Retail sales reported -- retail sales continued in the fourth quarter. Mall sales for the fourth quarter were up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, and up 34% year-over-year. Reported retail sales per square foot reached a record level for 2021 at $713 per foot for our mall and outlet business and $645 for the mills. These results obviously are impressive, particularly given the lack of international tourism for ‘21. Occupancy costs at the end of 2021 are the lowest they’ve been in five years at 12.6% year-end. We opened two new developments in 2021, one in the UK and a premium outlet in South Korea. Construction continues on our tenth outlet in Japan, opening this fall and Normandie, France opening in the spring of ‘23. We completed five significant redevelopments. We added densification components with the opening of two hotels and the completion of an NHL headquarters and practice facility. Progress continues on the densification of Phipps Plaza which will open this fall. We have a significant pipeline of redevelopment projects, which will be funded from our internally generated cash flow. Let me turn to our other platform investments, they produced terrific results in 2021, namely JCPenney, SPARC, ABG, and RGG, which is Rue Gilt Groupe. JCPenney’s results were impressive. Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.6 billion. Company delevered their balance sheet, has no borrowings on their line of credit. CEO, Marc Rosen strengthened his management team with a new CIO and Chief Digital Officer. RGG, including our Shop Premium Outlet marketplace growth continues, and we expect continued investment in 2022 to drive customer acquisition and sales growth. SPARC Group will be the operating partner for Reebok in the U.S. There’s a tremendous opportunity for SPARC to develop sportswear and footwear expertise. The Reebok integration will require additional investment by SPARC as it expands its capability and reach. TRG, Taubman Realty Group, which we own 80%, posted great operating metrics and results, which also beat our underwriting. Reported retail sales was $942 per square foot, a 31% increase year-over-year. Occupancy also increased 210 basis points for the year. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We’ve been active in the debt markets. We amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with lower pricing grid for five years. We issued $2.75 billion of senior notes €750 million notes, completed the refinancing of 25 property mortgages for a total of $3.3 billion at an average interest rate of 3.14%. We paid more than $4 billion in debt and delevered by $1.5 billion. And with the recent January notes offering, our liquidity stands at $8 billion. Now, just to turn to dividend, we paid out $2.7 billion in cash common stock dividends last year. Today, we announced a dividend of $1.65 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 27%. This dividend is payable on March 31. Now, just to go through guidance for 2022. Our FFO guidance is $11.50 to $11.70 per share. When looking at our ‘22 FFO guidance, it is important to note the following items as compared to ‘21 actual results. Approximately $0.32 per share gain related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability at Klépierre, approximately $0.32 per share in gains related to our investment in authentic brands. These gains were partially offset by approximately $0.14 per share in debt extinguishment charges, resulting in an adjusted FFO of $11.44 per share for ‘21. ‘21 also included significant increase in overage and percentage rent compared to prior years and lease settlement income of approximately $0.10 higher than historical average. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions: domestic property NOI growth of up to 2%, approximately $0.15 to $0.20 drag on FFO from additional investments in RGG, and SPO, JCPenney and the Reebok integration cost at SPARC all to fund future growth, the impact of a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to ‘21 levels, and continued muted international tourism, no significant acquisition, or disposition activity. Finally, I really want to thank the entire Simon team for their tireless work that they continue to do for our retailers, shoppers, and communities every day and for bouncing back in ‘21 after a very difficult 2020. Make no mistake about it, ‘21 was a great year. And I think -- Tom knows, but I think our FFO guidance was -- which was consistent with basically the analytic community around $9.60 per share, and we reported $11.94 per share. So, that’s a heck of a year. I’m very excited about our plans for ‘22 and the future growth prospects of our Company, and we’re ready for any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks for the detail or at least the additional disclosure on the guidance. I guess, just sort of tying back to the leasing comment you made about the 15 million feet being kind of a record year for the last six years, you know what are your expectations for leasing activity in ‘22? And how that might tie into further occupancy gains? And then, I also noticed that the leasing spread information that you used to provide in the supplemental wasn’t there anymore. And I was just wondering if you could comment on kind of pricing trends that you’re seeing. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Sure. So, I think we’re very optimistic, Steve, about ‘22 leasing. A lot of new business with a lot of new tenants is the goal. We expect to increase occupancy compared to year-end ‘21. And obviously, the last couple of years with COVID, we’ve been -- obviously been working with our retailers. So, we haven’t quite had the level of pricing power that we’d like to see. We’re starting to see that strengthen from our standpoint and we’re still looking for win-wins between us and our clients. But we feel better that we’ll continue to drive rental growth over time. And as you know, we took a bet that the world in bricks and mortar was not going to end. So, we -- when we did deal with a lot of renegotiations that came about because of COVID, we got -- we try to make it back on sales because we believed in our business. And that’s why you’ve got to look at that what we’re achieving on either percentage or overage rent, which historically we haven’t taken into account in our spreads, and one of the reasons why we have done away with the spreads and the fact that there’s no industry uniformity. And more importantly, there’s very few retail real estate companies that are doing it. But, we bet on our company. We made the right bet. It produced the results that we wanted to see in ‘21, frankly above our expectations. And the strength of our portfolio and the demand is there. So, now, we just got to execute it. I do think there’s so much going on that I’d be remiss not to say it still takes a while to get stores open. And with all the activity, we’ll see some of that in ‘22, but we’re going to see a tremendous amount of great new stores in the ‘23 time period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Maybe just a question on the guidance and the retailer contribution part. David, I know that you mentioned the ‘22 guide includes the $0.15 to $0.20 drag from additional investments this year. I guess, I was wondering if you could just go through kind of what contribution the retailers had in ‘21. What the guidance assumes for ‘22? And any more kind of background you can give on what’s causing that drag? Realize that it’s for future growth but what the impact in ‘22 is and what’s specifically driving it?\nDavid Simon: Yes. I mean, the drag is all about future investments. So, we outlined a little bit on the call, but we’re in a growth mode with Rue La La Gilt and shoppremiumoutlets.com. So, we’re acquiring customers. We’re marketing more, and we’re building the technology out to serve those three platforms with great sales growth and marketplace growth, but that takes investment. So, that’s one element of it. The second element of it is, as you know, JCPenney is building out its beauty business as well as its digital business. So again, it’s the belief in the brand that’s going to -- that is going to create these unique opportunities, and we’re going to invest in doing that. And then, finally, the bigger -- the Reebok integration will reduce the operating earnings from SPARC just temporarily in ‘02 as it deals with consolidating its operation. We now have an office, deal hasn’t closed yet. It’s going to close at the end of the month. We have excess real estate. So, we have to work through all of that. But the return for ‘23 on that will be much more than whatever the investment is. So, all of these have -- the payback on RGG stuff is 16 months. They track it -- they track it by the nickel, penny the same. I mean, very similar to previous businesses. But you got to invest for future growth. That’s what we’re seeing. In terms of operational outside of that, Caitlin, we’re basically more or less budgeting the same EBITDA, NOI levels for our investments, our other platform investments other than these investments that I just mentioned.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. And just one quick thing. You mentioned the Reebok integration will reduce SPARC earnings in ‘02. Did you mean Q2?\nDavid Simon: I meant ‘22. I’m sorry. ‘22.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: I want to talk about the dividend for a moment. You’ve raised it for three consecutive times. I think we’ve discussed in the past that it’s well below where you were in 2019, despite free cash flow being similar to where you were in 2019. Can you maybe just elaborate on why not increase the dividend more here? I recognize in the previous answer, you were talking about in growth mode and investing in businesses, but is there a trajectory to get back up to $8.30 where you were, I think, prior to COVID?\nDavid Simon: Yes. I mean, again, it would be my expectation over time that we’ll reach those levels. I think it’s just an abundance of caution. But if you look at Q-over-Q, it’s a 27% increase. So I know sequentially, it’s not. But that’s what we tend to do historically is we tend to be flat in the Q1 area. We measure our taxable income. And as earnings percolate, we tend to raise with our taxable income. So, I think we’re really adopting what we’ve done historically. But our payout ratio is low. Our liquidity is strong. And I would expect hopefully that our dividend, we’ll continue to see the increases. Now, there was a dramatic increase from ‘20 to ‘21. So, I’m hoping we’ll continue a very positive trend.\nRich Hill: And just one more question. If I think back to this time last year, you guided to -- initially guided to 950 to 975. You put up a really healthy number this year where I hope we see it 11.36 ex the one-timers you mentioned. I’m not sure if we see eye to eye on that, but that’s pretty close. Is there -- what would give us -- what would you give you any confidence that this could -- that 2022 could surprise to the upside just like 2021, or do you view this year as more baked, so to speak than 2021?\nDavid Simon: Well, the years never bake, right? So look, I think the big variable that is always there is basically sales because we still have because we still have some COVID oriented leases that have not rolled over that we still are a little more dependent on sales than we would have said 3, 4 years ago. So that is why we’re a little more cautious because we don’t -- I’d like to say we’re as good as we are. We’re not -- we can’t predict with certainty sales. But -- so I think -- I’m hopeful that the -- when we talk to retailers, they still feel very good about the economy and what’s going on. Obviously, there’s a lot of volatility in the world today. And we’re not immune to that. So, we just have to wait and see. But we are building off a terrific, terrific ‘21. So, we’ll see -- I am hopeful that we’ll continue to produce growth assuming the -- everything holds together externally with our economy and so on. So, there’s no certainty, but I feel pretty good about where we stand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: David, I wanted to come back to sort of the growth that you’re getting from a lot of these unique and differentiated investments that you’re making? And just sort of how it ties back to this year’s earnings forecast, but also that growth in the future. You gave us a couple of pieces, but they’re all a little bit different the time of all together. So, I’m just going to use one for now and maybe we can pivot off of that. But if you just look at your FFO from investments, which is on page 29 of the sup, which I recognize includes Klépierre, but it includes -- sorry, page 28, but includes all of these other investments that you’re making. You’re looking at 2021 at about $550 million, about $1.46. You’ve now thrown out for this coming year, the $0.15 to $0.20 drag from these investments that are being made. And I’m just trying to reconcile well how much is in the $11.60 a share for all of these, which are both retailer investments as well as Klépierre, what sort of range are we thinking about that’s obviously gross, but then netted down by, I guess, $0.15 to $0.20 for these other investments. I’m just trying to put it all together.\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, it’s pretty straightforward. But we really did not hear you well. But just to clarify what we did pick up. The NOI from investments is only Klépierre, and it includes our small interest in HPS, which is de minimis. Other platform or investment -- okay -- the other NOI from other platform investments would include RGG, SPARC, JCPenney or share of ABG. So, that’s that line just to clarify. I did hear that. Guys, did you hear question?\nTom Ward: I didn’t hear past that.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Does that help you?\nMichael Bilerman: No. Let me -- I’ll try to be clear, David.\nDavid Simon: Michael, if you went back to the office.\nMichael Bilerman: I’m in the office, David…\nDavid Simon: You might be able to sound a little clearer, okay? So, I don’t know, maybe you can -- I’m happy if you text this or read it out loud, and we cannot hear you.\nMichael Bilerman: Well, I’m in the office. How about if I pick up my phone. Is that better for you, David?\nDavid Simon: Slightly, yes.\nMichael Bilerman: All right. Well, I’ll take slightly. But I’m just trying to get, on page 28, you actually list the FFO contribution, right? $550 million from everything, right? $1.46. So, I’m just trying to triangulate what you earned in ‘21 and how that compares to the $11.60 million in ‘22. You’ve given us a couple of nuggets of information, the $0.15 to $0.20 drag, but it doesn’t net out to actually what’s in guidance for these investments.\nDavid Simon: Well, again, the tax effect of that, let’s -- there’s no surprise. Our math is very simple. I’m sorry, we’ve made money in all these investments. Now you have to pay attention to it. Unlike other people that make investments and lose money. We actually make investments that make money. These are the NOI. They’re not -- the tax line is below this. This is just kind of -- this is like an EBITDA number that we try to show the market. That’s all that this is, and it’s there for your information. And again, the NOI from other platforms, I described, the NOI from investments is Klépierre and HBS and we footnote corporate and other NOI sources. So I don’t know what else -- the guys are happy to take the question offline.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. Yes, I was looking at page 28, not the NOI page. That’s where the confusion was coming from David. Maybe just -- we see the FFO with investments, right? So that includes all of the FFO from all these great investments you’re making. And this is not a negative question, David, but this is a positive of stuff that you’re doing.\nDavid Simon: Yes. That includes everything lumped together and then take the tax impact. And again, it’s NOI, so it’s pre-interest, then obviously, FFO is not. But we’re happy to walk you through.\nMichael Bilerman: Well, that’s exactly -- now we’ve gotten to the question, which is that’s why -- that’s the number we do know, right? So, there’s no ambiguity.\nDavid Simon: It’s EBIT. So remember, retailers have depreciation that we don’t add back and so on and so forth. But the guys will be happy to walk you through it.\nTom Ward: We’ll connect offline, Michael.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. David, can you just talk generally? Your opening comment and the press release was all about unlocking value, and you’ve already done some of that through the transactions. How do you think about the initiatives that you want to focus on this year and what value is sitting in this platform for Simon shareholders?\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, given our level of cash investment, if you were to look at it on a private equity basis, right, we’ve made 20x on our investments. And they’re continuing to grow. And SPARC, I think, is a good example on RGG, have great platforms that can continue to be a leader in their business. And ultimately, the market we’ll see if we need to at some point in time, monetize these or highlight the value, but it’s embedded here at multiples that the market is ascribing to us, but frankly, the external market is probably valuing it more than what it is today.\nMichael Bilerman: Right. And that’s where all the questions that I’m asking, David, these are positive things that you’ve done that we get asked by the investment community of trying to ask for more disclosure to try to get to ascribe that value that you want. So that’s -- it’s coming from a good place. And usually, I’m good at math, but...\nDavid Simon: I never suggested you aren’t. I’m just having a hard time hearing you. That was the only negative comment. Okay. So, sorry about that. But again, we’re happy to walk you through it. So, it can help you understand what we’re doing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: So, I’ll abandon the retail investment question for now. But now in 4Q ‘19, pre-pandemic David, the redev pipeline was $1.8 billion at its peak. Now, it’s $944 million in 4Q. And that’s just a really modest increase from 3Q. So, as you talk about record FFO and very healthy cash flow, how are you looking at capital allocation priorities going forward? Should we expect ramping redevelopment, some transformational, clearly some more retailer investments, dividends, buybacks? You mentioned no acquisitions. How do you view the priorities here?\nDavid Simon: Well, the good news is our pipeline is kind of back to where it was in ‘19. However, remember, in ‘19, we finished some stuff, right? So naturally, that falls off. And then, we didn’t add anything really until this year. But I think you’ll see steady progress in adding -- and remember, we only add when we start construction on a project or we internally to prove it or we’re about to. So, we would expect to be able to add to that number this year. So, you’ll see that. I’d be disappointed if it didn’t grow in size and stature, and mostly in mixed use. So, we still -- I would still say that’s the number one priority, we’re going to invest in our existing platforms that we have, whether they’re SPARC or ABG or RGG. So, those are businesses that we have a lot of faith in, and we’ll continue to invest in those. We’re still doing a lot of investment kind of in the -- in updating the technology aspects of our shopping centers that we’ll continue to do. That’s important to us. We expect to raise the dividend. We’ve been really quiet on the acquisition front, and that’s like -- that’s perfectly fine with us. We’ll see how the market transpires, but we have no real we feel really good about our portfolio. And if there’s something that fits in nicely, reasonably priced, we’ll take a look at it, but if not, c’est la vie. And then I think we’re going to build another platform. It’s not necessarily a retail platform, but we’re in the midst of kind of working through some opportunities. Stay tuned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlex Goldfarb: Hey David. I’m torn because you guys had one question first, so I have two. But I’m going to restrain myself and just ask one, unless Tom gives me the go ahead. I’m going to go back to the retailer question. You guys made a lot of headway on your brands. You added $160 million of NOI, EBITDA, whatever you want to call it, from the retailer platform last year. And you guys seem to have a pretty quick turnaround of the brands. So one, does it surprise you how quickly these brands have turned around, given that there are a number of -- we won’t mention retailers, but brands out there, retailers who have been trying to restructure for years and haven’t been successful whereas in short order you guys have? And two, does this give you a better insight into your tenant negotiations such that now you have much more informed view of when you’re in negotiations with the tenants what their true potential is versus what they may be telling you at the table?\nDavid Simon: Yes. So, on the fast turnaround, I would say, yes. But remember, we bought these in bankruptcy, which most of them in bankruptcy. So, that allows you to clear out a lot of the issues and gives you a kind of a clean slate to grow from. I’d say that the management team that we put together at SPARC is excellent. They know how to integrate. And between our oversight from ABG and SPG, we’ve got good formula that’s working. Their performance has absolutely no relevance or insight at all when it comes to our negotiation or our insight into how to deal with retailers. So that’s just a flat out. No, Alex. I could see how you might ask that question, but it really doesn’t -- because each brand is there is unique and they don’t necessarily have a direct competitor that would be helpful, and we just don’t -- we don’t think like that because, as you know, every space and every mall is different and market rents are all over the place. So, simple answer to that is no.\nAlex Goldfarb: Okay. And Tom, will you allow me a second, or are there a lot of questions, you got to move on?\nDavid Simon: He’s got a puppy dog look toward me. So, based on that, we will allow you. Thank you. Go ahead.\nAlex Goldfarb: So, big picture. Obviously, a lot of what’s going on in retail and the crime and all these headlines is out there. My question for you is, is your sense from talking to the industry and obviously talking to local officials, is the view that it’s on the industry to try and beef up security and solve this, or do you sense that the local authorities are finally realizing they need to do more from their end?\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I think we are top notch in this area, though, unfortunately, as good as we are, we cannot avoid what’s happened. So, we’re all subject to this. I think it -- I don’t think it’s an industry issue. I think it’s a local jurisdiction issue. And it’s a nationwide issue. And I believe the tide is turning. We are all over this, the safety of our consumers and obviously, the retailers is priority number 1. We’re not immune to it as much as we would like to be. We have a very sophisticated operations center, intelligent center that deals with this. If you ask the retailers, they would tell you that I think, Alex, that we’re number 1 in this area, but we’re not immune. I would love to be immune. But we, as a nation, have to address this, and it’s happening, obviously, in a lot of different areas. I don’t want to get into politics at all. But I don’t think it’s -- I don’t think the industry can solve it. I do think it’s got to be at the local and national level. And I do think we’ve got to hold everyone accountable that this kind of stuff cannot be tolerated. But believe me, we are all over it but where we -- some of these things are just impossible to avoid. However, what you don’t hear from us, Alex, is all the ones that we forwarded, [ph] dozens and dozens of multiple ones, and we do an excellent job, but it’s -- we’re we have to deal with some unfortunate consequences of these acts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping to ask a little bit about rents and leasing spreads again. So, the base rent was flat sequentially at just under $54. Do you think that’s now bottomed or stabilized, and it’s headed upwards from here? And on the re-leasing spreads, I think you talked $8 about being in the number for the deals maybe signed in the fourth quarter or at quarter end, not quite sure there. But, when will that translate into the baseline rent? When will that kind of sunset out? And how are you guys thinking about internally on that spread number that’s no longer disclosed? Like what’s the expectation for what you generated in ‘21 and what your expectation is for ‘22?\nDavid Simon: Well, we -- first of all, we focus on NOI growth. So, that’s number one, and we expect to have NOI growth. So that’s the first. I’d say to you -- I think you’re not -- maybe we weren’t clear, but the $54 is somewhat -- it’s just the base minimum rent that our portfolio averages. It does not include overage or percentage rent. If you included that based on ‘21 results, that $54 would be $62. Okay? So, that’s the that relationship there. And I don’t -- I try to listen carefully to your question, but it just goes to show that the $54 is missing this component, and we thought it was material enough to point it out.\nJuan Sanabria: And so, when do you think that $8 comes into the number 1. Does that $8 -- that’s $8 assumption?\nDavid Simon: Yes. That’s all a function of lease expiration. So, we tend to raise -- if someone is an overage rent or they have a percent rent deal that’s expiring, we try to raise the base minimum rent or we try to capture as much in the base minimum rent from the overage that’s generated. You don’t always get all of it, but you do some of it. So, it’s -- it should pick up over time, but it’s really a function of the big overage rent payers and when their leases expire.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point.\nFloris Van Dijkum: David, you just mentioned NOI growth. And obviously, you know that I’ve been -- I still think there’s a lot of value in the business here. But again, you might be slightly joking...\nDavid Simon: By the way, so do I. So do I, Floris. Okay?\nFloris Van Dijkum: No, no. I know you think there’s a lot of value. And I’m trying to help you get that out. But the -- walk me again -- the 2% NOI growth that you have in your assumptions for ‘22. If you have your -- basically, you have fixed bumps in your leases typically of around 3%. You don’t get it for all of them, but you’re a little bit shy of 3% maybe. But all things set or spare, but everything else stays, the same occupancy stays the same. You should get around 2.5% to 3% NOI growth. Yet you’re only guiding for 2% growth.\nDavid Simon: Yes. I think it’s very simple. The real simple answer is sales, and we do a very sophisticated model. If we have sales levels that are above this year, we will overachieve that number. But again, we’re in February, and we tend to be -- try to be cautious on that number. But that’s really -- and then, there are increases in cost that we’re dealing with as well for us. So for instance, I mean, security expenses are up based on -- we just had a discussion with Alex on that. Obviously, we have wage inflation janitorial. So, we have pressures on expenses just like everybody else. We’ve got no break on the real estate tax front from the local municipalities, even though we were closed for months in many cases in ‘20 -- ‘19 and ‘20. But our real estate tax expense keeps going up. So, we have pressures there that we’re just trying to be relatively thoughtful about how to deal with. And then, the percent overage sales number going into every year is a little bit of the unknown, and we’re trying to bake some conservatism into that thought process.\nFloris Van Dijkum: So David, I mean, just again -- but a lot of your costs would be recaptured through CAM. You’ve got fixed CAM that increases at inflation. So that would imply that you’re fixed CAM...\nDavid Simon: No, no, no. We don’t have CPI adjusted.\nFloris Van Dijkum: That’s right. You have 3% bumps. You have 3% bumps. You’re right.\nDavid Simon: Yes. And we have bumps. But if it goes up 6% and we’re going up 3%, we lose 3%. So -- and -- so again, I mean, it’s all factored in. But I would say there’s a little bit of margin pressure. And again, hopefully, I’ve been clear on the sales front.\nFloris Van Dijkum: So David, so maybe if you can touch on one little area, which I looked at in your release, you have 6.8 million square feet of leases that are longer than a year, but that are sort of temporary tenants, specialty leasing, which are at an average rent of around -- off the top of my head, $17. It’s 10% of your small shop portfolio that is at a third your average rent that you’re getting. What happens when those leases go to market or become full tenants? Theoretically, they should go up by 300%. Is that the right way to look at it?\nDavid Simon: Yes. Look, I think that’s a great opportunity for our company. We did a very good job. It’s kind of a flex business. We’re still under occupied. We still have a number of tenants like that that are important to the community, but as more permanent tenants come to the market. That’s a great opportunity for the Company. Floris, this is a real interesting thing. A lot of that stuff is happening now. So, think about it this way. In ‘21 -- in ‘20, we got decimated by COVID, right? We came back unbelievably strong in ‘21, much better than anyone would have predicted and reinforce our business model. I would venture to say. But we still have we still have a lot of short-term leasing or what I’ll call specialty leasing. But that as we re-lease that space, that comes in midstream, that comes in first quarter, second quarter, third quarter of ‘22 because, as remember, our retail base, a lot of it sat on the sidelines, all of ‘20, and didn’t really start opening up open to buy in ‘21. And by the time you build out a store in a mall, it’s a six to nine-month process. So, as much given where we are today, I would say to you, and we never -- like this is solely anti the way I think. But we still have a transition year in ‘22. But it’s not an excuse. I’ve never used that as an excuse. But believe me, as we continue to lease up to permanent retailers away from specialty, we’re going to generate more income, but it’s not all going to fall in ‘22. Now, did I explain myself well, guys? Would you add to it? Okay. So, sometimes I’m inarticulate. So I mean -- and again, that’s not an excuse, but that’s how -- but ‘22 is going to be -- continue to be a transition year like ‘21 was, but we kicked the crap out of ‘21. It was an unbelievable year. Spectacular based on where we were. Okay, Floris?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: David, I’ve got a question on OCR. You mentioned OCRs earlier, something we haven’t talked about in a while. And at 12.6%, you mentioned that’s the highest level in five years. I guess I’m curious how important is OCR today in tenant conversations? Are they willing to pay or even consider some of these look back OCRs? And any color on where you think that OCRs might go near term, or do we ever get kind of back to the mid to upper teen levels? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Yes. Look, I think it reflects an earlier comment, which is we are starting to see a little more pricing power as demand goes up and the fact that the overall business is better. So, it’s a good insurance policy and that the retailers are producing very positive results in our portfolio. We don’t want to put them on the edge, but we’ve taken our lumps over the last few years. And now we’re just trying to balance it a little bit better than what we’ve seen over the last couple of years. So, it’s a good indicator that we’ve got some room to go. That’s all it is.\nHaendel St. Juste: And if I could follow up. I don’t know if you mentioned it earlier, or if you’re willing to share. Are you still doing any of those shorter-term leases that you were doing during COVID with the lower upfront rent threshold, but with the lower percentage rent thresholds, so you can make out in the event of improving sales, or is that in the event of the past now?\nDavid Simon: It’s essentially a thing in the past, though, there’s always a case here or there where we might -- we might have a deal in ‘23 for space, but they’re not ready -- I’m sorry, they’re not ready in ‘23. So we have a retailer in the space. So, ‘22 might be an extension of that while we finalize the lease for ‘23. And that’s a little bit what I was talking about with Floris as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street.\nVince Tibone: I wanted to follow up on Floris’ question. I believe you mentioned that if sales -- tenant sales repeated 2021 levels, you would likely exceed the 2% guidance for domestic property NOI. I just want to get a better understanding of maybe what sales levels you have baked into current guidance. And it would seem that your -- the base case is actually a decline in sales compared to last year. So, trying to just get a little more color there would be helpful.\nDavid Simon: Well, we do it -- we really do it -- I don’t know why, but we do do it tenant by tenant. And I do -- simple thing is if we do see sales above this year, we would hopefully -- putting aside the comment about rising expense cost, if you kept our expenses flat, we would see a better, more robust NOI -- portfolio NOI growth. Simple answer is that. And we do have some baked in conservatism in that number. But again, it’s -- we do this budgeting process late in the year. Actually, some people, they do it earlier than I’d like, but we -- it’s always -- in the case of sales, it’s an art versus a science. The good news, though, when we talk to retailers, they are planning up sales compared to ‘21, okay? And that’s positive. And if they produce their own plan, we’ll see the benefit of that.\nVince Tibone: So, is it fair to say that you’re forecasting sales to be negative? Maybe that’s the base case of guidance, or am I misreading into that?\nDavid Simon: I would say around the 2% level, it’s relatively flat.\nVince Tibone: Okay. That’s helpful. If I could maybe try to squeeze one more quick one in there. I’m just curious for like the overed rent component. How much was overed rents in terms of total lease income? Like what percentage was that for this last year?\nDavid Simon: We don’t give that out, but if we do -- well, I’ll ask the guys if they want to give it out. We tend not to do that. But I would say it was similar to what we would use to see from when we had big international tourism in our big international properties from a percent point of view. Okay? Guys, is that right? Okay. And then, it really went away. So, it’s kind of back to where we were maybe 4, 5, 6 years ago.\nTom Ward: Hector, we have time for one more question?\nOperator: Okay. Our final question comes from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan.\nMike Mueller: Hi. A quick one. Rent per square foot was lower year-over-year in the malls outlets, but it was higher in the mills. And curious what’s driving that dynamic.\nDavid Simon: I’m sorry. Could you repeat? I didn’t -- you broke up there for a second.\nMike Mueller: Yes. Your rent per square foot for malls and outlets is down year-over-year, but for the mills that’s up year-over-year.\nDavid Simon: Yes. In the mills, they include all of the boxes. We include all the boxes. I shouldn’t say that. We include all the boxes. So, every square footage. It’s not whereas in the outlet mall, it’s basically just the interior space, that’s the department store. So, that’s -- so they have a few big tenants that may be driving the increase. But that business has been very healthy, and we’re very pleased with the results there.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I’d like to turn the call back to Mr. David Simon, Chairman, for closing remarks.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Thank you. I know there’s a few that are still looking to get some questions answered. So, Brian and Tom will be available, of course, I am as well. And thanks for participating in the call today.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "We had a very busy and productive quarter to end a very successful year. We recorded occupancy gains, record retail sales, and demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is robust, and our other platform investments had strong results. We generated nearly $4.5 billion in funds from operation in ‘21 or $11.94 per share. The $4.5 billion is a record amount for our Company for the year, and coming off a difficult year of 2020, these results are a testament to our relentless focus on operations, cost structure, active portfolio management, smart investments coupled with coherent strategy. Fourth quarter funds from operations were $1.16 billion or $3.09 per share. Included in the fourth quarter results was a net loss of $0.10 per share from a loss on extinguishment of debt and a write-off of predevelopment cost, partially offset by an after-tax gain on the sale of equity interest. Our domestic operations had another excellent quarter to conclude the year. Our international operations improved in the quarter. Domestic property NOI increased 22.4% year-over-year -- I'm sorry, for the quarter, and 12% for the year, including our share of NOI from TRG and our international properties. Portfolio NOI increased 33.6% for the quarter and 22.3% for the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 93.4%, an increase sequentially of 60 basis points and 260 basis points year-over-year. Average base minimum rent was $53.91, add $8 to that if you included variable rent. For the year, we signed more than 4,100 leases for a total of more than 15 million square feet. This was the highest amount of leasing activity we have done over the last six years. Retail sales reported -- retail sales continued in the fourth quarter. Mall sales for the fourth quarter were up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, and up 34% year-over-year. Reported retail sales per square foot reached a record level for 2021 at $713 per foot for our mall and outlet business and $645 for the mills. These results obviously are impressive, particularly given the lack of international tourism for ‘21. Occupancy costs at the end of 2021 are the lowest they've been in five years at 12.6% year-end. We opened two new developments in 2021, one in the UK and a premium outlet in South Korea. Construction continues on our tenth outlet in Japan, opening this fall and Normandie, France opening in the spring of ‘23. We completed five significant redevelopments. We added densification components with the opening of two hotels and the completion of an NHL headquarters and practice facility. Progress continues on the densification of Phipps Plaza which will open this fall. We have a significant pipeline of redevelopment projects, which will be funded from our internally generated cash flow. Let me turn to our other platform investments, they produced terrific results in 2021, namely JCPenney, SPARC, ABG, and RGG, which is Rue Gilt Groupe. JCPenney's results were impressive. Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.6 billion. Company delevered their balance sheet, has no borrowings on their line of credit. CEO, Marc Rosen strengthened his management team with a new CIO and Chief Digital Officer. RGG, including our Shop Premium Outlet marketplace growth continues, and we expect continued investment in 2022 to drive customer acquisition and sales growth. SPARC Group will be the operating partner for Reebok in the U.S. There's a tremendous opportunity for SPARC to develop sportswear and footwear expertise. The Reebok integration will require additional investment by SPARC as it expands its capability and reach. TRG, Taubman Realty Group, which we own 80%, posted great operating metrics and results, which also beat our underwriting. Reported retail sales was $942 per square foot, a 31% increase year-over-year. Occupancy also increased 210 basis points for the year. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We've been active in the debt markets. We amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with lower pricing grid for five years. We issued $2.75 billion of senior notes €750 million notes, completed the refinancing of 25 property mortgages for a total of $3.3 billion at an average interest rate of 3.14%. We paid more than $4 billion in debt and delevered by $1.5 billion. And with the recent January notes offering, our liquidity stands at $8 billion. Now, just to turn to dividend, we paid out $2.7 billion in cash common stock dividends last year. Today, we announced a dividend of $1.65 per share for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 27%. This dividend is payable on March 31. Now, just to go through guidance for 2022. Our FFO guidance is $11.50 to $11.70 per share. When looking at our ‘22 FFO guidance, it is important to note the following items as compared to ‘21 actual results. Approximately $0.32 per share gain related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability at Klépierre, approximately $0.32 per share in gains related to our investment in authentic brands. These gains were partially offset by approximately $0.14 per share in debt extinguishment charges, resulting in an adjusted FFO of $11.44 per share for ‘21. ‘21 also included significant increase in overage and percentage rent compared to prior years and lease settlement income of approximately $0.10 higher than historical average. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions: domestic property NOI growth of up to 2%, approximately $0.15 to $0.20 drag on FFO from additional investments in RGG, and SPO, JCPenney and the Reebok integration cost at SPARC all to fund future growth, the impact of a continued strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and yen compared to ‘21 levels, and continued muted international tourism, no significant acquisition, or disposition activity. Finally, I really want to thank the entire Simon team for their tireless work that they continue to do for our retailers, shoppers, and communities every day and for bouncing back in ‘21 after a very difficult 2020. Make no mistake about it, ‘21 was a great year. And I think -- Tom knows, but I think our FFO guidance was -- which was consistent with basically the analytic community around $9.60 per share, and we reported $11.94 per share. So, that's a heck of a year. I'm very excited about our plans for ‘22 and the future growth prospects of our Company, and we're ready for any questions. Sure. So, I think we're very optimistic, Steve, about ‘22 leasing. A lot of new business with a lot of new tenants is the goal. We expect to increase occupancy compared to year-end ‘21. And obviously, the last couple of years with COVID, we've been -- obviously been working with our retailers. So, we haven't quite had the level of pricing power that we'd like to see. We're starting to see that strengthen from our standpoint and we're still looking for win-wins between us and our clients. But we feel better that we'll continue to drive rental growth over time. And as you know, we took a bet that the world in bricks and mortar was not going to end. So, we -- when we did deal with a lot of renegotiations that came about because of COVID, we got -- we try to make it back on sales because we believed in our business. And that's why you've got to look at that what we're achieving on either percentage or overage rent, which historically we haven't taken into account in our spreads, and one of the reasons why we have done away with the spreads and the fact that there's no industry uniformity. And more importantly, there's very few retail real estate companies that are doing it. But, we bet on our company. We made the right bet. It produced the results that we wanted to see in ‘21, frankly above our expectations. And the strength of our portfolio and the demand is there. So, now, we just got to execute it. I do think there's so much going on that I'd be remiss not to say it still takes a while to get stores open. And with all the activity, we'll see some of that in ‘22, but we're going to see a tremendous amount of great new stores in the ‘23 time period. Yes. I mean, the drag is all about future investments. So, we outlined a little bit on the call, but we're in a growth mode with Rue La La Gilt and shoppremiumoutlets.com. So, we're acquiring customers. We're marketing more, and we're building the technology out to serve those three platforms with great sales growth and marketplace growth, but that takes investment. So, that's one element of it. The second element of it is, as you know, JCPenney is building out its beauty business as well as its digital business. So again, it's the belief in the brand that's going to -- that is going to create these unique opportunities, and we're going to invest in doing that. And then, finally, the bigger -- the Reebok integration will reduce the operating earnings from SPARC just temporarily in ‘02 as it deals with consolidating its operation. We now have an office, deal hasn't closed yet. It's going to close at the end of the month. We have excess real estate. So, we have to work through all of that. But the return for ‘23 on that will be much more than whatever the investment is. So, all of these have -- the payback on RGG stuff is 16 months. They track it -- they track it by the nickel, penny the same. I mean, very similar to previous businesses. But you got to invest for future growth. That's what we're seeing. In terms of operational outside of that, Caitlin, we're basically more or less budgeting the same EBITDA, NOI levels for our investments, our other platform investments other than these investments that I just mentioned. I meant ‘22. I'm sorry. ‘22. Yes. I mean, again, it would be my expectation over time that we'll reach those levels. I think it's just an abundance of caution. But if you look at Q-over-Q, it's a 27% increase. So I know sequentially, it's not. But that's what we tend to do historically is we tend to be flat in the Q1 area. We measure our taxable income. And as earnings percolate, we tend to raise with our taxable income. So, I think we're really adopting what we've done historically. But our payout ratio is low. Our liquidity is strong. And I would expect hopefully that our dividend, we'll continue to see the increases. Now, there was a dramatic increase from ‘20 to ‘21. So, I'm hoping we'll continue a very positive trend. Well, the years never bake, right? So look, I think the big variable that is always there is basically sales because we still have because we still have some COVID oriented leases that have not rolled over that we still are a little more dependent on sales than we would have said 3, 4 years ago. So that is why we're a little more cautious because we don't -- I'd like to say we're as good as we are. We're not -- we can't predict with certainty sales. But -- so I think -- I'm hopeful that the -- when we talk to retailers, they still feel very good about the economy and what's going on. Obviously, there's a lot of volatility in the world today. And we're not immune to that. So, we just have to wait and see. But we are building off a terrific, terrific ‘21. So, we'll see -- I am hopeful that we'll continue to produce growth assuming the -- everything holds together externally with our economy and so on. So, there's no certainty, but I feel pretty good about where we stand. Well, I mean, it's pretty straightforward. But we really did not hear you well. But just to clarify what we did pick up. The NOI from investments is only Klépierre, and it includes our small interest in HPS, which is de minimis. Other platform or investment -- okay -- the other NOI from other platform investments would include RGG, SPARC, JCPenney or share of ABG. So, that's that line just to clarify. I did hear that. Guys, did you hear question? Okay. Does that help you? Michael, if you went back to the office. You might be able to sound a little clearer, okay? So, I don't know, maybe you can -- I'm happy if you text this or read it out loud, and we cannot hear you. Slightly, yes. Well, again, the tax effect of that, let's -- there's no surprise. Our math is very simple. I'm sorry, we've made money in all these investments. Now you have to pay attention to it. Unlike other people that make investments and lose money. We actually make investments that make money. These are the NOI. They're not -- the tax line is below this. This is just kind of -- this is like an EBITDA number that we try to show the market. That's all that this is, and it's there for your information. And again, the NOI from other platforms, I described, the NOI from investments is Klépierre and HBS and we footnote corporate and other NOI sources. So I don't know what else -- the guys are happy to take the question offline. Yes. That includes everything lumped together and then take the tax impact. And again, it's NOI, so it's pre-interest, then obviously, FFO is not. But we're happy to walk you through. It's EBIT. So remember, retailers have depreciation that we don't add back and so on and so forth. But the guys will be happy to walk you through it. Well, I mean, given our level of cash investment, if you were to look at it on a private equity basis, right, we've made 20x on our investments. And they're continuing to grow. And SPARC, I think, is a good example on RGG, have great platforms that can continue to be a leader in their business. And ultimately, the market we'll see if we need to at some point in time, monetize these or highlight the value, but it's embedded here at multiples that the market is ascribing to us, but frankly, the external market is probably valuing it more than what it is today. I never suggested you aren't. I'm just having a hard time hearing you. That was the only negative comment. Okay. So, sorry about that. But again, we're happy to walk you through it. So, it can help you understand what we're doing. Well, the good news is our pipeline is kind of back to where it was in ‘19. However, remember, in ‘19, we finished some stuff, right? So naturally, that falls off. And then, we didn't add anything really until this year. But I think you'll see steady progress in adding -- and remember, we only add when we start construction on a project or we internally to prove it or we're about to. So, we would expect to be able to add to that number this year. So, you'll see that. I'd be disappointed if it didn't grow in size and stature, and mostly in mixed use. So, we still -- I would still say that's the number one priority, we're going to invest in our existing platforms that we have, whether they're SPARC or ABG or RGG. So, those are businesses that we have a lot of faith in, and we'll continue to invest in those. We're still doing a lot of investment kind of in the -- in updating the technology aspects of our shopping centers that we'll continue to do. That's important to us. We expect to raise the dividend. We've been really quiet on the acquisition front, and that's like -- that's perfectly fine with us. We'll see how the market transpires, but we have no real we feel really good about our portfolio. And if there's something that fits in nicely, reasonably priced, we'll take a look at it, but if not, c'est la vie. And then I think we're going to build another platform. It's not necessarily a retail platform, but we're in the midst of kind of working through some opportunities. Stay tuned. Yes. So, on the fast turnaround, I would say, yes. But remember, we bought these in bankruptcy, which most of them in bankruptcy. So, that allows you to clear out a lot of the issues and gives you a kind of a clean slate to grow from. I'd say that the management team that we put together at SPARC is excellent. They know how to integrate. And between our oversight from ABG and SPG, we've got good formula that's working. Their performance has absolutely no relevance or insight at all when it comes to our negotiation or our insight into how to deal with retailers. So that's just a flat out. No, Alex. I could see how you might ask that question, but it really doesn't -- because each brand is there is unique and they don't necessarily have a direct competitor that would be helpful, and we just don't -- we don't think like that because, as you know, every space and every mall is different and market rents are all over the place. So, simple answer to that is no. He's got a puppy dog look toward me. So, based on that, we will allow you. Thank you. Go ahead. Well, look, I think we are top notch in this area, though, unfortunately, as good as we are, we cannot avoid what's happened. So, we're all subject to this. I think it -- I don't think it's an industry issue. I think it's a local jurisdiction issue. And it's a nationwide issue. And I believe the tide is turning. We are all over this, the safety of our consumers and obviously, the retailers is priority number 1. We're not immune to it as much as we would like to be. We have a very sophisticated operations center, intelligent center that deals with this. If you ask the retailers, they would tell you that I think, Alex, that we're number 1 in this area, but we're not immune. I would love to be immune. But we, as a nation, have to address this, and it's happening, obviously, in a lot of different areas. I don't want to get into politics at all. But I don't think it's -- I don't think the industry can solve it. I do think it's got to be at the local and national level. And I do think we've got to hold everyone accountable that this kind of stuff cannot be tolerated. But believe me, we are all over it but where we -- some of these things are just impossible to avoid. However, what you don't hear from us, Alex, is all the ones that we forwarded, [ph] dozens and dozens of multiple ones, and we do an excellent job, but it's -- we're we have to deal with some unfortunate consequences of these acts. Well, we -- first of all, we focus on NOI growth. So, that's number one, and we expect to have NOI growth. So that's the first. I'd say to you -- I think you're not -- maybe we weren't clear, but the $54 is somewhat -- it's just the base minimum rent that our portfolio averages. It does not include overage or percentage rent. If you included that based on ‘21 results, that $54 would be $62. Okay? So, that's the that relationship there. And I don't -- I try to listen carefully to your question, but it just goes to show that the $54 is missing this component, and we thought it was material enough to point it out. Yes. That's all a function of lease expiration. So, we tend to raise -- if someone is an overage rent or they have a percent rent deal that's expiring, we try to raise the base minimum rent or we try to capture as much in the base minimum rent from the overage that's generated. You don't always get all of it, but you do some of it. So, it's -- it should pick up over time, but it's really a function of the big overage rent payers and when their leases expire. By the way, so do I. So do I, Floris. Okay? Yes. I think it's very simple. The real simple answer is sales, and we do a very sophisticated model. If we have sales levels that are above this year, we will overachieve that number. But again, we're in February, and we tend to be -- try to be cautious on that number. But that's really -- and then, there are increases in cost that we're dealing with as well for us. So for instance, I mean, security expenses are up based on -- we just had a discussion with Alex on that. Obviously, we have wage inflation janitorial. So, we have pressures on expenses just like everybody else. We've got no break on the real estate tax front from the local municipalities, even though we were closed for months in many cases in ‘20 -- ‘19 and ‘20. But our real estate tax expense keeps going up. So, we have pressures there that we're just trying to be relatively thoughtful about how to deal with. And then, the percent overage sales number going into every year is a little bit of the unknown, and we're trying to bake some conservatism into that thought process. No, no, no. We don't have CPI adjusted. Yes. And we have bumps. But if it goes up 6% and we're going up 3%, we lose 3%. So -- and -- so again, I mean, it's all factored in. But I would say there's a little bit of margin pressure. And again, hopefully, I've been clear on the sales front. Yes. Look, I think that's a great opportunity for our company. We did a very good job. It's kind of a flex business. We're still under occupied. We still have a number of tenants like that that are important to the community, but as more permanent tenants come to the market. That's a great opportunity for the Company. Floris, this is a real interesting thing. A lot of that stuff is happening now. So, think about it this way. In ‘21 -- in ‘20, we got decimated by COVID, right? We came back unbelievably strong in ‘21, much better than anyone would have predicted and reinforce our business model. I would venture to say. But we still have we still have a lot of short-term leasing or what I'll call specialty leasing. But that as we re-lease that space, that comes in midstream, that comes in first quarter, second quarter, third quarter of ‘22 because, as remember, our retail base, a lot of it sat on the sidelines, all of ‘20, and didn't really start opening up open to buy in ‘21. And by the time you build out a store in a mall, it's a six to nine-month process. So, as much given where we are today, I would say to you, and we never -- like this is solely anti the way I think. But we still have a transition year in ‘22. But it's not an excuse. I've never used that as an excuse. But believe me, as we continue to lease up to permanent retailers away from specialty, we're going to generate more income, but it's not all going to fall in ‘22. Now, did I explain myself well, guys? Would you add to it? Okay. So, sometimes I'm inarticulate. So I mean -- and again, that's not an excuse, but that's how -- but ‘22 is going to be -- continue to be a transition year like ‘21 was, but we kicked the crap out of ‘21. It was an unbelievable year. Spectacular based on where we were. Okay, Floris? Yes. Look, I think it reflects an earlier comment, which is we are starting to see a little more pricing power as demand goes up and the fact that the overall business is better. So, it's a good insurance policy and that the retailers are producing very positive results in our portfolio. We don't want to put them on the edge, but we've taken our lumps over the last few years. And now we're just trying to balance it a little bit better than what we've seen over the last couple of years. So, it's a good indicator that we've got some room to go. That's all it is. It's essentially a thing in the past, though, there's always a case here or there where we might -- we might have a deal in ‘23 for space, but they're not ready -- I'm sorry, they're not ready in ‘23. So we have a retailer in the space. So, ‘22 might be an extension of that while we finalize the lease for ‘23. And that's a little bit what I was talking about with Floris as well. Well, we do it -- we really do it -- I don't know why, but we do do it tenant by tenant. And I do -- simple thing is if we do see sales above this year, we would hopefully -- putting aside the comment about rising expense cost, if you kept our expenses flat, we would see a better, more robust NOI -- portfolio NOI growth. Simple answer is that. And we do have some baked in conservatism in that number. But again, it's -- we do this budgeting process late in the year. Actually, some people, they do it earlier than I'd like, but we -- it's always -- in the case of sales, it's an art versus a science. The good news, though, when we talk to retailers, they are planning up sales compared to ‘21, okay? And that's positive. And if they produce their own plan, we'll see the benefit of that. I would say around the 2% level, it's relatively flat. We don't give that out, but if we do -- well, I'll ask the guys if they want to give it out. We tend not to do that. But I would say it was similar to what we would use to see from when we had big international tourism in our big international properties from a percent point of view. Okay? Guys, is that right? Okay. And then, it really went away. So, it's kind of back to where we were maybe 4, 5, 6 years ago. I'm sorry. Could you repeat? I didn't -- you broke up there for a second. Yes. In the mills, they include all of the boxes. We include all the boxes. I shouldn't say that. We include all the boxes. So, every square footage. It's not whereas in the outlet mall, it's basically just the interior space, that's the department store. So, that's -- so they have a few big tenants that may be driving the increase. But that business has been very healthy, and we're very pleased with the results there. Okay. Thank you. I know there's a few that are still looking to get some questions answered. So, Brian and Tom will be available, of course, I am as well. And thanks for participating in the call today."

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask to please respect the request to limit you to one question. I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Our cash flow increased to nearly $3 billion year-to-date, consistent with pre -pandemic levels. We recorded increased leasing volumes, occupancy gains, shopper traffic, and retail sales. Demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is strong and growing, and our various platform investments continue to outperform.  Third quarter highlights from funds from operation starts with $1.18 billion or $3.13 per share. Included in the third quarter results were non-cash after-tax gains of $0.30 per share from the contribution of our interest in the Forever 21 and Brooks Brother’s licensing ventures. For additional equity ownership in Authentic Brands Group, we now own approximately 11% of ABG, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.08 per share from the redemption of the $1.65 billion of senior notes.  Our domestic operations had another excellent quarter, our international operations have improved. However, the quarter was below our budget by roughly $0.03 per share, primarily due to various COVID restrictions. Domestic property NOI increased 24.5% year-over-year for the quarter and 8.8% year-to-date.  These growth rates do not include any contribution from the TRG portfolio, or lease settlement income. And if you did include TRG and international properties, our portfolio NOI increased 34.3% for the quarter and 18.7% year-to-date. Occupancy was 92.8%, which was an increase of a 100 basis points compared to the second quarter. Average base rent was $53.91. However, that excludes percentage rent. And if you included that, that would add actually another $7 to BMR. For the first nine months, we signed 3500 leases for 12.8 million square feet, which was nearly 3 million square feet or approximately 800 more deals compared to the first 9 months of 2019. Mall sales for the third quarter were up 11%, compared to third quarter 2019, up 43% year-over-year. Our sales are over 2019 peak levels. These results are impressive, in particular, given lack of international tourism, which we believe will start to increase after the strict restrictions on international travel are lifted beginning next week. Our Company's focus, as you know, is cash flow growth, which should allow us to fund our growth opportunities and increase our dividend.  We would encourage the analytic community to focus on our cash flow and its growth because there are many levers that contribute to it beyond what is contained in 1 or 2 operating metrics. A simplication point, our mathematical open and close spread has declined yet our cash flow has significantly increased. Leasing spreads are calculated at a point in time. We have studied the leasing spread metric across the various retail real estate companies and highlight the following: Spreads are significantly impacted by tenant mix. Our leasing spreads include all openings and closing and is not a same-space measure.  However, we believe many other companies use only this subset for their calculation. We do not include variable lease income in our spread calculations, others do. And there's no consistency in approach. We intend to spend the next several months working to achieve uniformity on this metric, much like we did for sales reporting, although the shopping center sector still does not disclose any sales productivity for its retailers.  Let's keep in mind that all of these metrics, we need to put in perspective and we encourage you to take this opportunity to refocus on the importance of cash flow. We opened our fifth Premium outlet in Korea, and our tenth in Japan is under construction, our redevelopment activities accelerating, and Northgate station opened at Seattle Kraken Community Iceplex.  And we have many developments ongoing at Phipps, King of Prussia , many others. Our share of net cost of development projects is now approaching $1 billion. Our retail investment platforms are performing very well, including SPARC, Penney, and ABG. SPARC outperformed their budgets on sales, gross margins, and EBITDA. And we're very pleased with the JCPenney results. The Penney's team has stabilized the business improved financial results. And we've added private and exclusive national brands to it. Our liquidity position is at $1.5 billion and there's no outstanding balance on their line of credit. And we're very excited to announce, and in fact, his first day is today, Marc Rosen, he's joined the Company as the CEO. He's got a terrific background, great leader, and we look very forward to working with him as he builds on the momentum Penny has established this year. Penny's success is an excellent example of how to better understand our Company. We appointed Stanley Shashoua as the interim CEO for nearly a year ago and look at the results.  Much like the variety of our investments, no other Company nor industry has the capabilities to put an executive in an interim role and produce these results. This is a testament, not only to Stanley, but to the Simon culture. TRG is operating above our underwriting, posted also impressive results for cash flow growth occupancy, gains in retail sales, which were 16% higher.  As you know, we amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. We refinanced number of mortgages, and our liquidity stands at $8 billion including 6.9 available on our credit facility the rest in our share of cash. We paid a dividend of $1.50 in September, that was a 7.1% increase sequentially, and 15.4% year-over-year.  Today, we announce our fourth quarter dividend of a $1.65 per share in cash, which is an increase of 10% sequentially, and 27% year-over-year. Dividend will be paid December 31. Now we raised our guidance from $10.70 to $10.80 last quarter to $11.55 to $11.65 per share. This is 85% increase on the midpoint. That's 27% to 28% growth compared to 2020 results, and basically $2 higher than our initial budget this year.  And let me just conclude by saying the following, even though our stock has posted impressive year to date returns, we strongly believe it is still undervalue. Our current multiple of 13 times is approximately 3 turns lower than our historical average and screams very cheap compared to the REIT sector at 24 times, and in many cases, even close to 30.  We have unequivocally proven with our results year-to-date that we've overcome the arbitrary shutdown of our business due to the pandemic and our cash flow has bounced back dramatically, which many had doubted. We have growth leverage beyond our real estate assets that are unique attributes of our Company.  We have proven to be astute investors, we have unique business models and diversity of income streams. Our balance sheet is industry-leading and as strong as it's ever been. Our dividend yield is 4.7% and growing, well - covered, higher than the S&P yield of 1.9%, and a REIT average of 2.9%, and we have the potential to perform very well in an inflationary cycle. We're now ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Hill : Hey, good morning -- or good afternoon, guys. Sorry, it's been a long day. Congrats on another really good quarter, David. I did want to maybe just understand a little bit more about the sequential slowdown on maybe -- in TRG’s domestic portfolio and the international portfolio. Is there anything specifically that would drive that? I'm really only asking the question in terms of how we should think about forward modeling because I do recognize that your guide --\nDavid Simon: No, no, no, you're wrong. It's -- we were just showing our share, so compared to the gross number last quarter. Okay. No, it's a good question, but it's just our share.\nRich Hill: Okay. Thank you very much for that clarification.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. No, no, no, I'm glad you pointed that out. Thank you.\nRich Hill: Got it. And then I did want to maybe just to understand a little bit more about the income from unconsolidated entities. Just to be clear, like last quarter, the non-cash gain was included in that number; is that right?\nDavid Simon: Yes. Yeah.\nRich Hill: Okay. And then maybe we can just talk about how -- why that number went down a little bit? I do recognize depreciation went up pretty significantly versus the prior quarter. Obviously, seasonality would dictate that the retailers were doing pretty well. Is there anything that we should think about in that number as we look going forward?\nDavid Simon: No, it's just -- it's probably most impacted by our European and international business, as I mentioned earlier.\nRich Hill: Great. Thanks. That's it from me. Thanks again and congrats on the good quarter.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Schmidt: Great. Thank you. I noticed going from second to third quarter, you increased your total redevelopment about $83 million, the total investment, but that does not include Taubman. Have you started to make any of your investments in terms of Taubman redevelopment?\nDavid Simon: Yeah. I mean, it's progressing the way we thought it would. There's a big master planning in the works on Cherry Creek, but that will be several years in the making, but now, there's some good stuff happening in that portfolio as well.\nCraig Schmidt: Great. And then, how should we think about your retail investments, in terms of quarter-to-quarter, it moves around. Should we look at it on an annual basis, or how should we get a better handle on what you have been able to produce that of your investment in retail?\nDavid Simon: Well, I think you should think about it as a Company that can add value to what we invest in, and you should always -- you should never worry about quarter-over-quarter or you should look at annual results and compare them historically. So I'd just say that's generally, but I think where -- I think the most important thing is Craig, we're just a different Company than what most think of us.  I mean, we have lots of avenues for growth and our investments in retailers and other companies has proven to be extremely successful and it will create some variability to quarter-over-quarter but year-after-year, I think, when you look at our return on investment, return on our EBITDA for those businesses; it's actually quite outstanding.  And if you look at the valuations that e-commerce companies are getting for their.com businesses, we've gotten embedded value here that's pretty exciting. So I would never worry about one quarter over another.\nCraig Schmidt: No. I'm particularly thinking about the 11% interest in APG and what people say that might go for on an IDL. That's very impressive. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. I mean, I just -- look, we're just not your -- we're more than just an -- even though, we're -- you call us a mall Company, I think we've proven to be beyond that, and that's what I'd encourage you to focus on.\nCraig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI, please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good afternoon, David. It was nice to see the occupancy up 100 basis points sequentially. I am just wondering if you could discuss a little bit about your leasing pipeline and backlog, maybe where you think occupancy ends at the end of this year and what your expectations are for a recovery in occupancy.\nDavid Simon: Well, I think it's going to take a little bit of time to get back to where we were pre -pandemic but, I think what's exciting, Steve, is that when we're talking to our folks there -- I was just seeing a tremendous amount of demand. Never been busier. Lots of new retailers, not -- a lots of new users. And I think the action is in our portfolio, so we'll have another increase this quarter upcoming, and then we'll increase our occupancy next year. I don't -- I can't, as you know, we never give specific guidance on that. But the demand, I strongly would tell you that it's -- it's very good. And it's across the board. It's the high-end retailers, it's the value-oriented retailers. We're very pleased with what we're seeing.\nSteve Sakwa: Great, thanks.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi. Good evening and nice quarter. I guess, maybe just another question on the retailer part of the business. I was wondering if you could go through from a REIT perspective, is there a max how big this business -- how big this can be as a part of your business? And just what's the current goal or ultimate plan for your own brands? Is it just to grow the existing brands, acquire more, and sell it? Just any thoughts on the plans going forward.\nDavid Simon: Well, listen, we're obviously very dedicated to being a REIT, and staying a REIT. And all of these businesses are in taxable REIT subsidiary. And you see that in this quarter in particular, you'll see that the big tax expense that is flowing through our P&L. But because we tend to buy these in partnerships, we have really a runway to continue to grow that business. Not to mention that we'd still have our SPAC out there that is a -- in a sense a vehicle for growth. So I'm optimistic that based on our track record, we're going to continue to find other investments whether its retailer, similar situated businesses that will continue that -- add to our unique Company, and we'll take it from there.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. I think we'll learn more once the 10-Q is out, but until then, just on that tax number in the quarter, could you clarify if that was just related to the retailer income and that taxable REIT subsidiaries, or if there is anything one-time included?\nBrian Mc Dade: Hey Caitlin, it's Brian. There's actually a one-time $48 million number coming through there from the ABG transaction that we had in the quarter. So you got to bifurcate the 2 numbers. There's a 48 and then the rest is just our normal regular occurring operational tax accrual.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. Thank you.\nBrian Mc Dade: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi, please proceed with your question.\nMichael Bilerman: Hi, Great. Kenny McConnell (ph) is on with me as well. David, good afternoon. I was wondering if you can maybe go a little bit deeper into the retailer environment in the sense that we know sales are extraordinarily strong as everyone's gotten back out and enjoyed buying things again, but the retailers are struggling a little bit behind -- below the sales line.  They're struggling with staffing. They're struggling with keeping product up to date, most of it launched on ships. So how are you thinking about it from two sides? One, the retailers that you own in dealing with some of these issues, where they're also dealing with their e-comm problems too.  And also from the standpoint of how you think retailers are going to approach the store openings next year, given some of the product, giving some of the staffing concerns and how all that melts together, now that you are more and more sitting on both sides of this equation and really understanding some of these pressure points.\nDavid Simon: Well, let me just tackle the backlog in getting product to the stores, which does have an impact on us. You know, just with respect to our tenants. And then as well as the brands that we own. There's variability.  I mean, everyone is pretty comfortable or  -- I should say confident that they're going to get the product in there for the holiday season, but I would tell you that there's no guarantees, so there will be some variability  that we probably would have felt a little bit better going into fourth quarter, but we're cautious on it because we just don't know and it's out of our hands though. I did throw a shout out to Stanley only because by the way, I trained him, but just don't forget that. But he did tell me that he was going to -- if he had to go to the port of LA and unpack boxes to get them into the Penny store, he said he was going to do it. Ad I said, \"Well, that's a great idea, I will do it too. We're on call to help, so that's that. If there is variability, I don't know, but I think generally, people are reasonably confident that they'll get this -- they'll get their product in for time -- for Christmas. Now with respect to employment, this as well beyond retail.\nMichael Bilerman : Yeah.\nDavid Simon: And I mean, it's a -- with all the political back and forth going on, it's really not talked about. And just from a CEO point-of-view and just someone that's worried about growing our overall economy because obviously we are correlated to GDP growth, we've got to figure out whatever is causing the lack of employment growth. We've got to \"Get to the root of it,” because it's not clear to me that there's a big focus on it.  And finally getting your last question, Thankfully, Michael, I have not seen it impact folk’s open-to-buy or their growth. Could it? Eventually, the answer is sure, but I -- we have not seen it yet. But the lack of employment is an issue, especially in its -- and some of our retailers are -- they're doing one shift, they're increasing the salaries of the people, there are less part time.  So they're combating it maybe in an a good long-term way because they're raising salaries and getting more loyalty out of that, but the increase in restaurant demand has been phenomenal. And that's the area I worry most about, is just -- ultimately, whether the employment picture could slow that demand -- I don't know, right now, but it's a concern.\nMichael Bilerman : And so when you throw all this stuff into the pot, you obviously have a lot more earnings and cash flow drivers at timing today that's ever been in your history; does your disclosure -- to be able to get credit and for the Street to value things to the point which you're talking about, your stock being undervalued. Isn't it necessary to breakdown some of these businesses or to give a little bit more information within supplemental so that people can really identify each of these drivers for more operating businesses to the more rent business because there's like little pieces, you have FFF on investments on a traveling 12-month basis in the credit metrics section, it would be really good to get that on a quarterly basis and all those -- are you stepping back?  I know you talked about the lease spreads, but is there an opportunity to revamp disclosure, to give the investment community more of that level of detail overall?\nDavid Simon: It's -- we're not going to rule it out. It is our property, domestic property business just to put it in perspective, Michael, is around 80% of our cash flow earnings. However -- FFO, however you want to define it. So then we have the 20% other stuff. And I just worry that if we do get into that, we'll spend more time on the 20%.  Now, 10 years from now it may be different, 5 years from now it could be different, the 80% could be 50%. And then, I agree 100% with your encouragement or point-of-view that it needs to be better articulated. The other option is we could sell our dot-com business for the huge number and -- like some of the others out there, and then you'll ascribe a certain value to it. Believe me, we wouldn't rule that out.\nMichael Bilerman : You were never in embarking business to begin with. You and I have gone back on that about selling interest in malls. You never wanted to be in the mark. You want to end cash flow and the value.\nDavid Simon: I mean, I'm a terrible seller as I have admitted. In any event, I think -- look, I'm excited about what we're doing. I do think it's still -- it's more -- it's a tail wagging the dog, but it's an important tail and it's a beautiful tail and it wags nice and it's very friendly. And as we grow that, I think you're -- I think what you say is certainly appropriate.\nMichael Bilerman : All right. Thanks. If we have time I'll queue up for a quick guidance on later.\nDavid Simon: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Hey, good afternoon out there, David. I didn't realize that you and David -- that you and Stanley are both union long shore men able to work on in the LA Long Beach periods, that's pretty impressive.\nDavid Simon: Well, we'll do whatever it takes to get product into our stores.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Well I think if you know that you need that as well.\nDavid Simon: You can join us, Alex. You can join us.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Hey, I -- if you didn't work, it's pretty tough work unless you can get to the crane operators, those guys make good money. My question for you, and it sounds like Tom, we get two questions, so I love it. David, it sounds like in your opening comments, you said that you were a little bit behind budget because of some of the COVID closures that you were still experiencing.  Despite that and backing up the ABG intellectual property gain, which is awesome, you guys don't handedly beat. So I know you guys -- I know David, you like to run your career really hard and with -- and do all the fun stuff shout, get your team excited to win.  But still, it's hard to say that you guys were under budget when you beat consensus as much and it sounds, in your answers to Michael on store openings and labor and all different things, it doesn't sound like there really -- any headwinds. It sounds like you guys are just really rebounding strong. So what was the below budget related to as far as --\nDavid Simon: Yes. Alex that was just our international ops. So if I didn't say the word 'international', it's just because I've misread it on the script. I said it. It's just international, it's the only business that I would say is under our initial budget for 2021.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Okay. So then just drilling into that international part, what are you seeing? Are you seeing anything like the rebound that we've seen in the U.S. whether it's Asia or Europe, or are the consumer rebound trends very different?\nDavid Simon: That's a good question. And I -- and it's by country, in a sense. So there is no simple answer that I would say to you. It's very much how COVID is impacting that country. As you know, Europe was much generally -- in France and Italy, much more stringent on how they open. And as you know, we -- our friends at Klepierre had to deal with almost a -- which, by the way, LA County almost did, but we'd have to enforce whether or not people had vaccine cards to let them in a mall, which thankfully a cooler heads prevailed but it really is a country-by-country.  We're seeing a little bit decent results in the European outlet business and Clay Pears (ph) feeling more confident about what they are seeing. But I would tell you, Asia is generally no, Japan is pretty tough but they have had a pretty strict, shutdown, Korea is doing just fine. I think generally, the U.S. is clearly outperforming. Other -- just from retail sales than other parts of the country -- other parts of the world, I should say.\nAlexander Goldfarb : And then on your international folks though, are they telling you, \"Yeah, by January 1st, the rest of Asia, Japan, Europe, France, all of the -- all the different countries in Europe. Everyone should be back? \" Or is there just a continued concern that those countries are going to continue to punt on reopening’s and ease of COVID mandates such that '22 is as greatly impacted on the international \nDavid Simon: I'm hopeful '22 will be a better year for them, just like '21 was for us. So -- but there will be more proactive gentlemen, I say they, I mean, again, it's country-by-country, but in many spots we'll be more proactive with COVID if COVID spikes.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Okay. And then just a quick \nDavid Simon:  restrictions I should say.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Just a quick question for Brian. On the new line of credit where you switched over from LIBOR to SOFR? The net, end of the day, the economic impact, you guys are still -- are basically paying the same cost for this switchover. You guys are ending up paying a little bit more, maybe it's a little bit less I don't know.\nDavid Simon: No, it's a push. It's an economic push that was the whole design, and so forth, Alex. The intent was to be economically neutral.\nAlexander Goldfarb : Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Mueller: Yeah. I was wondering, outside of the $0.22 of net 3Q one-time items, can you break down which drove the guidance increase for the balance of the year?\nDavid Simon: Can you repeat that, Michael?\nMike Mueller: You had net $0.22 of one-time items that you called out and guidance went up, I think $0.85 so what drove the other $0.63 or so of the increase, if you could break that down, how much retailer versus domestic ops?\nDavid Simon: We don't break that down, but it was a combination of both.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJuan Sanabria : Hi. Just checking if you could walk through maybe the quarterly volatility. I know you told Craig not to look at quarterly variances and I apologize for this; but given the movements, it does seem like last quarter, it was reported at share -- this quarter is that share.  And the retailer NOI dipped and the corporate NOI dipped as well, but the guidance went up, so I'm just trying to put these pieces together, maybe get the components for those two NOI pieces, retailer, corporate, and then tying that back to the guidance question that Mike just asked.\nDavid Simon: Well, one, you got to remember here, looking at annual numbers here or even quarterly numbers, there were a variety of retailer businesses that we didn't own last year. So that's part of this noise when you looking at it year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter. That's a big piece of this. JCPenney didn't close until year end of last year, which is a big driver of this. So you got a different population, if you would.\nJuan Sanabria : I'm just focused on sequential because the numbers did go down for -- it seems those two buckets on a share basis, the retailer investments NOI and the corporate, and other NOI s.\nBrian Mc Dade: Sure. You have just seasonality and timing on the retailer side of it, and then corporate and other, the bigger changes that we recognize as last quarter, a large amounts of termination income.\nJuan Sanabria : Okay. And then just more of a conceptual question on retailing. You guys own different pieces of the retailer landscape you have, the licensing, your traditional -- the licensing, an intellectual property licensing in the traditional retailing.  How do you think of the multiples that you would apply for those or the stickiness of the cash flows. And if you could talk about typical margins. Just trying to get a sense of where the EBITDA is coming from between those two pieces and how you think about those two pieces as well.\nDavid Simon: Whereas the EBITDA coming from the retail?\nJuan Sanabria : Between the licensing and traditional retail, yeah, because you have the ABG Investment which is talking about the licensing business.\nDavid Simon: This is the -- well, ABG more or less owns the brands. A lot of brands in the license income. The retailers run the e-commerce and operate stores, so it's essentially like any other retailer and the valuation of those should just be the way you look at any other public Company retailer. I will tell you today, from an EBITDA multiples, retailers reward value to the higher EBITDA multiple than Simon Property Group.\nJuan Sanabria : And what is a better margin business; do you think the licensing or the traditional retailing?\nDavid Simon: Well, the licensing, I mean, it's -- that's a -- licensing business -- are you amortizing the cost of buying the license or not? So the brand -- if you don't -- they have a higher margin, but the gross margins of good retailers are in the 60 plus range.\nJuan Sanabria : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your questions.\nVince Tibone: Hi. Good afternoon. How are same properties operating expenses trending versus 2019? Are you experiencing any pressure from wage inflation or extra cleaning costs given most of the retailers on a fixed CAM basis.\nDavid Simon: Not currently, a. They've got, I think -- we'll see how it impacts '22, but not rising costs from our standpoint in '21 -- shouldn't be all that material.\nJuan Sanabria : Are you much higher than where you were in '19 or are it kind of adjusted for occupancy changes like margins are more or less the same in your mind or kind of \nDavid Simon: Well, other than the drop in occupancy, I think in terms of operating, it's probably pretty similar to '19.\nJuan Sanabria : And are you thinking about -- go ahead, I'm sorry.\nDavid Simon: No, I think that's it.\nJuan Sanabria : And I was just saying are you thinking about the way CAM is structured any differently now, given the prospect of higher inflation or -- yeah, just curious to get your thoughts there.\nDavid Simon: Not really, a. I think the fixed CAM, and obviously it grows in many cases tied to CPI, is just an ease of doing business with the retailer and I don't see that changing.\nVince Tibone: Got it. Thank you. Maybe one last quick one for me. Could you just share your latest expectations for domestic property NOI growth from the year? I think the last time you formerly said anything was at 5% at beginning of the year, and I think it's clearly higher from there.\nDavid Simon: It's going to be higher, Vince.\nVince Tibone: Any number you could throw out there for us?\nDavid Simon: Well, now I -- we look at these things on an annual basis, but I'd hate to put a number in. But we're going to be really, based on where we were and what we guided to, we'll -- we should double it, more or less, right? I mean, I think, what do we guide to 4% or something like that? So we should be in that range.\nVince Tibone: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thanks. Way to get it out of me Vince, way to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your questions.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Hey, thanks guys. Thanks for taking my question. I sometimes wonder whether people are not seeing the forest through the trees here. I mean, your guidance for the year is $0.60 over 2022 estimates, right now for consensus, which is -- I suspect those numbers are going to have to come up drastically. Let me get to my question here.  It's about the leasing environment and I'd love to get your color on what you're seeing. Obviously, that you talked about the leasing spreads being negative, and again, those are backwards looking because those deals were negotiated 3 to 6 to 12 months ago, obviously when we are in a different environment. There were many articles written about tenants wanting more turnover, sales, and rent-based structures.  You talked about that in past quarters about offering some of that, but actually as sales now are in excess of 19 levels, comfortably, in excess, apparently, apparently. Are you actually capturing more rent and what do you think that's going to do for your overage rent and also how is that impacting your negotiations with tenants? Do they want to go back to the fixed rents with a smaller turnover base? I'd love to get your thoughts on that.\nDavid Simon: Thank you Floris. So I would say -- look, our overage rent is going to be significant this year, but I do want to put -- I want to underline, we still do not have international tourism. So we think there's another -- and I don't believe now, the rules of who can come where and how and whatever, are very confusing. Having -- make my own two international trips, I get confused on what I have to do to go from one place to the next.  But next week there is a lifting of international tourism. We'll see whether it has any impact this year, as I doubt it, but even with overage rent having a very good year this year, we still think that there is another leg up if we get the international tourist that we haven't seen for a couple of 2-3 years, right?  And now, the strengthened dollar may offset that to some extent but we'll see. On your question about lease, this 1, I think some of the folks that wanted to tie their rent too -- and we did it in a select few cases, not a lot. But, yes, they may suddenly think maybe they should do another traditional, go back and do a basic deal.  But by and large, Floris, there's not a lot. I'd say the negotiations about the structure of the lease and overage rent. I call it overage, but overage rent and breakpoints -- it's all pretty -- it's all -- I'd say pretty consistent. So not a huge change in what's going on there.\nFloris Van Dijkum: And David, maybe if you could touch on the specialty leasing environment as well. Obviously, last year, when a lot of your malls were closed, clearly, you couldn't have much kiosk income. Obviously, billboards -- billboard income is really driven by economic growth. So that, presumably, was very low last year. What do you see? I mean, this is -- could be up to 10% of your NOI. I mean, how do you see that part of the business performing as we head into '22?\nDavid Simon: I think we're going to have a very good year in '22 on that side. Because again, there's just a better appreciation for our kind of product and demand is good there. And growing and traffic is still reaching previous levels. So I think they're going to have a very good year this year, but a better year in '22, at least from our initial kind of review of that business plan that we just had recently.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Great. I mean, maybe if I ask what -- I sort of was asked before, but certainly the backlog of leasing; can you give us any more insight? I know somebody also asked the question about that, but certainly, in terms of what that could mean in terms of occupancy gains in '22 because clearly that's the easy income, if you will, because it all drops down to the bottom line. Any sort of backlog that you're working with right now? Your leasing is busy, and stretched to the max, I would imagine.\nDavid Simon: Listen, I always worry they tell me what I want a hear, but what they're telling me, okay? And what I'm seeing in my own -- having to deal with a few retailer space demands, demand is good. So I think -- listen, the world is uncertain as all get out, right? I mean, we all know it's just an -- it's a very interesting time. The last several years and the future are no different. But Floris, the good news is, the demand for our product is good. And our folks are busy, and they're hitting the streets, and making deals. Again, we never give an occupancy number, but I would be very disappointed if we didn't have an uptick in occupancy next year.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Thanks, David. That's it for me.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinnis with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Mc Ginnis: David, asking my question a bit differently in terms of back of the napkin math here. So FFO per share guidance appears to be take a slowdown in Q4 versus Q3 after adjusting for the non-cash items. Could you help us understand what items might be impacting those expectations?\nDavid Simon: Versus what you were doing or what we're doing?\nGreg Mc Ginnis: You have 291, Q3, if we take out the non-cash items. And then that kind of assumes 270, 280 in Q4?\nDavid Simon: We'll see what we earn. We don't really look at it quarter by quarter.\nGreg Mc Ginnis: All right. Then maybe shifting gears a little bit to the percent rent leases. First, I'm just trying to understand what portion of leases signed of last year are tied to percent rent deals. How is that compared to history? And then you also mentioned that overage rent will be significant this year, is there going to be seasonality associated with that?  We are just trying to understand if we should expect a sizeable pop in Q1 next year as Christmas sales and associated renter calculated or if it should be smoother throughout the year?\nDavid Simon: Well, overage rent does -- is impacted by holiday shopping. So there is some seasonality to it. We don't give out the specifics on what deals are percent versus fixed, though, the -- it's not a very big number.  I mean, overwhelmingly a high, high, high percentage of our leases are fixed and sometimes we have unnatural breakpoints which we can get into the mechanics of that later, if you'd like, where we do maybe -- and in COVID, this is -- we did a few -- a handful with some retailers where we may be lowered the fixed, but we got greater upside on sales. But 90 some odd percent of our leases are all fixed rent. And I think I answered your question, unless I missed something.\nGreg Mc Ginnis: No, you did. So if we think about how leases are getting signed now that we're coming out of COVID, should we expect to see those -- that percent rent number go down and maybe just base rent number start going back up again?\nDavid Simon: Well, yeah, on rollover. Sure, over time. Again, it's a function of when leases expire.\nGreg Mc Ginnis: All right. Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hi, David. Good evening.\nDavid Simon: How are you?\nHaendel St. Juste: So you mentioned earlier the stock being cheap 13 times FFO, I get it. And you point out your long-term average, but I guess the 1 missing piece we haven't seen is the asset value clarity. I guess, I'm curious where you peg a mall cap rates today, was there anything in your recent mall refinancing and negotiation that was informative about how the lending community is viewing mall values and how would you characterize the market appetite for mall refinancing’s today? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Good. I think we did -- how many financing did we do?\nBrian Mc Dade: It's probably -- that's 22 this year, almost $30 billion. The market is open from a refinancing perspective in supportive of high-quality assets.\nDavid Simon: Look, I think, we're -- I'd say where A assets, there's -- I mean, I have discussed this before and not to bore you, but there's not a lot of buyers, and sellers realized how valuable they are, and they want a really low cap rate. There's no A asset in this country, that would sell for anything above a five cap rate. My opinion -- in my humble opinion.\nHaendel St. Juste: I appreciate that. I was looking also if there's anything from the other side that you could share from how the lenders are valuing or any variant?\nDavid Simon: I thought you were an equity analyst. Why do you care about lenders?\nHaendel St. Juste: Well, there's a value with the loan is described to.\nDavid Simon: Exactly. I mean, look, they're -- they look at debt yield.\nBrian Mc Dade: Debt yield in cash flow cover deal is the metrics that they're using more and more importantly,\nDavid Simon: And sponsorship to our resource.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Well, I guess I'll move on to my next question. Thank you though. One last about the pricing and demand for your JCPenney boxes. Anything you could share on that? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Well, the ones that we own, we're not selling because Penney is performing terrifically well.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Thanks.\nTom Ward: Alex, we have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLinda Tsai: Hi. Thanks for taking my question.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nLinda Tsai: In terms of the $7 of variable rents that weren't included in the base minimum rent. When would you expect to see improvement in that number and how much of that -- those $7 could be moved to fix?\nDavid Simon: You mean improvement or just when it goes too fixed essentially, right?\nLinda Tsai: Well, I guess, 2 separate questions. When it goes too fixed and then when would we see an overall improvement in base minimum rent given the moving pieces?\nDavid Simon: Well, it's lease by lease to build that number up. I mean, demand is picking up, so we're focused on driving our cash flow. But again, as I -- maybe you missed my -- it wasn't overly compelling, but you missed my opening remarks. In that I would recommend again, I know -- I'd recommend you just look at the cash flow of the Company and not overly worry about a metric here or there. It just -- it all manifests itself in the cash.  In terms of when that will end up in base rent is really, as I said earlier, is just going to be functional when that particular resource, when it expires. And traditionally, when that does, we're usually pretty effective of trying to garner as much of that overage rent or that percentage rent above the break-point back into the base rent.\nLinda Tsai : Got it. And then store closures are way down from prior years and given the importance of holiday to retailers but also challenges around supply chain, do you think this is potentially a threat to some of the smaller lower credit retailers?\nDavid Simon: I don't think so. And honestly the credit profile of the retail community is not bad. I mean, there's always going to be a few out there, but I would say generally the credit profile is pretty -- not going to look pretty good. So the retailers are always pruning the portfolio and so on. But I don't think the supply chain is going to cause -- it might unfortunately cause a local mom and pop some stress but I don't think it will cause it a regional or bigger chain, financial calamity.\nLinda Tsai : Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to David Simon for closing remarks.\nDavid Simon: All right. Thank you and appreciate all the questions. We'll talk soon.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Hey Caitlin, it's Brian. There's actually a one-time $48 million number coming through there from the ABG transaction that we had in the quarter. So you got to bifurcate the 2 numbers. There's a 48 and then the rest is just our normal regular occurring operational tax accrual. Thank you. Sure. You have just seasonality and timing on the retailer side of it, and then corporate and other, the bigger changes that we recognize as last quarter, a large amounts of termination income. It's probably -- that's 22 this year, almost $30 billion. The market is open from a refinancing perspective in supportive of high-quality assets.

            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "Our cash flow increased to nearly $3 billion year-to-date, consistent with pre -pandemic levels. We recorded increased leasing volumes, occupancy gains, shopper traffic, and retail sales. Demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is strong and growing, and our various platform investments continue to outperform.  Third quarter highlights from funds from operation starts with $1.18 billion or $3.13 per share. Included in the third quarter results were non-cash after-tax gains of $0.30 per share from the contribution of our interest in the Forever 21 and Brooks Brother's licensing ventures. For additional equity ownership in Authentic Brands Group, we now own approximately 11% of ABG, and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.08 per share from the redemption of the $1.65 billion of senior notes.  Our domestic operations had another excellent quarter, our international operations have improved. However, the quarter was below our budget by roughly $0.03 per share, primarily due to various COVID restrictions. Domestic property NOI increased 24.5% year-over-year for the quarter and 8.8% year-to-date.  These growth rates do not include any contribution from the TRG portfolio, or lease settlement income. And if you did include TRG and international properties, our portfolio NOI increased 34.3% for the quarter and 18.7% year-to-date. Occupancy was 92.8%, which was an increase of a 100 basis points compared to the second quarter. Average base rent was $53.91. However, that excludes percentage rent. And if you included that, that would add actually another $7 to BMR. For the first nine months, we signed 3500 leases for 12.8 million square feet, which was nearly 3 million square feet or approximately 800 more deals compared to the first 9 months of 2019. Mall sales for the third quarter were up 11%, compared to third quarter 2019, up 43% year-over-year. Our sales are over 2019 peak levels. These results are impressive, in particular, given lack of international tourism, which we believe will start to increase after the strict restrictions on international travel are lifted beginning next week. Our Company's focus, as you know, is cash flow growth, which should allow us to fund our growth opportunities and increase our dividend.  We would encourage the analytic community to focus on our cash flow and its growth because there are many levers that contribute to it beyond what is contained in 1 or 2 operating metrics. A simplication point, our mathematical open and close spread has declined yet our cash flow has significantly increased. Leasing spreads are calculated at a point in time. We have studied the leasing spread metric across the various retail real estate companies and highlight the following: Spreads are significantly impacted by tenant mix. Our leasing spreads include all openings and closing and is not a same-space measure.  However, we believe many other companies use only this subset for their calculation. We do not include variable lease income in our spread calculations, others do. And there's no consistency in approach. We intend to spend the next several months working to achieve uniformity on this metric, much like we did for sales reporting, although the shopping center sector still does not disclose any sales productivity for its retailers.  Let's keep in mind that all of these metrics, we need to put in perspective and we encourage you to take this opportunity to refocus on the importance of cash flow. We opened our fifth Premium outlet in Korea, and our tenth in Japan is under construction, our redevelopment activities accelerating, and Northgate station opened at Seattle Kraken Community Iceplex.  And we have many developments ongoing at Phipps, King of Prussia , many others. Our share of net cost of development projects is now approaching $1 billion. Our retail investment platforms are performing very well, including SPARC, Penney, and ABG. SPARC outperformed their budgets on sales, gross margins, and EBITDA. And we're very pleased with the JCPenney results. The Penney's team has stabilized the business improved financial results. And we've added private and exclusive national brands to it. Our liquidity position is at $1.5 billion and there's no outstanding balance on their line of credit. And we're very excited to announce, and in fact, his first day is today, Marc Rosen, he's joined the Company as the CEO. He's got a terrific background, great leader, and we look very forward to working with him as he builds on the momentum Penny has established this year. Penny's success is an excellent example of how to better understand our Company. We appointed Stanley Shashoua as the interim CEO for nearly a year ago and look at the results.  Much like the variety of our investments, no other Company nor industry has the capabilities to put an executive in an interim role and produce these results. This is a testament, not only to Stanley, but to the Simon culture. TRG is operating above our underwriting, posted also impressive results for cash flow growth occupancy, gains in retail sales, which were 16% higher.  As you know, we amended and extended our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. We refinanced number of mortgages, and our liquidity stands at $8 billion including 6.9 available on our credit facility the rest in our share of cash. We paid a dividend of $1.50 in September, that was a 7.1% increase sequentially, and 15.4% year-over-year.  Today, we announce our fourth quarter dividend of a $1.65 per share in cash, which is an increase of 10% sequentially, and 27% year-over-year. Dividend will be paid December 31. Now we raised our guidance from $10.70 to $10.80 last quarter to $11.55 to $11.65 per share. This is 85% increase on the midpoint. That's 27% to 28% growth compared to 2020 results, and basically $2 higher than our initial budget this year.  And let me just conclude by saying the following, even though our stock has posted impressive year to date returns, we strongly believe it is still undervalue. Our current multiple of 13 times is approximately 3 turns lower than our historical average and screams very cheap compared to the REIT sector at 24 times, and in many cases, even close to 30.  We have unequivocally proven with our results year-to-date that we've overcome the arbitrary shutdown of our business due to the pandemic and our cash flow has bounced back dramatically, which many had doubted. We have growth leverage beyond our real estate assets that are unique attributes of our Company.  We have proven to be astute investors, we have unique business models and diversity of income streams. Our balance sheet is industry-leading and as strong as it's ever been. Our dividend yield is 4.7% and growing, well - covered, higher than the S&P yield of 1.9%, and a REIT average of 2.9%, and we have the potential to perform very well in an inflationary cycle. We're now ready for questions. No, no, no, you're wrong. It's -- we were just showing our share, so compared to the gross number last quarter. Okay. No, it's a good question, but it's just our share. Yeah. No, no, no, I'm glad you pointed that out. Thank you. Yes. Yeah. No, it's just -- it's probably most impacted by our European and international business, as I mentioned earlier. Thank you. Yeah. I mean, it's progressing the way we thought it would. There's a big master planning in the works on Cherry Creek, but that will be several years in the making, but now, there's some good stuff happening in that portfolio as well. Well, I think you should think about it as a Company that can add value to what we invest in, and you should always -- you should never worry about quarter-over-quarter or you should look at annual results and compare them historically. So I'd just say that's generally, but I think where -- I think the most important thing is Craig, we're just a different Company than what most think of us.  I mean, we have lots of avenues for growth and our investments in retailers and other companies has proven to be extremely successful and it will create some variability to quarter-over-quarter but year-after-year, I think, when you look at our return on investment, return on our EBITDA for those businesses; it's actually quite outstanding.  And if you look at the valuations that e-commerce companies are getting for their.com businesses, we've gotten embedded value here that's pretty exciting. So I would never worry about one quarter over another. Yeah. I mean, I just -- look, we're just not your -- we're more than just an -- even though, we're -- you call us a mall Company, I think we've proven to be beyond that, and that's what I'd encourage you to focus on. Thank you. Well, I think it's going to take a little bit of time to get back to where we were pre -pandemic but, I think what's exciting, Steve, is that when we're talking to our folks there -- I was just seeing a tremendous amount of demand. Never been busier. Lots of new retailers, not -- a lots of new users. And I think the action is in our portfolio, so we'll have another increase this quarter upcoming, and then we'll increase our occupancy next year. I don't -- I can't, as you know, we never give specific guidance on that. But the demand, I strongly would tell you that it's -- it's very good. And it's across the board. It's the high-end retailers, it's the value-oriented retailers. We're very pleased with what we're seeing. Thank you. Well, listen, we're obviously very dedicated to being a REIT, and staying a REIT. And all of these businesses are in taxable REIT subsidiary. And you see that in this quarter in particular, you'll see that the big tax expense that is flowing through our P&L. But because we tend to buy these in partnerships, we have really a runway to continue to grow that business. Not to mention that we'd still have our SPAC out there that is a -- in a sense a vehicle for growth. So I'm optimistic that based on our track record, we're going to continue to find other investments whether its retailer, similar situated businesses that will continue that -- add to our unique Company, and we'll take it from there. Well, let me just tackle the backlog in getting product to the stores, which does have an impact on us. You know, just with respect to our tenants. And then as well as the brands that we own. There's variability.  I mean, everyone is pretty comfortable or  -- I should say confident that they're going to get the product in there for the holiday season, but I would tell you that there's no guarantees, so there will be some variability  that we probably would have felt a little bit better going into fourth quarter, but we're cautious on it because we just don't know and it's out of our hands though. I did throw a shout out to Stanley only because by the way, I trained him, but just don't forget that. But he did tell me that he was going to -- if he had to go to the port of LA and unpack boxes to get them into the Penny store, he said he was going to do it. Ad I said, \"Well, that's a great idea, I will do it too. We're on call to help, so that's that. If there is variability, I don't know, but I think generally, people are reasonably confident that they'll get this -- they'll get their product in for time -- for Christmas. Now with respect to employment, this as well beyond retail. And I mean, it's a -- with all the political back and forth going on, it's really not talked about. And just from a CEO point-of-view and just someone that's worried about growing our overall economy because obviously we are correlated to GDP growth, we've got to figure out whatever is causing the lack of employment growth. We've got to \"Get to the root of it,” because it's not clear to me that there's a big focus on it.  And finally getting your last question, Thankfully, Michael, I have not seen it impact folk's open-to-buy or their growth. Could it? Eventually, the answer is sure, but I -- we have not seen it yet. But the lack of employment is an issue, especially in its -- and some of our retailers are -- they're doing one shift, they're increasing the salaries of the people, there are less part time.  So they're combating it maybe in an a good long-term way because they're raising salaries and getting more loyalty out of that, but the increase in restaurant demand has been phenomenal. And that's the area I worry most about, is just -- ultimately, whether the employment picture could slow that demand -- I don't know, right now, but it's a concern. It's -- we're not going to rule it out. It is our property, domestic property business just to put it in perspective, Michael, is around 80% of our cash flow earnings. However -- FFO, however you want to define it. So then we have the 20% other stuff. And I just worry that if we do get into that, we'll spend more time on the 20%.  Now, 10 years from now it may be different, 5 years from now it could be different, the 80% could be 50%. And then, I agree 100% with your encouragement or point-of-view that it needs to be better articulated. The other option is we could sell our dot-com business for the huge number and -- like some of the others out there, and then you'll ascribe a certain value to it. Believe me, we wouldn't rule that out. I mean, I'm a terrible seller as I have admitted. In any event, I think -- look, I'm excited about what we're doing. I do think it's still -- it's more -- it's a tail wagging the dog, but it's an important tail and it's a beautiful tail and it wags nice and it's very friendly. And as we grow that, I think you're -- I think what you say is certainly appropriate. Okay. Well, we'll do whatever it takes to get product into our stores. You can join us, Alex. You can join us. Yes. Alex that was just our international ops. So if I didn't say the word 'international', it's just because I've misread it on the script. I said it. It's just international, it's the only business that I would say is under our initial budget for 2021. That's a good question. And I -- and it's by country, in a sense. So there is no simple answer that I would say to you. It's very much how COVID is impacting that country. As you know, Europe was much generally -- in France and Italy, much more stringent on how they open. And as you know, we -- our friends at Klepierre had to deal with almost a -- which, by the way, LA County almost did, but we'd have to enforce whether or not people had vaccine cards to let them in a mall, which thankfully a cooler heads prevailed but it really is a country-by-country.  We're seeing a little bit decent results in the European outlet business and Clay Pears (ph) feeling more confident about what they are seeing. But I would tell you, Asia is generally no, Japan is pretty tough but they have had a pretty strict, shutdown, Korea is doing just fine. I think generally, the U.S. is clearly outperforming. Other -- just from retail sales than other parts of the country -- other parts of the world, I should say. I'm hopeful '22 will be a better year for them, just like '21 was for us. So -- but there will be more proactive gentlemen, I say they, I mean, again, it's country-by-country, but in many spots we'll be more proactive with COVID if COVID spikes. restrictions I should say. No, it's a push. It's an economic push that was the whole design, and so forth, Alex. The intent was to be economically neutral. Can you repeat that, Michael? We don't break that down, but it was a combination of both. Thank you. Well, one, you got to remember here, looking at annual numbers here or even quarterly numbers, there were a variety of retailer businesses that we didn't own last year. So that's part of this noise when you looking at it year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter. That's a big piece of this. JCPenney didn't close until year end of last year, which is a big driver of this. So you got a different population, if you would. Whereas the EBITDA coming from the retail? This is the -- well, ABG more or less owns the brands. A lot of brands in the license income. The retailers run the e-commerce and operate stores, so it's essentially like any other retailer and the valuation of those should just be the way you look at any other public Company retailer. I will tell you today, from an EBITDA multiples, retailers reward value to the higher EBITDA multiple than Simon Property Group. Well, the licensing, I mean, it's -- that's a -- licensing business -- are you amortizing the cost of buying the license or not? So the brand -- if you don't -- they have a higher margin, but the gross margins of good retailers are in the 60 plus range. Not currently, a. They've got, I think -- we'll see how it impacts '22, but not rising costs from our standpoint in '21 -- shouldn't be all that material. Well, other than the drop in occupancy, I think in terms of operating, it's probably pretty similar to '19. No, I think that's it. Not really, a. I think the fixed CAM, and obviously it grows in many cases tied to CPI, is just an ease of doing business with the retailer and I don't see that changing. It's going to be higher, Vince. Well, now I -- we look at these things on an annual basis, but I'd hate to put a number in. But we're going to be really, based on where we were and what we guided to, we'll -- we should double it, more or less, right? I mean, I think, what do we guide to 4% or something like that? So we should be in that range. Thanks. Way to get it out of me Vince, way to go. Thank you Floris. So I would say -- look, our overage rent is going to be significant this year, but I do want to put -- I want to underline, we still do not have international tourism. So we think there's another -- and I don't believe now, the rules of who can come where and how and whatever, are very confusing. Having -- make my own two international trips, I get confused on what I have to do to go from one place to the next.  But next week there is a lifting of international tourism. We'll see whether it has any impact this year, as I doubt it, but even with overage rent having a very good year this year, we still think that there is another leg up if we get the international tourist that we haven't seen for a couple of 2-3 years, right?  And now, the strengthened dollar may offset that to some extent but we'll see. On your question about lease, this 1, I think some of the folks that wanted to tie their rent too -- and we did it in a select few cases, not a lot. But, yes, they may suddenly think maybe they should do another traditional, go back and do a basic deal.  But by and large, Floris, there's not a lot. I'd say the negotiations about the structure of the lease and overage rent. I call it overage, but overage rent and breakpoints -- it's all pretty -- it's all -- I'd say pretty consistent. So not a huge change in what's going on there. I think we're going to have a very good year in '22 on that side. Because again, there's just a better appreciation for our kind of product and demand is good there. And growing and traffic is still reaching previous levels. So I think they're going to have a very good year this year, but a better year in '22, at least from our initial kind of review of that business plan that we just had recently. Listen, I always worry they tell me what I want a hear, but what they're telling me, okay? And what I'm seeing in my own -- having to deal with a few retailer space demands, demand is good. So I think -- listen, the world is uncertain as all get out, right? I mean, we all know it's just an -- it's a very interesting time. The last several years and the future are no different. But Floris, the good news is, the demand for our product is good. And our folks are busy, and they're hitting the streets, and making deals. Again, we never give an occupancy number, but I would be very disappointed if we didn't have an uptick in occupancy next year. Thank you. Versus what you were doing or what we're doing? We'll see what we earn. We don't really look at it quarter by quarter. Well, overage rent does -- is impacted by holiday shopping. So there is some seasonality to it. We don't give out the specifics on what deals are percent versus fixed, though, the -- it's not a very big number.  I mean, overwhelmingly a high, high, high percentage of our leases are fixed and sometimes we have unnatural breakpoints which we can get into the mechanics of that later, if you'd like, where we do maybe -- and in COVID, this is -- we did a few -- a handful with some retailers where we may be lowered the fixed, but we got greater upside on sales. But 90 some odd percent of our leases are all fixed rent. And I think I answered your question, unless I missed something. Well, yeah, on rollover. Sure, over time. Again, it's a function of when leases expire. Sure. How are you? Good. I think we did -- how many financing did we do? Look, I think, we're -- I'd say where A assets, there's -- I mean, I have discussed this before and not to bore you, but there's not a lot of buyers, and sellers realized how valuable they are, and they want a really low cap rate. There's no A asset in this country, that would sell for anything above a five cap rate. My opinion -- in my humble opinion. I thought you were an equity analyst. Why do you care about lenders? Exactly. I mean, look, they're -- they look at debt yield. And sponsorship to our resource. Well, the ones that we own, we're not selling because Penney is performing terrifically well. Sure. You mean improvement or just when it goes too fixed essentially, right? Well, it's lease by lease to build that number up. I mean, demand is picking up, so we're focused on driving our cash flow. But again, as I -- maybe you missed my -- it wasn't overly compelling, but you missed my opening remarks. In that I would recommend again, I know -- I'd recommend you just look at the cash flow of the Company and not overly worry about a metric here or there. It just -- it all manifests itself in the cash.  In terms of when that will end up in base rent is really, as I said earlier, is just going to be functional when that particular resource, when it expires. And traditionally, when that does, we're usually pretty effective of trying to garner as much of that overage rent or that percentage rent above the break-point back into the base rent. I don't think so. And honestly the credit profile of the retail community is not bad. I mean, there's always going to be a few out there, but I would say generally the credit profile is pretty -- not going to look pretty good. So the retailers are always pruning the portfolio and so on. But I don't think the supply chain is going to cause -- it might unfortunately cause a local mom and pop some stress but I don't think it will cause it a regional or bigger chain, financial calamity. All right. Thank you and appreciate all the questions. We'll talk soon."

For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Good evening. I'm pleased to report our business is solid and improving, demand for space in our well-located properties is increasing. I will turn to some highlights. Our profitability and cash flow have significantly increased. Second-quarter funds from operations were $1.22 billion, or $3.24 per share. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter. Our international operations continue to be affected by governmental closure orders and capacity restrictions, which cost us roughly $0.06 per share for this quarter compared to our expectations due to the equivalent of two and a half month of closures.  As we said in the press release, our quarter results included a non-cash gain of $118 million or $0.32 per share from the reversal of a deferred tax liability at Klepierre. We generated over $1 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, which was $125 million more than the first quarter. And additionally, compared to the second quarter of last year, our cash flow from operations was break-even due to the lockdown. Domestic international property NOI combined, increased 16.6% year-over-year for the quarter and 2.8% for the first half of the year. Remember, the First Quarter of 2020 was relatively unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  These growth rates do not include any contribution from the Taubman portfolio or lease settlement income. Malls and outlets occupancy at the end of the Second Quarter was 91.8%, an increase of 100 basis points. compared to the first quarter. We continue to see demand for space across our portfolio from healthy local, regional, and national tenants, entrepreneurs, restaurateurs, and mixed-use demand, ever so increasing day-by-day. Our team is active in signing leases with new and exciting tenants.  The average base minimum rent was $50.03. Our average base rents was impacted by the initial lower base rents we agreed to in addressing certain tenant COVID negotiations in exchange for lower sales breakpoints, if variable rents that were recognized in the first half of the year were included, it would add approximately $5 per foot to our average base minimum rent. Leasing spreads declined again due to the mix of deals that are now included, as well as the activity that has fallen out of the spread, given its rolling 12-month nature and metric.  New leasing activity that has affected the spread include large footprint, entertainment, fitness, and large-scale retailers. These boxes -- big-box deals, reduced our opening rate as they are all included in our spread metric. As a reminder, the opening rate included in our spread calculation does not include any estimates for percentage rent-based income based on sales, as I mentioned just recently. Leasing activity accelerated in the quarter. We signed nearly 1400 leases for approximately 5.2 million square feet, and have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. Through the first 6 months, we signed 2500 leases for over 900 -- I'm sorry, 9.5 million square feet.  Our team executed leases for 3 million more square feet or over approximately 800 more deals compared to the first 6 months this year, as well as -- I'm sorry, compared to the first six months of 2019. We have completed nearly 90% of our expiring leases for 2021. We recently had a deal committee. And what I'm told by my leasing folks is that that was the most active deal committee that they've had in several years. Now, retail sales continue to increase. Total sales for the month of June were equal to 06/2019, and up 80% compared to last year. And were approximately 5% higher than May sales. If you exclude two well-known tenants, our mall sales were up 8% more than compared to 06/2019. Multiple regions in the U.S. recorded higher sales volume in June and for the second quarter compared to our 2019 levels.  We're active in redevelopment and new development. We opened West Midlands Designer Outlet, and we started construction in the Western Paris suburb for our third outlet in France. At the end of the quarter, new development - redevelopment was underway across all our platforms. For our share of $850 million, our retail investments posted exceptional results. All of our global brands within SPARC Group outperformed their budget in the quarter on sales, gross margin, and EBITDA, led by Forever 21 and Aeropostale, SPARC's newest brand, Eddie Bauer, also outperformed our initial expectations.  We're also very pleased with JCPenney results. They continue to outperform their plan. Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.4 billion, and they do not have any outstanding balance on their line of credit. Penney will launch several private national brands later this year, as well as their new beauty initiative. Taubman Realty Group is operating their 2021 budget at a level above debt and above our underwriting. And their portfolio -- our portfolio shows resilience as sales are quickly returning to pre-pandemic levels.  Year-to-date through June, retail sales are 13% higher than the first half of the 2019 balance sheet. As you would expect, we've been very active in the capital markets. We refinanced 13 mortgages in the first half of the year for a total of $2.2 billion in total, our share of which is $1.3 billion, at an average interest rate of 2.9%. Our liquidity is more than $8.8 billion, consisting of 6.9 billion available on our credit facility, and $1.9 billion of cash, including our share of JV cash, and again, our liquidity is net of $500 million of U.S. commercial paper that's outstanding at quarter-end. Dividend.  We paid $1.40 per share of dividend in cash on July 23rd for the second quarter. That was a 7.7% increase sequentially and year-over-year. Today, we announced our third-quarter dividend of $1.50 per share in cash, which is an increase of 7.1% sequentially, and 15.4% -- 15.4% year-over-year. The dividend is payable on September 30. You will know that going forward, we are returning to our historical cadence of declaring dividends as we announce our quarterly earnings. Now, guidance.  Given our results for the first half of the year, as well as our view for the remainder of 2021, we are increasing our full-year 2021 FFO guidance range from $9.70 to $9.80 per share to $10.70 to $10.80 per share. This is an increase of $1 per share at the midpoint, and the range represents approximately 17% to 19% growth compared to 2020 results. Before we open it up to Q&A, I wanted to provide some additional perspective. First, we expect to generate approximately $4 billion in FFO this year.  That will be approximately a 25% increase compared to last year and just 5% below our 2019 number. To be just 5% below 2019, given all that we have endured over the last 15, 16 months, including significant restrictive governmental orders that force us to shut down, unlike many other establishments, is a testament to our portfolio and a real testament to the Simon team and people. Second, we expect to distribute more than $2 billion in dividends this year.  Keep in mind, we did not suspend our dividend at any point during the pandemic and in fact, we have now increased our dividend twice already this year. Now, just a point on valuation, and I tend to never really talk about it, but I felt it was appropriate today. Our valuation continues to be well below our historical averages when it comes to FFO multiples compared to other retail reach - retailers and the S&P 500.  And our dividend yield is higher than the S&P 500 by more than 250 basis points, treasuries by 325 basis points, and the REIT industry by a 150-basis point. And as I mentioned to you, our dividend is growing. Our Company has a diverse product offering that possesses many, many multiple drivers of earnings growth, accretive capital investment opportunities, and a balance sheet to support our growth. We are increasing our performance, profitability, cash flow, and return to our shareholders. And we're ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good afternoon, David. I wanted to just start on the occupancy trend, which was up pretty nicely from 1Q to 2Q. And you talked about the leasing activity that you had in the quarter in the pipeline. Could you just maybe share with us what your expectations are for occupancy by the end of this year, and what's embedded in the guidance?\nDavid Simon: Well, the guidance is affected by the continuing uptrend. We expect our occupancy by year-end to increase from the levels that we have right now. I don't have a number that I am going to give to you specifically, but as I mentioned to you, Steve, talking to my heads of leasing, we are -- maybe this is an overstatement, we're tickled pink by the demand by the new retailers and tenants that are surfacing.  The many, many opportunities that we have with restaurants, with the mixed-use developments, and I mentioned to you, our deal committee had more deals than it's had in a few years. Look, we still have a hole to dig out of, because of the bankruptcies that we had to confront, with the pandemic. But I'm very pleased with the activity, the mojo that we have in leasing the work that our personnel are doing there. The creativity, it's pretty encouraging.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on the leasing commentary. I know that you guys had to make some accommodations to the retailers and you lowered the base rent and took more percentage rent. Given that sales seem to be coming back very quickly, do you sense that that dynamic is changing at all as you’re having these current discussions about future leasing? Or do you still anticipate having to have a kind of lower base and take more upside going forward?\nDavid Simon: Look, it's tenant by tenant. The strategy we adopted at the height of the pandemic is playing out better than we could have expected. We made the right move. We got the renewals done. We accommodated the vast majority of retailers, assuming they were reasonable in their approach. We got the job done.  We kept our properties functioning. We bet on the rebound, and we're seeing the benefits of that. And as I look back, I'm not certain I would change a lot. And the reality is, there is always going to be a few handful situations where we'll bet on to come, bet on retailers because we have confidence in our properties, we have the confidence in the retailers that we're doing business with.  And I think physical retail, when I listen to the pundits, and they're throwing the baby out with the bathwater, read my lips, physical retail is here to stay. And people really like to shop in the physical world. Don't believe everything you hear on TV. We've got the evidence.\nSteve Sakwa: That's it for me. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Please, go ahead.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Good afternoon, David. And hope -- I guess you guys have had a really good -- not, I guess. You guys have had a really good quarter, just amazing to see guidance up by a buck. But continuing on Steve's question there. Amazing on the dividend rebound, amazing on the guidance, on the leasing activity you guys talked about, and everything is good. But when you think about people pulling out the negative, and believe it or not, David, people do look at some things in the negative limelight, they will see negative 22% re-leasing spreads, and that negative spread is widening.  I understand that you did deals to get the Company through, makes sense. But from an expectation standpoint, what would you think the cadence is over the next few quarters of this spread, and how do we relate to that versus the cash flow growth and everything else that's going on? Because, clearly, there's a disconnect between your cash flow recovery and this negative spread metric?\nDavid Simon: Yeah. Look, I -- Alex, stats don't mean as much to me as they do to you because I look at cash flow growth. Because there's a lot that goes into cash flow growth, a lot more than spreads. Now, the sole reason that the spread is down to 22% is because of the mix and the COVID deals that we did. The mix is that we -- the spread probably was higher than -- because we had a lot of boxes that rolled out that were low rent, and so we got the benefit of that. And now as we -- and those were out of our 12-month numbers.  And now, the new leasing that we're doing is in it and that's the sole thing. So, I would encourage our investors that know what we're all about to understand that it's a mix. If I do a deal with Dick's or an entertainment box and they paid $15 a foot but the expiration of that box was 15 months ago with $3 a foot, I still may have made a $15 spread. But because it was in our rollout 15 months ago, you don't see it.  It's not space by space. If I get to space by space, the trend would not be -- the percentage would not be anywhere near that. So, do you understand what I just explained? Remember, we had a lot of boxes that were pre-COVID at low rents. But we didn't do box leasing for the last 12, 14 months because of the pandemic. So that's the sole reason. You follow what I'm saying. Right, Alex?\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yeah. I do. I wasn't about to volunteer Tom, rehash for a space-by-space. But I do understand what you're saying.\nDavid Simon: This is not space by space. But the reality is if I add boxes that were -- that space that I got back that was at low numbers but they were 15 months ago, those closings is gone. So that really jerks up the number. And then I have the new lease that's at a low number, that jerks it down. But if you really compare it over a longer period of time, we've got a positive spread. Follow me?\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yeah, it makes total sense. The next topic, David, obviously --\nDavid Simon: It should make more than sense, it's the math.\nAlexander Goldfarb: No, I can see the math as evidence in the earnings growth, the cash flow growth. You've explained it well so that when understanding this, that explanation that it's not based on space-by-space makes it crystal clear what's going on. The next question is on the rising of COVID Delta, and whatever other variance there are out there, obviously. Facts of life. But you're seeing tremendous leasing demand, restaurant demand, et cetera.  Your malls and outlets are throughout the country. Is it your view and what your managers -- mall managers are saying, and tenants are saying, is that most people just accept COVID is part of life and, therefore, it doesn't interfere with their shopping or their restaurants or their activity, or is there a concern that people may start to pull back from some of the increased activity that we've seen this year?\nDavid Simon: Well, it's a very good question. I'm only going to give you my personal opinion, which could be wrong. But it's an opinion, so I guess, technically, it shouldn't be wrong. But I would say this, I think the most important -- this is factual and I actually checked it. So, as you know, Delta, to our Delta hotspots, we actually have malls in some of these hotspots. So, the land of the Ozarks is in Springfield, Missouri. You only know that through the Netflix Show, right? The Ozarks. Because you haven't been there, but I've been there.  And it's a wonderful place. But I checked Have we seen it in our battlefield ball, which is in Springfield, Missouri? Have we seen an uptick in COVID cases at the mall? We get the report from all the retailers and our staff. And the reality is, we haven't. The mall is safe. Even though we're starting to see counties talk about indoors, there's no science about the mall. I underline that. We've been mistreated in this whole 18-month ordeal, but it is what it is.  I personally think, now going back to your question, And I've checked it. In Florida where there are some upticks. We have not seen in an enclosed mall an uptick in COVID cases for the people that are in the mall, the staff, whether it's a retail or a management team, period, end of the story. No question about that. So, I personally think that people are just going to deal with Delta. I'm hopeful that people will get vaccinated. We're not going to mandate vaccines; we're going to encourage them. And I think we've got to keep being safe as possible going on with our lives. And where we need to mask up, we're going to mask up. And I think the consumer and the folks have all just dealt with it and are moving forward in that environment right now. So, I'm hopeful that as a country we don't get into these lockdowns they have produced. We -- I studied Sweden, I studied France, COVID reverts to the mean. Sweden did not lockdown, France did. And if you look at the chart on COVID cases, it all reverts to the mean; lockdown, no lockdown. So let us do our business, mask up if you need to, the mall is safe, next question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nRich Hill: Good afternoon, David. I want to just focus on maybe just some of the numbers and specifically the income from unconsolidated entities. If I'm looking at the numbers right, you got a pretty healthy increase in that line item, which obviously includes Taubman along with the retailers. I think it went to around 348.5 million versus 15 million the last quarter despite depreciation amortization, looking like it's approximately flat year-over-year.  That suggests to me something pretty healthy is happening in those line items. I was hoping you can maybe just give us a little bit more transparency and what you're seeing there and what's driving that beyond what you said in the prepared remarks?\nDavid Simon: Well, we're always transparent. That'll be in our queue. But we have our Klepierre deferred tax gain running through that. We have our retail investments running through that, or the two major pieces of that increase. And then obviously, positive operations in all of our joint venture properties. And that's really at Taubman because we've had that lunge through that as well, but we also have increased depreciation and amortization associated with it. That's a not-overly material in that big increase. Fellas, what else do we want to say? That's it?\nTom Ward: That's it.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Fellas agree with my assessment.\nRich Hill: Thank you. I'm sure I'll follow up offline with Brian and Tom on that. I do want to come back to, my words not yours, soft guidance on core NOI. I think you've said in the past, it was maybe going to be 4 to 5, closer to 5, if I'm reading the transcript in last quarter correctly. You obviously just had a really big quarter. How do you feel about that now? And do you see the potential for upside from that 5%?\nDavid Simon: Yes, we should outperform that.\nRich Hill: Okay, that's my 2 questions. So, I will get back in the queue. Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bilerman: Great. Just 2 quick ones. One quick one and maybe one a little bit longer. The first one, just on the dollar increase, can you just break that down to just some major buckets? The buck increase to the guidance of about 380 million. I would assume part of its $0.32, the deferred tax liability that you booked this quarter, which leaves another $0.68 unaccounted for. Maybe if you can just bucket it into like maybe retailer investments, core, and others would be helpful.\nDavid Simon: You're right. You're right. $0.32 of that is because of the deferred tax and then $0.68 plus is from just core-plus retail. but I -- we're not going to break out that which is which. But the good news is, we've got our core beating our initial budget. And retail, the same -- we're in the same spot.\nMichael Bilerman: Yeah, because your original retailer investment was like $0.15 to $0.20. It would appear that you may have blown through that just in this quarter. So that's what I was just trying to get a little bit and they -- that one's a lot more volatile, right?\nDavid Simon: It's entirely a fair and legitimate question and so there are no qualms on that. It's just we don't really -- we're not breaking out the beat or the increase, I should say, other than the $0.32, which is right. And then the other 68, and I hope it will be plus than that, will be as retail and core.\nMichael Bilerman: Right. And is a [Indiscernible] supporting the line.\nDavid Simon: I mean, that's the retailer multiples, maybe retail is core. I don't -- what's a core? What's non-core?\nMichael Bilerman: That's a longer discussion. The second question, David, is, given your perspective now, as a, obviously, you've been a landlord forever, but you're increasingly now getting your hands dirty at being a retailer. I'm curious what you're seeing from the retailers that you own and sort of dealing with this environment and turning it around relative to what you are as a landlord, right? Because I think you said your tickled pink.  If you're seeing it as a retailer, that must be a different description that you would use. So maybe you can talk a little bit about what you're doing on the retailer side to bring people into the assets, what type of promotions are you trying to lure people to brick-and-mortar, and just the whole omnichannel world with the retailers you own. I'm just trying to understand that relative to your time as a landlord?\nDavid Simon: Well, you're right. That's a long -- if I did that question justice, it would be a long answer. Let me just say this, and this is really important, the retailers that we bought, if we didn't buy them, would be gone. So, I'm most proud -- forget about the numbers and what it's meant for us financially, but we're most proud because we basically kept companies alive that otherwise would be dead, buried, and liquidated.  And what we found out is, you know what, if we just focus on the business, focus on cash flow, focus on the consumer, we could stabilize this business, have patient money, patient -- not worried about comp from one quarter to the next. We could turn those around. And I'm most proud because, I should know, maybe Brian knows but, our SPARC operations employ thousands of people. And then when you add Penney, you've got well over 50,000, 60,000 people.  Don't underestimate what we've done. We're not -- these were companies that were, frankly, roadkill. and we save them. And for that, I'm very, very thankful. So that's one. And then, I think, Michael, generally and -- I can get into this in more detail, it's just too much to tell you now. I'd say 2 things. One is the store is credit. If you talk to the retailers that run these businesses, and in our case in particular, because most of these companies didn't have the capital to invest in the Internet and the omni-channel.  We're taking it at the store level, okay? So, these are really turned in to be good physical store operators. Now, Eddie Bauer is more sophisticated in E-commerce than some of the other ones that we got when we bought them. But the store is a really, really important component that gets in today's world. For what -- it is what it is, gets overlooked. And I'd say we've also had a great partner in ABG that adds a lot to the marketing and know-how about sourcing that was very important to what we have.  And then Brookfield has been a terrific partner as well and adds a lot of value. They're in some deals, they've been converted in others, but they've been like us. What do we do that's right for the business? How do we keep these companies alive and prosper level-headed discussions? They're all the rest of the stuff. Omnichannel, clearly, is very important to the future, but these companies are basically surviving and prospering because of their physical footprint, not because of e-commerce.\nMichael Bilerman: I would say if I have a vote, and I know you probably wouldn't give me a vote, but on the retailer versus core Simon earnings, I do think there's a difference. The market can ascribe what multiple they want. You're in a -- you have leases and contracts, retailers on the other end of just a different business model.\nDavid Simon: I -- traditionally, you're right in that, but if you look at where the retailer multiples are, compared to ours, you would argue the reverse.\nMichael Bilerman: That's why I said I don't want to -- the market is going to tell us where, but at least having all the details of the components, I think it's just a very helpful piece of information that the street can earn. And then we can get into an argument about how things should be valued, but not having the individual pieces in a clear and concise way. I don't think allows us to have that conversation. It becomes a little bit more adversarial.\nDavid Simon: We got it. We understand the issue. But at the end of the day, we'll see the level of materiality to it, and we'll see if it makes sense. We've got partners in there as well. But I don't think -- well, let's -- the market is the market. I have to respect it. We hear what you're saying.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. I appreciate the time, David.\nDavid Simon: Thank you, Michael.\nMichael Bilerman: Have a good one.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. I was just wondering maybe if we could talk a little bit about the conversations you're having with retailers. I think in the past, and even last quarter, it sounded like there were still retailers that were maybe giving you a hard time about rent payment or rent negotiations. Wondering if you can give an update on how those conversations with the retailers are going, and also whether that is impacting the lease termination fees.\nDavid Simon: I would say we're really down to a couple of folks, and it's really caving way, way down. Everybody has lived up to there, basically, COVID deal. I would say, right now, other than 1 or 2 folks, it's really business as usual and how do we do business better, how do we grow our business, how do we do things more strategically.  So, I think -- I am hopeful that that whole unfortunate -- it was tough for us. It was tough for them. We're all dealing with the unprecedented sequence of events. I think it's all behind us. Our collection rates are in the back to normal, and yes, we've got 2 or 3 folks that are still out there. But if we -- if they stay out there, it is what it is, and we can't -- we'll -- we're moving forward, so it's all pretty much behind us, assuming there's nothing that we had to deal with like we did last year.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a quick one on the other income, both the lease settlement income was up decently in the quarter and also the bucket for other income. So, I was just wondering if you could give some detail on these few line items.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. I remember lease settlement income was up a few million dollars, not much. Maybe a couple of cents. And we sold 1 residential property at a gain and we also had, which is -- we had a significant increase in our Simon Brand Venture business, which is that probably the bigger grower of that number.\nBrian McDade: Absolutely. Caitlin, it's Brian. If you -- we saw a pretty substantial increase in Simon Brand Ventures, our gift card business, and some of our mall food operations, which, obviously, in the second quarter of last year, were non-existent.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Good evening. What do you need to see in order to green-light additional transformational mixed-use projects, especially the Taubman assets which we think make a lot of sense? Clearly, Northgate never skipped a beat. And now, Phipps Plaza really looks like it's back on track.  Maybe I missed it earlier, David, but I recall the office component being temporarily shelled, but what do you need to see to ramp additional transformational-type projects, and is there a laddered development program in place or any material ongoing, in-process entitlement request you can share?\nDavid Simon: Sure. You're right about Phipps. We're basically all systems go there. We expect to finish everything by the end of '22, which would be the new Class A office, Nobu Hotel, Life Time athletics. So, it's all going back. You're right. We did shut it down during COVID. We commenced -- we restarted this, I don't know, two, three months ago.  We want to approve some of the stuff earlier, but we really are finishing the projects. So that's -- that'll be really -- I'm really excited about that. So hopefully we'll be able to show you that and be something really proud of. And I would say we're really -- we took a hiatus of 12 months, more or less.  Brian, right? 12, 14 months. So, we're back at it. I think I mentioned the last call, we're probably, in some cases, decreasing the amount of maybe new retail space. But we're back at it and it's more mixed-use than ever. The demand on the mixed-use front has been really, really nice to see.  And just to name a few that were in the permitting process would be Brea in Orange County, we've got Stoneridge in the Northern California area just to get the permitting process going -- restarted. Some of those things we have to start again because the plans different. But the idea to redevelop, a lot of them are the old department store boxes that we got back or that we ended up buying. We're going. The plans maybe a little less grandiose, so to speak, but it's very active on that front, across the board.  So, we look for more and more of our pipeline to increase as we go through the betting process. And I think with the Taubman portfolio, you're right. There's a lot to do there. They didn't -- they -- I keep saying they, but we don't have a lot of empty boxes there. That was -- so there's not like the plethora of opportunities that you might otherwise think. But there are some, and we're working -- we're working those as well and its great real estate, great location. And I think I mentioned the last call, I mean, I do think not that there's really a silver lining in any of this, but I do think our properties, both by the communities and maybe the general movement there, the suburbs are -- especially in markets that we're in, are going to be really appreciated. And I think we're going to be the center of activity.\nDerek Johnston: Okay, great. Thank you. And I guess just my follow-up will be a quick follow-up to this question. Is the 13-story Class-A office building, is Life Time coworker and anchor tenant there? Did you sign them? Or have you pre-leased any of this space that gave you the confidence to move ahead? Or are you just moving ahead because you feel better in general?\nDavid Simon: Let me be clear. Life Time is its own separate building. It's actually built on top of a world-class food hall that we're doing with C3. And inside Life Time athletic, they will have their own co-working. The office building is on its own. It's not -- there's no leasing the Life Time on that. It's 13 stories. We're building it spec, though we just signed our first 90,000 square foot lease. The short answer is, yes, we are going.\nDerek Johnston: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Schmidt: Thank you. Looking at the guidance for 2021, you'll have recovered half of the loss from your previous peak on FFO per share. I'm wondering if, as you work on creating the income to get you back to the second half, is that going to be harder than the first half or could that be easier?\nDavid Simon: Just a quarter-over-quarter?\nCraig Schmidt: I'm just --\nDavid Simon: Not really -- I didn't really -- I don't think anybody understood your -- your connection's not that good, Craig. So maybe, can you restate it, please?\nCraig Schmidt: Sorry, can you hear me now?\nDavid Simon: Yes.\nCraig Schmidt: Okay. Your guidance for 2021 already brings you halfway back to your peak FFO per share. Thinking about the second half, is that going to be harder to recover or easier.\nDavid Simon: If you go quarter-over-quarter, I would just say, and I'll let Brian and Adam weigh in. But we had the brunt of COVID abatements and relief of defaults in Q2 and Q3 if I remember correctly. The comparison to Q3 of '21 compared to '20 should be a pretty big gap for -- like Q4, we had dealt with most of the stuff. If that's your question, I'm not sure I really, maybe, comprehend it completely. But if that's your question, hopefully, that answers it.\nCraig Schmidt: Great. And then just -- do you foresee any changes in the REIT rules that might allow you to grow your retail or some of your other businesses beyond previous limitations?\nDavid Simon: Well, that's hard to know, Craig, I'm hopeful. There are limitations. You're right, 100% right. There are limitations. And I'm hopeful that the folks that do legislate this stuff will understand the benefit that we've provided to basically working families because we've saved these retailers. So yes, there are rules that make it complicated. They should be less. Remember, our retail investments are in a taxable REIT subsidiary. If you look at our P&L, you will see a big tax expense. Correct, gentlemen? That's associated with the fact that our TRS is taxable, and we're paying the corporate tax rate at its full level.  And then when you look at the -- hopefully, the benefit of what we've done for these companies that otherwise would not exist frankly, that the folks that write legislation will see that this is really an arcane rule that was around a long time ago. And there's a real benefit to try and keep retailers and others alive to try and create employment and all that good stuff that they do in the community. So, I am hopeful, but there's no certainty on that.\nCraig Schmidt: Understood. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Thank you, Craig.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum of Compass Point. Your line is open.\nFloris van Dijkum: Thanks for taking my question. David, I have a feeling of Deja vu, what we've seen this picture before following the great financial crisis. Obviously, things are different of course, but it seems like we're reliving those times a bit. Maybe if you can -- my question to you is -- it's regarding tenant sales. Again, the key lifeblood to your malls and the key to the, obviously, to the retailer profitability too. Very encouraged by your statement of retail sales in June equaling -- in your portfolio equaling 19 levels and up 5% from May. Maybe if you can give some more breakdown in that, particularly as it comes out of the first quarter, and also did I hear you correctly? Did you say that Taubman sales were 13% ahead of ' 19 levels?\nDavid Simon: Correct, yes.\nFloris van Dijkum: Does that --\nDavid Simon: I mean, it's a good number. Look, I do think we all deal a force in a very tough predict -- it's really hard to make any predictions. But I think what it should tell all of us is that, and I said a little bit earlier, physical shopping is -- people like to physically shop. We are, by no stretch of the imagination, hitting on all cylinders. We still have tourist centers that don't have tourists, other than domestic. We have parts of the region that were slower to open up, i.e., California, than others.  And I just think the most important point is that people like physical shopping, and, listen, you hear it all the time and I'm sure you get -- Your clients ask you, well nobody shops physically anymore and you try to defend it. Or you'd say, \"Yeah, but what about this? What about that?\" I think we're just -- we're showing that it matters to the consumer and to these communities. And hopefully, that will continue. And it is -- I will say this, maybe getting to your question, it is across the board. So, it's -- yes.  It's the luxury retailers, but it's also Aeropostale, which the AUM is -- I won't tell you, I'm not allowed. I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you, but the AUM is lower than what it might be for a luxury retailer. Okay? So, it's just Forever 21, which has a lower AUM. So, I think that's just encouraging. Hopefully, the trend will continue. But I think the consumer likes the idea that they can go to a physical shopping place.\nFloris van Dijkum: Great. And if I can follow up, I guess, I wanted to -- you talked about the fact that your lease spreads are not -- they're not space-for-space, like-for-like. I wonder if you had that. And also, what is the impact if you have -- if your average sales get to 19 levels, what's the impact on the effective rent that you would be getting relative to the reported rents that you've talked about?\nDavid Simon: Well, I think the easiest way to do that, I mean, that's a complicated number because you've got to go retailer by retailer. We did for the first six months. And our estimate of what our base rent would be based upon -- we got the benefit. There's $5 more base rent had we not lowered our breakpoints due to the COVID reliefs. So that gives you an indication of an interesting stat if that's maybe it's of interest to you. So, I don't --\nFloris van Dijkum: Have you --\nDavid Simon: So, I can't really give you a number off the top of my head. It would just be a guess and I really don't want to do that on what it might be. And then again on the spreads, it's not space by space. A lot of people, and I know the burdens on you and the analytic community, but I'd really encourage you; very few people do it the way we do it. Most people do it space-by-space. Some people also include their estimate of if they have a base rent of acts and they think they're going to be in percent rent.  They include that in their spreads. We just -- it's all in and all out, mix matters because of these boxes I explained to you and you know what? It will manifest itself in the cash flow. And the big cash flow growth story that we have going forward is sales growth and put sales growth and occupancy growth, and SPB growth, getting that back to normal. That's the big story. And then lease -- so the spreads -- the spreads -- yeah, I could do a bunch of boxes. The spreads can look not as good as you had looked historically, but the reality is, Mike, cash flow went up because that was vacant space and it's already out of the spread calculation. Focus on cash flow growth, is the bottom line.\nFloris van Dijkum: Thanks, David. Appreciate it.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMike Mueller: So Q2 looks like it was about 292 without the reversal. And if you look at the 1075 guidance, it implies about a 250-a - quarter average for the balance of the year. What was the level of the number of incomes that won't recur into the back -- no, sorry? What was the level of income in 2Q that won't recur going forward?\nDavid Simon: I'm not sure.\nTom Ward: Say that one more time, Michael. Can you go through that question again, please?\nMike Mueller: Yeah --\nDavid Simon: The only thing that's -- the only -- let me say it this way. The only thing that's not going to recur is the Klepierre deferred tax gain. Again, I can't tell you exactly what retail sales are going to be, retailer sales. I can't tell you what our retail investments are going to be.  There is -- but the only thing that's non-recurring, we will always have certain non-recurring things every year, lease settlement income, sale of an income-producing property. These things always ebb and flow. But the only thing that is not going to recur is the deferred tax. That's a one-time gain, clearly articulated in our press release of $0.32.\nMike Mueller: What about prior period collections, were there any in there that were significant?\nDavid Simon: No, they wouldn't come through the P&L either.\nTom Ward: We saw no recovery, Michael.\nDavid Simon: Yeah.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone of Green Street. Your line is open.\nVince Tibone: Hi. Good afternoon. It seems clear that variable rent is growing in the portfolio. I'm just -- could you help frame how much this is shifting? As for the leases you are negotiating today, what is the split between contractual rent and the expected variable rent component? And how is that different from before the pandemic?\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I think that the answer -- the simple way to say this is that if we have -- if we are willing to bet in some cases, on the prospect of our property and our retailer. And to the extent that they are cautious because of what they had to deal with as well, we're willing to accept the lower base rent in some cases, if we get an artificial upside in other cases. And it's not anywhere near the majority. It's only dealing with certain cases, certain lease rollovers. And again, those lease rollovers happen let's say on average, we have 12% a year that rolls over.  Now, last year, we had more, only because we dealt with bankruptcies, which in theory, when you're in bankruptcy, all of your lease’s rollovers because you have the right to reject leases. So, we did a little bit more last year with some of the brands that went through bankruptcy, because it was at the height of the pandemic, and they were cautious with their plan.  But we made artificially low breakpoints to make some of the income back-ups with the sales set. I would say going forward, we are pretty much back to the normal way to do it, which is trying to get the appropriate base rent and a natural break over that to generate percentage rent. And I will --\nVince Tibone: Got it.\nDavid Simon: -- I will say this. We are still really important. We're still not -- we used to have big, big overage rent numbers from our outlet portfolio because of the foreign tours, and we're still not seeing that. Obviously, tourism dropped during the last couple of years pre-pandemic, strong dollar relationships with countries, et cetera. I won't go through all that stuff. Then we had the pandemic and the restriction.  So, one of the unique things that I think and I hope, not knowing Delta or anything else, is how it's all going to play out. But at some point, in the not-too-distant future, we're going to see really good growth in our high-quality tourism centers, which should manifest itself in additional percentage rent. We have yet to see that for primarily our outlet, but also our Vegas properties as well. We're like a forum shop.\nVince Tibone: No. Thank you. That's a really helpful color. I mean, it sounds like the lease structure is more temporary versus the secular shift towards more available rent. So, I appreciate the color there. One more for me, maybe just shifting gears. I mean, you were fairly active in the mortgage market in recent months. Just was hoping you could provide some color on the recent trends there and just the ability for both you and other than the industry to get non-recourse financing on high-quality malls today.\nDavid Simon: I'd say it's significantly improved, but not easy. Not a day at the beach. Retail is still -- look, I think a quarter like this, a couple of other quarters, pandemic in the rearview mirror, I expect it to get back to normal, but it's still not. That market is still difficult. The unique thing about us is we have an unsecured market for us and we don't necessarily need the mortgage market. Sponsorship is really, really important. But it's dramatically improved, but it's not where it needs to be, where it should be, and where it has been.\nVince Tibone: Yeah, that makes sense. If you had to draw, maybe, a line with them for sale per square foot or quality in terms of being able to get debt, is there anything you already want to throw out there?\nDavid Simon: Look, I think we've done the pentagon cities of the world. We've done those in a really good solid mall in a not [Indiscernible] town. It's tougher and it shouldn't be because the stability of that cash flow is frankly pretty good under our management and ownership. So -- but often to -- like we did domain. We had old real estate parlance.  We over-financed it. The Pentagon City of the world is fine. But if you have that traditional mall and a smaller market, even though it's really good, really solid, really stable, still is more difficult than it should be, in my opinion.\nVince Tibone: Interesting. Well, thank you for the time.\nDavid Simon: Sure. Thanks, Vince.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of Truist. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you talk about the retailer investments, the 195 million of NOI? I would've thought, you would have gotten that type of level of income towards the fourth quarter. You've just given us the seasonality that that's inherent in retail. So, I'm just trying to think about that compared to your previous guidance of 260 million of EBITDA, and should we expect a similarly strong quarter in the fourth quarter, or is there something unique that happened this time around?\nDavid Simon: Well, again, remember, this is all -- you're right, you're 100% right, in that like traditional retailers, a lot of it is back-end weighted. We budget the same way. We way outperformed our first six months. It's hard to know exactly what it will be in the next 6 months. But we budget to ramp up too, Ki Bin, so we'll see whether we're on a budget, above budget, below budget. I mean it's -- but we budget that ramp up as well.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. So, there wasn't anything unique to this quarter that would appear like a one-time item or anything like that?\nDavid Simon: Other than dramatic outperformance. That was what's unique about it.\nTom Ward: Yeah. No one-time items [Indiscernible] perform.\nDavid Simon: Yeah.\nKi Bin Kim: All right. And what are your latest thoughts on acquisitions? It's a bit ask out there how that compares to your internal hurdles, just any color you can share on that.\nDavid Simon: Well, we really -- it's really -- there's no action. We've got -- I mean I don't know if I should say this publicly, but it's a little late now. I mean, there's -- we're really not looking at anything that I know of. There's really no action, so it's really hard for me to comment on it because there's just not much happening.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nLinda Tsai: Hi. With the pandemic driving more buy online and pickup in-store, how do you think retailers are considering their occupancy cost ratios? And is this a similar approach to the way the retailers you've invested in also approach occupancy cost ratios?\nDavid Simon: Well, that's like there's no standard answer other than to say we are, if they buy online and pickup in-store, that sale goes through our lease, that sale goes into our sales calculation. It's not like it's excluded, so that's going to be part of our occupancy cost discussion.\nLinda Tsai: Got it. And then any sense of how the comps have trended for your retailer investments the past couple of months as maybe it relates to 2019 levels?\nDavid Simon: How the retail -- how our retail investments did to '19?\nLinda Tsai: Yeah, like a same-store sale.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. I would say, generally, above '19, except for JCPenney because they really were not in bankruptcy in '19. We're still having bankruptcy. They went into bankruptcy in 2020, early 2020. They had a lot less unaffected year. We're still below ' 19 levels, but the rest of them are above ' 19 levels pretty, pretty handsomely.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Your line is open.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey. Good evening, out there.\nDavid Simon: We're out here.\nHaendel St. Juste: I wanted to come back to leasing for a second. Clearly, the industry has gone through some changes here in the last year. Few shorter-term deals are being done. Percentage rent deals are a bit more prevalent. I guess I'm curious, as you look at the U.S. mall business here over the next year or two, and more especially in the period from '23 to '25.  I'm thinking about how do you assess the likelihood that leases perhaps don't necessarily go back to being long-term with fixed-rate contractual rent bumps, or maybe they become more like in Asia where they are more percentage rent, and perhaps the leases are shorter in nature. And so, I guess I'm curious, as you seeing what you are seeing, the tone of the conversations, what your thoughts are on there, and maybe some color on the average change in lease term here being signed in the portfolio the last couple of months.\nDavid Simon: The term hasn't changed all that significantly. I would -- look, I would say that I don't think there is a big fundamental shift. When you tend to go short-term, it's because you can agree on what you think the fair market value is. And so, you do a short-term deal. And, again, there's some cautiousness from the retail community because of the pandemic. But, I think, assuming we get over this, I think it's -- we're going to see long-term deals.  We also use short-term deals to our advantage because one is, we may be testing on a new concept, one is, we don't like the rent that the retailer is offering, so let's keep that retailer in there while we go find a better long-term tenant. There's redevelopment, we want to move people around. There are all sorts of strategic reasons to do short-term leases. But I think that's -- the simple straightforward answer is I don't think that the fundamental nature of our business has changed in terms of long-term leases.  Listen, the retailers if they are investing in the store, the better retailers want long-term leases because they want the right, they want the store to look good, they want their personnel to be there. They don't want to go through different personnel. Personnel at the store levels, know when leases are short. And when leases are long, they're more committed to that Company. there is motivation in many, many cases, as we are to have long-term leases.  So, I really don't think other than because of the nature of the pandemic, that the short-term leases are de facto the new industry. I just don't see it. No retailers going to invest in a store without long-term leases. And all the better retailers. All with a good physical plan. All want to put in their omnichannel capabilities and they're not going to do that on the short-term lease.\nHaendel St. Juste: I got you and I appreciate those comments. I was just trying to understand that if you have any concern on your part by perhaps the lease exploration schedule that's building up here, over the next couple of years, with some of the shorter-term leases that have been signed over the last year or two, adding on top of the normal lease expiration schedule, especially in that 2023 to '25 period in which you'll be anniversary again. I think some tougher comps from leases signed 7-10 years ago.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. Look, I think, again, because of the quality of our portfolio, I'm not concerned about that. The reality is, we may be negotiating from a position of better position because our properties look great. Sales are great. People -- a lot of the physical retail has dissipated in the markets where the action is.  So, we've made those bets all the time, that we're going to bet on the future. And if we don't -- we can't make a long-term deal. We make it short because we're betting on the future and we've been right more than we've been wrong in those bets. But we're not always right. But that's the judgment that we have to make and we make it reasonably well in my opinion.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. And a follow-up, if I could, on these leasing spreads, understanding that that's been impacted by some of the leases you are doing with the lower-percentage rent thresholds, I guess I'm curious. When you provide --\nDavid Simon: It's a little bit of that, but it's primarily the mix as I'd say -- as I've stated. And again --\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay.\nDavid Simon: -- it's not straightforward spreads.\nHaendel St. Juste: Understood. I was just curious if you were able to provide a figure net of these newer leases that have been done here with the lower-percentage rent thresholds.\nDavid Simon: I mean, we could -- let me just say this, we could paint an unbelievably good picture there, but we just put all the stuff in, and the number is the number. So, if we went space-by-space, if we did it over a certain period of time, if we -- there are all sorts of ways you could create the number we would want you to focus on. But it's just a number to us. It's not what's driving our business. Okay?\nHaendel St. Juste: Alright. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg McGinnis of Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nGreg McGinnis: Hey, David. Hi, team. I think one of the key concerns for investors today is the potential longer-term drag from lower-quality assets, maybe at least not if they remain primarily retail. How are you thinking about investing, or maybe not investing, in the different quality bands within your portfolio to extract the most long-term value from those assets?\nDavid Simon: Really not much of an issue for us. It's a de minimis number and it's like any other Company. If you have a profitable business, maybe you don't invest in it if you don't think the growth is there and you meet the cash flow. But if investors are concerned about that, my initial reaction is we should do a better job of explaining the quality of our portfolio, and the depth and breadth of our business. So, we encourage you to have them call us.  We'd be more than happy to walk through the portfolio, answer any questions that they have on it. But I don't think after that, they would come away with that being a real concern. If that does happen, it's on the margin. $0.03, $0.05, something like that. So, anybody that's concerned about that, please call me, Brian, or Tom. Or you can set it up and we'll walk them through the asset base.\nGreg McGinnis: All right. Appreciate that. Could you possibly touch on maybe how the operating performance differs between the higher end and the lower end? We used to get those NOI weighted numbers, which were helpful, but just curious how that performance is going today.\nDavid Simon: I have them -- they're pretty -- I have them somewhere. Yeah, let's see. Basically, occupancy in the EBITDA weighted is 93 to 91.8. And average base minimum rent is higher, obviously, but the spreads about the same, and the total rents about the same. And sales are rolling 12, or pretty consistent on a percent basis. But the rolling 12, when you can't -- remember, rolling 12, we have 3 months of downtime, so it's irrelevant. But the most important number is occupancy and it's a little bit better.\nGreg McGinnis: Okay. Really what I'm trying to understand, and what others are trying to understand, is whether or not there's any need for a higher level of dispositions post-pandemic or maybe just as the retail market evolves, and how the portfolio is coming to address them all.\nDavid Simon: We've got -- we've always been selling. We just sold the residential thing at a -- like a below sub-4 cap rate. There are a couple of retail properties that we've earmarked for sale. Markets are not quite there. We'll see what happens. Thank you.\nGreg McGinnis: All right. thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Please, go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Just wanted to hit on the guidance question again because it seems like you guys have outperformed expectations on the retail side on your investments, but the guidance implies that de-sell kind of x the one time from Klepierre. Should we just think that that is just conservatism built-in for the second half, given the volatility on the retail side? Or is there another reason for the sequential implied decline in the back half from a clean second-quarter run rate number?\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I think all I can tell you is that we have beaten our first quarter, our second quarter. We hope to beat third and we hope to beat the fourth, but we're in the midst of the third and we're in the midst of the fourth, and we'll see how it -- how it shakes out. But we feel, as I mentioned to you earlier, we feel pretty good as to where we're positioned.\nJuan Sanabria: Just to a follow-up is just in terms of mall operating hours. Are those back to pre-pandemic levels and if not --\nDavid Simon: Yeah. It is -- yeah. That's a good question. They're inching back toward it, more or less. We may be an hour short on -- excuse me. We may be an hour short on Monday through Wednesday, but basically Thursday, Friday, Saturday we're pretty much back to normal.\nJuan Sanabria: Is that just a lack of availability of labor issue or is it something else at this point?\nDavid Simon: No, it's pretty back to normal. I think that, in some cases, the retailers like it. It's something we're always monitoring and it's -- there is -- it's a very interesting subject because some retailers love it somewhat, more hours to go back. It gives me a headache when I think about all the different opinions. But it's pretty much back to normal, maybe an hour short in the early part of the week.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: But it's something -- the important point is something we monitor and manage daily, weekly, in significant consultation with our retailers. And it is -- and it has increased materially since the early days of reopening.\nJuan Sanabria: Understood. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time --\nDavid Simon: No, go ahead, Operator.\nOperator: Yeah, at this time, I would like to turn the call over to David Simon for closing remarks, sir?\nDavid Simon: All right. Thank you. Have a great rest of your summer and we'll talk soon Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "Good evening. I'm pleased to report our business is solid and improving, demand for space in our well-located properties is increasing. I will turn to some highlights. Our profitability and cash flow have significantly increased. Second-quarter funds from operations were $1.22 billion, or $3.24 per share. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter. Our international operations continue to be affected by governmental closure orders and capacity restrictions, which cost us roughly $0.06 per share for this quarter compared to our expectations due to the equivalent of two and a half month of closures.  As we said in the press release, our quarter results included a non-cash gain of $118 million or $0.32 per share from the reversal of a deferred tax liability at Klepierre. We generated over $1 billion in cash from operations in the quarter, which was $125 million more than the first quarter. And additionally, compared to the second quarter of last year, our cash flow from operations was break-even due to the lockdown. Domestic international property NOI combined, increased 16.6% year-over-year for the quarter and 2.8% for the first half of the year. Remember, the First Quarter of 2020 was relatively unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  These growth rates do not include any contribution from the Taubman portfolio or lease settlement income. Malls and outlets occupancy at the end of the Second Quarter was 91.8%, an increase of 100 basis points. compared to the first quarter. We continue to see demand for space across our portfolio from healthy local, regional, and national tenants, entrepreneurs, restaurateurs, and mixed-use demand, ever so increasing day-by-day. Our team is active in signing leases with new and exciting tenants.  The average base minimum rent was $50.03. Our average base rents was impacted by the initial lower base rents we agreed to in addressing certain tenant COVID negotiations in exchange for lower sales breakpoints, if variable rents that were recognized in the first half of the year were included, it would add approximately $5 per foot to our average base minimum rent. Leasing spreads declined again due to the mix of deals that are now included, as well as the activity that has fallen out of the spread, given its rolling 12-month nature and metric.  New leasing activity that has affected the spread include large footprint, entertainment, fitness, and large-scale retailers. These boxes -- big-box deals, reduced our opening rate as they are all included in our spread metric. As a reminder, the opening rate included in our spread calculation does not include any estimates for percentage rent-based income based on sales, as I mentioned just recently. Leasing activity accelerated in the quarter. We signed nearly 1400 leases for approximately 5.2 million square feet, and have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. Through the first 6 months, we signed 2500 leases for over 900 -- I'm sorry, 9.5 million square feet.  Our team executed leases for 3 million more square feet or over approximately 800 more deals compared to the first 6 months this year, as well as -- I'm sorry, compared to the first six months of 2019. We have completed nearly 90% of our expiring leases for 2021. We recently had a deal committee. And what I'm told by my leasing folks is that that was the most active deal committee that they've had in several years. Now, retail sales continue to increase. Total sales for the month of June were equal to 06/2019, and up 80% compared to last year. And were approximately 5% higher than May sales. If you exclude two well-known tenants, our mall sales were up 8% more than compared to 06/2019. Multiple regions in the U.S. recorded higher sales volume in June and for the second quarter compared to our 2019 levels.  We're active in redevelopment and new development. We opened West Midlands Designer Outlet, and we started construction in the Western Paris suburb for our third outlet in France. At the end of the quarter, new development - redevelopment was underway across all our platforms. For our share of $850 million, our retail investments posted exceptional results. All of our global brands within SPARC Group outperformed their budget in the quarter on sales, gross margin, and EBITDA, led by Forever 21 and Aeropostale, SPARC's newest brand, Eddie Bauer, also outperformed our initial expectations.  We're also very pleased with JCPenney results. They continue to outperform their plan. Their liquidity position is growing, now $1.4 billion, and they do not have any outstanding balance on their line of credit. Penney will launch several private national brands later this year, as well as their new beauty initiative. Taubman Realty Group is operating their 2021 budget at a level above debt and above our underwriting. And their portfolio -- our portfolio shows resilience as sales are quickly returning to pre-pandemic levels.  Year-to-date through June, retail sales are 13% higher than the first half of the 2019 balance sheet. As you would expect, we've been very active in the capital markets. We refinanced 13 mortgages in the first half of the year for a total of $2.2 billion in total, our share of which is $1.3 billion, at an average interest rate of 2.9%. Our liquidity is more than $8.8 billion, consisting of 6.9 billion available on our credit facility, and $1.9 billion of cash, including our share of JV cash, and again, our liquidity is net of $500 million of U.S. commercial paper that's outstanding at quarter-end. Dividend.  We paid $1.40 per share of dividend in cash on July 23rd for the second quarter. That was a 7.7% increase sequentially and year-over-year. Today, we announced our third-quarter dividend of $1.50 per share in cash, which is an increase of 7.1% sequentially, and 15.4% -- 15.4% year-over-year. The dividend is payable on September 30. You will know that going forward, we are returning to our historical cadence of declaring dividends as we announce our quarterly earnings. Now, guidance.  Given our results for the first half of the year, as well as our view for the remainder of 2021, we are increasing our full-year 2021 FFO guidance range from $9.70 to $9.80 per share to $10.70 to $10.80 per share. This is an increase of $1 per share at the midpoint, and the range represents approximately 17% to 19% growth compared to 2020 results. Before we open it up to Q&A, I wanted to provide some additional perspective. First, we expect to generate approximately $4 billion in FFO this year.  That will be approximately a 25% increase compared to last year and just 5% below our 2019 number. To be just 5% below 2019, given all that we have endured over the last 15, 16 months, including significant restrictive governmental orders that force us to shut down, unlike many other establishments, is a testament to our portfolio and a real testament to the Simon team and people. Second, we expect to distribute more than $2 billion in dividends this year.  Keep in mind, we did not suspend our dividend at any point during the pandemic and in fact, we have now increased our dividend twice already this year. Now, just a point on valuation, and I tend to never really talk about it, but I felt it was appropriate today. Our valuation continues to be well below our historical averages when it comes to FFO multiples compared to other retail reach - retailers and the S&P 500.  And our dividend yield is higher than the S&P 500 by more than 250 basis points, treasuries by 325 basis points, and the REIT industry by a 150-basis point. And as I mentioned to you, our dividend is growing. Our Company has a diverse product offering that possesses many, many multiple drivers of earnings growth, accretive capital investment opportunities, and a balance sheet to support our growth. We are increasing our performance, profitability, cash flow, and return to our shareholders. And we're ready for questions. Well, the guidance is affected by the continuing uptrend. We expect our occupancy by year-end to increase from the levels that we have right now. I don't have a number that I am going to give to you specifically, but as I mentioned to you, Steve, talking to my heads of leasing, we are -- maybe this is an overstatement, we're tickled pink by the demand by the new retailers and tenants that are surfacing.  The many, many opportunities that we have with restaurants, with the mixed-use developments, and I mentioned to you, our deal committee had more deals than it's had in a few years. Look, we still have a hole to dig out of, because of the bankruptcies that we had to confront, with the pandemic. But I'm very pleased with the activity, the mojo that we have in leasing the work that our personnel are doing there. The creativity, it's pretty encouraging. Look, it's tenant by tenant. The strategy we adopted at the height of the pandemic is playing out better than we could have expected. We made the right move. We got the renewals done. We accommodated the vast majority of retailers, assuming they were reasonable in their approach. We got the job done.  We kept our properties functioning. We bet on the rebound, and we're seeing the benefits of that. And as I look back, I'm not certain I would change a lot. And the reality is, there is always going to be a few handful situations where we'll bet on to come, bet on retailers because we have confidence in our properties, we have the confidence in the retailers that we're doing business with.  And I think physical retail, when I listen to the pundits, and they're throwing the baby out with the bathwater, read my lips, physical retail is here to stay. And people really like to shop in the physical world. Don't believe everything you hear on TV. We've got the evidence. Thank you. Yeah. Look, I -- Alex, stats don't mean as much to me as they do to you because I look at cash flow growth. Because there's a lot that goes into cash flow growth, a lot more than spreads. Now, the sole reason that the spread is down to 22% is because of the mix and the COVID deals that we did. The mix is that we -- the spread probably was higher than -- because we had a lot of boxes that rolled out that were low rent, and so we got the benefit of that. And now as we -- and those were out of our 12-month numbers.  And now, the new leasing that we're doing is in it and that's the sole thing. So, I would encourage our investors that know what we're all about to understand that it's a mix. If I do a deal with Dick's or an entertainment box and they paid $15 a foot but the expiration of that box was 15 months ago with $3 a foot, I still may have made a $15 spread. But because it was in our rollout 15 months ago, you don't see it.  It's not space by space. If I get to space by space, the trend would not be -- the percentage would not be anywhere near that. So, do you understand what I just explained? Remember, we had a lot of boxes that were pre-COVID at low rents. But we didn't do box leasing for the last 12, 14 months because of the pandemic. So that's the sole reason. You follow what I'm saying. Right, Alex? This is not space by space. But the reality is if I add boxes that were -- that space that I got back that was at low numbers but they were 15 months ago, those closings is gone. So that really jerks up the number. And then I have the new lease that's at a low number, that jerks it down. But if you really compare it over a longer period of time, we've got a positive spread. Follow me? It should make more than sense, it's the math. Well, it's a very good question. I'm only going to give you my personal opinion, which could be wrong. But it's an opinion, so I guess, technically, it shouldn't be wrong. But I would say this, I think the most important -- this is factual and I actually checked it. So, as you know, Delta, to our Delta hotspots, we actually have malls in some of these hotspots. So, the land of the Ozarks is in Springfield, Missouri. You only know that through the Netflix Show, right? The Ozarks. Because you haven't been there, but I've been there.  And it's a wonderful place. But I checked Have we seen it in our battlefield ball, which is in Springfield, Missouri? Have we seen an uptick in COVID cases at the mall? We get the report from all the retailers and our staff. And the reality is, we haven't. The mall is safe. Even though we're starting to see counties talk about indoors, there's no science about the mall. I underline that. We've been mistreated in this whole 18-month ordeal, but it is what it is.  I personally think, now going back to your question, And I've checked it. In Florida where there are some upticks. We have not seen in an enclosed mall an uptick in COVID cases for the people that are in the mall, the staff, whether it's a retail or a management team, period, end of the story. No question about that. So, I personally think that people are just going to deal with Delta. I'm hopeful that people will get vaccinated. We're not going to mandate vaccines; we're going to encourage them. And I think we've got to keep being safe as possible going on with our lives. And where we need to mask up, we're going to mask up. And I think the consumer and the folks have all just dealt with it and are moving forward in that environment right now. So, I'm hopeful that as a country we don't get into these lockdowns they have produced. We -- I studied Sweden, I studied France, COVID reverts to the mean. Sweden did not lockdown, France did. And if you look at the chart on COVID cases, it all reverts to the mean; lockdown, no lockdown. So let us do our business, mask up if you need to, the mall is safe, next question. Well, we're always transparent. That'll be in our queue. But we have our Klepierre deferred tax gain running through that. We have our retail investments running through that, or the two major pieces of that increase. And then obviously, positive operations in all of our joint venture properties. And that's really at Taubman because we've had that lunge through that as well, but we also have increased depreciation and amortization associated with it. That's a not-overly material in that big increase. Fellas, what else do we want to say? That's it? Okay. Fellas agree with my assessment. Yes, we should outperform that. Thank you. You're right. You're right. $0.32 of that is because of the deferred tax and then $0.68 plus is from just core-plus retail. but I -- we're not going to break out that which is which. But the good news is, we've got our core beating our initial budget. And retail, the same -- we're in the same spot. It's entirely a fair and legitimate question and so there are no qualms on that. It's just we don't really -- we're not breaking out the beat or the increase, I should say, other than the $0.32, which is right. And then the other 68, and I hope it will be plus than that, will be as retail and core. I mean, that's the retailer multiples, maybe retail is core. I don't -- what's a core? What's non-core? Well, you're right. That's a long -- if I did that question justice, it would be a long answer. Let me just say this, and this is really important, the retailers that we bought, if we didn't buy them, would be gone. So, I'm most proud -- forget about the numbers and what it's meant for us financially, but we're most proud because we basically kept companies alive that otherwise would be dead, buried, and liquidated.  And what we found out is, you know what, if we just focus on the business, focus on cash flow, focus on the consumer, we could stabilize this business, have patient money, patient -- not worried about comp from one quarter to the next. We could turn those around. And I'm most proud because, I should know, maybe Brian knows but, our SPARC operations employ thousands of people. And then when you add Penney, you've got well over 50,000, 60,000 people.  Don't underestimate what we've done. We're not -- these were companies that were, frankly, roadkill. and we save them. And for that, I'm very, very thankful. So that's one. And then, I think, Michael, generally and -- I can get into this in more detail, it's just too much to tell you now. I'd say 2 things. One is the store is credit. If you talk to the retailers that run these businesses, and in our case in particular, because most of these companies didn't have the capital to invest in the Internet and the omni-channel.  We're taking it at the store level, okay? So, these are really turned in to be good physical store operators. Now, Eddie Bauer is more sophisticated in E-commerce than some of the other ones that we got when we bought them. But the store is a really, really important component that gets in today's world. For what -- it is what it is, gets overlooked. And I'd say we've also had a great partner in ABG that adds a lot to the marketing and know-how about sourcing that was very important to what we have.  And then Brookfield has been a terrific partner as well and adds a lot of value. They're in some deals, they've been converted in others, but they've been like us. What do we do that's right for the business? How do we keep these companies alive and prosper level-headed discussions? They're all the rest of the stuff. Omnichannel, clearly, is very important to the future, but these companies are basically surviving and prospering because of their physical footprint, not because of e-commerce. I -- traditionally, you're right in that, but if you look at where the retailer multiples are, compared to ours, you would argue the reverse. We got it. We understand the issue. But at the end of the day, we'll see the level of materiality to it, and we'll see if it makes sense. We've got partners in there as well. But I don't think -- well, let's -- the market is the market. I have to respect it. We hear what you're saying. Thank you, Michael. I would say we're really down to a couple of folks, and it's really caving way, way down. Everybody has lived up to there, basically, COVID deal. I would say, right now, other than 1 or 2 folks, it's really business as usual and how do we do business better, how do we grow our business, how do we do things more strategically.  So, I think -- I am hopeful that that whole unfortunate -- it was tough for us. It was tough for them. We're all dealing with the unprecedented sequence of events. I think it's all behind us. Our collection rates are in the back to normal, and yes, we've got 2 or 3 folks that are still out there. But if we -- if they stay out there, it is what it is, and we can't -- we'll -- we're moving forward, so it's all pretty much behind us, assuming there's nothing that we had to deal with like we did last year. Yeah. I remember lease settlement income was up a few million dollars, not much. Maybe a couple of cents. And we sold 1 residential property at a gain and we also had, which is -- we had a significant increase in our Simon Brand Venture business, which is that probably the bigger grower of that number. Sure. You're right about Phipps. We're basically all systems go there. We expect to finish everything by the end of '22, which would be the new Class A office, Nobu Hotel, Life Time athletics. So, it's all going back. You're right. We did shut it down during COVID. We commenced -- we restarted this, I don't know, two, three months ago.  We want to approve some of the stuff earlier, but we really are finishing the projects. So that's -- that'll be really -- I'm really excited about that. So hopefully we'll be able to show you that and be something really proud of. And I would say we're really -- we took a hiatus of 12 months, more or less.  Brian, right? 12, 14 months. So, we're back at it. I think I mentioned the last call, we're probably, in some cases, decreasing the amount of maybe new retail space. But we're back at it and it's more mixed-use than ever. The demand on the mixed-use front has been really, really nice to see.  And just to name a few that were in the permitting process would be Brea in Orange County, we've got Stoneridge in the Northern California area just to get the permitting process going -- restarted. Some of those things we have to start again because the plans different. But the idea to redevelop, a lot of them are the old department store boxes that we got back or that we ended up buying. We're going. The plans maybe a little less grandiose, so to speak, but it's very active on that front, across the board.  So, we look for more and more of our pipeline to increase as we go through the betting process. And I think with the Taubman portfolio, you're right. There's a lot to do there. They didn't -- they -- I keep saying they, but we don't have a lot of empty boxes there. That was -- so there's not like the plethora of opportunities that you might otherwise think. But there are some, and we're working -- we're working those as well and its great real estate, great location. And I think I mentioned the last call, I mean, I do think not that there's really a silver lining in any of this, but I do think our properties, both by the communities and maybe the general movement there, the suburbs are -- especially in markets that we're in, are going to be really appreciated. And I think we're going to be the center of activity. Let me be clear. Life Time is its own separate building. It's actually built on top of a world-class food hall that we're doing with C3. And inside Life Time athletic, they will have their own co-working. The office building is on its own. It's not -- there's no leasing the Life Time on that. It's 13 stories. We're building it spec, though we just signed our first 90,000 square foot lease. The short answer is, yes, we are going. Sure. Just a quarter-over-quarter? Not really -- I didn't really -- I don't think anybody understood your -- your connection's not that good, Craig. So maybe, can you restate it, please? Yes. If you go quarter-over-quarter, I would just say, and I'll let Brian and Adam weigh in. But we had the brunt of COVID abatements and relief of defaults in Q2 and Q3 if I remember correctly. The comparison to Q3 of '21 compared to '20 should be a pretty big gap for -- like Q4, we had dealt with most of the stuff. If that's your question, I'm not sure I really, maybe, comprehend it completely. But if that's your question, hopefully, that answers it. Well, that's hard to know, Craig, I'm hopeful. There are limitations. You're right, 100% right. There are limitations. And I'm hopeful that the folks that do legislate this stuff will understand the benefit that we've provided to basically working families because we've saved these retailers. So yes, there are rules that make it complicated. They should be less. Remember, our retail investments are in a taxable REIT subsidiary. If you look at our P&L, you will see a big tax expense. Correct, gentlemen? That's associated with the fact that our TRS is taxable, and we're paying the corporate tax rate at its full level.  And then when you look at the -- hopefully, the benefit of what we've done for these companies that otherwise would not exist frankly, that the folks that write legislation will see that this is really an arcane rule that was around a long time ago. And there's a real benefit to try and keep retailers and others alive to try and create employment and all that good stuff that they do in the community. So, I am hopeful, but there's no certainty on that. Thank you, Craig. Correct, yes. I mean, it's a good number. Look, I do think we all deal a force in a very tough predict -- it's really hard to make any predictions. But I think what it should tell all of us is that, and I said a little bit earlier, physical shopping is -- people like to physically shop. We are, by no stretch of the imagination, hitting on all cylinders. We still have tourist centers that don't have tourists, other than domestic. We have parts of the region that were slower to open up, i.e., California, than others.  And I just think the most important point is that people like physical shopping, and, listen, you hear it all the time and I'm sure you get -- Your clients ask you, well nobody shops physically anymore and you try to defend it. Or you'd say, \"Yeah, but what about this? What about that?\" I think we're just -- we're showing that it matters to the consumer and to these communities. And hopefully, that will continue. And it is -- I will say this, maybe getting to your question, it is across the board. So, it's -- yes.  It's the luxury retailers, but it's also Aeropostale, which the AUM is -- I won't tell you, I'm not allowed. I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you, but the AUM is lower than what it might be for a luxury retailer. Okay? So, it's just Forever 21, which has a lower AUM. So, I think that's just encouraging. Hopefully, the trend will continue. But I think the consumer likes the idea that they can go to a physical shopping place. Well, I think the easiest way to do that, I mean, that's a complicated number because you've got to go retailer by retailer. We did for the first six months. And our estimate of what our base rent would be based upon -- we got the benefit. There's $5 more base rent had we not lowered our breakpoints due to the COVID reliefs. So that gives you an indication of an interesting stat if that's maybe it's of interest to you. So, I don't -- So, I can't really give you a number off the top of my head. It would just be a guess and I really don't want to do that on what it might be. And then again on the spreads, it's not space by space. A lot of people, and I know the burdens on you and the analytic community, but I'd really encourage you; very few people do it the way we do it. Most people do it space-by-space. Some people also include their estimate of if they have a base rent of acts and they think they're going to be in percent rent.  They include that in their spreads. We just -- it's all in and all out, mix matters because of these boxes I explained to you and you know what? It will manifest itself in the cash flow. And the big cash flow growth story that we have going forward is sales growth and put sales growth and occupancy growth, and SPB growth, getting that back to normal. That's the big story. And then lease -- so the spreads -- the spreads -- yeah, I could do a bunch of boxes. The spreads can look not as good as you had looked historically, but the reality is, Mike, cash flow went up because that was vacant space and it's already out of the spread calculation. Focus on cash flow growth, is the bottom line. Sure. I'm not sure. The only thing that's -- the only -- let me say it this way. The only thing that's not going to recur is the Klepierre deferred tax gain. Again, I can't tell you exactly what retail sales are going to be, retailer sales. I can't tell you what our retail investments are going to be.  There is -- but the only thing that's non-recurring, we will always have certain non-recurring things every year, lease settlement income, sale of an income-producing property. These things always ebb and flow. But the only thing that is not going to recur is the deferred tax. That's a one-time gain, clearly articulated in our press release of $0.32. No, they wouldn't come through the P&L either. Yeah. Thanks. Well, look, I think that the answer -- the simple way to say this is that if we have -- if we are willing to bet in some cases, on the prospect of our property and our retailer. And to the extent that they are cautious because of what they had to deal with as well, we're willing to accept the lower base rent in some cases, if we get an artificial upside in other cases. And it's not anywhere near the majority. It's only dealing with certain cases, certain lease rollovers. And again, those lease rollovers happen let's say on average, we have 12% a year that rolls over.  Now, last year, we had more, only because we dealt with bankruptcies, which in theory, when you're in bankruptcy, all of your lease's rollovers because you have the right to reject leases. So, we did a little bit more last year with some of the brands that went through bankruptcy, because it was at the height of the pandemic, and they were cautious with their plan.  But we made artificially low breakpoints to make some of the income back-ups with the sales set. I would say going forward, we are pretty much back to the normal way to do it, which is trying to get the appropriate base rent and a natural break over that to generate percentage rent. And I will -- -- I will say this. We are still really important. We're still not -- we used to have big, big overage rent numbers from our outlet portfolio because of the foreign tours, and we're still not seeing that. Obviously, tourism dropped during the last couple of years pre-pandemic, strong dollar relationships with countries, et cetera. I won't go through all that stuff. Then we had the pandemic and the restriction.  So, one of the unique things that I think and I hope, not knowing Delta or anything else, is how it's all going to play out. But at some point, in the not-too-distant future, we're going to see really good growth in our high-quality tourism centers, which should manifest itself in additional percentage rent. We have yet to see that for primarily our outlet, but also our Vegas properties as well. We're like a forum shop. I'd say it's significantly improved, but not easy. Not a day at the beach. Retail is still -- look, I think a quarter like this, a couple of other quarters, pandemic in the rearview mirror, I expect it to get back to normal, but it's still not. That market is still difficult. The unique thing about us is we have an unsecured market for us and we don't necessarily need the mortgage market. Sponsorship is really, really important. But it's dramatically improved, but it's not where it needs to be, where it should be, and where it has been. Look, I think we've done the pentagon cities of the world. We've done those in a really good solid mall in a not [Indiscernible] town. It's tougher and it shouldn't be because the stability of that cash flow is frankly pretty good under our management and ownership. So -- but often to -- like we did domain. We had old real estate parlance.  We over-financed it. The Pentagon City of the world is fine. But if you have that traditional mall and a smaller market, even though it's really good, really solid, really stable, still is more difficult than it should be, in my opinion. Sure. Thanks, Vince. Well, again, remember, this is all -- you're right, you're 100% right, in that like traditional retailers, a lot of it is back-end weighted. We budget the same way. We way outperformed our first six months. It's hard to know exactly what it will be in the next 6 months. But we budget to ramp up too, Ki Bin, so we'll see whether we're on a budget, above budget, below budget. I mean it's -- but we budget that ramp up as well. Other than dramatic outperformance. That was what's unique about it. Yeah. Well, we really -- it's really -- there's no action. We've got -- I mean I don't know if I should say this publicly, but it's a little late now. I mean, there's -- we're really not looking at anything that I know of. There's really no action, so it's really hard for me to comment on it because there's just not much happening. Sure. Well, that's like there's no standard answer other than to say we are, if they buy online and pickup in-store, that sale goes through our lease, that sale goes into our sales calculation. It's not like it's excluded, so that's going to be part of our occupancy cost discussion. How the retail -- how our retail investments did to '19? Yeah. I would say, generally, above '19, except for JCPenney because they really were not in bankruptcy in '19. We're still having bankruptcy. They went into bankruptcy in 2020, early 2020. They had a lot less unaffected year. We're still below ' 19 levels, but the rest of them are above ' 19 levels pretty, pretty handsomely. Sure. We're out here. The term hasn't changed all that significantly. I would -- look, I would say that I don't think there is a big fundamental shift. When you tend to go short-term, it's because you can agree on what you think the fair market value is. And so, you do a short-term deal. And, again, there's some cautiousness from the retail community because of the pandemic. But, I think, assuming we get over this, I think it's -- we're going to see long-term deals.  We also use short-term deals to our advantage because one is, we may be testing on a new concept, one is, we don't like the rent that the retailer is offering, so let's keep that retailer in there while we go find a better long-term tenant. There's redevelopment, we want to move people around. There are all sorts of strategic reasons to do short-term leases. But I think that's -- the simple straightforward answer is I don't think that the fundamental nature of our business has changed in terms of long-term leases.  Listen, the retailers if they are investing in the store, the better retailers want long-term leases because they want the right, they want the store to look good, they want their personnel to be there. They don't want to go through different personnel. Personnel at the store levels, know when leases are short. And when leases are long, they're more committed to that Company. there is motivation in many, many cases, as we are to have long-term leases.  So, I really don't think other than because of the nature of the pandemic, that the short-term leases are de facto the new industry. I just don't see it. No retailers going to invest in a store without long-term leases. And all the better retailers. All with a good physical plan. All want to put in their omnichannel capabilities and they're not going to do that on the short-term lease. Yeah. Look, I think, again, because of the quality of our portfolio, I'm not concerned about that. The reality is, we may be negotiating from a position of better position because our properties look great. Sales are great. People -- a lot of the physical retail has dissipated in the markets where the action is.  So, we've made those bets all the time, that we're going to bet on the future. And if we don't -- we can't make a long-term deal. We make it short because we're betting on the future and we've been right more than we've been wrong in those bets. But we're not always right. But that's the judgment that we have to make and we make it reasonably well in my opinion. It's a little bit of that, but it's primarily the mix as I'd say -- as I've stated. And again -- -- it's not straightforward spreads. I mean, we could -- let me just say this, we could paint an unbelievably good picture there, but we just put all the stuff in, and the number is the number. So, if we went space-by-space, if we did it over a certain period of time, if we -- there are all sorts of ways you could create the number we would want you to focus on. But it's just a number to us. It's not what's driving our business. Okay? Thank you. Really not much of an issue for us. It's a de minimis number and it's like any other Company. If you have a profitable business, maybe you don't invest in it if you don't think the growth is there and you meet the cash flow. But if investors are concerned about that, my initial reaction is we should do a better job of explaining the quality of our portfolio, and the depth and breadth of our business. So, we encourage you to have them call us.  We'd be more than happy to walk through the portfolio, answer any questions that they have on it. But I don't think after that, they would come away with that being a real concern. If that does happen, it's on the margin. $0.03, $0.05, something like that. So, anybody that's concerned about that, please call me, Brian, or Tom. Or you can set it up and we'll walk them through the asset base. I have them -- they're pretty -- I have them somewhere. Yeah, let's see. Basically, occupancy in the EBITDA weighted is 93 to 91.8. And average base minimum rent is higher, obviously, but the spreads about the same, and the total rents about the same. And sales are rolling 12, or pretty consistent on a percent basis. But the rolling 12, when you can't -- remember, rolling 12, we have 3 months of downtime, so it's irrelevant. But the most important number is occupancy and it's a little bit better. We've got -- we've always been selling. We just sold the residential thing at a -- like a below sub-4 cap rate. There are a couple of retail properties that we've earmarked for sale. Markets are not quite there. We'll see what happens. Thank you. Well, look, I think all I can tell you is that we have beaten our first quarter, our second quarter. We hope to beat third and we hope to beat the fourth, but we're in the midst of the third and we're in the midst of the fourth, and we'll see how it -- how it shakes out. But we feel, as I mentioned to you earlier, we feel pretty good as to where we're positioned. Yeah. It is -- yeah. That's a good question. They're inching back toward it, more or less. We may be an hour short on -- excuse me. We may be an hour short on Monday through Wednesday, but basically Thursday, Friday, Saturday we're pretty much back to normal. No, it's pretty back to normal. I think that, in some cases, the retailers like it. It's something we're always monitoring and it's -- there is -- it's a very interesting subject because some retailers love it somewhat, more hours to go back. It gives me a headache when I think about all the different opinions. But it's pretty much back to normal, maybe an hour short in the early part of the week. But it's something -- the important point is something we monitor and manage daily, weekly, in significant consultation with our retailers. And it is -- and it has increased materially since the early days of reopening. Thank you. No, go ahead, Operator. All right. Thank you. Have a great rest of your summer and we'll talk soon Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

For our prepared remarks, I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Good evening. I'm pleased to report that our business has significantly improved after having addressed the impacts from COVID-19, including the restrictive governmental orders that have forced us to shut down, as well as reduce our operating capacity. Thankfully, those restrictions are now being lifted. I'm pleased to report our continued improvement in our profitability and cash flow generated for the first quarter. First quarter funds from operation was $934 million or $2.48 per share. FFO increased approximately $150 million or $0.31 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Our international operations continued to be affected by governmental closure orders and capacity restrictions. And in fact, the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $0.08 per share compared to our expectations given the closures that have occurred internationally. We also recorded additional COVID impacts in the first quarter of approximately $0.07 per share from based upon basically domestic rent abatements and uncollectible rents. We generated $875 million in cash from operations in the quarter, which was an increase of 18% compared to the prior-year period. We collected over 95% of our net billed rents for the first quarter and our in-line tenant collections are back to pre-COVID levels in the approximate 98% range. Our operating metrics in the period were as follows: mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 90.8%, down 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. This 50 basis point decline for the quarter is approximately 75% - 75 basis points less than the average historical seasonal decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Average base rents was $56.07, up 60 basis points year over year. Leasing spreads declined for the trailing 12 months, primarily due to the mix of deals that have fallen out, the spread calculation that have resulted in an increase to the average closing rate by approximately $8 per square foot for the trailing 12 months. Pricing continues to improve with the average opening rate per square foot for the trailing 12 months of approximately $60 per foot. And as you can see in the lease expiration schedule included in our supplemental, our expiring rents for the next few years are less than $60 per square foot. Keep in mind that the opening rate included in our spread calculation does not include any estimates for variable lease income based on sales. In certain circumstances in addressing tenant COVID negotiations last year, we, in certain cases, agreed to lower our initial base rent in exchange for lower unnatural sales breakpoints, allowing us to participate in the improved sales performance as the economy recovers. Now we think that will end up being a very smart move on our behalf. Those deals are included in the average opening rate at the lower base minimum rent and does not include our estimation of what the percentage rent could be, and we'll, obviously, believe those contributions in time will add to our cash flow. Leasing momentum has continued across our portfolio. We signed 1,100 leases for approximately 4.4 million square feet, and we have significant number of leases in our pipeline, our leasing volume in both number of leases in square feet was greater than the volume in each of the first quarter of 2020 and 2019. The improving domestic economic environment, shopper sentiment, have increased shopper foot traffic and sales across our portfolio. As I mentioned, increased in traffic for our open air and suburban centers has been very encouraging and retail sales continue to improve across the portfolio with higher sales volumes in March compared to 2019 levels. We opened West Midlands Designer Outlet, our second outlet in the United Kingdom in early April. This was behind schedule, was supposed to open in the fall of 2020 but was delayed due to COVID restrictions. We're pleased that this has now been lifted and we're now able to open and serve the shoppers. During the first quarter, we started construction of our fifth premium outlet in South Korea. We're excited about that opportunity. And hopefully by now, with respect to our brand and retailer investments, you've seen that we've been able to add significant value there. Our global brands within SPARC outperformed their plans in March and April on both sales and gross margin, led by Forever 21 and Aéropostale. For the two months combined, SPARC outperformed the sales plan by more than $135 million and our gross margin plan by more than $75 million. And we're also very pleased with the JCPenney early results. They continue to be above our plan. Our company's liquidity position at Penney is strong at $1.2 billion, and balance sheet is in very good shape with leverage of less than 1.2 times net debt to projected EBITDA. We continue to add new brands to the JCPenney portfolio, and we expect growth to be our focus going forward. Just a quick update on Taubman, we're very pleased with our partnership and the results in the first quarter. Our teams have collectively shared and implemented many best practices and are adding value to the assets. We expect to step up redevelopment plans with mixed-use opportunities throughout their TRG portfolio. Capital markets, very similar to what we always do. We're very active. We completed $1.5 billion senior note offering at 1.96%, weighted average term of 8.4 years. We also completed a EUR 750 million note, shouldn't say dollar, at one and one-eighths percent coupon at a term of 12 years. We used those proceeds to completely repay the $2 billion unsecured term facility associated with the Taubman deal, as well as pay off our $550 million senior notes. We've also refinanced six mortgages for $1.3 billion, our share of which is $589 million at an average interest rate of 3.36%. That market is continuing to improve. And at the end of the quarter, with all this activity, we have $8.4 billion of liquidity, consisting of $6.9 billion available on our credit facility; $1.5 billion of cash, including our share of JV cash. And reminder, that is net of $500 million of U.S. commercial paper outstanding at quarter end. We paid $1.30 per share in cash, in terms of our dividend on April 23. And then, finally, as you've seen, given our first-quarter results, we are increasing our full-year 2021 FFO guidance from $9.50 to $9.75 per share to $9.70 to $9.80 per. This is an increase of $0.20 per share at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the top end of the range or a 13% - or a $0.13 increase at midpoint and that represents a 6.5% to 7.6% growth rate compared to our 2020 results. So in conclusion, pleased with the results, encouraged with what we're seeing in terms of sales, traffic, retail demand. And we continue to continue to increase our performance and our Profitability. Ready for questions.\nOperator: Our first question is from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRich Hill: Hey, David, good afternoon. I had a quick question on the guide. Look, we've argued that the guide looks pretty conservative because I think if you assume no NOI growth versus 2020, you can sort of get to the high end of the prior range. And so the revision looks fairly conservative to us. I recognize there was some lease termination benefits in this quarter. So maybe you can just walk us through how you think about the cadence of that guide in 2Q, 3Q and 4Q?\nDavid Simon: Well, Rich, you can't blame us for being conservative, can you?\nRich Hill: No sir.\nDavid Simon: After what we dealt with for 14 months, we did not - just a couple of things. We - the lease settlement income was kind of in our plan, one. On the other hand, we did not - when we gave our initial guidance, we did not expect the negative results that we saw in Europe, primarily of $0.08. So that hurt us by $0.08. And that's still going to underperform given the restrictions for the rest of the year because that lockdown amazingly took a lot longer and lasted a lot longer. So unfortunately, in Europe, they're still dealing with COVID. That will have an impact. And then, I would say we - as you know, in the first quarter, we did still have some abatement and some bad debt, so to speak, that also affected us of $0.07. So we still think we are - there may be some further activity in that. We don't know. It's pretty much behind us at this point. But we're conservative. We've got Europe. I think the comp NOI, we didn't give you a number, but we expect in the U.S. to do better than what we initially thought. And I hope you're right. I hope we're conservative and I hope we do better than what we've what we're guiding to, but it's just been a traumatic time for this company and our folks, and you can't blame us.\nRich Hill: Understood. I have one follow-up question. And hopefully, I'm not putting words in your mouth, but I think on the last earnings call, you had talked about total core portfolio, ex-Taubman, being in the 3% to 4% range for 2021. And I note that total portfolio was plus 4% in this quarter, including Taubman, if I read it correctly. So how should we think about the total portfolio growth going forward, recognizing you haven't guided? Is that 3% to 4% still accurate, meaning that there should be a pretty significant ramp over the next several quarters?\nDavid Simon: Well, let's separate the two. I think when we talked about our comp, we thought we were going to be in the four-ish range, just comp, excluding Taubman. So to be clear, at least that's what our - my intent was when we had our year-end call. We expect to be a little bit above that. I mean, we still don't know. As I mentioned to you, because of COVID and some of the negotiations with retailers, we're betting a little bit more, so to speak, on the com because of the sales aspect of it. But we would hope to be around 5% on that as we look at it. And then, Taubman, we are just putting that in based on our plan. They're off to a pretty good start, and that's where you get the portfolio numbers. So the comp NOI should be in the 4% to 5%, hopefully, on the high end of that range. And then we itemized Taubman because we didn't want to confuse people. We're just going to show you those results. Then next year, 2022, we'll just have the TRG portfolio on our comps. So you'll see Taubman the rest of the year the way it's outlined. Did that help you at all?\nRich Hill: It does. I can follow up with Brian and Tom off-line on some wonky accounting questions, but that's helpful color. I'll get back in the queue.\nDavid Simon: I pride myself in being a wonk. So if you're ever bored, you can call me anytime.\nRich Hill: All right, sir. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nSteve Sakwa: So thanks. Good afternoon, David. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit more on kind of the leasing momentum and you talked about the 4.4 million feet done in Q1. Maybe just give us a little bit more color kind of what the pipeline sort of looks like, what types of attendance are you seeing. Is there a focus, whether it be food, whether it be on apparel, whether it be on entertainment? Just what are you seeing on the leasing today?\nDavid Simon: Well, keep my fingers crossed, but we're actually seeing really good demand across the board. Very interestingly, the restaurants demand is at the very high level. We're seeing a lot of restaurateurs that for some of the fixed space that was vacated They want to come in, retrofit it, get open quicker. So we're seeing really good demand there. I think some of the strong retailers are growing their business significantly. American Eagle is a great example. Urban Outfitters is a great - another great example of two companies that just pop to mind that have We have multiple deals in the works on. We're probably 80% done, Steve, on our renewals thus far. And I'd say we generally feel pretty good and much better than we felt in a long time. And I just think the - we're seeing a resurgence in brand. So let's take a great example of a company, Crocs. Crocs was hot a decade ago. People thought it lost its mojo, maybe it had. It's now killing it. So we are seeing footwear, we're seeing apparel. We're seeing another - a lot of brands in the - that are new, that are coming into the - that want great retail real estate. So I'm seeing basically a resurgence across the board, and our team is very, very active. We're also seeing demand from entrepreneurs, local, regional. So pretty good results are coming that I think you'll start to see in the upcoming quarters.\nSteve Sakwa: OK, thanks. And I guess, that sort of dovetails into sort of my follow-up, when you think about kind of the occupancy trend, and I appreciate your comments that the drop sequentially was maybe less than what you normally see seasonally. But do you feel like occupancy at this point is now at the bottom and you start to see that kind of improve throughout this year or into next year? And then same with kind of leasing spreads, does this kind of mark the bottom here on leasing spreads?\nDavid Simon: Well, again, I think we gave a rather lengthy explanation on leasing spreads. The thing I would focus on, it is mix driven. So that's the first point. The other thing is, as part of COVID, we were doing renewals, where we had lower base rents and more unnatural breakpoints, which I think hopefully, based on sales trends are going to actually - we're going to actually have made a pretty good bet on that. So I don't think you'll see that as the mix changes, and gets more stable, and that's why we pointed out the kind of - what you see expiring. I would hope for that you'd see that essentially that decrease go away with time as that goes out. So that's the first point. And then, I think, occupancy, I would think we would see improvement clearly where we were at the end of last year by the time we get back up to year-end. So I would expect a reasonable improvement on '20 versus '21. We're not going to get back to 2019 levels in '21. We look kind of more in '22, '23 level, but that's a little bit of a estimate. But the demand, frankly, I don't want to oversell it. That's not my style. But I mean, I'm - we've got - and I don't like naming names, but even though I named two already, we are just making deals with - across the board with a bunch of people. We do have some - still have some difficult relationships and negotiations that we're dealing with. And again, I won't name names, but - so to the extent it's not - the occupancy uptick is not as robust as you think, it's primarily because we've taken the tactical response that, look, we're not going to - if they're not paying what we think is fair, we'd just rather sit on empty space. And that's a judgment that I hope investors will appreciate that having done this for quite some time, we're not always going to get it right, but the fact of the matter is we're going to try and do fair deals. But to the extent that it's too one-sided, we're just - we'll sit on the space. So we still have a few of those kind of scenarios that will probably play out in '21.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. That's it for me. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi there. Maybe just following up on the occupancy point. The lease termination fees were significant in the quarter. And I think you mentioned that was kind of your plan. What made you comfortable allowing this tenant or multiple tenants move out early and Simon take that termination income rather than keeping them in occupancy?\nDavid Simon: Yeah, that's really in our - it's a good, really good question. It's really an art versus science. It's really a function. We don't really like to do it. But in some cases, we think the space is really good, and we'll be able to ring the bell on the lease termination income and then lease it up. And so we get the benefit of both. If I get the present value of that lease stream more or less, and then I have the space to lease, that's a pretty good business for us to do. And that's the case, that's what we saw in Q1. So we basically, in a lot of cases, took the net present - near 100% of the net present value of that lease, got the money, got the cash, then we have the space and then we'll lease it up. That's pretty good case, and that's pretty smart to do, pretty thoughtful to do. Our space isn't going anywhere. Our malls aren't going anywhere. There's still great real estate, demand is picking up. So in some cases, we'll - that's the kind of trade we'll make. We're not taking real discounts to NPV. And obviously, we are very sophisticated in running the math to see what the fair deal is.\nCaitlin Burrows: OK. And then, maybe on the acquisition front, Simon raised equity later in 2020, and I think some of it was earmarked for possible property acquisitions. So just wondering what you're seeing in terms of opportunity, and I guess, willing sellers, and is there any commentary on whether you're more interested in potential U.S. or international properties.\nDavid Simon: Well, I think we have built a great portfolio over a long period of time. We don't need anything to continue to run profitably and grow our earnings now after having dealt with 14, 15 months of COVID. On the other hand, if there's some - a few properties here and there that make strategic sense, we're willing able buyers of that. The sellers, they ebb and they flow, and sometimes their expectations aren't where we think they should be. Obviously, we're very active with Taubman. We think that's going to turn out to be a very good deal for everybody involved. So it's not like we haven't just done a significant transaction. And we think there's lots of upside in the portfolios we work with the Taubmans to recover from COVID. So we're - we've got our eye out. We're - we've got a great network. We can always enhance it, but we also are looking at content. And where - what do I mean by content? Well, you'll see - as we point out to the value creation in some of our content deals over this year or next, you'll see our ability to create significant value off balance sheet that I think helps us with content and what we are trying to do in terms of positioning our real estate for the future.\nCaitlin Burrows: OK, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good afternoon, David. How are you?\nDavid Simon: Good.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Oh, fabulous, fabulous.\nDavid Simon: It's earnings. We got a bunch of stuff still going on.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Life is good. So two questions here. Saw the Eddie Bauer news, and if my ability to read English is correct, it looks like you did that in the traditional ABG investment wrapper not in the SPAC. So a two-parter for my first question, just - I know last time on the call, you said the SPAC will do a lot more than just traditional retail, but maybe just walk through thoughts on how stuff goes into - just remind us how stuff goes into the ABG wrapper versus the SPAC. And then, two, the disclosure on Page 16, which you guys have had for a while, but it does show the benefit from these retail investments starting to come through, which really shows that, hey, these things are making money. But to that point, just sort of curious how much of the brand's NOI is coming from Simon centers versus coming from non-Simon centers?\nDavid Simon: Well, we don't really go through that. But no, these are retailers that have essentially a very broad portfolio. And so they get a lot of their profitability from stores and e-commerce outside of our portfolio. So just to touch on your last one. So just a quick note on Eddie Bauer. So Eddie Bauer, we will partner with ABG to buy the IP, which we think is terrific. It's been around 100 years, celebrated 100-year anniversary, I think, last year. It was the first company to create the down jacket. And in 2019, it did $786 million of sales, and we are buying the IP at a fraction, a lot less than one times. And if you look at where brands are being priced, you will have noticed that we did - we'll do a great deal. In addition, we are buying - SPARC will buy the operating company which were partners with ABG on for essentially the working capital, and they'll operate the stores. And we think - again, they're going to add $30 million to $40 million of EBITDA to SPARC. SPARC this year projected we'll do about $130 million of EBITDA. That doesn't really come through because we have depreciation. We don't add that back for FFO and the like. But - and so SPARC is doing fantastic. Eddie Bauer, adding that to SPARC will be really beneficial, and then we're beginning to create kind of a whole outdoor apparel with the brands that we have with Nautica and so on. And then I think the IP of Eddie Bauer will be - will have growth associated with it under the ABG umbrella.\nAlexander Goldfarb: But as far as like your thoughts of this going into theirs, like so is the SPAC really just for more like technology or efficiency cost investments, not retail?\nDavid Simon: Well, this is not in the SPAC. The SPAC is available to do kind of what we told the market, things outside. But this is like a core ABG, SPARC transaction that the synergies associated with folding this into SPARC doing the - following the same game plan that we've done with all the other brands we bought is essentially a no-brainer.\nAlexander Goldfarb: OK. Second question is, David, ESG, certainly a growing investment outlook and a lot of funds looking for it, but there's more talk in retail about the efficiencies of physical versus online. Clearly, individual boxes being shipped, intuitively doesn't make sense. Driving trucks, whether gas or electric through neighborhoods doesn't sort of compete versus bulk shipment to the malls and shopping centers. So what are you guys doing to address this, not just on the white paper you did a few years ago, but more collectively, whether individually or industry, to really highlight and showcase the environmental benefits of physical retail to the investment community and to the local communities as a whole versus just what the industry has done before, which as I say, you've done the white paper, etc.?\nDavid Simon: Well, Alex, this reminds me of the - it's - if you can sense hesitation, it's because you can sense frustration. Physical shopping, unquestionably, is better for the environment than e-commerce. And we have written studies on it. We have discussed it and right now, nobody cares. It's our job to have the communities care. And I think part of why people cared less was, obviously, because of COVID and priorities were focused elsewhere. But I think it's a real focus for us in the future to explain the merits of our physical footprint and what it means for carbon footprint of physical stores vis-a-vis e-commerce, not to mention all of the energy costs, server costs, etc., packaging. You can go on and on and on about the cost associated, the carbon footprint of e-commerce compared to physical. And I will refute anyone, and I think others have tried to say that e-commerce is - has less carbon footprint. It - that just is not true. So - but we have our job to do much - reminds me, we got to get the governments to care. We got to get governments to ask. And it reminds me that I've been around enough to know that e-commerce, Internet sales, taxation, we talk, we talk, we talk. Everybody says, you're right, you're right, you're right. Nobody did anything until thankfully, the Supreme Court overturned the Quill decision to level the playing field. There is no reason, in addition to that that retail real estate should be taxed 10 times what warehouse and distribution facilities are taxed, 10 times. But hopefully, when we give our pitch to local jurisdictions, real estate assessors, government authorities and so on, they will care. We do. And - but we - I'm open to ideas on how to get the message out. The message is clear to me. Hopefully, people will care.\nAlexander Goldfarb: We do.\nDavid Simon: And I'm open to ideas on how to get the message out.\nAlexander Goldfarb: The message is clear to me. Hopefully people will care. OK, thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Bilerman: Great. Good afternoon, David. I wanted to ask you about sort of development and redevelopment spending. You're, obviously, I think, enthusiastic as all of us are about the recovery and everything that's happening. How do you think about increasing the deployment of capital, either into new assets or into existing assets? If you look on Page 25 of the supplemental, I think that $430 million may be the lowest I've seen in years. And I think back - I think over the last decade, David, you put like $8 billion to work in your assets. So how should we think about deployment of capital over the next couple of quarters or at least announcements of investing more capital when you also think about the investments you can make in Taubman's assets, which I think the schedule excludes?\nDavid Simon: Yeah, it's absolutely a very valid observation. I mean, with COVID, we shut things down, we've frankly stopped construction of certain projects in midstream. One is because we had to because governmental orders; two is we didn't necessarily see any light at the end of the tunnel when you basically have 230 properties shut down across the country. So the good news is we were able to do it. We did it without incident, we did it justly, fairly, appropriately And now we're starting back up, Michael. We're still going - we are still a little conservative on that front, primarily. We still have concerns about - we just want to make sure we're through the COVID crises that we've all had to deal with. But it is a goal of ours and a focus of ours to crank this up. Now the good news it's there, it's ready. We've rethought some projects. I think I mentioned this last time, a couple of the California projects, we had more retail than we probably will now. And we're evaluating supply and demand when it comes to other mixed-use components of it. The good news is, without question, the silver lining in surviving this very tough time for all of us, has been that it wasn't too long ago, and it's like clocks. It wasn't too long ago where Suburbia was like, forget about it, right? So to me, and I mentioned this, I don't know, two calls ago, suburbia is hot. Suburbia is the place to be. And we just happen to have a lot of great, well-located suburban real estate that we tend to take - will tend to take advantage of. And I don't think this is a short-term scenario. I think this will play out for several years. So we've got some really good stuff. And the redevelopment pipeline will pick up. And I think Our experience and knowledge and execution will clearly help. And the Taubman portfolio is a great suburban real estate more or less. And there will be great opportunities to add to that. We're already working on, as an example, they have a big development in Cherry Creek, which will end up being a major mixed-use opportunity for TRG that we're there to help the partners sort through as it develops.\nMichael Bilerman: So when we're thinking about this slide at the end of the year, do you think it could easily be at, let's say, a $2 billion run rate when you include Taubman and all the projects that you're accelerating? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much. And also, just given your overall enthusiasm about the results and where you see traffic and sales and leasing, I'm just trying to get a sense of how much that will translate into incremental capital above and beyond what you've already identified?\nDavid Simon: Well, again, it's all valid questions. I would say to you by year-end, and this is a guess, and Brian who's looking at me shaking his head, no. But I would - when you look - and we've got a couple of things in Europe that we'll probably do when you put it all together, I would say - again, the spend will be over a year plus we'll end up having a pipeline probably at about $1 billion of stuff that we'll have committed to by year-end. Again, don't hold me to that number, but that would be kind of my gut feel.\nBrian McDade: Yeah, there will be some that we'll talk to too, Michael. So don't forget about that piece. So there will be projects that get delivered for the year that will ultimately reduce that number.\nMichael Bilerman: Right, right. And then, just as a follow-up. Clearly, there's a lot of people going out and doing things, and I don't know if it's revenge shopping or stimulus shopping, but there are certainly much more people going out and shopping. How are you able to discern how much of this is just that? Just like we've been stuck around for so long, I just need to get out and do something. I want to go shop versus something that's longer lasting. And are you able to sort of tease out anything from the data analytics in terms of dwell times or conversion rates or any certain retail categories that are seeing more long-lasting benefits than maybe one type of shot in the arm?\nDavid Simon: Well, I think that's the big question, right? So that's why we continue to be conservative because between being cooped up, between being locked down, between the stimulus, between celebrating that we are - the country is still around, and we're still going to try to get back to normal, there's clearly some level of euphoria around that. It would be impossible for me to tell you what percent that is. But that's why we were being conservative. On the other hand, we're still seeing pockets of the country that haven't really seen that yet. Who? California is a great example, parts of the New York region. There's still no international tourism, which we would expect to see in '22. So even if it kind of like stabilizes or just kind of normalizes, there'll be other pockets that I think will pick up as the entire country reopens. I mean, let's take California versus Florida. I mean, Disney World has been open nine months. And Disneyland, I think just opened, right? So California has a nine-month lag. And we've got - we're - we've got real presence in California, as you know, that we'll see the benefits of. And then I - and don't underestimate, I do believe, assuming - and this is a global issue, but I do think people are going to start to travel again, globally, probably won't happen much until end of this year or certainly in '22. But we're going to see a pick of that - pickup of that. We might see that in Europe, just because the Chinese has stayed at home. With the Chinese coming here, we could see that here. So there are elements that will pick up the slack to the extent that the last couple of months have been really, really nice to see.\nMichael Bilerman: OK, thanks for the color, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from Derek Johnston of DB. Your line is open.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Thank you. Hi, David. So we touched on this a bit, but our store checks are pointing to a pretty high level of online order fulfillment from the mall or the retail store itself. And is this a tenant last mile approach that you're seeing gaining any type of traction? And especially since distribution space has gotten so costly, are retailers talking about this? And could there be a growing trend at work here kind of the merger between online and in-store?\nDavid Simon: Well, there's no question that most of the sophisticated retailers really want to be - I don't want to use all the buzzwords, but seamless between online and ship from store, pick up in store, all of that stuff. It's interesting, when we talk to retailers, the majority want to do that. Some like to fulfill it still in the distribution facility. So it's not uniform across the board, but they all want a seamless experience. They want to be able to offer clearly pick-up in-store or deliver from store. In a lot of cases, with shipping and delays that's much more advantageous to them. A handful would prefer to execute out of their distribution facilities. But I'd say the vast majority are moving toward seamless pick-up, ship from store, using that as so to speak, a - ability to fulfill from the physical store is a real advantage to them in terms of delivery costs and so on. So yeah, though there's a few that find it more efficient to do otherwise. So it's like everything else in retail, there's not one size fits all. But it's a good trend. And I think they need their footprint. With the connection for the retailer, lots of retailers will tell you that - not to be repetitive. But as we said and others have said, look, when they close a store and that's their store in their marketplace, they lose the e-commerce business. Or vice versa, when they open a store, their e-commerce business goes up. So they look at it in totality. I think with all the ability now to study the consumer better with all the data, we're able to do a much better job.\nDerek Johnston: Thank you. That makes sense. Could you expand on some of the early reads from the JCPenney investment? I know you spent some time on Forever 21 and Arrow, and even called out JCPenney briefly. What are you seeing importantly at JCPenney? How have the trends held up there? Are there any remerchandising wins or early successes that you'd like to expand on?\nDavid Simon: Well, I think we've been mostly like all of our deals when we buy a retailer out of bankruptcy, we are in the stabilization mode and the capital preservation mode. We've accomplished both of those already. As I mentioned to you, in the call, we've got $1.2 billion of liquidity and undrawn ABL. So we're in good shape. We are bringing new merchandise brands to it. But importantly, some of the other brands that were nervous about us - when I say nervous, not about Simon and ABG, but nervous when you go through a bankruptcy, reestablishing those relationships and giving the vendors comfort that we're going to be around and able to pay for the goods has been really rewarding and we're seeing more and more confidence from the vendor community. So because when you go through bankruptcy, not only landlords get burned, but vendors get burned, and so it's very important for us as new owners taking Penney out of bankruptcy that we give the vendors comfort that we're going to be around to do it. Now the ultimately move toward growth is the future of what we are working on. We're not there yet. We stabilized it. We are bringing in new brands. We've got lots of ideas and what to do there. But the first goal is to rightsize the company, strengthen the financial capabilities, repairing a vendor relationships that we need to do, stabilize the morale and so on. Obviously, that's harder to do in COVID, when people are working remotely. But we've - I've been proud of the execution, and so far, the results. Our plan is above where we thought it was going to be. So that's very encouraging. But in order to turn JCPenney into a 21st century retailer, that's still work in progress.\nDerek Johnston: Understood. Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCraig Schmidt: Thank you. I'm just thinking about sales per square foot, if you were to annualize 1Q sales, are you within spitting distance of your pre-COVID sales per square foot? Or is there still a way to go?\nDavid Simon: Well, the best - I would say it depends how far you spit Craig, OK? If you play - it depends if you play baseball or not and - what do they call that when they have the - what is that?\nBrian McDade: Spittoon.\nDavid Simon: Spittoon. That's the word I'm looking for. So just to give you a sense of - the best way for us to look at it is March of 2019 to March of '21. I mean, we're way over March of '20. I mean, we are 130% above March of '20. But put that aside because that I would say to you when you put it all together in March of '21 compared to March of 2019, comparable - so same basically stores, we're like a little under - we're like minus 7%, 8%, OK? Now I think April will be ahead of - so when you look at April and March together, I think we're going to be ahead of sales for April, March of 2019, April, March '21, OK? Is that helpful?\nCraig Schmidt: Yes, that's very helpful.\nDavid Simon: And I think that's the way to do it. So yes, I think we're - it's pitting difference. And I think we'll be ahead by - as April sales come rolling in, if you put the two months together, we'll be ahead.\nCraig Schmidt: Great. And then, I know you were talking earlier about possibly ramping up redevelopment and developments, would you think more would be spent on mixed-use efforts or anchor repositionings?\nDavid Simon: I think we'll end up, given the move toward the suburbs and what's happening there and away from CBDs, I actually - I mean, again, this is just a gut feel. So I actually think there'll probably be more toward mixed-use. I really do.\nCraig Schmidt: OK. And then just finally, are you planning to introduce a lot of your SPARC brands into JCPenney? Like can we see any Bauer department in JCPenney's future?\nDavid Simon: I think it's the - it's not just SPARC brands, but it could be ABG brands. Remember, ABG owns a lot of - they have the IP for a lot of different brands. So the answer is, without question, the - it takes time, obviously, design it, manufacture it and get it in there. But I would think in '22, maybe even late '21, we'll start to see a lot of the ABG brands end up in JCPenney.\nCraig Schmidt: OK, that's it for me. Thanks. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum of Compass Point. Your line is open.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Guys, thanks for taking my question. David, maybe - obviously, very encouraging so far. Talking about comp sales of 4% to 5% this year for your historical SPG portfolio. Presumably, Taubman is going to see something similar. Are you working on any initiatives in the TRG portfolio? I'm thinking more of one of the things that sets SPG apart from some of its peers is your focus on specialty leasing, kiosks, things like that. Is that going to be more of an element in the TRG portfolio? Or are they going to be - remain a more traditional high-end retailer? Or do you - where do you see the revenue opportunities in TRG in particular? And could that same-store growth actually be higher as a result of not having some of these things that SPG has had in the past?\nDavid Simon: Yeah, I think the short answer is without question. We've actually - they - it wasn't that they were - first of all, you can execute any program we have and still maintain a high-end mall. But put that aside, the - we just this - we just have a lot of - we have a lot of resources to bear. I mean, we've got a big field operation. We're basically in the most - all of their markets. And I think by doing local leasing, specialty leasing, sponsorship at the rate and at the level that we do, we're going to see significant upside in TRG. And in fact, we basically implemented in many cases, the existing SPG sales force for no better word to start selling our product to that portfolio. So that's actually been implemented and we're at work on it. So - and the working relationship to execute that was honestly, great and a lot easier than when I had to deal with Chelsea folks when we came in, OK? So - and I think it's been very - it's been the relationship, the coordination on leasing and development, me and Rick and the Taubmans, doing all of that stuff has been excellent. And yes, the short answer is there is upside, and we've got the - they were limited in resources, frankly, to do it, not out of neglect or out of a different point of view. I just didn't have the people, the scale to do it. Here we go. So we're ready. And we're doing things like insurance that we have more scale to there. So there's all sorts of those things that we are bringing to bear without - with open arms on both sides. So I do think that that portfolio will have a little bit higher uptick with time than probably us because we already do it and they don't. So we'll hope to see some of the benefit of that in the future.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Great. Thanks. And maybe one follow-up. If you could maybe comment, you're now on both sides of the table, if you will, you're the landlords and you also own these retailers. Does your confidence that you're exuding in this call partly stem from the uptick that you're seeing in the retailers that you've made an investment in? And maybe if you could share some of the growth in maybe sales for those retailers? And you sort of commented a little bit about that, but also the growth in EBITDA that you potentially see going forward for the retailer part of your business?\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, obviously, that data that helps us. So I mentioned in the call for us that literally just two brands in SPARC, Forever 21 and Aéropostale, are literally $135 million over their plan already. Now their February wasn't as great. Remember, February had a lot of uptick in COVID. But - and so it's sure. I mean, it does - it's a great reference point and it does give us confidence. We're seeing similar good results in Penney. But importantly, our guys across the board talk to all sorts of retailers from luxury to moderate, to department stores. People are feeling pretty good and look at the retail stocks. I mean, the retail stocks have blown past us. I mean, I had Tom do his thing for me. We're still below our COVID - pre-COVID price yet the retailers are, in many cases, 200% higher than what they were. So the answer is, yes, we have a lot of data. We understand the consumer better than ever. But importantly, we have content now that allows us flexibility and knowledge that we didn't necessarily have before.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Mueller: Hi. In terms of the $0.07 of COVID reserves and abatements, was there any prior-period collections that were positive offset within it that may not repeat?\nDavid Simon: Nothing material. We did collect deferred rent of how much, Brian?\nBrian McDade: Yeah, the deferred, we collected $100 million of previously deferred rents. But that was earnings that we recognized last year, was simply working capital adjustment, Michael.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. So that didn't flow through the P&L, but it's always good to see a collection of deferred rent. So but no, not anything noteworthy at all, Mike.\nMichael Mueller: OK, that was it. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nLinda Tsai: Hi. Just looking at your NOI overview disclosure on Page 16, it looks like your share of NOI from retailer investments and also corporate and other NOI sources were down a bit sequentially. What was driving that?\nBrian McDade: Well, Linda, it's Brian. With respect to the NOI from retailers, you got to remember the seasonality of the retail business, typically, first quarter is the low mark. And so you're actually seeing a positive contribution here relative to historical. Sequentially versus fourth quarter, you would be down because the fourth quarter is, obviously, the biggest point in the year. With respect to corporate and other NOI sources, we do provide the breakdown of that. What you see is the - coming through that line is an increase in lease settlement income. And then offsetting that is some further reductions from our auxiliary lines of business in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of last year. So Simon Business Ventures, those kind of businesses were down relative to a full quarter last year.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks. And just in terms of the strength in 1Q leasing, can you just talk about who the backfill options are? Are they existing retailers or more new to market?\nDavid Simon: I missed the question, what -\nBrian McDade: The option and leases.\nDavid Simon: Well, there's a lot. I mean, it's - there are - I hate naming names, but you've got a lot of the B2C guys that are growing their business. I mentioned to you, American Eagle is growing their business. Urban Outfitters is growing their business So we're - it's really across the board, restaurants, the luxury folks, product, Gucci, Louis Vuitton. I mean, it really is encouraging. You've got - it is really encouraging to see it not in one particular category, but across the board, Levi's, rue21, Ladderock, I mentioned Aerie, Marc Jacobs, Bottega Veneta, Saint Lauren. SPARC is growing some opportunities, and you've got - we had a Golden Goose open, Warby Parker, Craghoppers, a U.K. outerwear brand. I really miss Rick when this happens, OK? So I'm going to have Rick come in for a cameo, OK? I don't do as good a job as Rick, but - when it comes to that. But it is across the board.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks for that.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Your line is open.\nHaendel St. Juste: I guess, that's me. Thank you for taking the question. So question on occupancy. And you talked a bit earlier about rebuilding the occupancy, the time line. But I guess, I was more curious specifically from a cash paying perspective, I think you said you could be back to 2019 occupancy levels by perhaps 2022 or '23. But when do you think we'll see the cash flow impact of that? Is that another year out, so maybe this is more like 2023?\nDavid Simon: Well, there's clearly a lag impact, yeah, so I think that's a fair statement. I mean, look, we've run lots of numbers, when do we get past our 2019 numbers, we are certainly not going to get there this year. We're certainly not going to get there next year. Could it be '23, '24? Look, it's so dependent upon the economy and what's out there. But I think the ability to see that closer than what we thought a few months ago is there. So that's the goal. And we're - every day, we're grinding to make that happen.\nHaendel St. Juste: Fair enough. Fair enough. Thank you for that. And just a couple of follow-ups on the guide. I understand the restriction that is still ongoing and beyond your control in the international portfolio. But I was curious maybe you could talk a bit about what's implied in the guidance for international this year? You mentioned an $0.08 drag in the first quarter. Is that a level we should expect again in second quarter? And when do you expect that to improve? And also one for Brian, I was curious about the level of bad debt reserves you're carrying at the end of the first-quarter year and perhaps maybe speaking to the broad industry exposure or probability of recovery of some of that and anything implied in the guide? Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Well, I'll do Europe. I mean, Europe, we will see further impact in Europe, Q2 against our plan. My guess is probably in the $0.04 to $0.05 range, if I had to guess. And then, I'm hopeful we'll be on plan the rest of Q3 and Q4 as it picks up. Now to the extent that there's anything like the U.S. where there's some pent-up demand, we may see that - may see a little bit of outperformance in Q3 and Q4, but we are not anticipating that. But clearly, we're going to see in the $0.04 or $0.05 range compared to our plan and our guidance. The Europe - and then when I talk about international, it's really Japan, is the squishiest because of COVID and their caution, obviously, with the Olympics coming up. So that could be another couple of cents internationally.\nBrian McDade: Haendel, with respect to your other question about recoverability of the reserves, I mean, at quarter end, we were appropriately reserved. As you heard us say that we did not get any positive impact in the first quarter from that, and that's our expectation from the balance of the year. The reserves that we're establishing, we expect to be true reserves and write-offs, not a recovery.\nHaendel St. Juste: OK. And that level again, sorry, what was that at the end of first quarter?\nBrian McDade: It was consistent with prior years, but we're not giving out individual levels.\nHaendel St. Juste: OK, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim of Truist. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. Good evening. So just going to your top tenant list, I noticed some decreases in store counts for - at least for the top five. Just a little bit of an open-ended question here, but just curious if you can provide any color and should we expect some further fallout?\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, look, I think all of the retailers were very conservative in dealing with COVID. And if these leases happen to expire during that awful shutdown and the restrictions and all of that, I mean, they closed stores, so there's going to - and like I said earlier, I mean, there's going to be a few retailers that we are not going to be able to find a happy medium with, and we may lose their entire fleet. And that's - I mean, we're ready for it. And it's - a lot of our expectations are already in those numbers. So we'll see. But yes, I think there'll be - for some of the big retailers, they've announced public store closings. I don't want to get into which that - all of that's out there of the public. But they're all thinning their fleet and the fact of the matter is if they do, they do, and we're used to leasing up space.\nKi Bin Kim: OK. And can you just comment about some of the lease clauses and language that's being used today for the new lease deals? And I'm just, in particular, more curious about if tenants have more out. I know you mentioned more percentage rent deals as they hit breakpoints, but I'm just curious if there's some other language with - regarding like future pandemics or things like that that might create some variability.\nDavid Simon: Not really. I mean, there's always a lease here or there with 20-plus thousand leases. There's always some variability. But the reality is we - during the COVID renewals, those were difficult discussions. Everybody was under enormous pressure, and in some of those cases, like I said earlier, we reduced our base rent to bet on sales. We'll see maybe we did a better deal than what we thought we had done at that time, OK? Believe me, I prefer to have had the higher base rent. But no one is - there's no - there's very few, very focused on pandemic language, And at this point, there's no material or even meaningful trend in that language. And I would say, generally, lease terms, it depends on the retailer maybe in some cases, they're very similar to what they've been. We're very focused on lease terms. We don't willy nilly just do a deal to do a deal. And there's a lot of give and take. And I would say there's no real super trend that's going on in lease terms. There's always a give and take, but nothing of note that I think we should share at this point.\nKi Bin Kim: OK, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vince Tibone of Green Street. Your line is open.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good evening. How sensitive is your NOI this year to tenant sales? It would be helpful if you could provide some guideposts there. For example, just if tenant sales this year came in at 2019 levels, how different would it be if, let's say, tenant sales were 10% higher this year than 2019?\nDavid Simon: Well, it is very - it's very complicated. It's very complicated because it's lease by lease, it's where they're natural or unnatural break is, it's when it hits. It's what they tell us, what we audit. And so the simple answer, Vince, as much as I'd like to tell you, we don't really guide to that. We do it in our own budgets. But we're a big company, sophisticated company, lots of ins and outs, And I think that's how we want people to think about us as opposed to what the percent rent is here versus there. It kind of ebbs and flows W.e like people to think about us a little big bit in a more broader context.\nVince Tibone: That's - are there like any rough ballpark? Like is it a 20 bps impact if that 10% swing in sales? Or the 2% or 3%? I mean, any kind of rough sense? Because, I mean, tenant sales, obviously, the - you're kind of the one of the big markers we are following, but just trying to get a sense of how much it truly matters for FFO or NOI this year.\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, I'd say simply, if we end up at 2019 sales, we'd be happy. How is that? Even Tom is smiling, OK?\nVince Tibone: OK, fair enough.\nDavid Simon: Tom does not smile. It takes him a lot to smile.\nVince Tibone: One more for me. It looks like temporary tenants continue to take more space in the portfolio. Can you discuss the overall strategy as it relates to backfilling space with these lower rent paying temporary tenants? And just whether you expect the square footage leased to these temp tenants to move higher or lower from here?\nDavid Simon: Well, look, we - I mean, frankly, Vince, we have more space. So - because we've lost space. So remember, as you know, we don't add that into our occupancy unless it's a year lease. We also like - again, we like doing business with local and regional entrepreneurs that are bootstrapping their way up to try and build the business. We've had - I mean, our most famous retailer on that is a finish line when they came in - and it's finished lines from Indianapolis. But those guys started with one store, and they grew - obviously, they were just bought by JD Sports. But I mean, we don't know who the next finish line. We did the same thing with LIDS, where they started with one or two stores. So you never know. We like that business. It also creates a uniqueness to the real estate and the local. I was actually just reviewing the book that our specialty leasing folks put together for me every quarter. The mix and the customer care that these people have with their communities is great. The product is getting better and better. So it's an important part of our business. We have more space to fill because of either bankruptcies or some of the larger folks because of COVID reducing their store counts. So we're proud of that business. We like working with entrepreneurs. We like finding the next finish line, the next LIDS. We don't know where it will be, but that's what our people try and do. And it also makes the real estate look and feel better than a vacancy. And if you walk one of our centers, I hope you feel like - obviously, there's frictional vacancy because if you're building out a store, somebody is moving in or out. But I want people to feel like it's full. The last thing you want to do is you walk down Madison Avenue, you know there's kind of a problem there, right? So when I - when they walk them all, I want them to feel like It feels good. So it's just a good, solid part of our business. I'm proud of what we do there, proud of the people that we lease to and that's a business we'll continue to foster again. Not always - doesn't always work out for the entrepreneur and for us, but it's something that we like to focus on.\nVince Tibone: Makes sense. Thank you for the time.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJuan Sanabria: Good evening. I was just hoping to touch on Michael Bilerman's earlier question on the development and redevelopment schedule. Just saw the expected yields come down a tick on a couple of the different buckets. And I was just curious if that was more of a mix issue or if the underwriting has changed on expected rents or the time frames have widened out as a result of COVID? If you could provide any color, that would be helpful.\nBrian McDade: Juan, it's Brian. This is simply mix. Every time we produce the schedule every quarter, there's projects that come in and out. And so it's a mix change over time from the fourth quarter.\nJuan Sanabria: Great. And then, a second question is just on the retailer EBITDA contribution. I believe you spoke to a $260 million number for 2021. Just curious on what your sense for that number is now kind of pre-Eddie Bauer, if you have it handy?\nDavid Simon: Well, Eddie Bauer won't close - it will be higher, but Eddie Bauer won't close probably until two months? So it will be higher. How is that? Is that helpful? So I mean, the $260 million included our share of everything, including Penney. So we're above that now. So we're going to - hopefully. Again, retail is - does have its ebbs and flows. But we're projecting to be greater than that already without Eddie Bauer. And then, I think Eddie Bauer, once it closes, will clearly add to that. I mean, it's going to be a very good deal for SPARC there. I'm a little nervous because SPARC - my guys at SPARC have done a great job. Mark Miller, CEO; Dave Dick, CFO are thoughtful, conservative, great stewards of the brands, great partners of me and Jamie Salter of ABG. I'm just nervous because they were really excited about Eddie Bauer, and I'm like, \"You guys are never excited about anything. Now I'm nervous, OK?\" But no, we - they think it's going to be a great addition.\nBrian McDade: And Juan, just one thing to point out, obviously, is relative to our retail investments, we don't add back depreciation and amortization. So the FFO contribution is much less than the EBITDA contribution.\nJuan Sanabria: Yeah, thank you very much.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey, David, just to maybe touch on that last question a little bit differently. On the last call, it was a $0.15 to $0.20 contribution to FFO from the retail investments. So is it fair now that there's a higher number assumed for the contribution of guidance?\nDavid Simon: Yeah, I think that's to say. I don't know, Greg, what the number is off the top of my head, but it should, hopefully, it will outperform our initial budget.\nGreg McGinniss: OK. And then, just kind of rounding out the guidance questions, could you tell us what's built in regarding additional lease cancellation income?\nDavid Simon: Nothing material. For the balance of the year, nothing material. Nothing on - nothing really in our radar.\nGreg McGinniss: OK, thank you very much.\nDavid Simon: Thank you. Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: There are no further questions on queue. I will turn the call over back to David Simon for any closing remarks.\nDavid Simon: Thank you. Thanks for your interest and all your questions and Look forward to talking to you soon. Take care.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]",

            "content": "Yeah, there will be some that we'll talk to too, Michael. So don't forget about that piece. So there will be projects that get delivered for the year that will ultimately reduce that number. Spittoon. Yeah, the deferred, we collected $100 million of previously deferred rents. But that was earnings that we recognized last year, was simply working capital adjustment, Michael. Well, Linda, it's Brian. With respect to the NOI from retailers, you got to remember the seasonality of the retail business, typically, first quarter is the low mark. And so you're actually seeing a positive contribution here relative to historical. Sequentially versus fourth quarter, you would be down because the fourth quarter is, obviously, the biggest point in the year. With respect to corporate and other NOI sources, we do provide the breakdown of that. What you see is the - coming through that line is an increase in lease settlement income. And then offsetting that is some further reductions from our auxiliary lines of business in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of last year. So Simon Business Ventures, those kind of businesses were down relative to a full quarter last year. The option and leases. Haendel, with respect to your other question about recoverability of the reserves, I mean, at quarter end, we were appropriately reserved. As you heard us say that we did not get any positive impact in the first quarter from that, and that's our expectation from the balance of the year. The reserves that we're establishing, we expect to be true reserves and write-offs, not a recovery. It was consistent with prior years, but we're not giving out individual levels. Juan, it's Brian. This is simply mix. Every time we produce the schedule every quarter, there's projects that come in and out. And so it's a mix change over time from the fourth quarter.

            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "Good evening. I'm pleased to report that our business has significantly improved after having addressed the impacts from COVID-19, including the restrictive governmental orders that have forced us to shut down, as well as reduce our operating capacity. Thankfully, those restrictions are now being lifted. I'm pleased to report our continued improvement in our profitability and cash flow generated for the first quarter. First quarter funds from operation was $934 million or $2.48 per share. FFO increased approximately $150 million or $0.31 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Our international operations continued to be affected by governmental closure orders and capacity restrictions. And in fact, the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $0.08 per share compared to our expectations given the closures that have occurred internationally. We also recorded additional COVID impacts in the first quarter of approximately $0.07 per share from based upon basically domestic rent abatements and uncollectible rents. We generated $875 million in cash from operations in the quarter, which was an increase of 18% compared to the prior-year period. We collected over 95% of our net billed rents for the first quarter and our in-line tenant collections are back to pre-COVID levels in the approximate 98% range. Our operating metrics in the period were as follows: mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 90.8%, down 50 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. This 50 basis point decline for the quarter is approximately 75% - 75 basis points less than the average historical seasonal decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Average base rents was $56.07, up 60 basis points year over year. Leasing spreads declined for the trailing 12 months, primarily due to the mix of deals that have fallen out, the spread calculation that have resulted in an increase to the average closing rate by approximately $8 per square foot for the trailing 12 months. Pricing continues to improve with the average opening rate per square foot for the trailing 12 months of approximately $60 per foot. And as you can see in the lease expiration schedule included in our supplemental, our expiring rents for the next few years are less than $60 per square foot. Keep in mind that the opening rate included in our spread calculation does not include any estimates for variable lease income based on sales. In certain circumstances in addressing tenant COVID negotiations last year, we, in certain cases, agreed to lower our initial base rent in exchange for lower unnatural sales breakpoints, allowing us to participate in the improved sales performance as the economy recovers. Now we think that will end up being a very smart move on our behalf. Those deals are included in the average opening rate at the lower base minimum rent and does not include our estimation of what the percentage rent could be, and we'll, obviously, believe those contributions in time will add to our cash flow. Leasing momentum has continued across our portfolio. We signed 1,100 leases for approximately 4.4 million square feet, and we have significant number of leases in our pipeline, our leasing volume in both number of leases in square feet was greater than the volume in each of the first quarter of 2020 and 2019. The improving domestic economic environment, shopper sentiment, have increased shopper foot traffic and sales across our portfolio. As I mentioned, increased in traffic for our open air and suburban centers has been very encouraging and retail sales continue to improve across the portfolio with higher sales volumes in March compared to 2019 levels. We opened West Midlands Designer Outlet, our second outlet in the United Kingdom in early April. This was behind schedule, was supposed to open in the fall of 2020 but was delayed due to COVID restrictions. We're pleased that this has now been lifted and we're now able to open and serve the shoppers. During the first quarter, we started construction of our fifth premium outlet in South Korea. We're excited about that opportunity. And hopefully by now, with respect to our brand and retailer investments, you've seen that we've been able to add significant value there. Our global brands within SPARC outperformed their plans in March and April on both sales and gross margin, led by Forever 21 and Aéropostale. For the two months combined, SPARC outperformed the sales plan by more than $135 million and our gross margin plan by more than $75 million. And we're also very pleased with the JCPenney early results. They continue to be above our plan. Our company's liquidity position at Penney is strong at $1.2 billion, and balance sheet is in very good shape with leverage of less than 1.2 times net debt to projected EBITDA. We continue to add new brands to the JCPenney portfolio, and we expect growth to be our focus going forward. Just a quick update on Taubman, we're very pleased with our partnership and the results in the first quarter. Our teams have collectively shared and implemented many best practices and are adding value to the assets. We expect to step up redevelopment plans with mixed-use opportunities throughout their TRG portfolio. Capital markets, very similar to what we always do. We're very active. We completed $1.5 billion senior note offering at 1.96%, weighted average term of 8.4 years. We also completed a EUR 750 million note, shouldn't say dollar, at one and one-eighths percent coupon at a term of 12 years. We used those proceeds to completely repay the $2 billion unsecured term facility associated with the Taubman deal, as well as pay off our $550 million senior notes. We've also refinanced six mortgages for $1.3 billion, our share of which is $589 million at an average interest rate of 3.36%. That market is continuing to improve. And at the end of the quarter, with all this activity, we have $8.4 billion of liquidity, consisting of $6.9 billion available on our credit facility; $1.5 billion of cash, including our share of JV cash. And reminder, that is net of $500 million of U.S. commercial paper outstanding at quarter end. We paid $1.30 per share in cash, in terms of our dividend on April 23. And then, finally, as you've seen, given our first-quarter results, we are increasing our full-year 2021 FFO guidance from $9.50 to $9.75 per share to $9.70 to $9.80 per. This is an increase of $0.20 per share at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the top end of the range or a 13% - or a $0.13 increase at midpoint and that represents a 6.5% to 7.6% growth rate compared to our 2020 results. So in conclusion, pleased with the results, encouraged with what we're seeing in terms of sales, traffic, retail demand. And we continue to continue to increase our performance and our Profitability. Ready for questions. Well, Rich, you can't blame us for being conservative, can you? After what we dealt with for 14 months, we did not - just a couple of things. We - the lease settlement income was kind of in our plan, one. On the other hand, we did not - when we gave our initial guidance, we did not expect the negative results that we saw in Europe, primarily of $0.08. So that hurt us by $0.08. And that's still going to underperform given the restrictions for the rest of the year because that lockdown amazingly took a lot longer and lasted a lot longer. So unfortunately, in Europe, they're still dealing with COVID. That will have an impact. And then, I would say we - as you know, in the first quarter, we did still have some abatement and some bad debt, so to speak, that also affected us of $0.07. So we still think we are - there may be some further activity in that. We don't know. It's pretty much behind us at this point. But we're conservative. We've got Europe. I think the comp NOI, we didn't give you a number, but we expect in the U.S. to do better than what we initially thought. And I hope you're right. I hope we're conservative and I hope we do better than what we've what we're guiding to, but it's just been a traumatic time for this company and our folks, and you can't blame us. Well, let's separate the two. I think when we talked about our comp, we thought we were going to be in the four-ish range, just comp, excluding Taubman. So to be clear, at least that's what our - my intent was when we had our year-end call. We expect to be a little bit above that. I mean, we still don't know. As I mentioned to you, because of COVID and some of the negotiations with retailers, we're betting a little bit more, so to speak, on the com because of the sales aspect of it. But we would hope to be around 5% on that as we look at it. And then, Taubman, we are just putting that in based on our plan. They're off to a pretty good start, and that's where you get the portfolio numbers. So the comp NOI should be in the 4% to 5%, hopefully, on the high end of that range. And then we itemized Taubman because we didn't want to confuse people. We're just going to show you those results. Then next year, 2022, we'll just have the TRG portfolio on our comps. So you'll see Taubman the rest of the year the way it's outlined. Did that help you at all? I pride myself in being a wonk. So if you're ever bored, you can call me anytime. Well, keep my fingers crossed, but we're actually seeing really good demand across the board. Very interestingly, the restaurants demand is at the very high level. We're seeing a lot of restaurateurs that for some of the fixed space that was vacated They want to come in, retrofit it, get open quicker. So we're seeing really good demand there. I think some of the strong retailers are growing their business significantly. American Eagle is a great example. Urban Outfitters is a great - another great example of two companies that just pop to mind that have We have multiple deals in the works on. We're probably 80% done, Steve, on our renewals thus far. And I'd say we generally feel pretty good and much better than we felt in a long time. And I just think the - we're seeing a resurgence in brand. So let's take a great example of a company, Crocs. Crocs was hot a decade ago. People thought it lost its mojo, maybe it had. It's now killing it. So we are seeing footwear, we're seeing apparel. We're seeing another - a lot of brands in the - that are new, that are coming into the - that want great retail real estate. So I'm seeing basically a resurgence across the board, and our team is very, very active. We're also seeing demand from entrepreneurs, local, regional. So pretty good results are coming that I think you'll start to see in the upcoming quarters. Well, again, I think we gave a rather lengthy explanation on leasing spreads. The thing I would focus on, it is mix driven. So that's the first point. The other thing is, as part of COVID, we were doing renewals, where we had lower base rents and more unnatural breakpoints, which I think hopefully, based on sales trends are going to actually - we're going to actually have made a pretty good bet on that. So I don't think you'll see that as the mix changes, and gets more stable, and that's why we pointed out the kind of - what you see expiring. I would hope for that you'd see that essentially that decrease go away with time as that goes out. So that's the first point. And then, I think, occupancy, I would think we would see improvement clearly where we were at the end of last year by the time we get back up to year-end. So I would expect a reasonable improvement on '20 versus '21. We're not going to get back to 2019 levels in '21. We look kind of more in '22, '23 level, but that's a little bit of a estimate. But the demand, frankly, I don't want to oversell it. That's not my style. But I mean, I'm - we've got - and I don't like naming names, but even though I named two already, we are just making deals with - across the board with a bunch of people. We do have some - still have some difficult relationships and negotiations that we're dealing with. And again, I won't name names, but - so to the extent it's not - the occupancy uptick is not as robust as you think, it's primarily because we've taken the tactical response that, look, we're not going to - if they're not paying what we think is fair, we'd just rather sit on empty space. And that's a judgment that I hope investors will appreciate that having done this for quite some time, we're not always going to get it right, but the fact of the matter is we're going to try and do fair deals. But to the extent that it's too one-sided, we're just - we'll sit on the space. So we still have a few of those kind of scenarios that will probably play out in '21. Thank you, Steve. Yeah, that's really in our - it's a good, really good question. It's really an art versus science. It's really a function. We don't really like to do it. But in some cases, we think the space is really good, and we'll be able to ring the bell on the lease termination income and then lease it up. And so we get the benefit of both. If I get the present value of that lease stream more or less, and then I have the space to lease, that's a pretty good business for us to do. And that's the case, that's what we saw in Q1. So we basically, in a lot of cases, took the net present - near 100% of the net present value of that lease, got the money, got the cash, then we have the space and then we'll lease it up. That's pretty good case, and that's pretty smart to do, pretty thoughtful to do. Our space isn't going anywhere. Our malls aren't going anywhere. There's still great real estate, demand is picking up. So in some cases, we'll - that's the kind of trade we'll make. We're not taking real discounts to NPV. And obviously, we are very sophisticated in running the math to see what the fair deal is. Well, I think we have built a great portfolio over a long period of time. We don't need anything to continue to run profitably and grow our earnings now after having dealt with 14, 15 months of COVID. On the other hand, if there's some - a few properties here and there that make strategic sense, we're willing able buyers of that. The sellers, they ebb and they flow, and sometimes their expectations aren't where we think they should be. Obviously, we're very active with Taubman. We think that's going to turn out to be a very good deal for everybody involved. So it's not like we haven't just done a significant transaction. And we think there's lots of upside in the portfolios we work with the Taubmans to recover from COVID. So we're - we've got our eye out. We're - we've got a great network. We can always enhance it, but we also are looking at content. And where - what do I mean by content? Well, you'll see - as we point out to the value creation in some of our content deals over this year or next, you'll see our ability to create significant value off balance sheet that I think helps us with content and what we are trying to do in terms of positioning our real estate for the future. Good. It's earnings. We got a bunch of stuff still going on. Well, we don't really go through that. But no, these are retailers that have essentially a very broad portfolio. And so they get a lot of their profitability from stores and e-commerce outside of our portfolio. So just to touch on your last one. So just a quick note on Eddie Bauer. So Eddie Bauer, we will partner with ABG to buy the IP, which we think is terrific. It's been around 100 years, celebrated 100-year anniversary, I think, last year. It was the first company to create the down jacket. And in 2019, it did $786 million of sales, and we are buying the IP at a fraction, a lot less than one times. And if you look at where brands are being priced, you will have noticed that we did - we'll do a great deal. In addition, we are buying - SPARC will buy the operating company which were partners with ABG on for essentially the working capital, and they'll operate the stores. And we think - again, they're going to add $30 million to $40 million of EBITDA to SPARC. SPARC this year projected we'll do about $130 million of EBITDA. That doesn't really come through because we have depreciation. We don't add that back for FFO and the like. But - and so SPARC is doing fantastic. Eddie Bauer, adding that to SPARC will be really beneficial, and then we're beginning to create kind of a whole outdoor apparel with the brands that we have with Nautica and so on. And then I think the IP of Eddie Bauer will be - will have growth associated with it under the ABG umbrella. Well, this is not in the SPAC. The SPAC is available to do kind of what we told the market, things outside. But this is like a core ABG, SPARC transaction that the synergies associated with folding this into SPARC doing the - following the same game plan that we've done with all the other brands we bought is essentially a no-brainer. Well, Alex, this reminds me of the - it's - if you can sense hesitation, it's because you can sense frustration. Physical shopping, unquestionably, is better for the environment than e-commerce. And we have written studies on it. We have discussed it and right now, nobody cares. It's our job to have the communities care. And I think part of why people cared less was, obviously, because of COVID and priorities were focused elsewhere. But I think it's a real focus for us in the future to explain the merits of our physical footprint and what it means for carbon footprint of physical stores vis-a-vis e-commerce, not to mention all of the energy costs, server costs, etc., packaging. You can go on and on and on about the cost associated, the carbon footprint of e-commerce compared to physical. And I will refute anyone, and I think others have tried to say that e-commerce is - has less carbon footprint. It - that just is not true. So - but we have our job to do much - reminds me, we got to get the governments to care. We got to get governments to ask. And it reminds me that I've been around enough to know that e-commerce, Internet sales, taxation, we talk, we talk, we talk. Everybody says, you're right, you're right, you're right. Nobody did anything until thankfully, the Supreme Court overturned the Quill decision to level the playing field. There is no reason, in addition to that that retail real estate should be taxed 10 times what warehouse and distribution facilities are taxed, 10 times. But hopefully, when we give our pitch to local jurisdictions, real estate assessors, government authorities and so on, they will care. We do. And - but we - I'm open to ideas on how to get the message out. The message is clear to me. Hopefully, people will care. And I'm open to ideas on how to get the message out. Thank you. Yeah, it's absolutely a very valid observation. I mean, with COVID, we shut things down, we've frankly stopped construction of certain projects in midstream. One is because we had to because governmental orders; two is we didn't necessarily see any light at the end of the tunnel when you basically have 230 properties shut down across the country. So the good news is we were able to do it. We did it without incident, we did it justly, fairly, appropriately And now we're starting back up, Michael. We're still going - we are still a little conservative on that front, primarily. We still have concerns about - we just want to make sure we're through the COVID crises that we've all had to deal with. But it is a goal of ours and a focus of ours to crank this up. Now the good news it's there, it's ready. We've rethought some projects. I think I mentioned this last time, a couple of the California projects, we had more retail than we probably will now. And we're evaluating supply and demand when it comes to other mixed-use components of it. The good news is, without question, the silver lining in surviving this very tough time for all of us, has been that it wasn't too long ago, and it's like clocks. It wasn't too long ago where Suburbia was like, forget about it, right? So to me, and I mentioned this, I don't know, two calls ago, suburbia is hot. Suburbia is the place to be. And we just happen to have a lot of great, well-located suburban real estate that we tend to take - will tend to take advantage of. And I don't think this is a short-term scenario. I think this will play out for several years. So we've got some really good stuff. And the redevelopment pipeline will pick up. And I think Our experience and knowledge and execution will clearly help. And the Taubman portfolio is a great suburban real estate more or less. And there will be great opportunities to add to that. We're already working on, as an example, they have a big development in Cherry Creek, which will end up being a major mixed-use opportunity for TRG that we're there to help the partners sort through as it develops. Well, again, it's all valid questions. I would say to you by year-end, and this is a guess, and Brian who's looking at me shaking his head, no. But I would - when you look - and we've got a couple of things in Europe that we'll probably do when you put it all together, I would say - again, the spend will be over a year plus we'll end up having a pipeline probably at about $1 billion of stuff that we'll have committed to by year-end. Again, don't hold me to that number, but that would be kind of my gut feel. Well, I think that's the big question, right? So that's why we continue to be conservative because between being cooped up, between being locked down, between the stimulus, between celebrating that we are - the country is still around, and we're still going to try to get back to normal, there's clearly some level of euphoria around that. It would be impossible for me to tell you what percent that is. But that's why we were being conservative. On the other hand, we're still seeing pockets of the country that haven't really seen that yet. Who? California is a great example, parts of the New York region. There's still no international tourism, which we would expect to see in '22. So even if it kind of like stabilizes or just kind of normalizes, there'll be other pockets that I think will pick up as the entire country reopens. I mean, let's take California versus Florida. I mean, Disney World has been open nine months. And Disneyland, I think just opened, right? So California has a nine-month lag. And we've got - we're - we've got real presence in California, as you know, that we'll see the benefits of. And then I - and don't underestimate, I do believe, assuming - and this is a global issue, but I do think people are going to start to travel again, globally, probably won't happen much until end of this year or certainly in '22. But we're going to see a pick of that - pickup of that. We might see that in Europe, just because the Chinese has stayed at home. With the Chinese coming here, we could see that here. So there are elements that will pick up the slack to the extent that the last couple of months have been really, really nice to see. Well, there's no question that most of the sophisticated retailers really want to be - I don't want to use all the buzzwords, but seamless between online and ship from store, pick up in store, all of that stuff. It's interesting, when we talk to retailers, the majority want to do that. Some like to fulfill it still in the distribution facility. So it's not uniform across the board, but they all want a seamless experience. They want to be able to offer clearly pick-up in-store or deliver from store. In a lot of cases, with shipping and delays that's much more advantageous to them. A handful would prefer to execute out of their distribution facilities. But I'd say the vast majority are moving toward seamless pick-up, ship from store, using that as so to speak, a - ability to fulfill from the physical store is a real advantage to them in terms of delivery costs and so on. So yeah, though there's a few that find it more efficient to do otherwise. So it's like everything else in retail, there's not one size fits all. But it's a good trend. And I think they need their footprint. With the connection for the retailer, lots of retailers will tell you that - not to be repetitive. But as we said and others have said, look, when they close a store and that's their store in their marketplace, they lose the e-commerce business. Or vice versa, when they open a store, their e-commerce business goes up. So they look at it in totality. I think with all the ability now to study the consumer better with all the data, we're able to do a much better job. Well, I think we've been mostly like all of our deals when we buy a retailer out of bankruptcy, we are in the stabilization mode and the capital preservation mode. We've accomplished both of those already. As I mentioned to you, in the call, we've got $1.2 billion of liquidity and undrawn ABL. So we're in good shape. We are bringing new merchandise brands to it. But importantly, some of the other brands that were nervous about us - when I say nervous, not about Simon and ABG, but nervous when you go through a bankruptcy, reestablishing those relationships and giving the vendors comfort that we're going to be around and able to pay for the goods has been really rewarding and we're seeing more and more confidence from the vendor community. So because when you go through bankruptcy, not only landlords get burned, but vendors get burned, and so it's very important for us as new owners taking Penney out of bankruptcy that we give the vendors comfort that we're going to be around to do it. Now the ultimately move toward growth is the future of what we are working on. We're not there yet. We stabilized it. We are bringing in new brands. We've got lots of ideas and what to do there. But the first goal is to rightsize the company, strengthen the financial capabilities, repairing a vendor relationships that we need to do, stabilize the morale and so on. Obviously, that's harder to do in COVID, when people are working remotely. But we've - I've been proud of the execution, and so far, the results. Our plan is above where we thought it was going to be. So that's very encouraging. But in order to turn JCPenney into a 21st century retailer, that's still work in progress. Thank you. Well, the best - I would say it depends how far you spit Craig, OK? If you play - it depends if you play baseball or not and - what do they call that when they have the - what is that? Spittoon. That's the word I'm looking for. So just to give you a sense of - the best way for us to look at it is March of 2019 to March of '21. I mean, we're way over March of '20. I mean, we are 130% above March of '20. But put that aside because that I would say to you when you put it all together in March of '21 compared to March of 2019, comparable - so same basically stores, we're like a little under - we're like minus 7%, 8%, OK? Now I think April will be ahead of - so when you look at April and March together, I think we're going to be ahead of sales for April, March of 2019, April, March '21, OK? Is that helpful? And I think that's the way to do it. So yes, I think we're - it's pitting difference. And I think we'll be ahead by - as April sales come rolling in, if you put the two months together, we'll be ahead. I think we'll end up, given the move toward the suburbs and what's happening there and away from CBDs, I actually - I mean, again, this is just a gut feel. So I actually think there'll probably be more toward mixed-use. I really do. I think it's the - it's not just SPARC brands, but it could be ABG brands. Remember, ABG owns a lot of - they have the IP for a lot of different brands. So the answer is, without question, the - it takes time, obviously, design it, manufacture it and get it in there. But I would think in '22, maybe even late '21, we'll start to see a lot of the ABG brands end up in JCPenney. Yeah, I think the short answer is without question. We've actually - they - it wasn't that they were - first of all, you can execute any program we have and still maintain a high-end mall. But put that aside, the - we just this - we just have a lot of - we have a lot of resources to bear. I mean, we've got a big field operation. We're basically in the most - all of their markets. And I think by doing local leasing, specialty leasing, sponsorship at the rate and at the level that we do, we're going to see significant upside in TRG. And in fact, we basically implemented in many cases, the existing SPG sales force for no better word to start selling our product to that portfolio. So that's actually been implemented and we're at work on it. So - and the working relationship to execute that was honestly, great and a lot easier than when I had to deal with Chelsea folks when we came in, OK? So - and I think it's been very - it's been the relationship, the coordination on leasing and development, me and Rick and the Taubmans, doing all of that stuff has been excellent. And yes, the short answer is there is upside, and we've got the - they were limited in resources, frankly, to do it, not out of neglect or out of a different point of view. I just didn't have the people, the scale to do it. Here we go. So we're ready. And we're doing things like insurance that we have more scale to there. So there's all sorts of those things that we are bringing to bear without - with open arms on both sides. So I do think that that portfolio will have a little bit higher uptick with time than probably us because we already do it and they don't. So we'll hope to see some of the benefit of that in the future. Well, I mean, obviously, that data that helps us. So I mentioned in the call for us that literally just two brands in SPARC, Forever 21 and Aéropostale, are literally $135 million over their plan already. Now their February wasn't as great. Remember, February had a lot of uptick in COVID. But - and so it's sure. I mean, it does - it's a great reference point and it does give us confidence. We're seeing similar good results in Penney. But importantly, our guys across the board talk to all sorts of retailers from luxury to moderate, to department stores. People are feeling pretty good and look at the retail stocks. I mean, the retail stocks have blown past us. I mean, I had Tom do his thing for me. We're still below our COVID - pre-COVID price yet the retailers are, in many cases, 200% higher than what they were. So the answer is, yes, we have a lot of data. We understand the consumer better than ever. But importantly, we have content now that allows us flexibility and knowledge that we didn't necessarily have before. Sure. Nothing material. We did collect deferred rent of how much, Brian? Yeah. So that didn't flow through the P&L, but it's always good to see a collection of deferred rent. So but no, not anything noteworthy at all, Mike. Thanks. I missed the question, what - Well, there's a lot. I mean, it's - there are - I hate naming names, but you've got a lot of the B2C guys that are growing their business. I mentioned to you, American Eagle is growing their business. Urban Outfitters is growing their business So we're - it's really across the board, restaurants, the luxury folks, product, Gucci, Louis Vuitton. I mean, it really is encouraging. You've got - it is really encouraging to see it not in one particular category, but across the board, Levi's, rue21, Ladderock, I mentioned Aerie, Marc Jacobs, Bottega Veneta, Saint Lauren. SPARC is growing some opportunities, and you've got - we had a Golden Goose open, Warby Parker, Craghoppers, a U.K. outerwear brand. I really miss Rick when this happens, OK? So I'm going to have Rick come in for a cameo, OK? I don't do as good a job as Rick, but - when it comes to that. But it is across the board. Sure. Well, there's clearly a lag impact, yeah, so I think that's a fair statement. I mean, look, we've run lots of numbers, when do we get past our 2019 numbers, we are certainly not going to get there this year. We're certainly not going to get there next year. Could it be '23, '24? Look, it's so dependent upon the economy and what's out there. But I think the ability to see that closer than what we thought a few months ago is there. So that's the goal. And we're - every day, we're grinding to make that happen. Well, I'll do Europe. I mean, Europe, we will see further impact in Europe, Q2 against our plan. My guess is probably in the $0.04 to $0.05 range, if I had to guess. And then, I'm hopeful we'll be on plan the rest of Q3 and Q4 as it picks up. Now to the extent that there's anything like the U.S. where there's some pent-up demand, we may see that - may see a little bit of outperformance in Q3 and Q4, but we are not anticipating that. But clearly, we're going to see in the $0.04 or $0.05 range compared to our plan and our guidance. The Europe - and then when I talk about international, it's really Japan, is the squishiest because of COVID and their caution, obviously, with the Olympics coming up. So that could be another couple of cents internationally. Well, I mean, look, I think all of the retailers were very conservative in dealing with COVID. And if these leases happen to expire during that awful shutdown and the restrictions and all of that, I mean, they closed stores, so there's going to - and like I said earlier, I mean, there's going to be a few retailers that we are not going to be able to find a happy medium with, and we may lose their entire fleet. And that's - I mean, we're ready for it. And it's - a lot of our expectations are already in those numbers. So we'll see. But yes, I think there'll be - for some of the big retailers, they've announced public store closings. I don't want to get into which that - all of that's out there of the public. But they're all thinning their fleet and the fact of the matter is if they do, they do, and we're used to leasing up space. Not really. I mean, there's always a lease here or there with 20-plus thousand leases. There's always some variability. But the reality is we - during the COVID renewals, those were difficult discussions. Everybody was under enormous pressure, and in some of those cases, like I said earlier, we reduced our base rent to bet on sales. We'll see maybe we did a better deal than what we thought we had done at that time, OK? Believe me, I prefer to have had the higher base rent. But no one is - there's no - there's very few, very focused on pandemic language, And at this point, there's no material or even meaningful trend in that language. And I would say, generally, lease terms, it depends on the retailer maybe in some cases, they're very similar to what they've been. We're very focused on lease terms. We don't willy nilly just do a deal to do a deal. And there's a lot of give and take. And I would say there's no real super trend that's going on in lease terms. There's always a give and take, but nothing of note that I think we should share at this point. Well, it is very - it's very complicated. It's very complicated because it's lease by lease, it's where they're natural or unnatural break is, it's when it hits. It's what they tell us, what we audit. And so the simple answer, Vince, as much as I'd like to tell you, we don't really guide to that. We do it in our own budgets. But we're a big company, sophisticated company, lots of ins and outs, And I think that's how we want people to think about us as opposed to what the percent rent is here versus there. It kind of ebbs and flows W.e like people to think about us a little big bit in a more broader context. Well, I mean, I'd say simply, if we end up at 2019 sales, we'd be happy. How is that? Even Tom is smiling, OK? Tom does not smile. It takes him a lot to smile. Well, look, we - I mean, frankly, Vince, we have more space. So - because we've lost space. So remember, as you know, we don't add that into our occupancy unless it's a year lease. We also like - again, we like doing business with local and regional entrepreneurs that are bootstrapping their way up to try and build the business. We've had - I mean, our most famous retailer on that is a finish line when they came in - and it's finished lines from Indianapolis. But those guys started with one store, and they grew - obviously, they were just bought by JD Sports. But I mean, we don't know who the next finish line. We did the same thing with LIDS, where they started with one or two stores. So you never know. We like that business. It also creates a uniqueness to the real estate and the local. I was actually just reviewing the book that our specialty leasing folks put together for me every quarter. The mix and the customer care that these people have with their communities is great. The product is getting better and better. So it's an important part of our business. We have more space to fill because of either bankruptcies or some of the larger folks because of COVID reducing their store counts. So we're proud of that business. We like working with entrepreneurs. We like finding the next finish line, the next LIDS. We don't know where it will be, but that's what our people try and do. And it also makes the real estate look and feel better than a vacancy. And if you walk one of our centers, I hope you feel like - obviously, there's frictional vacancy because if you're building out a store, somebody is moving in or out. But I want people to feel like it's full. The last thing you want to do is you walk down Madison Avenue, you know there's kind of a problem there, right? So when I - when they walk them all, I want them to feel like It feels good. So it's just a good, solid part of our business. I'm proud of what we do there, proud of the people that we lease to and that's a business we'll continue to foster again. Not always - doesn't always work out for the entrepreneur and for us, but it's something that we like to focus on. Thank you. Well, Eddie Bauer won't close - it will be higher, but Eddie Bauer won't close probably until two months? So it will be higher. How is that? Is that helpful? So I mean, the $260 million included our share of everything, including Penney. So we're above that now. So we're going to - hopefully. Again, retail is - does have its ebbs and flows. But we're projecting to be greater than that already without Eddie Bauer. And then, I think Eddie Bauer, once it closes, will clearly add to that. I mean, it's going to be a very good deal for SPARC there. I'm a little nervous because SPARC - my guys at SPARC have done a great job. Mark Miller, CEO; Dave Dick, CFO are thoughtful, conservative, great stewards of the brands, great partners of me and Jamie Salter of ABG. I'm just nervous because they were really excited about Eddie Bauer, and I'm like, \"You guys are never excited about anything. Now I'm nervous, OK?\" But no, we - they think it's going to be a great addition. Thank you. Yeah, I think that's to say. I don't know, Greg, what the number is off the top of my head, but it should, hopefully, it will outperform our initial budget. Nothing material. For the balance of the year, nothing material. Nothing on - nothing really in our radar. Thank you. Thanks, Greg. Thank you. Thanks for your interest and all your questions and Look forward to talking to you soon. Take care."

I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Good evening from Phipps Plaza, where we recently completed our transformation, including a new office building, a new Nobu Hotel and a Life Time resort. I'm pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year results. We generated approximately $4.5 billion in FFO in 2022 or $11.95 per share. On a comparable basis, full year FFO per share was $11.87, an increase of 3.8% year-over-year. We returned approximately $2.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and shares. And total dividends today paid since our IPO now totals approximately $39 billion. We invested approximately $1 billion, including accretive development projects and expanding our other investment platform into the growing asset and investment management businesses with our Jamestown partnership. These consistent strong results are testament to the quality of our portfolio, a relentless focus on operational and cost structure, disciplined capital allocation and our team's commitment to our shoppers and communities. Fourth quarter funds from operations were $1.27 billion or $3.40 per share. Included in the fourth quarter results was a net gain of $0.25 per share, principally from the sale of our interest in the Eddie Bauer licensing JV in exchange for additional equity ownership in Authentic Brands Group, Authentic. We now own 12% of Authentic valued at approximately $1.5 billion. Let me walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q4 of 2021. Our domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.23 of growth, driven primarily by higher rental income and with some lower operating expenses. These positive contributions were partially offset by higher interest expense of $0.03 at a $0.15 lower contribution from our other platform investments. 2021 was a great year for our retailers. However, in 2022, Forever 21 and JCPenney were affected by inflationary pressures and consumers reducing their spend. Despite not achieving the same profitability that we did in 2021, we are pleased on how we and the management teams dealt with the unanticipated external environment. Turning to domestic property NOI. We increased 5.8% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.8% for the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 6.3% for the quarter and 5.7% for the year. Occupancy for malls and outlets at the end of the fourth quarter was 94.9%, an increase of 150 basis points compared to prior year and an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. Renewals occupancy was 98.2%, and TRG was 94.5%. Average base minimum rent was $55.13 per foot, an increase of 2.3% year-over-year. For the year, we signed 4,100 leases for more than 14 million square feet. Over 2 years, we've now signed 8,000 leases for more than 29 million square feet, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline that will open for a late 2023 and 2024 openings. Reported retailer sales momentum continued. We reached another record in the fourth quarter at $753 per square foot with the malls and outlets combined, an increase of 6% year-over-year. All platforms achieved record sales levels, including the mills, it's $679 per square foot which was a 5% increase. TRG was $1,095 per square foot, an 11% increase, and our occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 12%. We opened a new development in 2022, our 10th premium outlet in Japan. Construction continues, our new outlet in Normandy, France, west of Paris. This will be our second outlet in France and our 35th international outlet. Our international outlet platform is a hidden jewel for SPG. As a frame of reference, it is bigger and much more profitable with much higher sales per square foot than another public company's portfolio. We completed 14 redevelopments, and we will complete another major redevelopment project this year at some of our most productive properties. In addition, we expect to begin construction this year on 6 to 8 mixed-use projects. All of this will be funded with our internally generated cash flow. Now turning to other platform investments in the fourth quarter, it contributed $0.23 per share in FFO compared to $0.38 in the prior year period. For the year, OPI contributed $0.64 in FFO compared to $1.07 in the prior year. We are pleased with the contribution from our OPI investments, especially given our de minimis cash investment we've made in these companies. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed refinancing on 20 property mortgages for a total of $2.3 billion at an average interest rate of 5.33%. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. Our fixed coverage ratio is 4.8x, and we ended the year with approximately $7.8 billion of liquidity. In 2022, we paid approximately $2.6 billion of common stock dividends in cash. We announced $1.80 per share this quarter, which is a 9% increase over the same period last year. The dividend is payable at the end of March -- at the end of this quarter, on March 31. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $98.57 in 2022. Moving on to '23. Our comparable FFO guidance is $11.70 to $11.95 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions: domestic property NOI growth of at least 2%; increased interest expense compared to 2022 of approximately $0.30 to $0.35 per share, reflecting current market interest rates on both fixed and variable debt assumptions; similar OPI investment contribution, FFO contribution compared to 2022; the continuing impact of the strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and the yen; no significant acquisition or disposition activity; and a diluted share count of approximately 374 million shares. To conclude, we had another excellent year, effectively navigating external headwinds that included rising interest rates, strong U.S. dollars, inflation and a somewhat softening economy. We have consistently posted industry-leading results through our hard work, innovation, great people and great assets, and we are -- continue to be excited about our plans for 2023. If you come to Atlanta, you will see what we're doing, and it's a great example of the future growth prospects of our company. And will now allow for Q&A. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Just starting with the guidance of at least 2% sort of organic growth next year, obviously, occupancy is already back to 95%. Just a little bit more color on that. How much of that is occupancy gain? How much of that is rent bumps? Just trying to get a sense of what's driving that.\nDavid Simon: Well, I think it's all the above. It's rent bumps, it's occupancy gains. We still -- and this is very important to underscore. We still have a lot of openings scheduled for the latter half of '23 and the early part of '24. So we're not going to see the full contribution of those tenants open until essentially really a run rate at '24, I'd say, sometime in '24. Now you ask why? Well, because we have a high-quality group of retailers opening in these, and it takes a while to build out their quality stores. But it's occupancy gains, it's rental -- it's spread increases. It's a reduction in our temporary tenant income because we're leasing space permanently. And it's basically assuming that -- a lot goes into this, but it's basically assuming relatively flat sales. Now if you remember last year, we said up to 2%. This year, we obviously blew past it. It was total for the domestic properties at clearly 5%, roughly 5%, 4.8%. So we're hopeful we'll do better. But again, we still have to make assumptions and that's why we like where we're at. And the biggest assumption that is somewhat of the unknown sales.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: I guess as you think about your other platform investments and some of the monetizations that you talked about with Authentic Brands, how do you sort of think about those on a go-forward basis against maybe making new investments in new retailers that may be struggling at this time?\nDavid Simon: Well, we have a unique relations, relationship with Authentic. That's a very important partnership, so to speak, both as a big shareholder, but also we're 50% owners together, 50% for us, 50% for Authentic in SPARC. And we have a different ownership structure with JCPenney. We don't really have any plans to -- for SPARC to buy additional retailers. We're very opportunistic on that. We had a very busy year last year with Reebok, where SPARC became the operating -- domestic operating partner for Reebok. More -- a very complicated deal. As you remember, we've had -- depressed earnings. We mentioned that to you early last year, that it did depress earnings because we had -- we knew we had some losses to occur this year. So hopefully, we'll be past that this year. But we really don't have any plans to acquire anything. If we do, it will be opportunistically. And just to -- we really -- we've done our -- most of our work has been with -- on the bankruptcy front or where somebody wanted to unload a business. And -- but generally, there's not a lot of distress in retail right now. I'm not saying it won't develop in the year. But there are some brands out there that are in trouble that obviously people know about. But we don't see playing in any of those situations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: Can we get a more granular update on Phipps Plaza? The repositioning has been open for, I'd say most, or at least part of 4Q. So I guess how is it tracking versus plan? What changes in traffic are you seeing? Or any notable change of in-line rents? Any dates would be appreciated. And then I guess lastly, the project seems to have increased your plan for accelerating some other mixed-use endeavors, I guess, with Jamestown, any more information would be helpful.\nDavid Simon: Yes. So it really just opened. So the hotel opened at the end of October, November, but it's really new. The office -- literally, the first tenant just moved in January, mid-January. We just did a tour of that. We still have a lot of lease up. Just to give you a rough number, pre-investment, Phipps stood in the low 20s of NOI. We think it will be stabilized close to 60. And we'll have invested around $350 million in it over that period of time. So again, we don't -- we're a big company. We don't really get into like granular detail, but we basically increased the NOI by about $35 million. Remember, this was a Belk department store. So in the Belk department store, we couldn't lease up that wing. We now have a plaza that has been created external. We announced Hermès opening into the Plaza and part of the wing that really was difficult to lease with Belk as the anchor. We have an unbelievable Life Time resort. If you haven't seen what they build or their product, both with Life Time Work, the pool and the restaurants and the services and the salon and, obviously, all the fitness activities, I'd encourage you to do so. And we have a Class A plus office, the best in Buckhead that just opened. So again, low 20, 60, $350 million investment is the math. Now again, we're doing -- and you mentioned Jamestown. Jamestown investment is in the investment and asset management business. So these mixed-use developments that I mentioned in my call text, the 6 to 8, we're doing all of those with -- by ourselves or with partners that we've used before. So that really isn't with Jamestown. Again, we looked at the Jamestown relationship, future endeavors that we can do together or in partnership, but we're very active in building out our platform now. And Seattle as an example, we're about to start a residence in a hotel, which finally got approved, and that's going to start construction. We can go through the list. But all that, Simon Property Group owned just like Phipps, which we own 100% of. Nobu, we own, obviously. The Life Time it was a lease and then the office building we own, too, which is all 100% owned asset. So I don't want you to confuse those 2. But that's the rough math on Phipps. And then the true lease up of Phipps, again, which goes back to the -- my earlier comment on the NOI. The true lease-up effects because you have -- you see Malone and some of the high-end brands building out their stores, it's not a 3-month build. It's, in many cases, 9 months to a year. The true offering that Phipps will have will really show in '24 when all of these retailers open the stores. So Christian Louboutin, Hermès and AKRIS and on and on. But most of those will either open late '23 or '24, and that's when Phipps really will be finished. These things don't just -- you don't just flip a switch and it opens. So that gives you a sense of it. And we think the true pro forma of this will ultimately manifest itself in year '25 or even in '26.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So a question on the retailer brand portfolio and your equity stake in Authentic Brands. You guys have a headwind -- sorry, not a headwind. You guys have a fluctuating contribution from the retailers just based on their actual sales, right? Because it's not rents, it's based on sales. Yet I'm assuming you get some sort of recurring cash flow from the intellectual property that you own in Authentic Brands, managing the brands and all that. So I'm just trying to understand, as you guys sell more of the brand equity and exchange it for a bigger stake of Authentic Brands, how does your income mix switch from being solely sales-dependent to being more consistent, whether it's managing or other sorts of more regular fee income versus volatility from however many jeans or shorts are sold in a given quarter?\nDavid Simon: All right. You're introducing -- I'll take you through a tutorial because I like you, Alex, so here we go. SPARC operates the domestic business of the brands Lucky, Aéropostale, Forever 21, [Eddie Bauer], okay, Brooks Brothers, et cetera. It license the brands from Authentic and it pays a royalty fee to Authentic, and then we, and our partner, Authentic, and it pays rent to landlords, including Simon that will pay rent to -- Forever 21 could be in a Vornado property. In fact, it is in Times Square pays rent to Steve Roth and Vornado. And that business has operating profit. And we share in that 50-50 with Authentic. So we actually, now that we converted and exchanged our license, that we own together. Now we have historically done the license business on a JV basis. We've decided over time to exchange that into stock of Authentic. And that's why we were not a shareholder in Authentic, but eventually it become a 12% shareholder in Authentic through the exchange of our interest in the JV license business, for stock into Authentic. Authentic is a big company. It does $1 billion of revenue, close thereabouts. But it owns the license of many, many brands beyond SPARC. It owns its partnership with David Beckham and its partnership with Shaquille, Elvis Presley, Juicy Couture and on down the list. You can Google it, it will give you all the names, so. But SPARC is essentially the retail operating company. So when you think of SPARC, you should think of it similar to any other retailer like American Eagle or anybody else that operates stores, operate e-commerce, et cetera, it does wholesale. The only difference it pays a royalty to Authentic. It does not pay a royalty to Simon Property Group. So the only vagaries that Simon Property Group has is, in fact, what the operating profits of SPARC are. And in the case of '21 versus '22, the big difference was essentially Forever 21 because that teenage consumer obviously cut back with the rapid increase in gas prices and inflation and the uncertain economic environment. So I know we're not allowed, but can we let Alex -- I'm asking Tom Ward, who's the police of the call, can we ask Alex if he understands this? Okay, Alex. do you understand it? Was I perfectly clear?\nAlexander Goldfarb: So if I take away what you're saying, SPG lives really on the retail sales and performance, your 12% stake in AB doesn't generate any fees to you? So again, the focus is really the earnings derived purely from sales, there's not any sort of recurring.\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, it's more than -- sure, sales are important, but there's gross margin. They also sell wholesale, okay? So Brooks Brothers does have wholesale accounts. So it's more -- but it generates EBITDA basically through running the business, which includes stores, e-commerce, wholesale, and certain other ventures. Authentic, because we equity account, they're a very profitable company with high gross margins. It's an asset-light company, essentially. We take our share of earnings from them, net income because they are a taxpayer, et cetera. But together, all of those businesses, SPARC, RGG, which is our partnership with Michael Rubin, who owns Fanatics, and Authentic, all of that rolls through OPI. And OPI contributed $0.64 out of $11.87. So it's in that range, to give you a sense. So $0.64 out of $11.85. So -- but that -- hopefully, that helps explain it. Lastly, you got it?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street.\nVince Tibone: Could you provide some color on leasing economics and how those are trending in the current macro environment? Just given current NOI guidance is about 2%, which is lower than average contractual bumps and there should be some occupancy upside, this just seems to imply leasing economics aren't great. But I know it's contrary to what you said on recent calls. So can you just help me better understand kind of the dynamics at play here with guidance and maybe where leasing economics are right now?\nDavid Simon: Yes. Look, I would say we have positive spreads across the portfolio in renewals and in new leases versus existing leases for new fixed. And again, we also had operating spend increase because we're not immune to security cost increases, housekeeping, all of that normal operating expenses. To some extent, our fixed and bumps don't cover that. We're also projecting flat sales. Obviously, to the extent that sales outperformed that, we'll outperform as well. And we have these cases when we're adding great retailers and great restaurants to our portfolio, we have to take out the tenant that was, in many cases, temporary, you have to take that out. And you basically have 9 months of downtime where you have no income for it. Now like we did last time, Vince, we said up to 2%. We did 4.8%. I'm hoping to do better. But those are basically the determinants. And that's why we said better than 2%. But we have some operating expense increases, real estate taxes, unbelievably continue even though we're the goose that continues to lay the golden eggs for all of the communities in which we operate, our taxes continue to go up. While we have operating expenses that go up with inflationary pressures, we had downtime. We had flat sales, and we lose temporary income while we're retending and going to physical, whether we're going to permanent income. All of that's great news, but our rent spreads are positive. Renewals are positive. And we -- and that's been the difference. And obviously, we'll throw COVID out. But even the trend prior to COVID, renewals were under customers, you know, Vince. And demand continues to be very good.\nVince Tibone: Just one follow-up. Like is variable lease income -- do you expect that to continue to trend down just as you unwind maybe some COVID lease modifications? Or how should we think about that part of the puzzle to going forward?\nDavid Simon: We have budgeted it basically down slightly because, number one is the extent that a tenant renews the lease, we're getting some of that overage into the base rent. If you remember out of bankruptcy, Forever 21 pays basically percentage rent to all of its landlords, us included. It had a tough year last year, as I mentioned earlier. And we're budgeting basically flat this year. So there's a lot that goes on that kind of -- you've got to again separate between overage and percent rent. It's a little bit of a crystal ball. There are always retailers that do well, some that slow down. We're pretty good at anticipating who's going to be great, who's not. But we're not the ones -- other than Forever 21, we're not the ones putting the stuff in the stores itself, okay? Forever 21, you can blame it on us, okay? So I hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi.\nCraig Mailman: David, just you had mentioned Forever 21, JCPenney's managed some inflationary headwinds in their business. I'm just kind of curious, with your purview through SPARC and other investments, just how you think the retailers, that your investors and maybe other tenants that people have concerns about or talked about in the news, are positioned heading into '23 from a gross margin management perspective and just balance sheet. And how much risk you see in this current environment versus maybe the kind of the headline fees that are in the market.\nDavid Simon: Right now, we feel really good about our retailers. I think they were very focused on entering '23 with good, clean inventories. We feel like most of them have managed that. I asked my leasing folks all the time any pullback on demand. It's not really happened. So we feel good about that. Demand continues to be generally very strong. And I think they really -- because of the bounce back out of COVID really got the benefit of kind of getting their house in order. So I think on the credit side, we're feeling very comfortable, right, Brian? Yes?\nBrian McDade: Yes. Watch list has been lower in years. The tenant community rebuilt its financial position during COVID and is coming out of it in a much better place.\nDavid Simon: So nothing yet. Obviously, you've got a couple of big names out there, but we really have very little exposure to them. And in some cases, we'd like most of them are boxed and also in strip centers. So the ones that were -- that we have and we like the box at, we think we can do something better with them. So I'd say generally, knock on wood, I think credit side is pretty good and demand is good. And they ran -- they -- December was very spotty for a lot of retailers. On the other hand, after Christmas, most had a really good January. And again, I think the mistake we made, Simon Property Group made is that -- again, SPARC was profitable even with -- even though even it didn't meet the financial results of what -- and again, we shouldn't dwell on this too much because again, $0.64 out of $11.87, $0.64 out of $11.87. But it's important just so we'll do a little vehicle, but we made the mistake that thinking '21 -- we budgeted basically flat to '21. And '21 was for a couple of the brands there, just extraordinarily profitable. We made some tactical mistakes in Forever 21. We brought in a new CEO to rectify those mistakes. She's doing a terrific job. So we're very pleased there. We also are very pleased with JCPenney. It's unbelievably profitable EBITDA. You can see the EBITDA. There are some public filings out there. But it is -- it didn't have the '21 year of '21, but we're very pleased at where that company is positioned. And we're extremely pleased with the management team and all that they're doing to reinvigorate the brand. That means so much to that consumer in those communities. And we're taking a different tack than others that have managed or owned that brand. We're actually reinvesting in that company to make it very important for those communities. So very pleased with how we're positioning Penney. But it had EBITDA -- I don't know if I can disclose it, but it had a lot of EBITDA, okay? So and our partner, Brookfield, we'll let Brookfield take -- we'll let Brookfield announce it if they do their -- I'm kidding. But it was very profitable from an EBITDA point of view. So we're very pleased there with the brands. But we did make the mistake of thinking '21 would repeat. And then obviously, you had a lot of volatility from a macro point in '22 with huge increases in interest rates, huge increase in price, in food and energy cost that the consumer was whipsawed, and we felt the impact of it. It's stabilized now, we believe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.\nCraig Schmidt: Given the China reopening, I wonder if you could outline how these visitors would impact your coastal premium outlets and your dominant coastal malls.\nDavid Simon: Well, I think we haven't seen the benefit. But just walking we -- I mean I don't want to get into the kind of the geopolitics of what's going on. But we're -- we think there's a real benefit to our landmark assets that have always been shopped by the Chinese consumer or the Asian consumer. We're starting to see that a little bit, but we're not planning for that to really accelerate in '23 but we're hopeful that it will.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Floris Gerbrand Dijkum with Compass Point.\nFloris Gerbrand Dijkum: David, you had talked last quarter, actually, in response to a question I asked about recovering back to 2019 levels of same-property NOI, which we reckon to be about $6.2 billion. But obviously, that includes -- that does not include some of your retailer investments. But depending on how you slice it, I'm just trying to do the math here, but you're at least $200 million short, even if you include those retailer investments. If you can walk us through -- that would imply that you would get to around 3.7% NOI growth to get back to those levels. So you're clearly not guiding to that yet. You're guiding to 2%. But what are the headwinds, if you will?\nDavid Simon: Floris, I think you can -- you really should just focus on domestic. To put the retailers in there, there's too much volatility. It's not something we look to -- we're focused on are domestic property NOI to get back to 2019 numbers before we were shut down by the pandemic. The short answer is we will get there on a run rate by the end of this year. That's the short answer. And you shouldn't put the retailer NOI in there. It's, again, that's -- you've got to remember, we have basically no cash investment in SPARC. So -- and I know we could talk about it all day, but it's -- when you think about Simon Property Group, we want you to think about those investments as it gets with purchase, okay? We get this great property company that owns all those real estate that's redeveloping it, great balance sheet, the ability to make smart investments with an unbelievable return on investment outside its core business. And that's what you get with a seasoned team that's experienced from recession to credit prices to a shutdown in a pandemic, okay? And we managed it through it all. So the bottom line is our domestic property NOI, because of the delay in some of these openings, we will get back on a same property basis. Because remember, the other thing for us, we have properties in and out. So you can't go back in '19, the portfolio is different. But if you do the same portfolio that we own today versus the same portfolio that we own in '19, possible we'll be there by the end of this year, okay?\nFloris Gerbrand Dijkum: And that would -- and David, that includes -- the $6.2 billion was included your stake in Taubman as well. But I'm just curious because...\nDavid Simon: No. We're not including Taubman in it. This is just the domestic property NOI. So we're not even including our international NOI. So what we can give you the mill, if you combine the mills, outlets and malls, domestic portfolio that we owned in '19 and that we still own in '22, we will get there on a run rate by the end of this year. As simple as that we're not that far off, but we have delayed openings. And depending on where sales come in, it's even possible we make it this year. And that's the way to look at it. And that's the only way to look at it, really.\nFloris Gerbrand Dijkum: I don't disagree. If I can -- the S&L pipeline, has that changed from the last quarter as well? You mentioned some of your spaces opening later in '23 and then '24, obviously, that has the potential to impact your NOI growth going forward by 5% to 7% depending on the rent that you signed, plus your fixed rent bumps. The math that we have suggests that 2% is -- it's the extreme low side of what's probably going to happen over the next 2 to 3 years.\nDavid Simon: Yes. I mean certainly, if you look at it over that period of time, call to way outperform -- and again, I just go back to last year. We try to be as thoughtful in doing this, but there are variabilities to it, overage rent being the biggest. But we also have some certain inflationary pressures that we, as landlords and property owners, have to deal with, what I mentioned earlier. And again, you have downtime. But we -- I would hope that we would beat our number just like we did last year. And just like we have historically.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: In the past, you've talked about 80% of the NOI being generated by the top 50% of the properties. Does this remain true? And can you talk about the demand trends and pricing power that you have in the top half of the portfolio relative to the bottom half?\nDavid Simon: Well, I don't -- anybody has the percent...\nBrian McDade: Yes. Michael, that's the whole group. Our top 100 assets generate roughly 80% of our domestic NOI.\nDavid Simon: Yes. So it's more than 50%.\nBrian McDade: It's more than 50%.\nDavid Simon: It's more than 50%. So I'd say demand across the board is good. Obviously, the higher end property probably has more demand. And -- but we're generally -- our leases still, to this day, occupancy cost is low and our rent spreads across the board are generally positive regardless of the sales front.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Just a quick one. For your platform investment FFO forecast, are you expecting any significant nonrecurring costs like you had in the 2022 results?\nDavid Simon: No. That's a good question and the answer is no. We're not.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: I was hoping maybe you could share some thoughts on deploying capital in the current macro. We noticed you didn't buy back any stock in the fourth quarter. So I guess I'm curious what your level of interest and stock buybacks is here today. And second, I know you mentioned that there's no sizable acquisitions or dispositions in the guide. But I'm curious what your view of the transaction market for malls is, at least today. Clearly, things are still a bit stalled across the board, but there have been a few trades in California the last couple of months. So curious what you think of those trades and if there are any pricing read-throughs.\nDavid Simon: Well, I think we're generally pleased that we're seeing some activity in our sector. And it's great that there's others out there that are -- real estate industries that are trying to grow externally. As an example, what was today that was announced. It's good to see we're not the only ones that like to make things happen externally. So that's good. I think our strategy has been essentially confirmed by others, other players in our industry where size and economies of scale see the benefits. So it's always good to see. We saw it in the warehousing world, and we saw it in the -- now we might see in the storage world. So it's great that we see that. From a stock buyback, I think our dividend is really where we're focused growing that. One of the thing I mentioned, hopefully, in my conference text that you heard was we paid out $39 billion in dividends, staggering number when you put it in perspective. That does not include any stock buyback, that's just pure dividends. I'd say that's the, obviously, the focus. But if the stock comes under pressure, we still have the ability to deal with that. So that is in our arsenal. We got a lot of mixed-use properties. I'd say generally, relatively quiet on the acquisition front. We did create our partnership with Jamestown, which we're focused on this year and, obviously, the years to come to grow that relationship. But we've got a lot going on and the capital to continue to create external opportunities. And we've been -- we haven't batted 1,000, but we've certainly moved the needle profitably with our investments and creating unbelievable return on investment, both in the real estate -- still one of the best deals ever done in real estate was our deal on premium outlets, which I'm happy to walk through the math not today. But still one of the best multiple deals ever been in our industry. And at that time, we were widely criticized for it. But one of the best deals done in the public company space.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. And I appreciate that. But it sounds like at a high level, not putting words in your mouth, that the focus of your capital investing today is going to be more the redev, less the stock buybacks, less the acquisitions. Question, just a follow-up maybe on the FFO guide itself. I appreciate some of the headwinds, the unknowns, the OpEx, the interest expense, et cetera, but I'm trying to get a sense of what else might be limiting the FFO growth this year, which is basically flat year-over-year versus the 2%, at least.\nDavid Simon: Yes, it's really simple. It's interest rate. We're losing roughly $0.30 to $0.35 per share just from either floating rate debt that's now higher or our own assumptions of what our refinancing costs are going to be. The good news is we're refinancing all of our debt. The market is there. but the cost of debt is higher. So that's really if you cut through it all, that's -- and when you look at kind of where the market was, very few analysts updated their numbers at all for higher interest rates. But they -- I don't have to tell you they ballooned over the last 12 months.\nHaendel St. Juste: No, I appreciate that. I wanted to get a bit of clarity, though, perhaps on bad debt. How are you thinking about that this year within the guide, FX headwinds, maybe at least?\nDavid Simon: Yes. I think we got to open it up a little higher. We have a little higher bad debt expense budgeted this year than last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping for a little color on expected CapEx spend just in general for maintenance and then the development spend that we should be budgeting, and what kind of returns or NOI contributions we should be thinking about on the dev readouts stopped -- that would flow through into '23 as we model.\nDavid Simon: I will look at our 8-K because the development spend will add to that. But obviously, when you start a real estate project, it's over a, 2-year sometimes 3-year process. So all that's disclosed in the 8-K. And the CapEx, including TA, will probably be roughly with what it was '22, if not a little bit less, okay?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: Regarding the large number of stores opening in late '23 and early '24, what's that expected NOI contribution in GLA, which you attributed to these leases that are signed but not yet been paying?\nDavid Simon: At least $100 million.\nGreg McGinniss: On NOI or -- I guess NOI. Okay. And then is there any contribution expectation from the Jamestown investment? And then if you could talk about like Klépierre that's built into guidance as well. That would be appreciated.\nDavid Simon: That all in Jamestown is accretive, but it wasn't a big investment. So -- and so it's in our budget, but it's not really -- the relationship is material, but the financial impact is not material. So that's one. Klépierre, we -- it is consistent with their guidance that they'll be developing when they announced their earnings this -- in the next couple of weeks.\nBrian McDade: There is some FX headwind still baked in there, Greg, [indiscernible] dollars.\nDavid Simon: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: Hope to have a quick one here. So when I look at your 2023 lease expirations, your portfolio still has about 10.5% expiring, which hasn't really budged in the past couple of quarters. I remember from the last call, you said these things can take time, especially with larger national accounts. So I was just curious if you can share an update and how we should mentally think about a realistic set of outcomes here.\nDavid Simon: Well, it's -- listen, we're negotiating for the benefit of our shareholders. They're negotiating for the benefit of their shareholders. And a lot of these things we have, what I'll say, handshakes and it's the process of being [tapered]. So you should feel good that there's no smoking gun. There's nothing there that's going to lead to a fall out. It's just a process. And renewals are going We're, in fact, ahead of our '23 renewals now compared to where we were last year, some of the '22s -- and in some cases, because '22 took so long, we're doing '23s, so together and it's a process. But it's going well and relationships are progressing appropriately.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And just one quick one. Where should we expect your portfolio occupancy to end up by end of this year?\nDavid Simon: '23, slightly up, slightly up. I don't have the number but Brian will have it for you later. Okay, last one, I guess. We're over 6:00, but we have one more question and one to finish the Q&A.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: On the guidance, the range you provided based on comparable FFO per share in the coming quarters when you have a better sense of mark-to-market gains or losses, will you also show guidance for estimated diluted per share for the full year like you did in prior quarters?\nDavid Simon: Yes. Last -- you mean our mark-to-market equity investments?\nLinda Tsai: Yes.\nDavid Simon: Yes, sure. I mean we outlined it. We separate it. We'll do comparable and real numbers. So you'll see both. Hopefully, it will only be up. But last year, we did take a reported FFO. You have the number? What was it?\nTom Ward: $0.08.\nDavid Simon: $0.08. But we'll outline those for you, Linda so, you'll see them both.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to David Simon for closing remarks.\nDavid Simon: Thank you. And again, I'm sure there are a lot more detailed questions. Please call Brian and Tom, and we'll be happy to walk you through more details. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Good evening from Phipps Plaza, where we recently completed our transformation, including a new office building, a new Nobu Hotel and a Life Time resort. I'm pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year results. We generated approximately $4.5 billion in FFO in 2022 or $11.95 per share. On a comparable basis, full year FFO per share was $11.87, an increase of 3.8% year-over-year. We returned approximately $2.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and shares. And total dividends today paid since our IPO now totals approximately $39 billion. We invested approximately $1 billion, including accretive development projects and expanding our other investment platform into the growing asset and investment management businesses with our Jamestown partnership. These consistent strong results are testament to the quality of our portfolio, a relentless focus on operational and cost structure, disciplined capital allocation and our team's commitment to our shoppers and communities. Fourth quarter funds from operations were $1.27 billion or $3.40 per share. Included in the fourth quarter results was a net gain of $0.25 per share, principally from the sale of our interest in the Eddie Bauer licensing JV in exchange for additional equity ownership in Authentic Brands Group, Authentic. We now own 12% of Authentic valued at approximately $1.5 billion. Let me walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q4 of 2021. Our domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.23 of growth, driven primarily by higher rental income and with some lower operating expenses. These positive contributions were partially offset by higher interest expense of $0.03 at a $0.15 lower contribution from our other platform investments. 2021 was a great year for our retailers. However, in 2022, Forever 21 and JCPenney were affected by inflationary pressures and consumers reducing their spend. Despite not achieving the same profitability that we did in 2021, we are pleased on how we and the management teams dealt with the unanticipated external environment. Turning to domestic property NOI. We increased 5.8% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.8% for the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 6.3% for the quarter and 5.7% for the year. Occupancy for malls and outlets at the end of the fourth quarter was 94.9%, an increase of 150 basis points compared to prior year and an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. Renewals occupancy was 98.2%, and TRG was 94.5%. Average base minimum rent was $55.13 per foot, an increase of 2.3% year-over-year. For the year, we signed 4,100 leases for more than 14 million square feet. Over 2 years, we've now signed 8,000 leases for more than 29 million square feet, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline that will open for a late 2023 and 2024 openings. Reported retailer sales momentum continued. We reached another record in the fourth quarter at $753 per square foot with the malls and outlets combined, an increase of 6% year-over-year. All platforms achieved record sales levels, including the mills, it's $679 per square foot which was a 5% increase. TRG was $1,095 per square foot, an 11% increase, and our occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter was 12%. We opened a new development in 2022, our 10th premium outlet in Japan. Construction continues, our new outlet in Normandy, France, west of Paris. This will be our second outlet in France and our 35th international outlet. Our international outlet platform is a hidden jewel for SPG. As a frame of reference, it is bigger and much more profitable with much higher sales per square foot than another public company's portfolio. We completed 14 redevelopments, and we will complete another major redevelopment project this year at some of our most productive properties. In addition, we expect to begin construction this year on 6 to 8 mixed-use projects. All of this will be funded with our internally generated cash flow. Now turning to other platform investments in the fourth quarter, it contributed $0.23 per share in FFO compared to $0.38 in the prior year period. For the year, OPI contributed $0.64 in FFO compared to $1.07 in the prior year. We are pleased with the contribution from our OPI investments, especially given our de minimis cash investment we've made in these companies. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed refinancing on 20 property mortgages for a total of $2.3 billion at an average interest rate of 5.33%. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. Our fixed coverage ratio is 4.8x, and we ended the year with approximately $7.8 billion of liquidity. In 2022, we paid approximately $2.6 billion of common stock dividends in cash. We announced $1.80 per share this quarter, which is a 9% increase over the same period last year. The dividend is payable at the end of March -- at the end of this quarter, on March 31. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $98.57 in 2022. Moving on to '23. Our comparable FFO guidance is $11.70 to $11.95 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions: domestic property NOI growth of at least 2%; increased interest expense compared to 2022 of approximately $0.30 to $0.35 per share, reflecting current market interest rates on both fixed and variable debt assumptions; similar OPI investment contribution, FFO contribution compared to 2022; the continuing impact of the strong U.S. dollar versus the euro and the yen; no significant acquisition or disposition activity; and a diluted share count of approximately 374 million shares. To conclude, we had another excellent year, effectively navigating external headwinds that included rising interest rates, strong U.S. dollars, inflation and a somewhat softening economy. We have consistently posted industry-leading results through our hard work, innovation, great people and great assets, and we are -- continue to be excited about our plans for 2023. If you come to Atlanta, you will see what we're doing, and it's a great example of the future growth prospects of our company. And will now allow for Q&A. Thank you. Well, I think it's all the above. It's rent bumps, it's occupancy gains. We still -- and this is very important to underscore. We still have a lot of openings scheduled for the latter half of '23 and the early part of '24. So we're not going to see the full contribution of those tenants open until essentially really a run rate at '24, I'd say, sometime in '24. Now you ask why? Well, because we have a high-quality group of retailers opening in these, and it takes a while to build out their quality stores. But it's occupancy gains, it's rental -- it's spread increases. It's a reduction in our temporary tenant income because we're leasing space permanently. And it's basically assuming that -- a lot goes into this, but it's basically assuming relatively flat sales. Now if you remember last year, we said up to 2%. This year, we obviously blew past it. It was total for the domestic properties at clearly 5%, roughly 5%, 4.8%. So we're hopeful we'll do better. But again, we still have to make assumptions and that's why we like where we're at. And the biggest assumption that is somewhat of the unknown sales. Well, we have a unique relations, relationship with Authentic. That's a very important partnership, so to speak, both as a big shareholder, but also we're 50% owners together, 50% for us, 50% for Authentic in SPARC. And we have a different ownership structure with JCPenney. We don't really have any plans to -- for SPARC to buy additional retailers. We're very opportunistic on that. We had a very busy year last year with Reebok, where SPARC became the operating -- domestic operating partner for Reebok. More -- a very complicated deal. As you remember, we've had -- depressed earnings. We mentioned that to you early last year, that it did depress earnings because we had -- we knew we had some losses to occur this year. So hopefully, we'll be past that this year. But we really don't have any plans to acquire anything. If we do, it will be opportunistically. And just to -- we really -- we've done our -- most of our work has been with -- on the bankruptcy front or where somebody wanted to unload a business. And -- but generally, there's not a lot of distress in retail right now. I'm not saying it won't develop in the year. But there are some brands out there that are in trouble that obviously people know about. But we don't see playing in any of those situations. Yes. So it really just opened. So the hotel opened at the end of October, November, but it's really new. The office -- literally, the first tenant just moved in January, mid-January. We just did a tour of that. We still have a lot of lease up. Just to give you a rough number, pre-investment, Phipps stood in the low 20s of NOI. We think it will be stabilized close to 60. And we'll have invested around $350 million in it over that period of time. So again, we don't -- we're a big company. We don't really get into like granular detail, but we basically increased the NOI by about $35 million. Remember, this was a Belk department store. So in the Belk department store, we couldn't lease up that wing. We now have a plaza that has been created external. We announced Hermès opening into the Plaza and part of the wing that really was difficult to lease with Belk as the anchor. We have an unbelievable Life Time resort. If you haven't seen what they build or their product, both with Life Time Work, the pool and the restaurants and the services and the salon and, obviously, all the fitness activities, I'd encourage you to do so. And we have a Class A plus office, the best in Buckhead that just opened. So again, low 20, 60, $350 million investment is the math. Now again, we're doing -- and you mentioned Jamestown. Jamestown investment is in the investment and asset management business. So these mixed-use developments that I mentioned in my call text, the 6 to 8, we're doing all of those with -- by ourselves or with partners that we've used before. So that really isn't with Jamestown. Again, we looked at the Jamestown relationship, future endeavors that we can do together or in partnership, but we're very active in building out our platform now. And Seattle as an example, we're about to start a residence in a hotel, which finally got approved, and that's going to start construction. We can go through the list. But all that, Simon Property Group owned just like Phipps, which we own 100% of. Nobu, we own, obviously. The Life Time it was a lease and then the office building we own, too, which is all 100% owned asset. So I don't want you to confuse those 2. But that's the rough math on Phipps. And then the true lease up of Phipps, again, which goes back to the -- my earlier comment on the NOI. The true lease-up effects because you have -- you see Malone and some of the high-end brands building out their stores, it's not a 3-month build. It's, in many cases, 9 months to a year. The true offering that Phipps will have will really show in '24 when all of these retailers open the stores. So Christian Louboutin, Hermès and AKRIS and on and on. But most of those will either open late '23 or '24, and that's when Phipps really will be finished. These things don't just -- you don't just flip a switch and it opens. So that gives you a sense of it. And we think the true pro forma of this will ultimately manifest itself in year '25 or even in '26. All right. You're introducing -- I'll take you through a tutorial because I like you, Alex, so here we go. SPARC operates the domestic business of the brands Lucky, Aéropostale, Forever 21, [Eddie Bauer], okay, Brooks Brothers, et cetera. It license the brands from Authentic and it pays a royalty fee to Authentic, and then we, and our partner, Authentic, and it pays rent to landlords, including Simon that will pay rent to -- Forever 21 could be in a Vornado property. In fact, it is in Times Square pays rent to Steve Roth and Vornado. And that business has operating profit. And we share in that 50-50 with Authentic. So we actually, now that we converted and exchanged our license, that we own together. Now we have historically done the license business on a JV basis. We've decided over time to exchange that into stock of Authentic. And that's why we were not a shareholder in Authentic, but eventually it become a 12% shareholder in Authentic through the exchange of our interest in the JV license business, for stock into Authentic. Authentic is a big company. It does $1 billion of revenue, close thereabouts. But it owns the license of many, many brands beyond SPARC. It owns its partnership with David Beckham and its partnership with Shaquille, Elvis Presley, Juicy Couture and on down the list. You can Google it, it will give you all the names, so. But SPARC is essentially the retail operating company. So when you think of SPARC, you should think of it similar to any other retailer like American Eagle or anybody else that operates stores, operate e-commerce, et cetera, it does wholesale. The only difference it pays a royalty to Authentic. It does not pay a royalty to Simon Property Group. So the only vagaries that Simon Property Group has is, in fact, what the operating profits of SPARC are. And in the case of '21 versus '22, the big difference was essentially Forever 21 because that teenage consumer obviously cut back with the rapid increase in gas prices and inflation and the uncertain economic environment. So I know we're not allowed, but can we let Alex -- I'm asking Tom Ward, who's the police of the call, can we ask Alex if he understands this? Okay, Alex. do you understand it? Was I perfectly clear? Well, I mean, it's more than -- sure, sales are important, but there's gross margin. They also sell wholesale, okay? So Brooks Brothers does have wholesale accounts. So it's more -- but it generates EBITDA basically through running the business, which includes stores, e-commerce, wholesale, and certain other ventures. Authentic, because we equity account, they're a very profitable company with high gross margins. It's an asset-light company, essentially. We take our share of earnings from them, net income because they are a taxpayer, et cetera. But together, all of those businesses, SPARC, RGG, which is our partnership with Michael Rubin, who owns Fanatics, and Authentic, all of that rolls through OPI. And OPI contributed $0.64 out of $11.87. So it's in that range, to give you a sense. So $0.64 out of $11.85. So -- but that -- hopefully, that helps explain it. Lastly, you got it? Yes. Look, I would say we have positive spreads across the portfolio in renewals and in new leases versus existing leases for new fixed. And again, we also had operating spend increase because we're not immune to security cost increases, housekeeping, all of that normal operating expenses. To some extent, our fixed and bumps don't cover that. We're also projecting flat sales. Obviously, to the extent that sales outperformed that, we'll outperform as well. And we have these cases when we're adding great retailers and great restaurants to our portfolio, we have to take out the tenant that was, in many cases, temporary, you have to take that out. And you basically have 9 months of downtime where you have no income for it. Now like we did last time, Vince, we said up to 2%. We did 4.8%. I'm hoping to do better. But those are basically the determinants. And that's why we said better than 2%. But we have some operating expense increases, real estate taxes, unbelievably continue even though we're the goose that continues to lay the golden eggs for all of the communities in which we operate, our taxes continue to go up. While we have operating expenses that go up with inflationary pressures, we had downtime. We had flat sales, and we lose temporary income while we're retending and going to physical, whether we're going to permanent income. All of that's great news, but our rent spreads are positive. Renewals are positive. And we -- and that's been the difference. And obviously, we'll throw COVID out. But even the trend prior to COVID, renewals were under customers, you know, Vince. And demand continues to be very good. We have budgeted it basically down slightly because, number one is the extent that a tenant renews the lease, we're getting some of that overage into the base rent. If you remember out of bankruptcy, Forever 21 pays basically percentage rent to all of its landlords, us included. It had a tough year last year, as I mentioned earlier. And we're budgeting basically flat this year. So there's a lot that goes on that kind of -- you've got to again separate between overage and percent rent. It's a little bit of a crystal ball. There are always retailers that do well, some that slow down. We're pretty good at anticipating who's going to be great, who's not. But we're not the ones -- other than Forever 21, we're not the ones putting the stuff in the stores itself, okay? Forever 21, you can blame it on us, okay? So I hope that helps. Right now, we feel really good about our retailers. I think they were very focused on entering '23 with good, clean inventories. We feel like most of them have managed that. I asked my leasing folks all the time any pullback on demand. It's not really happened. So we feel good about that. Demand continues to be generally very strong. And I think they really -- because of the bounce back out of COVID really got the benefit of kind of getting their house in order. So I think on the credit side, we're feeling very comfortable, right, Brian? Yes? So nothing yet. Obviously, you've got a couple of big names out there, but we really have very little exposure to them. And in some cases, we'd like most of them are boxed and also in strip centers. So the ones that were -- that we have and we like the box at, we think we can do something better with them. So I'd say generally, knock on wood, I think credit side is pretty good and demand is good. And they ran -- they -- December was very spotty for a lot of retailers. On the other hand, after Christmas, most had a really good January. And again, I think the mistake we made, Simon Property Group made is that -- again, SPARC was profitable even with -- even though even it didn't meet the financial results of what -- and again, we shouldn't dwell on this too much because again, $0.64 out of $11.87, $0.64 out of $11.87. But it's important just so we'll do a little vehicle, but we made the mistake that thinking '21 -- we budgeted basically flat to '21. And '21 was for a couple of the brands there, just extraordinarily profitable. We made some tactical mistakes in Forever 21. We brought in a new CEO to rectify those mistakes. She's doing a terrific job. So we're very pleased there. We also are very pleased with JCPenney. It's unbelievably profitable EBITDA. You can see the EBITDA. There are some public filings out there. But it is -- it didn't have the '21 year of '21, but we're very pleased at where that company is positioned. And we're extremely pleased with the management team and all that they're doing to reinvigorate the brand. That means so much to that consumer in those communities. And we're taking a different tack than others that have managed or owned that brand. We're actually reinvesting in that company to make it very important for those communities. So very pleased with how we're positioning Penney. But it had EBITDA -- I don't know if I can disclose it, but it had a lot of EBITDA, okay? So and our partner, Brookfield, we'll let Brookfield take -- we'll let Brookfield announce it if they do their -- I'm kidding. But it was very profitable from an EBITDA point of view. So we're very pleased there with the brands. But we did make the mistake of thinking '21 would repeat. And then obviously, you had a lot of volatility from a macro point in '22 with huge increases in interest rates, huge increase in price, in food and energy cost that the consumer was whipsawed, and we felt the impact of it. It's stabilized now, we believe. Well, I think we haven't seen the benefit. But just walking we -- I mean I don't want to get into the kind of the geopolitics of what's going on. But we're -- we think there's a real benefit to our landmark assets that have always been shopped by the Chinese consumer or the Asian consumer. We're starting to see that a little bit, but we're not planning for that to really accelerate in '23 but we're hopeful that it will. Floris, I think you can -- you really should just focus on domestic. To put the retailers in there, there's too much volatility. It's not something we look to -- we're focused on are domestic property NOI to get back to 2019 numbers before we were shut down by the pandemic. The short answer is we will get there on a run rate by the end of this year. That's the short answer. And you shouldn't put the retailer NOI in there. It's, again, that's -- you've got to remember, we have basically no cash investment in SPARC. So -- and I know we could talk about it all day, but it's -- when you think about Simon Property Group, we want you to think about those investments as it gets with purchase, okay? We get this great property company that owns all those real estate that's redeveloping it, great balance sheet, the ability to make smart investments with an unbelievable return on investment outside its core business. And that's what you get with a seasoned team that's experienced from recession to credit prices to a shutdown in a pandemic, okay? And we managed it through it all. So the bottom line is our domestic property NOI, because of the delay in some of these openings, we will get back on a same property basis. Because remember, the other thing for us, we have properties in and out. So you can't go back in '19, the portfolio is different. But if you do the same portfolio that we own today versus the same portfolio that we own in '19, possible we'll be there by the end of this year, okay? No. We're not including Taubman in it. This is just the domestic property NOI. So we're not even including our international NOI. So what we can give you the mill, if you combine the mills, outlets and malls, domestic portfolio that we owned in '19 and that we still own in '22, we will get there on a run rate by the end of this year. As simple as that we're not that far off, but we have delayed openings. And depending on where sales come in, it's even possible we make it this year. And that's the way to look at it. And that's the only way to look at it, really. Yes. I mean certainly, if you look at it over that period of time, call to way outperform -- and again, I just go back to last year. We try to be as thoughtful in doing this, but there are variabilities to it, overage rent being the biggest. But we also have some certain inflationary pressures that we, as landlords and property owners, have to deal with, what I mentioned earlier. And again, you have downtime. But we -- I would hope that we would beat our number just like we did last year. And just like we have historically. Well, I don't -- anybody has the percent... Yes. So it's more than 50%. It's more than 50%. So I'd say demand across the board is good. Obviously, the higher end property probably has more demand. And -- but we're generally -- our leases still, to this day, occupancy cost is low and our rent spreads across the board are generally positive regardless of the sales front. No. That's a good question and the answer is no. We're not. Well, I think we're generally pleased that we're seeing some activity in our sector. And it's great that there's others out there that are -- real estate industries that are trying to grow externally. As an example, what was today that was announced. It's good to see we're not the only ones that like to make things happen externally. So that's good. I think our strategy has been essentially confirmed by others, other players in our industry where size and economies of scale see the benefits. So it's always good to see. We saw it in the warehousing world, and we saw it in the -- now we might see in the storage world. So it's great that we see that. From a stock buyback, I think our dividend is really where we're focused growing that. One of the thing I mentioned, hopefully, in my conference text that you heard was we paid out $39 billion in dividends, staggering number when you put it in perspective. That does not include any stock buyback, that's just pure dividends. I'd say that's the, obviously, the focus. But if the stock comes under pressure, we still have the ability to deal with that. So that is in our arsenal. We got a lot of mixed-use properties. I'd say generally, relatively quiet on the acquisition front. We did create our partnership with Jamestown, which we're focused on this year and, obviously, the years to come to grow that relationship. But we've got a lot going on and the capital to continue to create external opportunities. And we've been -- we haven't batted 1,000, but we've certainly moved the needle profitably with our investments and creating unbelievable return on investment, both in the real estate -- still one of the best deals ever done in real estate was our deal on premium outlets, which I'm happy to walk through the math not today. But still one of the best multiple deals ever been in our industry. And at that time, we were widely criticized for it. But one of the best deals done in the public company space. Yes, it's really simple. It's interest rate. We're losing roughly $0.30 to $0.35 per share just from either floating rate debt that's now higher or our own assumptions of what our refinancing costs are going to be. The good news is we're refinancing all of our debt. The market is there. but the cost of debt is higher. So that's really if you cut through it all, that's -- and when you look at kind of where the market was, very few analysts updated their numbers at all for higher interest rates. But they -- I don't have to tell you they ballooned over the last 12 months. Yes. I think we got to open it up a little higher. We have a little higher bad debt expense budgeted this year than last year. I will look at our 8-K because the development spend will add to that. But obviously, when you start a real estate project, it's over a, 2-year sometimes 3-year process. So all that's disclosed in the 8-K. And the CapEx, including TA, will probably be roughly with what it was '22, if not a little bit less, okay? At least $100 million. That all in Jamestown is accretive, but it wasn't a big investment. So -- and so it's in our budget, but it's not really -- the relationship is material, but the financial impact is not material. So that's one. Klépierre, we -- it is consistent with their guidance that they'll be developing when they announced their earnings this -- in the next couple of weeks. Yes. Well, it's -- listen, we're negotiating for the benefit of our shareholders. They're negotiating for the benefit of their shareholders. And a lot of these things we have, what I'll say, handshakes and it's the process of being [tapered]. So you should feel good that there's no smoking gun. There's nothing there that's going to lead to a fall out. It's just a process. And renewals are going We're, in fact, ahead of our '23 renewals now compared to where we were last year, some of the '22s -- and in some cases, because '22 took so long, we're doing '23s, so together and it's a process. But it's going well and relationships are progressing appropriately. '23, slightly up, slightly up. I don't have the number but Brian will have it for you later. Okay, last one, I guess. We're over 6:00, but we have one more question and one to finish the Q&A. Yes. Last -- you mean our mark-to-market equity investments? Yes, sure. I mean we outlined it. We separate it. We'll do comparable and real numbers. So you'll see both. Hopefully, it will only be up. But last year, we did take a reported FFO. You have the number? What was it? $0.08. But we'll outline those for you, Linda so, you'll see them both. Thank you. And again, I'm sure there are a lot more detailed questions. Please call Brian and Tom, and we'll be happy to walk you through more details. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Good morning, and I’m pleased to report our third quarter results. Third quarter funds from operations were $1.1 billion or $2.97 per share prior to a non-cash unrealized loss of $0.04 from a mark-to-market in fair value of publicly held securities. Let me walk you through some of the variances for the quarter compared to Q3 2021, our domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.05 of growth, driven by higher rental income. Our International operations posted strong results in the quarter and increased $0.05, despite the negative currency impact of $0.05 given the strength in the dollar. These positive contributions were partially offset by an $0.11 lower contribution from our other platform investments, which reflects costs associated with the JCPenney launch of new beauty brands, Reebok Integration costs and some softening of sales compared to 2021 from our two value-oriented brands. Domestic property, net operating income increased 2.3% for the quarter and 4.4% for the first nine months of the year. NOI growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to the light off of outstanding receivables from Regal Theaters upon its bankruptcy filing. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.2% for the quarter and 5.5% for the first nine months of the year. Occupancy ended third quarter 94.5%, an increase of 170 basis points compared to the prior year and an increase of 60 basis points compared to the second quarter. TRG was 94.5%, average base minimum rent increase for the fourth quarter in a row and was $54.80, an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued, we signed nearly 900 leases for more than 3 million square feet in the quarter and have signed over 3,100 leases for more than 10 million square feet through the first nine months of the year. And we continue to have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. The opening rate on our new leases has increased 10% since last year, or roughly $6 per lease. Reported retail sales momentum continued. Our shopper remains resilient. We reported another record in the third quarter of $749 per square foot for the malls and outlets, which was an increase of 14% year-over-year. Mills ended up at $677 per square foot, a 15% increase. TRG was $1,080 per foot, 25% increase. Our occupancy cost is at 12%, which is a level not seen since early 2015. We opened our 10th premium outlet in Japan and started construction on a significant expansion at Busan and South Korea. Our redevelopment pipeline is moving forward with more creative projects. Turning to our other platform investments. In the third quarter contributing $0.17 in FFO per share, as compared to $0.28 in the prior year period. After cash distributions received, we have approximately $475 million of net investment within our other platform investments primarily an ABG and RGG. We expect to generate approximately $300 million in FFO from OPI, that is for those of you like math is a 60% return on investment. We believe the value of our investments in OPI is over $2 billion. We've recently announced our strategic partnership with Jamestown, a global real estate investment and management firm. We see great opportunity with this investment to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses. The Jamestown team, our experienced, mixed-use operators, developers, property managers and asset managers, we're pleased to expand our investment platform with this best-in-class operator and we expect to grow their asset management business and accelerate our densification opportunities. We anticipate this accretive transaction to close prior to the end of this year. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of 16 property mortgages during the first nine months of the year for a total of $1.8 billion, at an average interest rate of 4.78%. Our balance sheet is strong, with approximately $8.6 billion of liquidity. Net debt-to-EBITDA is at 5.7 times and our fixed charge coverage is over 5 times. Today, we announced a 9.1% increase in our common stock dividend, and we will pay $1.80 per share for the fourth quarter. The dividend is payable on December 30th. Since May, we have purchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $98.57 per share. Given our current view, for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.70 to $11.77 per share, to $11.83 per share to $11.88 per share, compared to $11.44 last year. So that's an increase of 13% at the bottom end of the range and $0.12 at the midpoint and an increase of $0.26 at the midpoint compared to our initial guidance for the year. This guidance increase comes in the face of a strong U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures. Now, just let me conclude by saying, we had another impressive quarter. And before we get to questions, I would like to share some thoughts with you. For nearly 30 years as a public company, like many companies and industries, we have dealt with significant shifts within our industry. In our case, we embrace new challenges, and are better operators and more thoughtful and astute capital allocations – allocators. Many have tried to kill off physical retail real estate and in particular in closed malls. And I need not remind you, when physical retail was closed in COVID, all the naysayers saying that physical retail was gone forever. However, brick and mortar is strong -- brick and mortar retail are strong and ecommerce is flat lining. And importantly, over this period of time, we have paid out $39 billion in dividends to shareholders, as we have become stronger and more profitable. And why do I bring this up constantly? Well, because hopefully, this will put an end to the so-called negative mall narrative as you can't pay those dividends without a strong underlying business. Now, operator, we're ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning, David. It's nice to see the occupancy continue to climb and I know minimum base rents are up 1.7%. And you did mention in your comments that new lease rates were up 6% - or $6 sorry, per foot. Can you just kind of provide any color on how leasing spreads are trending? And do you envision bringing that metric back perhaps early next year? Just any thoughts around that?\nDavid Simon: Yes, they are -- when you do comparable space, they're wildly positive.\nSteve Sakwa: Can you just provide any more color?\nDavid Simon: Well, I just -- we don't report spreads, but they're wildly positive when you focus on comparable space.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Good morning. Good morning out there, David. Hey, so, one, appreciate the continued disclosure of the different platforms, the core, the International, Klepierre and the brands. But my question is, just given continued inflation, obviously, energy grown more of a concern, can you just help us understand when we hear or see like retailer brand earning contribution is down, or we read about different retailers having issues, how that translates, if at all, to their leasing? Because I think one of the questions that certainly comes up, is, hey, retailers have a bad print, oh, that's negative for the landlords. But that doesn't seem to be the case of accepting maybe certain circumstances. So, is there a general insight that you can help us understand that when the retailers have a bad quarter or a bad print, what the impact, if at all, that you see on the leasing side?\nDavid Simon: Sure. I would say, this is something we monitor every single day, in good times, bad times, mediocre times. We have yet to see any pullback in opening new stores or renewals. So, there's been absolutely no impact. And you're always going to have a deal here or there that falls apart for all sorts of different reasons, but nothing based upon the macro conditions. And I would tell you, Alex, that where -- they're seeing most of the pressure is in the e-commerce business. So the flight toward bricks and mortar is real. It's going to be sustained. And if they're in the retail business and they want to grow, they're going to open stores. And it's that simple, because the returns on e-commerce just aren't quite what everybody talks about. And so I think you've seen that and we've seen no slowdown whatsoever, there's always going to be a deal here or there. But if they're growing retailer, they have to put the money in bricks. Highest return on investment, we understand it as well as anybody because we see the e-commerce business, not just in the brands that we own with ABG, but also at Penney and RGG. And it's been a difficult year for e-commerce and bricks is where the action is.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Good morning. David, you've been doing this a long time. How do you…\nDavid Simon: Yes, you're right about that, you're right about that.\nDerek Johnston: Yes, sir. But how do you and the team feel headed into holiday? The consumer seems okay. But certainly, we're facing a slowdown, high inflation, it's hitting interest rates. So I mean, what really keeps you optimistic on your retail investments and then also on the holiday overall and it being a solid season?\nDavid Simon: Well, look, you're always, as any kind of CEO, you're always worried about the macro environment. But I will tell you what gives me unbelievable confidence going into the next few years is, the realization that - what we have been saying is that don't underestimate physical retail. And it’s kind of repetitive what I said earlier, but I'll just reinforce. We feel really good because physical retail is where the action is. That's where the return on investment is. And so even though if we may slow down next year or even into the holiday season, I don't think the growth from our existing business is going to slow down because the demand for new deals and space is there. On the retail side, I -- we're trying to -- one is I don't want to make a huge deal out of it. Two, is I want people to understand we've made an unbelievable investment. So we're getting a 50% return on our net investment there. So if it goes to 70% or it goes to 50%, it's -- we are going to have volatility, but it's still the hell of an investment, still being a great thing for us to do, to not only understand but what it takes for retailers to be successful, but kind of where the future is. So there will be volatility in that, but our better brands in there like Brooks Brothers, Lucky Jeans, Monica, really doing well. I said to you on the last call, the lower income consumer is tightened their belt and we do have a few brands that are affected by that. But even with that said, we have an unbelievable return on investment after tax from the earnings that those businesses throw off. And we're also making investments in that -- in those businesses. So, I expect those investments to pay for future earnings growth. But the macro is concerning, but look, rates will have an impact is probably the most direct impact that we'll have next year. But I still feel like demand and bricks and mortars where the action is going to be.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Quick ones, if I could sneak them in. The first is just on the occupancy gain is pretty impressive this quarter. I think you talked about maybe getting to pre-COVID occupancy by 2023. Just how are you thinking about sort of the upside on occupancy in this portfolio at this point? The second one was just on the new disclosure in the supplemental is really helpful on the fixed versus variable. Just any color or any comments as you're converting these variable leases to fix? How is that going? How much is left to go? What's the economics look like? Would be helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure. Let me -- I'll take the last one. I mean, we expect to garner a lot of the percentage and overage rent to minimum rent as these leases roll, but they take time to roll over. And our average lease term is probably 7 years. So it's not going to happen overnight, but it will happen over time. And remind me your first question? Occupancy. Thank you. So Look, I think we're still on track to achieve our goal -- I mean, I -- frankly, I think we've done an unbelievable job in increasing our occupancy and increasing our cash flow since the shutdowns. So hopefully, in '23, we'll get back to pre-COVID levels.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vince Tibone of Green Street. Please go ahead.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good morning. Could you elaborate on how you expect to grow Jamestown's Asset Management business? And could you see that platform being acquisition vehicles, U.S. malls or Simon's the operating partner and how minority stake in the fund or investment?\nDavid Simon: It's really in the asset management business. So I don't see it buying -- I don't see buying malls in that platform under any circumstance. But they have a lot of institutional relationships as do we, and we think, our working together, we'll be able to separate account money to invest in kind of the opportunities that exist in real estate. They're great place-making real estate. So there'll be some of those opportunities. They are also historically a big German fund operator. We expect them to continue that and they look for opportunities both internationally and domestically, not in our core business, but in other forms of real estate. So I think between essentially kind of the historical separate account business. They have their premier fund, plus their German fund business and then our adding to that platform in terms of owning 50% of the business. I think it will be attractive for institutional and retail investors, not retail real estate investors, but retail investors to potentially want to have Jamestown invest in real estate form.\nVince Tibone: That's really helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Floris Van Dijkum of Compass Point.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Thanks. David, I was heartening to hear you talk about the benefits of physical real estate over e-commerce, your perspective is always much valued on those. You have better insight call on that than anybody in the industry. And obviously, sales records, tenant sales records, leasing remains strong. I guess the question I have for you is, last quarter, I think you said your SNO pipeline was around 200 basis points. Is that still the case? Because you're signing new leases as well as opening stores? And then when do you think you're going to be able to achieve 19 levels of NOI on a same-store basis?\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I -- we're pushing the group to achieve that next year. And Floris, I would say to you the biggest issue for us next year will be just getting our pipeline open. And a lot of these are really good retailers with really good stores, and it takes time to build them and open them. So that will be our challenge. That will be our primary challenge to reach next year's to get back to '19 levels. But I'm hopeful that we can do it, and we are pushing very hard to do that, which is, I think, pretty much ahead of schedule. It's a very fair and good question to ask that because I ask that every single day. So you and I are on the same page. On the pipe.\nBrian McDade: Yes, Floris, this is Brian. We're still running about 200 basis points. We've added stuff and we've taken stuff out as we opened, but we're running around 200 basis points consistently.\nFloris Van Dijkum: In the malls and the outlets relatively unchanged?\nBrian McDade: Yes. Very consistent.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from Craig Mailman of Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph: This is Nick Joseph here with Craig. Just on the Jamestown strategic partnership. What was the price and valuation for the deal? And then do you expect to move more into asset management? And if so, how large could that platform become?\nDavid Simon: The first part was what? How big would the -- what I'm not sure. When did you -- you broke up there.\nTom Ward: Can you repeat your question?\nNick Joseph: For the Jamestown deal.\nDavid Simon: Yes -- we're not disclosing the private company, and we both chose not to disclose it. So I think you asked the size of the deal. I'm sorry, Craig, you're breaking up some. I'm guessing that's what you've asked. They manage roughly $13 billion of assets across their various funds. And we are hopeful that over time, it's not just quantity, but there is quality involved, but there's no reason why we can't turn that into one of the bigger asset management players with their expertise and our expertise combined, their reputation and our reputation combined, we think it will be an attractive platform to raise additional funds to invest in real estate. And I am hopeful that we can more than double it. I'm not going to put a number out there, but we didn't do it to be flat. We did it because we expect to grow their assets under management. And given the existing size, we think we can grow it with time pretty significantly.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Mueller: Yes, hi David, on your comment about wildly positive leasing spreads, I guess, how recent of a dynamic is that where you would, I guess, describe them as being wildly positive?\nDavid Simon: I would say it really started at the beginning of this year. So look, we -- again, spreads -- ultimately, you see it in our minimum base rent growth. So -- but that's a huge -- that's everything. So it takes time. But if you -- and again, we want you to focus on cash flow growth as opposed to spreads. But if we were to track comparable space, space leases to same space, it would be wildly positive, more than the $6 per foot that I mentioned. But we don't then we don't want you to like be obsessed with that either. So, we're trying just to focus everyone on occupancy, minimum rent growth, we've outlined kind of where we get the variable income where we get our contractual income. It's all in the 8-K, and it all manifests itself in the NOI. And that's what we want you to focus on. But if you were to take the subset, which is space for space that's like it's pretty damn impressive. And our renewals are positive overall. And so that's changed. That you're right, over the last certainly in COVID we got -- those renewals were tough that happened to show up during COVID. But I am happy to report renewals generally and new deals with ending space and new space is wildly positive and that's manifesting itself in our comp NOI growth. Then you add that to the pipeline, and that's why we feel good about next year. But unfortunately, the only negative next year will be getting stores open and getting this 200 basis point type open and operate. And that takes time because the retailers that we're doing business with want to have the proper looking, they want to have a proper look in store. But we are very pleased to see the spread story change.\nMichael Mueller: Okay, thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Schmidt: Great. Thank you. Will Simon's total investment in redevelopments and developments grow in 2023 or might macro events like a potential recession cause a pause in new projects?\nDavid Simon: Yes. That's a good question, Chris. Right now, we think the -- if we do run into a recession, actually, from the standpoint of new projects, actually, we see a slight benefit. They sound counterintuitive, but construction pricing for new projects is higher than what we want to see. So I'm hopeful that any slowdown will demonstrate will reduce cost of new construction, which we will then want to like move forward more aggressively. So it's kind of counterintuitive. But again, I'm not looking forward. I don't want to recession. I hope there's not a recession, but from the standpoint of redevelopment and new development, we actually -- the counter cyclicality of cost of construction may actually be one of the side benefits that we can take advantage of.\nOperator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good morning. I was just looking at the lease income disclosed in the supplemental for the consolidated properties. And it seems like that was up 60 basis points year-over-year, but your domestic NOI was up 2.3%. So I'm just -- and at the same time, it was – that lease income was down modestly sequentially. So just hoping for a little bit more of an explanation, I guess, or tying to lose sense as to the difference between the lease income and then the NOI reported? And is it cost controls or any other kind of unusual items that kind of drove that disparity between the lease income growth and of course NOI?\nDavid Simon: Yes. I think you had less -- we had a reduction in overage rent, right, would be one of the reasons. So that's another trend. Juan, don't forget, we mentioned that we took a charge for the legal write-off and to reduce that line item as well in the current quarter. And then we do have certainly cost containment, as you can see through the P&L. So all of that mixed together drove the levers to higher NOI growth.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey, good morning. If you could just please touch on the reduction in overage rent again and how much of that is driven by, one, reduced sales despite kind of tenant sales being up 14% year-over-year? And then otherwise, the conversion of pandemic leases back to fixed and then maybe how much more of that kind of conversion we expect to see this year and into next year?\nDavid Simon: Well, we -- look, I mean strategy-wise, we always try to convert our overage rent into minimum rent. So you -- certainly, some reduction is associated with it. And then usually '21, obviously, on sales was pretty strong. And in certain cases, percent rent where we -- it's not so much the overage say, the percent of rent, we have some tenants that are just purely percent rent. They've had slower sales since '21, and that's showing up in the numbers. But -- we're still very pleased with the results. So I think those are kind of the big picture. We'll continue to reduce percent in overage rent as leases roll over. On the other hand, our sales are rising and the retailers focused on the higher-income consumer continue to spend, and that's good for us as it shows up in our cash flow.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The domestic property NOI increased 2.3% in the quarter. The portfolio increased 3.2%. That's a deceleration from last quarter about 130, 140 basis points, but it sounds like there's an offset of 100 basis points from the Regal write-off. So maybe like a 30 to 40 basis point slowdown. So from the last quarter, so I guess -- the question is, is this like the right rate of portfolio NOI growth that we should expect kind of going forward? Or is there an expectation that things kind of continue to moderate from here?\nDavid Simon: Well, again, I wouldn't focus too much on quarter-over-quarter. There is volatility in our numbers because of overage rent and other factors, layoff like Regal, which is highly unusual that it would manifest itself in a material number, but it's important to point out. So look, I think you have to go back to the beginning of the year where we thought because '21 was a really banner year, and we were very conservative in our comp NOI estimate of 2%. We're blowing through that number. We'll see what the fourth quarter brings. But it's -- our comp NOI growth is going to be really strong, and we continue to expect it to grow next year as well. So you've got to look at this over 2- or 3-year period as opposed to quarter-over-quarter or even year-over-year. And we're making a tremendous amount of progress a number we were one of the few industries that were literally mandated the shutdown, and we're kind of back up and running and producing results that are pre-pandemic, which is very good to see. And we'll expect to see comp NOI growth next year even in the face of a potential recession.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: Hi, good morning. In terms of the write-off from Regal, is this for all your Regals? And are they rent reductions or rejected leases?\nDavid Simon: This is all of our Regal. We took a reserve against outstanding receivables.\nLinda Tsai: So what would happen -- it's still going to operate as Regal or ...\nDavid Simon: Well, we don't know. I mean you're in bankruptcy, we -- my guess is they'll come out of bankruptcy as it's an ongoing business, but we have to wait and see. I'm sure they're going to restructure the debt. We're experts in understanding bankruptcies, but I would imagine they'll reward and some of this may come back as its pre-petitioned. So in order for them to assume a lease. They have to clear up to the pre-petition rent. So it gets very technical and complicated. There's trade-offs, we'll just have to see how it goes through bankruptcy at this point. And -- but I expect them to continue to operate. There could be a couple of theater closures in our portfolio. Some of that will be fine. And -- but we have yet to have a -- I think their debt and financing is, I think, just about approved or was approved. So it's going to go through a process that we've -- we have seen hundreds of times.\nOperator: Next question is from Ki Bin Kim of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning. So just want to go back to your comments about the lease spreads looking pretty positive this quarter. If you take a step back to look at and look at it on a kind of net economic basis, meaning regardless of is it minimum rent or income from percentage deals, as you're signing new deals, how does the net economic benefit look like versus the comments you made about the lease spread looking positive? And what do you think that looks like going forward?\nTom Ward: Stephen, can you repeat your question? You are breaking up a little bit.\nKi Bin Kim: Sure.\nDavid Simon: Yes. It was really, sorry [indiscernible].\nKi Bin Kim: Yes. Is this better?\nDavid Simon: Yes. Thank you. Yes.\nKi Bin Kim: Yes. So just talking about the lease spreads, you guys mentioned that the spreads were pretty positive this quarter. I'm just curious about the net economic impact of the renewals or new leases meaning as you convert some of the percentage deals into fixed, is the net economic benefit you're getting as good as the comments you made about spreads looking pretty positive?\nDavid Simon: Well, sure. I mean it's -- yes, because we obviously take into account our existing income stream from that space, which includes if we have average 1% rent. And we're -- we look at it in totality but we expect the total income stream to go up. And coding tends to be minimum rent increase and some assumption on overage. That's why rent spreads are kind of whatever you -- whatever you want it to be. That's why we chose not to do it. So as an example, our -- when we disclosed it historically, we included everything. We had minimum rent against minimum rent. We did not factor in overage. Well, Taubman as an example, when they did their rent spreads, they included some assumption on overage. Well, when they disclosed it to their rent spreads, is that beneficial or not beneficial. I mean, to the -- so to me, it's like, hey, it all shows up in cash flow man, so you see the cash flow, see the NOI. So, that's why you guys be very careful with rent spreads. That's why they're more manufactured than they should be. They're in some cases, take assumptions and whether you want assumptions or not, we'd rather not have assumptions. So we just say, here's the math. Minimum right, you see our overage, see the NOI next question. So -- but when we look at our -- when we go lease space by space. We're looking at the total income stream before and after the renewal or in the case of a new tenant to see whether we're going up or down or it's flat. And what I'm telling you is the trend is up pretty straightforwardly.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Great. And you guys mentioned that the lease percentage for your portfolio is about 200 basis points higher than that 94.5. I'm just curious if you look at the forward leasing pipeline of new deals that you're looking at as we head into next year, what does that picture look like compared to maybe a couple of quarters ago? And tied to that, I also noticed your 2023 lease expirations didn't really budge all that much quarter-over-quarter. Just like any kind of preliminary thoughts on that role?\nDavid Simon: Yes. The stuff out there, we're very close to some of the larger accounts just takes time to do renewals, paper and all that stuff. So that's all moving not no real concerns there. Go ahead, Brian.\nBrian McDade: And Ki, you said there about the 200 basis points. Let me just clarify. That is included within the current occupancy level. It is space in the leasing that has been done but hasn't commenced paying rent. So that is next year effectively will be partially next year's growth.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question is from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel St. Juste: Good morning. I have a question, a follow-up for you on the leasing. The occupancy is up 170 basis points year-over-year, but your lease income is only up about 60 basis points. My question is, when are we going to see the impact of that that occupancy gain. Is that part of the cautious optimism embedded in your thinking for next year and your hopes for getting back to 2019 at levels or that be more of a full year '24 impact?\nDavid Simon: Well, I think you've seen it, and you'll continue to see it. So our comp NOI growth the first 9 months is 4.4%. So you've seen it for the first 9 months, 4.4% growth. And then as Brian mentioned earlier, and I have mentioned throughout the call, is we had this other pipeline that's basically leases that will open and start paying commencing rent in 2023. And that's why we're positive about the feeling that we'll continue to have future comp NOI growth for next year, even in the face of potential recessionary environment, okay?\nHaendel St. Juste: Fair enough. And I guess as a follow-on to that, if we assume expenses have to go up given what's going on with inflation and operating expenses, personnel, is it your expectation that you can grow NOI between the fourth quarter year and middle of next year?\nDavid Simon: Absolutely. That's what I -- yes, we said we expect comp NOI growth next year. And obviously, that includes the expense side as well.\nHaendel St. Juste: Right, right. I was thinking more than 6 months. But nevertheless, one more if I could squeeze in for Brian. Maybe it's a bit follow-up, but the $600 million of unsecured maturing next June, bearing interest in 2 and 3 quarters. What's the early thinking there? And where do you think you could issue 10-year unsecured today?\nBrian McDade: Sure. Look, we actively monitor markets at all times, and you've seen us numerous times react ahead of maturities or at maturity. So we would expect to continue to keep our pulse on the finger of the market. Unsecured today is approximately 6% for us.\nHaendel St. Juste: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: All right. You can sneak in a few extra questions there. I think that was it on the question side. So thank you. It's a change of pace to it in the morning, but we did it in hopes that you got home early enough to trick or treat. And hopefully, you have a great Halloween. So thank you, and we'll talk to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Yes, Floris, this is Brian. We're still running about 200 basis points. We've added stuff and we've taken stuff out as we opened, but we're running around 200 basis points consistently. Yes. Very consistent. And Ki, you said there about the 200 basis points. Let me just clarify. That is included within the current occupancy level. It is space in the leasing that has been done but hasn't commenced paying rent. So that is next year effectively will be partially next year's growth. Sure. Look, we actively monitor markets at all times, and you've seen us numerous times react ahead of maturities or at maturity. So we would expect to continue to keep our pulse on the finger of the market. Unsecured today is approximately 6% for us."

            "content": "Good morning, and I'm pleased to report our third quarter results. Third quarter funds from operations were $1.1 billion or $2.97 per share prior to a non-cash unrealized loss of $0.04 from a mark-to-market in fair value of publicly held securities. Let me walk you through some of the variances for the quarter compared to Q3 2021, our domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.05 of growth, driven by higher rental income. Our International operations posted strong results in the quarter and increased $0.05, despite the negative currency impact of $0.05 given the strength in the dollar. These positive contributions were partially offset by an $0.11 lower contribution from our other platform investments, which reflects costs associated with the JCPenney launch of new beauty brands, Reebok Integration costs and some softening of sales compared to 2021 from our two value-oriented brands. Domestic property, net operating income increased 2.3% for the quarter and 4.4% for the first nine months of the year. NOI growth for the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to the light off of outstanding receivables from Regal Theaters upon its bankruptcy filing. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.2% for the quarter and 5.5% for the first nine months of the year. Occupancy ended third quarter 94.5%, an increase of 170 basis points compared to the prior year and an increase of 60 basis points compared to the second quarter. TRG was 94.5%, average base minimum rent increase for the fourth quarter in a row and was $54.80, an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued, we signed nearly 900 leases for more than 3 million square feet in the quarter and have signed over 3,100 leases for more than 10 million square feet through the first nine months of the year. And we continue to have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. The opening rate on our new leases has increased 10% since last year, or roughly $6 per lease. Reported retail sales momentum continued. Our shopper remains resilient. We reported another record in the third quarter of $749 per square foot for the malls and outlets, which was an increase of 14% year-over-year. Mills ended up at $677 per square foot, a 15% increase. TRG was $1,080 per foot, 25% increase. Our occupancy cost is at 12%, which is a level not seen since early 2015. We opened our 10th premium outlet in Japan and started construction on a significant expansion at Busan and South Korea. Our redevelopment pipeline is moving forward with more creative projects. Turning to our other platform investments. In the third quarter contributing $0.17 in FFO per share, as compared to $0.28 in the prior year period. After cash distributions received, we have approximately $475 million of net investment within our other platform investments primarily an ABG and RGG. We expect to generate approximately $300 million in FFO from OPI, that is for those of you like math is a 60% return on investment. We believe the value of our investments in OPI is over $2 billion. We've recently announced our strategic partnership with Jamestown, a global real estate investment and management firm. We see great opportunity with this investment to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses. The Jamestown team, our experienced, mixed-use operators, developers, property managers and asset managers, we're pleased to expand our investment platform with this best-in-class operator and we expect to grow their asset management business and accelerate our densification opportunities. We anticipate this accretive transaction to close prior to the end of this year. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of 16 property mortgages during the first nine months of the year for a total of $1.8 billion, at an average interest rate of 4.78%. Our balance sheet is strong, with approximately $8.6 billion of liquidity. Net debt-to-EBITDA is at 5.7 times and our fixed charge coverage is over 5 times. Today, we announced a 9.1% increase in our common stock dividend, and we will pay $1.80 per share for the fourth quarter. The dividend is payable on December 30th. Since May, we have purchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $98.57 per share. Given our current view, for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.70 to $11.77 per share, to $11.83 per share to $11.88 per share, compared to $11.44 last year. So that's an increase of 13% at the bottom end of the range and $0.12 at the midpoint and an increase of $0.26 at the midpoint compared to our initial guidance for the year. This guidance increase comes in the face of a strong U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures. Now, just let me conclude by saying, we had another impressive quarter. And before we get to questions, I would like to share some thoughts with you. For nearly 30 years as a public company, like many companies and industries, we have dealt with significant shifts within our industry. In our case, we embrace new challenges, and are better operators and more thoughtful and astute capital allocations – allocators. Many have tried to kill off physical retail real estate and in particular in closed malls. And I need not remind you, when physical retail was closed in COVID, all the naysayers saying that physical retail was gone forever. However, brick and mortar is strong -- brick and mortar retail are strong and ecommerce is flat lining. And importantly, over this period of time, we have paid out $39 billion in dividends to shareholders, as we have become stronger and more profitable. And why do I bring this up constantly? Well, because hopefully, this will put an end to the so-called negative mall narrative as you can't pay those dividends without a strong underlying business. Now, operator, we're ready for questions. Yes, they are -- when you do comparable space, they're wildly positive. Well, I just -- we don't report spreads, but they're wildly positive when you focus on comparable space. Sure. I would say, this is something we monitor every single day, in good times, bad times, mediocre times. We have yet to see any pullback in opening new stores or renewals. So, there's been absolutely no impact. And you're always going to have a deal here or there that falls apart for all sorts of different reasons, but nothing based upon the macro conditions. And I would tell you, Alex, that where -- they're seeing most of the pressure is in the e-commerce business. So the flight toward bricks and mortar is real. It's going to be sustained. And if they're in the retail business and they want to grow, they're going to open stores. And it's that simple, because the returns on e-commerce just aren't quite what everybody talks about. And so I think you've seen that and we've seen no slowdown whatsoever, there's always going to be a deal here or there. But if they're growing retailer, they have to put the money in bricks. Highest return on investment, we understand it as well as anybody because we see the e-commerce business, not just in the brands that we own with ABG, but also at Penney and RGG. And it's been a difficult year for e-commerce and bricks is where the action is. Yes, you're right about that, you're right about that. Well, look, you're always, as any kind of CEO, you're always worried about the macro environment. But I will tell you what gives me unbelievable confidence going into the next few years is, the realization that - what we have been saying is that don't underestimate physical retail. And it's kind of repetitive what I said earlier, but I'll just reinforce. We feel really good because physical retail is where the action is. That's where the return on investment is. And so even though if we may slow down next year or even into the holiday season, I don't think the growth from our existing business is going to slow down because the demand for new deals and space is there. On the retail side, I -- we're trying to -- one is I don't want to make a huge deal out of it. Two, is I want people to understand we've made an unbelievable investment. So we're getting a 50% return on our net investment there. So if it goes to 70% or it goes to 50%, it's -- we are going to have volatility, but it's still the hell of an investment, still being a great thing for us to do, to not only understand but what it takes for retailers to be successful, but kind of where the future is. So there will be volatility in that, but our better brands in there like Brooks Brothers, Lucky Jeans, Monica, really doing well. I said to you on the last call, the lower income consumer is tightened their belt and we do have a few brands that are affected by that. But even with that said, we have an unbelievable return on investment after tax from the earnings that those businesses throw off. And we're also making investments in that -- in those businesses. So, I expect those investments to pay for future earnings growth. But the macro is concerning, but look, rates will have an impact is probably the most direct impact that we'll have next year. But I still feel like demand and bricks and mortars where the action is going to be. Sure. Let me -- I'll take the last one. I mean, we expect to garner a lot of the percentage and overage rent to minimum rent as these leases roll, but they take time to roll over. And our average lease term is probably 7 years. So it's not going to happen overnight, but it will happen over time. And remind me your first question? Occupancy. Thank you. So Look, I think we're still on track to achieve our goal -- I mean, I -- frankly, I think we've done an unbelievable job in increasing our occupancy and increasing our cash flow since the shutdowns. So hopefully, in '23, we'll get back to pre-COVID levels. It's really in the asset management business. So I don't see it buying -- I don't see buying malls in that platform under any circumstance. But they have a lot of institutional relationships as do we, and we think, our working together, we'll be able to separate account money to invest in kind of the opportunities that exist in real estate. They're great place-making real estate. So there'll be some of those opportunities. They are also historically a big German fund operator. We expect them to continue that and they look for opportunities both internationally and domestically, not in our core business, but in other forms of real estate. So I think between essentially kind of the historical separate account business. They have their premier fund, plus their German fund business and then our adding to that platform in terms of owning 50% of the business. I think it will be attractive for institutional and retail investors, not retail real estate investors, but retail investors to potentially want to have Jamestown invest in real estate form. Well, look, I -- we're pushing the group to achieve that next year. And Floris, I would say to you the biggest issue for us next year will be just getting our pipeline open. And a lot of these are really good retailers with really good stores, and it takes time to build them and open them. So that will be our challenge. That will be our primary challenge to reach next year's to get back to '19 levels. But I'm hopeful that we can do it, and we are pushing very hard to do that, which is, I think, pretty much ahead of schedule. It's a very fair and good question to ask that because I ask that every single day. So you and I are on the same page. On the pipe. The first part was what? How big would the -- what I'm not sure. When did you -- you broke up there. Yes -- we're not disclosing the private company, and we both chose not to disclose it. So I think you asked the size of the deal. I'm sorry, Craig, you're breaking up some. I'm guessing that's what you've asked. They manage roughly $13 billion of assets across their various funds. And we are hopeful that over time, it's not just quantity, but there is quality involved, but there's no reason why we can't turn that into one of the bigger asset management players with their expertise and our expertise combined, their reputation and our reputation combined, we think it will be an attractive platform to raise additional funds to invest in real estate. And I am hopeful that we can more than double it. I'm not going to put a number out there, but we didn't do it to be flat. We did it because we expect to grow their assets under management. And given the existing size, we think we can grow it with time pretty significantly. I would say it really started at the beginning of this year. So look, we -- again, spreads -- ultimately, you see it in our minimum base rent growth. So -- but that's a huge -- that's everything. So it takes time. But if you -- and again, we want you to focus on cash flow growth as opposed to spreads. But if we were to track comparable space, space leases to same space, it would be wildly positive, more than the $6 per foot that I mentioned. But we don't then we don't want you to like be obsessed with that either. So, we're trying just to focus everyone on occupancy, minimum rent growth, we've outlined kind of where we get the variable income where we get our contractual income. It's all in the 8-K, and it all manifests itself in the NOI. And that's what we want you to focus on. But if you were to take the subset, which is space for space that's like it's pretty damn impressive. And our renewals are positive overall. And so that's changed. That you're right, over the last certainly in COVID we got -- those renewals were tough that happened to show up during COVID. But I am happy to report renewals generally and new deals with ending space and new space is wildly positive and that's manifesting itself in our comp NOI growth. Then you add that to the pipeline, and that's why we feel good about next year. But unfortunately, the only negative next year will be getting stores open and getting this 200 basis point type open and operate. And that takes time because the retailers that we're doing business with want to have the proper looking, they want to have a proper look in store. But we are very pleased to see the spread story change. Yes. That's a good question, Chris. Right now, we think the -- if we do run into a recession, actually, from the standpoint of new projects, actually, we see a slight benefit. They sound counterintuitive, but construction pricing for new projects is higher than what we want to see. So I'm hopeful that any slowdown will demonstrate will reduce cost of new construction, which we will then want to like move forward more aggressively. So it's kind of counterintuitive. But again, I'm not looking forward. I don't want to recession. I hope there's not a recession, but from the standpoint of redevelopment and new development, we actually -- the counter cyclicality of cost of construction may actually be one of the side benefits that we can take advantage of. Yes. I think you had less -- we had a reduction in overage rent, right, would be one of the reasons. So that's another trend. Juan, don't forget, we mentioned that we took a charge for the legal write-off and to reduce that line item as well in the current quarter. And then we do have certainly cost containment, as you can see through the P&L. So all of that mixed together drove the levers to higher NOI growth. Well, we -- look, I mean strategy-wise, we always try to convert our overage rent into minimum rent. So you -- certainly, some reduction is associated with it. And then usually '21, obviously, on sales was pretty strong. And in certain cases, percent rent where we -- it's not so much the overage say, the percent of rent, we have some tenants that are just purely percent rent. They've had slower sales since '21, and that's showing up in the numbers. But -- we're still very pleased with the results. So I think those are kind of the big picture. We'll continue to reduce percent in overage rent as leases roll over. On the other hand, our sales are rising and the retailers focused on the higher-income consumer continue to spend, and that's good for us as it shows up in our cash flow. Well, again, I wouldn't focus too much on quarter-over-quarter. There is volatility in our numbers because of overage rent and other factors, layoff like Regal, which is highly unusual that it would manifest itself in a material number, but it's important to point out. So look, I think you have to go back to the beginning of the year where we thought because '21 was a really banner year, and we were very conservative in our comp NOI estimate of 2%. We're blowing through that number. We'll see what the fourth quarter brings. But it's -- our comp NOI growth is going to be really strong, and we continue to expect it to grow next year as well. So you've got to look at this over 2- or 3-year period as opposed to quarter-over-quarter or even year-over-year. And we're making a tremendous amount of progress a number we were one of the few industries that were literally mandated the shutdown, and we're kind of back up and running and producing results that are pre-pandemic, which is very good to see. And we'll expect to see comp NOI growth next year even in the face of a potential recession. This is all of our Regal. We took a reserve against outstanding receivables. Well, we don't know. I mean you're in bankruptcy, we -- my guess is they'll come out of bankruptcy as it's an ongoing business, but we have to wait and see. I'm sure they're going to restructure the debt. We're experts in understanding bankruptcies, but I would imagine they'll reward and some of this may come back as its pre-petitioned. So in order for them to assume a lease. They have to clear up to the pre-petition rent. So it gets very technical and complicated. There's trade-offs, we'll just have to see how it goes through bankruptcy at this point. And -- but I expect them to continue to operate. There could be a couple of theater closures in our portfolio. Some of that will be fine. And -- but we have yet to have a -- I think their debt and financing is, I think, just about approved or was approved. So it's going to go through a process that we've -- we have seen hundreds of times. Yes. It was really, sorry [indiscernible]. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Well, sure. I mean it's -- yes, because we obviously take into account our existing income stream from that space, which includes if we have average 1% rent. And we're -- we look at it in totality but we expect the total income stream to go up. And coding tends to be minimum rent increase and some assumption on overage. That's why rent spreads are kind of whatever you -- whatever you want it to be. That's why we chose not to do it. So as an example, our -- when we disclosed it historically, we included everything. We had minimum rent against minimum rent. We did not factor in overage. Well, Taubman as an example, when they did their rent spreads, they included some assumption on overage. Well, when they disclosed it to their rent spreads, is that beneficial or not beneficial. I mean, to the -- so to me, it's like, hey, it all shows up in cash flow man, so you see the cash flow, see the NOI. So, that's why you guys be very careful with rent spreads. That's why they're more manufactured than they should be. They're in some cases, take assumptions and whether you want assumptions or not, we'd rather not have assumptions. So we just say, here's the math. Minimum right, you see our overage, see the NOI next question. So -- but when we look at our -- when we go lease space by space. We're looking at the total income stream before and after the renewal or in the case of a new tenant to see whether we're going up or down or it's flat. And what I'm telling you is the trend is up pretty straightforwardly. Yes. The stuff out there, we're very close to some of the larger accounts just takes time to do renewals, paper and all that stuff. So that's all moving not no real concerns there. Go ahead, Brian. Well, I think you've seen it, and you'll continue to see it. So our comp NOI growth the first 9 months is 4.4%. So you've seen it for the first 9 months, 4.4% growth. And then as Brian mentioned earlier, and I have mentioned throughout the call, is we had this other pipeline that's basically leases that will open and start paying commencing rent in 2023. And that's why we're positive about the feeling that we'll continue to have future comp NOI growth for next year, even in the face of potential recessionary environment, okay? Absolutely. That's what I -- yes, we said we expect comp NOI growth next year. And obviously, that includes the expense side as well. All right. You can sneak in a few extra questions there. I think that was it on the question side. So thank you. It's a change of pace to it in the morning, but we did it in hopes that you got home early enough to trick or treat. And hopefully, you have a great Halloween. So thank you, and we'll talk to you soon."

[Operator Instructions] I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Thank you. Pleased to report our second quarter results. Second quarter funds from operations were $1.1 billion or $2.96 per share prior to a noncash unrealized loss of $0.05 from a mark-to-market and fair value of publicly held securities. Let me walk you through the big variances for this quarter compared to Q2 of 2021. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter and contributed $0.13 of growth driven by higher rental income of $0.09, strong performance in Simon Brand Ventures and short-term leasing of $0.05. TRG contributed $0.04 of growth, and they were partially offset by higher operating costs of approximately $0.05. Our international operations posted strong results in the quarter and increased $0.10. Lower interest rate -- interest expense contributed $0.03, and these $0.26 of positive contributions were partially offset by the headwind from a strong U.S. dollar of $0.03 and a $0.19 lower contribution from our other platform investments, principally from JCPenney and a couple of brands within SPARC. These costs include --these included costs associated with JCPenney's launch of new brands, the recent Reebok transaction and the integration costs associated with that and a softening of sales from our value-oriented brands due to inflationary pressures on that consumer. We generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which was $200 million higher than the first quarter of this year. And we have generated $2.2 billion for the first 6 months of the year. Domestic property NOI increased 3.6% year-over-year for the quarter and 5.6% for the first half of the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties, grew 4.6% for the quarter and 6.7% for the first 6 months. Occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 93.9%, an increase of 210 basis points and TRG was at 93.4%. The number of tenant terminations this year has been at record low levels. Average base rent increased -- average base minimum rent increased for the third quarter in a row and was at $54.58. Leasing momentum accelerated across our portfolio. We signed nearly 1,300 leases for more than 4 million square feet in the quarter, have signed over 2,200 leases for more than 7 million square feet through the first half of the year, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. Nearly 40% of our total leasing activity in the first 6 months of the year has been new deal volume. This is up approximately 25% from last year. Retail sales continued. Mall sales volumes for the second quarter were up 7%. Our reported retailer sales per square foot reached another record in the second quarter at $746 per square foot for the malls and the outlets combined, which was an increase of 26%, $674 for the mills, a 29% increase. TRG was at $1,068 per square foot, a 35% increase. We began our national outlet shopping day, which was very successful from shoppers and participating retailers offering a timely first-of-its-kind power shopping experience. More than 3 million shoppers visited our premium outlets and mills over the shopping weekend. Feedback following the event has been tremendous from both our retailers and consumers. We're already planning next year's event, which we expect to be bigger. So please stay tuned on that. Our occupancy cost at the end of the quarter are the lowest they've been in 7 years, 12.1% in Q2 of 2022. Now our other platform of investments, let's talk about it. We were pleased with the results of our investments in the platform for the second quarter. They contributed approximately $0.21 in FFO, even though we were down from last year's terrific results, primarily, as I mentioned, continued investment and the inflationary pressures that have developed. Based on our distributions -- based upon our cash distributions received, we have no cash equity investment in SPARC and JCPenney. And in fact, we have parlayed our SPARC investment into our investment in ABG that is now worth over $1 billion. There will be a little more volatility from quarter-to-quarter when it comes to SPARC and JCPenney, but please keep in -- this in the proper perspective. It's all upside from here. During the quarter, we also, as I mentioned, had our mark on our SoHo and Lifetime Holdings of $0.05. A reminder on that it's a noncash mark, and we would expect that those companies would bounce back. We completed the refinancing of 14 property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of $1.6 billion at an average interest rate of 3.75%. We reduced our share of total indebtedness by more than $650 million. And once again, our balance sheet is strong. We had $8.5 billion of liquidity. $8.5 billion. Today, we announced our dividend of $1.75 per share for the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 17%. This will be payable at the end of the third quarter, September 30. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $144 million. And let me point out while other companies in our sector are paying little or no dividends and issuing equity, we are repeatedly raising our dividend and buying our stock back. We have now returned more than $37 billion of capital to our shareholders since we've been public. $37 billion. Given our current view of the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.60 to $11.75 per share to the new range of $11.70 to $11.77 per share, which compares to a comparable number of last year of $11.44 per share. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.06 at the midpoint of the range. The guidance comes in the face, obviously, of a strong U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and the inflationary pressures that are out there in the marketplace. So let me conclude. I'm pleased with our second quarter results. Our business is strong. The higher income consumer is in good shape, brick-and-mortar stores are where the shoppers want to be, outpacing e-commerce across the world and the broad retail spectrum. Demand for our space is extremely strong. Worldwide retailers need to grow, and they're doubling down on the U.S. International tourism is returning. Domestic tourism is strong. Our redevelopment pipeline is growing with exciting projects. And in addition to our newly announced premium outlet, new developments and expansions, we are experienced at managing our business through volatile periods, including leveraging our existing platform for operating efficiencies, allocating capital appropriately, managing risks. We are not over our skis in any aspect of our business. I encourage you to look at our track record. We outperform in these kinds of periods, and we also do some of our best work as well. So thank you, operator. We're ready for any questions at this moment.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Bilerman: It's actually Michael Bilerman here with Craig. David, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about sort of that inflationary pressure that's on the retailers that you're starting to experience first-hand and obviously, your knowledge base of the retailer environment is significant. But now actually being on both sides, what can you do as a landlord to help your tenants through this period of time where they are dealing with a lot of inflationary pressures and more inventory because arguably, I know from a landlord perspective, you want your rent to inflate and that just makes matters worse. So can you just talk a little bit about the things that you can do to take share and really leverage what you're learning on the retailer side for the benefit of shareholders?\nDavid Simon: Well, thank you, Michael, for that question. So look, we're not presumptuous to tell any retailer under any circumstance how to run their business. So it's really entirely up to them on how they see fit, how to manage inventory et cetera. And just our own experience within SPARC, we have several brands. And we did see some softness in the more value-oriented brands. And again, we do think that pressure on the consumer with respect to food, housing, obviously, gas, and they reined it in. But again, I think the important thing to keep in mind, Michael, is even with that said, we were profitable. We had an unbelievably strong year last year with Penney and SPARC. We're still projecting really high EBITDA growth for these companies. And even though they're -- obviously, their consumers being cautious, back-to-school so far is off to a good start. Our traffic is actually pretty good. And I think just from our own operating experience, the SPARC management team and the Penney, I think, do what a lot of retailers do. They rein in discretionary capital. They watch the overhead. They really don't close stores because stores are profitable to them. They watch marketing expenses that -- they're very focused on the payback when it comes to return on investment [Indiscernible] digital spending. So I think the JCPenney and SPARC team will do kind of similar to what others, but we would never tell a retailer what they should do. If they want to compare notes, we're happy to do that, but that's just not our style. And again,-- and we try to -- it's really important. This other business that we're in is not our -- it's a very small part of our business. It's under 10% at the end of the day. We have no cash adjustment in it. So I've got -- I'm just talking cash-on-cash return, let's go simple math. I've taken distributions, cash distributions in both SPARC and Penney that basically has me at a zero net investment. And it will -- they'll have volatility with the earnings like any other retailer, and that's just the way of the world. And it's all upside, frankly. And these businesses are importantly, and this is very important, they're very well positioned. They're very well positioned to weather if this continues, which we kind of expected to. They're very well positioned to weather any storm because as a simple example, JCPenney has $1.3 billion of liquidity, just to throw that out there. So I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: David, a question on -- following up on the retailer platform income. The NOI this year was like $116 million in the year. Last year, it was $195 million. So is this some of the volatility that you're talking about? And just curious what drove that mark? And if I can do a footnote for a sort of quasi second question, you mentioned something about the value brands in your retailer platform, having trouble, but the other brands were doing well. Maybe just a little bit more comment on that.\nDavid Simon: Yes. Look, Alex, it was $0.19 for the quarter. So we can spend a lot of time on it. But the reason I went through with you is because we have no cash investments in these businesses. So I'm happy to go through it, but let's put it in perspective, please. The point is -- yes. So let's just talk about SPARC. SPARC, Nautica, Brooks Brothers, Lucky did great, above budget. Eddie Bauer, above budget, so on. The only softness we really saw was a little bit in the team market at Arrow, a little bit in the fast fashion business in F21 and a little bit in JCPenney. We -- and we also -- as we told everyone at the beginning of the year, we had significant integration costs at SPARC with respect to the Reebok transaction. So that -- and obviously, that closed, and we saw some of that in the second quarter. So that's the status. Everything -- we also had a management change in F21, which we think will be for the better. That happened, I believe, at the beginning of the year. We've got our -- we also had our new CEO at Penney, which also happened last year. So they're absolutely greatly positioned. We've got all the confidence in the world and it's a retailer and there'll be ups and downs, $0.19 added $2.96, okay? That's the math and no investment -- no cash investment, okay? So I think I answered it, but if there's something you'd like me to dwell on more than I did, I'm happy to do. Well, I guess that's the one question, right? So it's over, right? Go ahead, Alex. I'll let you -- because I like you, go ahead. What else you got?\nAlexander Goldfarb: Well, then I'll ask you one other question. You guys are always financially savvy and you buy back stock. I'm imagining that buying back debt is not attractive just given where your outstanding debt coupons are or has the disruptions in the debt markets giving you opportunity to buy certain pieces of paper?\nDavid Simon: Well, we unencumbered -- the reason we have lower interest expense is because we unencumbered assets. We have that flexibility. So we don't like the mortgage market, unlike some others. We just write a check, and we -- that's why we have lower interest expense compared to last year, and I did the Q-over-Q because we can write a check and just unencumber it.\nBrian McDade: At a lower cost.\nDavid Simon: At a lower cost. So we look at that all the time. And that may not be buying debt back, but it's more or less the same thing. Ends in the same result.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: David, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the leasing pipeline. It was nice to see the occupancy up as much as it was from Q1 to Q2. But could you talk a little bit more about the pipeline, the types of tenants? And when you sort of look at the demand, if you sort of were to try and bifurcate the portfolio maybe by sales, I guess, how different is the demand for the really strong centers versus maybe centers in the middle and the lower end of the portfolio?\nDavid Simon: Well, again, our lower end is just not -- just to get -- it's a good question because we don't put these numbers in, but our EBITDA weighted -- this excludes TRG, but our EBITDA weighted sales are $954 a foot. Our average base rent actually increased 70 basis points -- at 73, 41 versus 70, 287. So -- and that's what's driving our NOI, right, because it's the bigger properties. Look, it is across the board. It's also across the retail type. It's restaurants. It's entertainment. It's obviously the high-end folks, but it's a -- and I don't like naming retailers. Rick does, but bother me, and he's not here to do it. So -- but we have value-oriented retailers that are on very much aggressive opening program. So it really is across the board. Only the best properties get the high-end folks. We're seeing a big rebound in Vegas. Florida is on fire. California spying the sea legs. Westchester and Roseville Field are all coming back as the suburb. So Midwest has been stable. So we're seeing it across the board by retailer, by price point, by geography, by mix pretty much across the board. And -- so I mean I'm not -- it's not really granular and you probably wanted names. But -- and we have not seen, thankfully, even with the -- with what's going on in the world. We really haven't seen anyone back out of deals of note at all. And I said this last quarter, I said it this quarter in my prepared remarks. The U.S. is the -- let's hope the U.S., we don't screw it up. But the U.S. is the bastion of growth for the world compared to -- because we know China is with the way COVID is dealt with there, that's going to have ebbs and flows. And I think our economy is still pretty healthy. Consumers in good shape. I think the growth will continue in the U.S., and I think the future is bright here.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer: I just wanted to drill in a little bit more on capital allocation. Obviously, raised the dividend here again was active on the buyback in the quarter in just a couple of months. Put out these kind of press releases as well about some of the kind of the new and renewed development projects. So I just wanted to kind of maybe hear you kind of maybe rank or just kind of discuss the different options for capital allocation here. And I know external growth is always maybe an option as well. You talked about it last quarter, but maybe if you could just kind of rank the different options here with your capital and excess free cash flow.\nDavid Simon: Well, look, as a REIT, it will always be the dividend. So that would -- I mean, it's hard to rank it. But I think clearly, the dividend we have to pay out 90% to 95% of our taxable income. There's a difference to you pay out 90% technically versus 95%. But you got to pay out 95% of our taxable income. We're fortunate to be highly -- we had taxable income. So we pay out close to -- we're at 100% of our taxable income. That's growing. So that's going to be paid out in cash. Obviously, we've modified that twice in our history. One was COVID, obviously, when we were shut down and two was in The Great Recession. So that always will rank number one. Two is we -- our stock is just -- we look at other REITs. We look at other S&P 500 companies. We look at our balance sheet. We look at the fact that we're a cash flow company that generates cash, return on equity, we make deals like SPARC that gets all our money back, and we have free cash flow. We can't figure out our value. So the reality is the market -- we have refuted e-commerce, taking the malls down. We have still COVID. Our business is strong, growing in the enclosed mall business. In the enclosed mall business is strong, yet we have naysayers out there that don't believe it, but we believe it. So our stock is cheap, and we're going to keep buying stock back. And then I think we have a duty to make our properties as efficient and as attractive as we can to the consumer. I mean, obviously, we have to do it with a remind -- we had to do it with a return on investment methodology, i.e., if we had a property and we spent all this money on and got no return, we wouldn't do it. But where we can do that, that's what we should do and we will do that and then the external stuff I don't really care about. And if it's there and it makes sense, we'll do it. We have the flexibility to do it. But I'd rather do the dividend, buy our ridiculously cheap stock back, make our existing portfolio better and then every once in a while, we'll have great new development to do they'll do it because that also is a core competency of ours that we'll do. And that's how I look at it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDerek Johnston: Yes. So on real estate, Phipps Plaza, slated for an October open or relaunch, let's say. So David, I believe you took roughly a and NOI offline to develop. So upon stabilization, what NOI contribution from this project is expected? And really, should we look at this as one of the key earnings accretion blueprints looking ahead with other mixed projects?\nDavid Simon: Yes. Thank you. I'm happy to talk on real estate. And look, I mean, Phipps is fantastic story because we took an old department store. It had was an underperformer, had 14 acres. We couldn't redevelop it. We're going to spend around $350 million, and we're going to get about a $35 million of NOI just on that. But more importantly -- well, I shouldn't say more importantly, in addition to that, -- and eventually, we'll show everybody what we did, but we -- the leasing momentum that we have created there in terms of retenanting, re-leasing Phipps is staggering. So Phipps, again, we don't really disclose that. But my guess is the existing property will increase by roughly 30% NOI when we're done with it, if not more without that -- not including the incremental that's what I just mentioned. But because of all the retenanting and more importantly, we will have all of the best brands when we're done with it, and that's ongoing. That won't all be done probably until '24 because some of the other existing retailers have leases, and they're coming over after that. But we're taking a quiet mall and making it -- and it's going to be, I think, the hub of activity in a great area in Buckhead and a lot of good stuff is happening in Atlantic at the same time. But yes, the simple answer to your question is I would hope to do that in Brea, Ross Park, go down the list. But yes, we have a ton of those opportunities and the mixed use -- most of our real estate is really well located and adding the mixed-use components, especially residential really does add a lot of synergy, a lot of mojo of the property. So we hope for that to continue.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg McGinniss: David, hopefully, easy two-part for you. But how is the broader economic environment adjusted the process for adding projects to development pipeline, then how it increases in construction costs and labor shortages impacted pipeline returns and time lines?\nDavid Simon: Let me talk time lines. The only -- the biggest issue that we're having on time lines is in what I call in the restaurant industry in that some of the equipment required to open restaurants does have a backlog. This -- the storefront improvement is increasing. Obviously, tenants are very, very focused on that, not affecting timing, but it is something that we're watching has not affected deal flow or deal economics. And I do think the good news when it comes to at least materials, we are at a lower level than we were a few months ago. So on a timing side, it's really just equipment for restaurants. On our return development, nothing -- yes, we have a little bit more here and there, but nothing that is going to ultimately decide to go from a go project to a negative. If anything, in a lot of these cases, we're planning on higher income, so they seem to be getting basically the same returns. But we're not -- nothing has changed dramatically that would suddenly scratch the project.\nGreg McGinniss: If I could just add just real quick to that. What about now that you have a lower priced stock to investment in the stock versus redevelopment expense side\nDavid Simon: I think we can do both. I think we -- and again, I mean, some of these things, we really want folks to focus on others in our sector. When you put us in perspective, we're buying stock back. We're not issuing equity, and we're raising our dividend. I don't -- there are very few and you can define the sector anyway you want, and I don't want -- but there's not many -- we're just built a little bit differently even though we may be in the same industry, we were built differently, okay. And so that's the important point, and that's why we really try to emphasize it much like we emphasize SPARC about some of the mathematical differences about our company beyond just we're in the same business. It is math. At the end of the day, you got to run your business, so the math works. But yes, I'd like buying our stock back. But like I said, I do think we have a duty to continue to invest in our portfolio as long as we see the right return on investment on that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Mueller: The year-over-year ABR per square foot looks pretty strong at about up 5%. Is there anything out of the ordinary driving that?\nDavid Simon: No, I just think we've worked well together and the portfolio is in great shape and driving -- and we're driving growth out of it collectively. So it's all good.\nOperator: Our next question is from Floris Gerbrand Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.\nFloris Gerbrand Van Dijkum: Last quarter, you indicated that your signed not open pipeline was around 200 basis points, I believe, and it was a little bit higher in the malls than the outlets. I was curious if you can give an update on that. And also maybe, David, you've got these retailers. Are you -- everybody has been talking about a glut of inventory, will you create outlet stores for some of your retailers? And where else are you seeing some of the demand for the outlets coming from? Is there more luxury potentially that's coming to the outlets or homewares? Or where -- what other segments do you think will expand into the outlet business?\nDavid Simon: I'll let Brian answer the -- it was very clever to get two questions. I'll let Brian answer the first, and then I'll take a shot at the second part.\nBrian McDade: Floris, we're still hovering right around 200 basis points in the second quarter.\nDavid Simon: And then I would say -- the big, big retailers had a glut of inventory. We -- the luxury guys do not have a glut of inventory, okay? So that's not happening. And to the extent that -- the SPARC brands, by and large, are already in a lot of outlets, some of ours. A lot or not ours. There's really no change in plan. Maybe there's been a few -- some of the brands, not just SPARC but elsewhere had a few pop-ups. But net ebbs and flows, I don't think, Floris, there's any interesting dynamic going on that. And there's not a lot of folks with a glut of inventory as far as I can see, I mean, obviously, some bigger folks. But most of those guys want to plug through their existing system, and there is no -- the higher-end folks, there's no glut of inventory that we see.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nVince Tibone: Could you drill down a little more on sales trends during the quarter? Did sales start to slow down at all in the back half of the quarter as inflation accelerated and recession period increased?\nDavid Simon: No. No, not really. So it was -- I mean, not really. We didn't really -- in fact, in July, in a lot of cases, we saw a little bit better results recently. So no real trend there, Vince.\nVince Tibone: That's good to hear. That's helpful. And then just maybe 1 follow-up to that. Are you seeing any difference in tenant sales performance between the higher end and luxury tenants versus the more three brands, presumably the latter would be more impacted by the inflation issues?\nDavid Simon: I would absolutely -- we definitely have seen that where the value-oriented retailers or -- there's no question the consumer that is pressed on discretionary income is dealing with a very difficult situation with food, obviously, gas and dwelling. So -- and they're reining in their spend. So there's no question about that. But we're -- but we haven't really seen that at all in kind of the better brands. And like I mentioned earlier, SPARC, like the Brooks Brothers, the luckies of the world are doing very well. But where you do see it a little bit is in the value-oriented retailer or the younger consumer that suddenly gas has taken a lot out of the pocket book.\nOperator: Our next question is from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Schmidt: Domestic same-store NOI was up 3.6% compared to 7.5%. It looks like a lot of it was due to the tougher comps in second quarter. And in that case, it seems like the comps only get more difficult third and fourth quarter. Is that why the same-store number might actually be going down for the second half of the year? Or is it the macro factors?\nDavid Simon: No. I mean, Craig, we were really clear. We're actually outperforming what we thought. We -- Q1 of last year had the big benefit of going up against COVID, right? So now we were really, really clear what we saw overall, and we've been outperforming. And I think we'll outperform our initial guidance of 2%, but that's nothing other than that or normal seasonality of the business, Craig. Yes. I mean this is better than our plan and is consistent with our plan, even though the trend is above our plan.\nCraig Schmidt: So your leasing year-to-date, if you will, is strong enough that you think that -- has it continued in July? And do you think you could continue despite some of the macro factors?\nDavid Simon: Well, I've said that several times. Yes, the answer is we have not -- our pipeline is as strong as it's been. We're doing a bunch of new deals. Now Craig, you know when you sign a lease, the store doesn't open tomorrow in a lot of cases. And this is really, really important for everyone to understand, we're very optimistic because a lot of the leasing that we've done really doesn't open until '23, '24. So not only are we outperforming our budget this year off a strong last year, but we actually feel really good that as we get these stores open that we leased to over the last 6, 9 months. That will continue to fuel positive comp NOI. Thank you, Craig.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: On the guidance, the low end of the range has come up, the high end relatively flat at a time when you're seeing softening of sales at your lower income brand. So my question is, what's implied for the performance of the base business in the second half kind of relative to what you saw in the domestic and international operations in the second quarter? Maybe said another way, how sensitive is your performance to the macro environment? And what's the outlook for percentage rents?\nDavid Simon: Well, it's a very -- look, I think we feel really positive about the portfolio, the results that will generate from the portfolio. And again, the higher income consumer is still spending money. And if anything, I think if you go back in history and actually, Tom did a very good piece on that. If any of you're interested, you can call Tom. He'll go through it with you. Our business and our industry actually tends to outperform during recessionary environments to the extent that we get there and maybe we're in one, maybe we're not, I'll stay out of that political definition primarily because the big ticket items suddenly go toward kind of what we sell at our product. So -- and that's kind of somewhat of an insurance policy and it's historically always proved to be very positive. So even in every recession, other than COVID when we were told to shut down, our cash flow from our properties was flat. It did not decrease. So Tom has a great paper on it. If you're interested, we'll charge you, but we'll give you the data. I think the same case will be here. We'll -- if we do get into a full-blown recession, our cash flow will be positive. It won't maybe grow is high. We'll have some exposure on sales, but we do see the big tickets kind of go away and they move toward the items that we sell in our properties. And again, I think you asked something about SPARC -- again, it's really just a couple of the brands. It's also going against a great year. And again, let's have a bigger picture view of that business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. \nJuan Sanabria: Just wanted to ask with regards to the month-to-month leases that are still on the books are a little bit higher than the historical average. Should we expect that to stay there? Or are you still comfortable kind of for higher rents? Or how are you thinking current context?\nDavid Simon: Yes. I think that's more a function of documentation than dealmaking in that we don't put that done until signed and a lot of our bigger renewals have been done over the last 2, 3, 4 months, and all that's being documented. So I would expect that, that number would continue to go down, but we have no fear in that number.\nOperator: Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Dave, I guess a question on -- a follow-up on the seasonality of NOI in the first half of this year. Second quarter NOI was lower than the first quarter based on supplemental in both periods, which is unusual. How are operating expenses impacting typical seasonality? And what's embedded in the profit this year?\nDavid Simon: Yes. We didn't gather your first question. Could you please repeat it?\nHaendel St. Juste: First question on the impact of seasonality and the sequential NOI for 1Q to 2Q. 2Q looked lower than 1Q, which is unusual. And so I was actually asking how operating income\nDavid Simon: I think -- I don't -- see, I don't think the NOI was lower quarter over -- sequentially quarter-over-quarter. You think -- we do have a lot of companies hit in overage rent in the first quarter because their leases end in January 31. And so you pick some of that up in Q1, but that's not -- that would be the only reason.\nHaendel St. Juste: And on OpEx, any color on how the impacting seasonality or perhaps what's your expectation embedded in the 2% in sort of mentioned\nDavid Simon: Again, I'm sorry, but your connection is really not so good.\nBrian McDade: We're not really seeing much inflation just yet in operating expenses. As you think about us, we've got long-term contracts that protect us from material increases.\nDavid Simon: And we did increase our operating expenses $0.05. We did have a negative $0.05 for the quarter there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question\nKi Bin Kim: Just a follow-up on Haendel's question. Your NOI from Klepierre and HBS also increased pretty significantly in 2Q over Q1. Also curious about how much of that is sustainable in a run rate perspective or if there's some onetime items?\nDavid Simon: Well, no. Klepierre was shut down last quarter. So this is kind of more -- I mean, last year this quarter. So this is -- they're still not firing on all cylinders, so we'd expect future growth here. So comparing to Q2 of '21 compared to Q2 of '22, Q2 of '21, they were under a lot of restrictions and in some places closed. And HBS is so small. It's insignificant. But there's no real change there. We -- it's a lease that pays a certain amount of rent every month. So it's -- there's no very little growth other than like the normal step-ups. Very small, but the change is.\nKi Bin Kim: I actually meant sequentially. That sequentially -- I actually meant that sequentially, it increased by, I think, $10 million as well.\nDavid Simon: Well, we did a restructuring. So that's part of it.\nBrian McDade: And they're doing better, quite honestly. They're announced results in strong results. So I think you're seeing that starting to come through our results as well.\nKi Bin Kim: And I'm not sure if I missed it or not, but any kind of commentary you can share on what the lease spreads look like in 2Q? And given that you're close to 94% occupancy, as you continue to increase in that, what kind of pricing power do you expect to gain when you start to reach 95% or 96% occupancy?\nDavid Simon: Well, rents are all moving in the right direction and our spreads are moving in the right direction, too.\nOperator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLinda Tsai: On the guidance, original guidance was domestic NOI of 2% growth and year-to-date, it's 5.6%. So is there any update to the 2%?\nDavid Simon: As we've said for several years, we do not update that. We give you our best guess at the beginning of the year. It's all part of our plan. We disclosed what we think the number is. Well, we do not update it quarter-to-quarter other than as we've said, we're pretty confident we're going to beat our initial expectations.\nLinda Tsai: And then can you talk about what you're most focused on from an ESG perspective in 2022? And what are some initiatives where we might see some progress?\nDavid Simon: Well, we -- I mean that's a -- I don't have enough time to go through it. But obviously, we're -- it's across the enterprise. And obviously, from an operating point of view, a lot of it continues to be focused on reducing our carbon footprint, but -- and giving back to the communities, which we do in a lot of different ways. But it's a -- that's a very long. Please read our report. If you don't have it, there's a link, I'm sure, Tom can give it to you. But it's certainly focused on -- the big item is focusing on reducing our carbon footprint.\nOperator: We have reached at the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to Mr. David Simon for closing remarks.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Thank you. I believe that's our allotted time. So thanks for everybody's questions. And any follow-up, please call Tom and Brian. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for participation.",

            "content": "Thank you. Pleased to report our second quarter results. Second quarter funds from operations were $1.1 billion or $2.96 per share prior to a noncash unrealized loss of $0.05 from a mark-to-market and fair value of publicly held securities. Let me walk you through the big variances for this quarter compared to Q2 of 2021. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter and contributed $0.13 of growth driven by higher rental income of $0.09, strong performance in Simon Brand Ventures and short-term leasing of $0.05. TRG contributed $0.04 of growth, and they were partially offset by higher operating costs of approximately $0.05. Our international operations posted strong results in the quarter and increased $0.10. Lower interest rate -- interest expense contributed $0.03, and these $0.26 of positive contributions were partially offset by the headwind from a strong U.S. dollar of $0.03 and a $0.19 lower contribution from our other platform investments, principally from JCPenney and a couple of brands within SPARC. These costs include --these included costs associated with JCPenney's launch of new brands, the recent Reebok transaction and the integration costs associated with that and a softening of sales from our value-oriented brands due to inflationary pressures on that consumer. We generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which was $200 million higher than the first quarter of this year. And we have generated $2.2 billion for the first 6 months of the year. Domestic property NOI increased 3.6% year-over-year for the quarter and 5.6% for the first half of the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties, grew 4.6% for the quarter and 6.7% for the first 6 months. Occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 93.9%, an increase of 210 basis points and TRG was at 93.4%. The number of tenant terminations this year has been at record low levels. Average base rent increased -- average base minimum rent increased for the third quarter in a row and was at $54.58. Leasing momentum accelerated across our portfolio. We signed nearly 1,300 leases for more than 4 million square feet in the quarter, have signed over 2,200 leases for more than 7 million square feet through the first half of the year, and we have a significant number of leases in our pipeline. Nearly 40% of our total leasing activity in the first 6 months of the year has been new deal volume. This is up approximately 25% from last year. Retail sales continued. Mall sales volumes for the second quarter were up 7%. Our reported retailer sales per square foot reached another record in the second quarter at $746 per square foot for the malls and the outlets combined, which was an increase of 26%, $674 for the mills, a 29% increase. TRG was at $1,068 per square foot, a 35% increase. We began our national outlet shopping day, which was very successful from shoppers and participating retailers offering a timely first-of-its-kind power shopping experience. More than 3 million shoppers visited our premium outlets and mills over the shopping weekend. Feedback following the event has been tremendous from both our retailers and consumers. We're already planning next year's event, which we expect to be bigger. So please stay tuned on that. Our occupancy cost at the end of the quarter are the lowest they've been in 7 years, 12.1% in Q2 of 2022. Now our other platform of investments, let's talk about it. We were pleased with the results of our investments in the platform for the second quarter. They contributed approximately $0.21 in FFO, even though we were down from last year's terrific results, primarily, as I mentioned, continued investment and the inflationary pressures that have developed. Based on our distributions -- based upon our cash distributions received, we have no cash equity investment in SPARC and JCPenney. And in fact, we have parlayed our SPARC investment into our investment in ABG that is now worth over $1 billion. There will be a little more volatility from quarter-to-quarter when it comes to SPARC and JCPenney, but please keep in -- this in the proper perspective. It's all upside from here. During the quarter, we also, as I mentioned, had our mark on our SoHo and Lifetime Holdings of $0.05. A reminder on that it's a noncash mark, and we would expect that those companies would bounce back. We completed the refinancing of 14 property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of $1.6 billion at an average interest rate of 3.75%. We reduced our share of total indebtedness by more than $650 million. And once again, our balance sheet is strong. We had $8.5 billion of liquidity. $8.5 billion. Today, we announced our dividend of $1.75 per share for the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 17%. This will be payable at the end of the third quarter, September 30. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $144 million. And let me point out while other companies in our sector are paying little or no dividends and issuing equity, we are repeatedly raising our dividend and buying our stock back. We have now returned more than $37 billion of capital to our shareholders since we've been public. $37 billion. Given our current view of the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.60 to $11.75 per share to the new range of $11.70 to $11.77 per share, which compares to a comparable number of last year of $11.44 per share. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.06 at the midpoint of the range. The guidance comes in the face, obviously, of a strong U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and the inflationary pressures that are out there in the marketplace. So let me conclude. I'm pleased with our second quarter results. Our business is strong. The higher income consumer is in good shape, brick-and-mortar stores are where the shoppers want to be, outpacing e-commerce across the world and the broad retail spectrum. Demand for our space is extremely strong. Worldwide retailers need to grow, and they're doubling down on the U.S. International tourism is returning. Domestic tourism is strong. Our redevelopment pipeline is growing with exciting projects. And in addition to our newly announced premium outlet, new developments and expansions, we are experienced at managing our business through volatile periods, including leveraging our existing platform for operating efficiencies, allocating capital appropriately, managing risks. We are not over our skis in any aspect of our business. I encourage you to look at our track record. We outperform in these kinds of periods, and we also do some of our best work as well. So thank you, operator. We're ready for any questions at this moment. Well, thank you, Michael, for that question. So look, we're not presumptuous to tell any retailer under any circumstance how to run their business. So it's really entirely up to them on how they see fit, how to manage inventory et cetera. And just our own experience within SPARC, we have several brands. And we did see some softness in the more value-oriented brands. And again, we do think that pressure on the consumer with respect to food, housing, obviously, gas, and they reined it in. But again, I think the important thing to keep in mind, Michael, is even with that said, we were profitable. We had an unbelievably strong year last year with Penney and SPARC. We're still projecting really high EBITDA growth for these companies. And even though they're -- obviously, their consumers being cautious, back-to-school so far is off to a good start. Our traffic is actually pretty good. And I think just from our own operating experience, the SPARC management team and the Penney, I think, do what a lot of retailers do. They rein in discretionary capital. They watch the overhead. They really don't close stores because stores are profitable to them. They watch marketing expenses that -- they're very focused on the payback when it comes to return on investment [Indiscernible] digital spending. So I think the JCPenney and SPARC team will do kind of similar to what others, but we would never tell a retailer what they should do. If they want to compare notes, we're happy to do that, but that's just not our style. And again,-- and we try to -- it's really important. This other business that we're in is not our -- it's a very small part of our business. It's under 10% at the end of the day. We have no cash adjustment in it. So I've got -- I'm just talking cash-on-cash return, let's go simple math. I've taken distributions, cash distributions in both SPARC and Penney that basically has me at a zero net investment. And it will -- they'll have volatility with the earnings like any other retailer, and that's just the way of the world. And it's all upside, frankly. And these businesses are importantly, and this is very important, they're very well positioned. They're very well positioned to weather if this continues, which we kind of expected to. They're very well positioned to weather any storm because as a simple example, JCPenney has $1.3 billion of liquidity, just to throw that out there. So I hope that answers your question. Yes. Look, Alex, it was $0.19 for the quarter. So we can spend a lot of time on it. But the reason I went through with you is because we have no cash investments in these businesses. So I'm happy to go through it, but let's put it in perspective, please. The point is -- yes. So let's just talk about SPARC. SPARC, Nautica, Brooks Brothers, Lucky did great, above budget. Eddie Bauer, above budget, so on. The only softness we really saw was a little bit in the team market at Arrow, a little bit in the fast fashion business in F21 and a little bit in JCPenney. We -- and we also -- as we told everyone at the beginning of the year, we had significant integration costs at SPARC with respect to the Reebok transaction. So that -- and obviously, that closed, and we saw some of that in the second quarter. So that's the status. Everything -- we also had a management change in F21, which we think will be for the better. That happened, I believe, at the beginning of the year. We've got our -- we also had our new CEO at Penney, which also happened last year. So they're absolutely greatly positioned. We've got all the confidence in the world and it's a retailer and there'll be ups and downs, $0.19 added $2.96, okay? That's the math and no investment -- no cash investment, okay? So I think I answered it, but if there's something you'd like me to dwell on more than I did, I'm happy to do. Well, I guess that's the one question, right? So it's over, right? Go ahead, Alex. I'll let you -- because I like you, go ahead. What else you got? Well, we unencumbered -- the reason we have lower interest expense is because we unencumbered assets. We have that flexibility. So we don't like the mortgage market, unlike some others. We just write a check, and we -- that's why we have lower interest expense compared to last year, and I did the Q-over-Q because we can write a check and just unencumber it. At a lower cost. So we look at that all the time. And that may not be buying debt back, but it's more or less the same thing. Ends in the same result. Well, again, our lower end is just not -- just to get -- it's a good question because we don't put these numbers in, but our EBITDA weighted -- this excludes TRG, but our EBITDA weighted sales are $954 a foot. Our average base rent actually increased 70 basis points -- at 73, 41 versus 70, 287. So -- and that's what's driving our NOI, right, because it's the bigger properties. Look, it is across the board. It's also across the retail type. It's restaurants. It's entertainment. It's obviously the high-end folks, but it's a -- and I don't like naming retailers. Rick does, but bother me, and he's not here to do it. So -- but we have value-oriented retailers that are on very much aggressive opening program. So it really is across the board. Only the best properties get the high-end folks. We're seeing a big rebound in Vegas. Florida is on fire. California spying the sea legs. Westchester and Roseville Field are all coming back as the suburb. So Midwest has been stable. So we're seeing it across the board by retailer, by price point, by geography, by mix pretty much across the board. And -- so I mean I'm not -- it's not really granular and you probably wanted names. But -- and we have not seen, thankfully, even with the -- with what's going on in the world. We really haven't seen anyone back out of deals of note at all. And I said this last quarter, I said it this quarter in my prepared remarks. The U.S. is the -- let's hope the U.S., we don't screw it up. But the U.S. is the bastion of growth for the world compared to -- because we know China is with the way COVID is dealt with there, that's going to have ebbs and flows. And I think our economy is still pretty healthy. Consumers in good shape. I think the growth will continue in the U.S., and I think the future is bright here. Well, look, as a REIT, it will always be the dividend. So that would -- I mean, it's hard to rank it. But I think clearly, the dividend we have to pay out 90% to 95% of our taxable income. There's a difference to you pay out 90% technically versus 95%. But you got to pay out 95% of our taxable income. We're fortunate to be highly -- we had taxable income. So we pay out close to -- we're at 100% of our taxable income. That's growing. So that's going to be paid out in cash. Obviously, we've modified that twice in our history. One was COVID, obviously, when we were shut down and two was in The Great Recession. So that always will rank number one. Two is we -- our stock is just -- we look at other REITs. We look at other S&P 500 companies. We look at our balance sheet. We look at the fact that we're a cash flow company that generates cash, return on equity, we make deals like SPARC that gets all our money back, and we have free cash flow. We can't figure out our value. So the reality is the market -- we have refuted e-commerce, taking the malls down. We have still COVID. Our business is strong, growing in the enclosed mall business. In the enclosed mall business is strong, yet we have naysayers out there that don't believe it, but we believe it. So our stock is cheap, and we're going to keep buying stock back. And then I think we have a duty to make our properties as efficient and as attractive as we can to the consumer. I mean, obviously, we have to do it with a remind -- we had to do it with a return on investment methodology, i.e., if we had a property and we spent all this money on and got no return, we wouldn't do it. But where we can do that, that's what we should do and we will do that and then the external stuff I don't really care about. And if it's there and it makes sense, we'll do it. We have the flexibility to do it. But I'd rather do the dividend, buy our ridiculously cheap stock back, make our existing portfolio better and then every once in a while, we'll have great new development to do they'll do it because that also is a core competency of ours that we'll do. And that's how I look at it. Yes. Thank you. I'm happy to talk on real estate. And look, I mean, Phipps is fantastic story because we took an old department store. It had was an underperformer, had 14 acres. We couldn't redevelop it. We're going to spend around $350 million, and we're going to get about a $35 million of NOI just on that. But more importantly -- well, I shouldn't say more importantly, in addition to that, -- and eventually, we'll show everybody what we did, but we -- the leasing momentum that we have created there in terms of retenanting, re-leasing Phipps is staggering. So Phipps, again, we don't really disclose that. But my guess is the existing property will increase by roughly 30% NOI when we're done with it, if not more without that -- not including the incremental that's what I just mentioned. But because of all the retenanting and more importantly, we will have all of the best brands when we're done with it, and that's ongoing. That won't all be done probably until '24 because some of the other existing retailers have leases, and they're coming over after that. But we're taking a quiet mall and making it -- and it's going to be, I think, the hub of activity in a great area in Buckhead and a lot of good stuff is happening in Atlantic at the same time. But yes, the simple answer to your question is I would hope to do that in Brea, Ross Park, go down the list. But yes, we have a ton of those opportunities and the mixed use -- most of our real estate is really well located and adding the mixed-use components, especially residential really does add a lot of synergy, a lot of mojo of the property. So we hope for that to continue. Let me talk time lines. The only -- the biggest issue that we're having on time lines is in what I call in the restaurant industry in that some of the equipment required to open restaurants does have a backlog. This -- the storefront improvement is increasing. Obviously, tenants are very, very focused on that, not affecting timing, but it is something that we're watching has not affected deal flow or deal economics. And I do think the good news when it comes to at least materials, we are at a lower level than we were a few months ago. So on a timing side, it's really just equipment for restaurants. On our return development, nothing -- yes, we have a little bit more here and there, but nothing that is going to ultimately decide to go from a go project to a negative. If anything, in a lot of these cases, we're planning on higher income, so they seem to be getting basically the same returns. But we're not -- nothing has changed dramatically that would suddenly scratch the project. I think we can do both. I think we -- and again, I mean, some of these things, we really want folks to focus on others in our sector. When you put us in perspective, we're buying stock back. We're not issuing equity, and we're raising our dividend. I don't -- there are very few and you can define the sector anyway you want, and I don't want -- but there's not many -- we're just built a little bit differently even though we may be in the same industry, we were built differently, okay. And so that's the important point, and that's why we really try to emphasize it much like we emphasize SPARC about some of the mathematical differences about our company beyond just we're in the same business. It is math. At the end of the day, you got to run your business, so the math works. But yes, I'd like buying our stock back. But like I said, I do think we have a duty to continue to invest in our portfolio as long as we see the right return on investment on that. No, I just think we've worked well together and the portfolio is in great shape and driving -- and we're driving growth out of it collectively. So it's all good. I'll let Brian answer the -- it was very clever to get two questions. I'll let Brian answer the first, and then I'll take a shot at the second part. And then I would say -- the big, big retailers had a glut of inventory. We -- the luxury guys do not have a glut of inventory, okay? So that's not happening. And to the extent that -- the SPARC brands, by and large, are already in a lot of outlets, some of ours. A lot or not ours. There's really no change in plan. Maybe there's been a few -- some of the brands, not just SPARC but elsewhere had a few pop-ups. But net ebbs and flows, I don't think, Floris, there's any interesting dynamic going on that. And there's not a lot of folks with a glut of inventory as far as I can see, I mean, obviously, some bigger folks. But most of those guys want to plug through their existing system, and there is no -- the higher-end folks, there's no glut of inventory that we see. No. No, not really. So it was -- I mean, not really. We didn't really -- in fact, in July, in a lot of cases, we saw a little bit better results recently. So no real trend there, Vince. I would absolutely -- we definitely have seen that where the value-oriented retailers or -- there's no question the consumer that is pressed on discretionary income is dealing with a very difficult situation with food, obviously, gas and dwelling. So -- and they're reining in their spend. So there's no question about that. But we're -- but we haven't really seen that at all in kind of the better brands. And like I mentioned earlier, SPARC, like the Brooks Brothers, the luckies of the world are doing very well. But where you do see it a little bit is in the value-oriented retailer or the younger consumer that suddenly gas has taken a lot out of the pocket book. No. I mean, Craig, we were really clear. We're actually outperforming what we thought. We -- Q1 of last year had the big benefit of going up against COVID, right? So now we were really, really clear what we saw overall, and we've been outperforming. And I think we'll outperform our initial guidance of 2%, but that's nothing other than that or normal seasonality of the business, Craig. Yes. I mean this is better than our plan and is consistent with our plan, even though the trend is above our plan. Well, I've said that several times. Yes, the answer is we have not -- our pipeline is as strong as it's been. We're doing a bunch of new deals. Now Craig, you know when you sign a lease, the store doesn't open tomorrow in a lot of cases. And this is really, really important for everyone to understand, we're very optimistic because a lot of the leasing that we've done really doesn't open until '23, '24. So not only are we outperforming our budget this year off a strong last year, but we actually feel really good that as we get these stores open that we leased to over the last 6, 9 months. That will continue to fuel positive comp NOI. Thank you, Craig. Well, it's a very -- look, I think we feel really positive about the portfolio, the results that will generate from the portfolio. And again, the higher income consumer is still spending money. And if anything, I think if you go back in history and actually, Tom did a very good piece on that. If any of you're interested, you can call Tom. He'll go through it with you. Our business and our industry actually tends to outperform during recessionary environments to the extent that we get there and maybe we're in one, maybe we're not, I'll stay out of that political definition primarily because the big ticket items suddenly go toward kind of what we sell at our product. So -- and that's kind of somewhat of an insurance policy and it's historically always proved to be very positive. So even in every recession, other than COVID when we were told to shut down, our cash flow from our properties was flat. It did not decrease. So Tom has a great paper on it. If you're interested, we'll charge you, but we'll give you the data. I think the same case will be here. We'll -- if we do get into a full-blown recession, our cash flow will be positive. It won't maybe grow is high. We'll have some exposure on sales, but we do see the big tickets kind of go away and they move toward the items that we sell in our properties. And again, I think you asked something about SPARC -- again, it's really just a couple of the brands. It's also going against a great year. And again, let's have a bigger picture view of that business. Yes. I think that's more a function of documentation than dealmaking in that we don't put that done until signed and a lot of our bigger renewals have been done over the last 2, 3, 4 months, and all that's being documented. So I would expect that, that number would continue to go down, but we have no fear in that number. Yes. We didn't gather your first question. Could you please repeat it? I think -- I don't -- see, I don't think the NOI was lower quarter over -- sequentially quarter-over-quarter. You think -- we do have a lot of companies hit in overage rent in the first quarter because their leases end in January 31. And so you pick some of that up in Q1, but that's not -- that would be the only reason. Again, I'm sorry, but your connection is really not so good. And we did increase our operating expenses $0.05. We did have a negative $0.05 for the quarter there. Well, no. Klepierre was shut down last quarter. So this is kind of more -- I mean, last year this quarter. So this is -- they're still not firing on all cylinders, so we'd expect future growth here. So comparing to Q2 of '21 compared to Q2 of '22, Q2 of '21, they were under a lot of restrictions and in some places closed. And HBS is so small. It's insignificant. But there's no real change there. We -- it's a lease that pays a certain amount of rent every month. So it's -- there's no very little growth other than like the normal step-ups. Very small, but the change is. Well, we did a restructuring. So that's part of it. Well, rents are all moving in the right direction and our spreads are moving in the right direction, too. As we've said for several years, we do not update that. We give you our best guess at the beginning of the year. It's all part of our plan. We disclosed what we think the number is. Well, we do not update it quarter-to-quarter other than as we've said, we're pretty confident we're going to beat our initial expectations. Well, we -- I mean that's a -- I don't have enough time to go through it. But obviously, we're -- it's across the enterprise. And obviously, from an operating point of view, a lot of it continues to be focused on reducing our carbon footprint, but -- and giving back to the communities, which we do in a lot of different ways. But it's a -- that's a very long. Please read our report. If you don't have it, there's a link, I'm sure, Tom can give it to you. But it's certainly focused on -- the big item is focusing on reducing our carbon footprint. Okay. Thank you. I believe that's our allotted time. So thanks for everybody's questions. And any follow-up, please call Tom and Brian. Thank you."

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I’m pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: I’m pleased to report our first quarter results. First quarter funds from operations were $1.046 billion or $2.78 per share prior to a non-cash unrealized loss of $0.08 from a mark-to-market in fair value of publicly held securities. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter. Our international operations posted strong results in the quarter, despite being negatively impacted from the surging U.S. dollar. We are also very pleased with the results from our other platform investments. We generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year period. Domestic property NOI increased 7.5% year-over-year for the quarter and our international properties as I mentioned performed well, driving portfolio NOI growth to 8.8% occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 93.3%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to the prior year and a decrease of only 10 basis points compared to are seasonally high fourth quarter year-end of 2021. The number of tenant terminations in the first quarter was the lowest recorded in the last five years. And our TRG portfolio occupancy was 93.2% at quarter-end, average base minimum rent increased compared to the fourth quarter and was $54.14. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 900 leases for more than 3 million square feet in the quarter and had a significant number of leases in our pipeline. In fact, at our recent leasing deal committee, we approved the most deals since 2016 and overall, we recently have approved approximately 500 new deals representing 2 million square feet. Demand is very strong and interesting with the volatility of the world, our portfolio in the U.S. is in great demand from worldwide brands, restaurants, and entertainment operators, as most retailers and tenants view the U.S. as the place to be. Sales momentum continued for our retailers, mall sales volume for the first quarter were up 19% year-over-year, we reported retail sales per square foot reached another record in the first quarter at $734 per square foot, for the mall and outlet combined 43% increase and 669 per square foot for the Mills, which was a 50% increase. TRG reported 1,038 per square foot, which was a 52% year-over-year increase. Our occupancy cost is the lowest that we’ve had in seven years. We are pleased with the results of our other platform investments in the first quarter, including SPARC Group and J.C. Penney. J.C. Penney’s liquidity position is strong at $1.3 billion and it has no borrowings on its line of credit and performed better than planned. I can say the same for SPARC, which also performed better than planned in the quarter. SPARC also completed the U.S. Reebok transaction, and we anticipate great things from this iconic brand. Remember we expect Reebok to incur operating losses for SPARC in 2022, due to the integration aspects of the transaction. SPARC financial position like Penney is strong with the recent refinancing of its ABL, and it is in fact, a net cash positive position. During the quarter, however, our investments in Soho House and Life Time Holdings, which both became public companies at the end of last year were impacted by overall market volatility, driving an $0.08 unrealized non-cash mark-to-market. These are high quality businesses that fit with our flywheel of unique companies, and we believe these investments will generate value above our bases as they fully reopen and reengage with their customers. On the balance sheet front, we completed very timely, a dual tranche U.S. senior notes offering that totaled $1.2 billion, including a 10-year fix rate offering at 2.65%. Early in the year, we used the net proceeds to pay off our amounts outstanding on our credit facility. We also refinanced seven mortgages for a total of $1.1 billion at an average interest rate of 2.92%. And our liquidity stands at $8 billion now. Today we announced our dividend of $1.70 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 21%. The dividend will be payable on June 30, including our dividends declared today, we paid more than $37 billion in dividends over our years as a public company, $37 billion. We also announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock repurchase program for up to $2 billion that will become effective on May 16. When we look at the valuation of our stock today at an FFO multiple of approximately 10 times relative to the historical valuations closer to 15 times, and an applied cap rate of around 7% for our real estate assets, we see substantial value in our stock, particularly given our belief and conviction in our future growth opportunities. Our balance sheet is strong, continues to be a significant advantage for us while our cash flow generation provides us with the flexibility to adapt as conditions warrant and as we have proved countless times. We will be thoughtful and opportunistic on the buyback and keep in mind, this is in addition to the more than 20% increase in our dividend we announced today. Now, given our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.50 to $11.70 per share to $11.60 to $11.75 per share, which compares to our comparable number of $11.44 last year. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the top or an 8% increase at the midpoint. This does not include the previously mentioned unrealized loss or gain that may occur the rest of the year on our fair value of investments that I mentioned and please keep in mind that this guidance increase comes in the face of a strong U.S. dollar and rising interest rates. Now, just to conclude, I’m pleased with our first quarter results. Tenant demand is excellent. And our real estate is a great hedge inflationary times, hopefully our operating results and our announced stock buyback authorization today reinforces that we are primarily focused internally and growing our existing platforms organically and I think that will conclude my comments. Ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi everyone, good evening. Maybe just on the guidance, I know you don’t like to give too many of the pieces, but given the current volatility in the market and macro uncertainties, which may or may not be impacting Simon guidance was increased slightly at the midpoint. So I was wondering if you could give some detail on some of the puts and takes, what’s performing ahead of your initial expectations versus what might be offsetting some of that upside surprise, maybe occupancy, leasing, retailer sales, interest rates, what everything’s most relevant.\nDavid Simon: Sure. I mean you’re right. The reason Caitlin, we don’t go through the detail is, we are a big company and there’s a lot going on and we think it’s better for the market just to focus on in our totality of our results, but what’s better is very simple. Our retail operations, which is our other retail properties is trending to be better than our plan. That’s number one. Most importantly, our property NOI growth is projecting to be better than plan. And the only negatives that are offsetting that are we have some exposure to floating rate debt. We’re probably at the very, very low end of other real estate companies, but we do have some. But we don’t have any commercial paper outstanding. We don’t have any outstanding on our line except for $125 million, which is primarily for tax purposes. And then obviously the strong dollar, when we bring back our foreign earnings, we have to do it at a lower dollar that that has a more meaningful impact than the rising interest rate environment. But so far demand is really, really good. I don’t want – we’re not – we don’t pound the table here too much we do sometimes we get carried away, but demand is great. Our leasing folks are very excited and our property NOI is better than what we anticipated, obviously because of the COVID a lot of restructurings on the leases and because of our high end tenant concentration and the amount of sales that they’ve had. I mean there’s volatility in that I cannot pinpoint exactly where our sales will come out on that. And that will have some impact on ultimately our results, but we try to give you a range here that we feel very comfortable that we can produce.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Thanks to that. I think the suggestion or guide is one question, so I’ll stop there.\nDavid Simon: You’re very kind to follow the rules. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRich Hill: Hey, good evening. I’ll try to follow Caitlin’s lead and follow the rules as well. Hey David, income from unconsolidated entities was a pretty healthy number this quarter, in the past 1Qs, it’s been slightly negative. We modeled it negative in the quarter to be conservative. So I’m just maybe wondering if you can walk us through what your expectations were for income consolidated entities versus how it actually played out?\nDavid Simon: Sure. I’ll turn that over to Brian to walk you through actually put together, yes, a piece of paper there for you guys in the 8-K to walk you through that, because I know it’s not confusing to us, but it might be to you. So hopefully this will help. Brian, take it over.\nBrian McDade: Hey, Hey Rich, Brian here. So we did add some additional disclosure to our supplement to breakdown our income from an unconsolidated entities. As you can see the driver of the changes, our joint venture activity on our property side, including the performance of our international portfolio, which David highlighted in open remarks. \nDavid Simon: And remember, international last year, really was suffering from more of a lockdown than the U.S. portfolio. Yes.\nRich Hill: Got it. And I am allowed to ask a follow-up question if I were to follow the rules?\nDavid Simon: Sure. So if you did it so politely, yes, and you’re gentlemen, we’re happy to hopefully – go ahead. Go ahead.\nRich Hill: Brian, I’m sorry in advance of a to answer the dumb question, but the negative $18.5 million you reported for TRG, including amortization of excess investment. What is sort of that as a clean number and happy to take it offline, but I’m actually just trying to back out how well TRG did this quarter prior – compared to prior quarters given the…\nBrian McDade: The $18 million was primarily from the excess investment of our – for the Tobin purchase. So this is net income, remember, Richard.\nDavid Simon: Yes. So we have to – when you capture things, obviously, you put it to market value and then we amortize that investment over its life has nothing to do with cash flow.\nRich Hill: Okay. We can catch up later on Brian. Thank you.\nBrian McDade: No problem.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDerek Johnston: Hey everyone. Thank you. Just, I guess, I get one on the retailer NOI contribution or I think it’s the NOI from other platform investments. It was $26 million this quarter in first Q. But when I look at it versus last year, the contribution was I think around $3.5 million. So just wondering if you could walk us through the drivers and maybe the Delta between this quarter and last year.\nBrian McDade: Derek, the change is simply better performance out of our retailer investments in the first quarter of this year, relative to last year. There was still a lot of volatility still in the world. And there were definitely still closures throughout the U.S. specifically, California in the first quarter of last year. So the driver is just simply better performance out of the retailer investments.\nDavid Simon: It’s good news, by the way, just so you – I just don’t want you to be confused. It’s always good to have better performance. Thank you, Brian.\nBrian McDade: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Yes, I just want to put it in perspective. It’s good to have better performance. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSamir Khanal: Good evening, everybody. David, clearly the leasing environment is very strong. You talked about the 3 million square feet. But I was wondering if you could maybe provide color on sort of the pricing trends that you’re seeing in the portfolio, whether it’s the outlets or the malls – or the mills. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Yes. I would say, generically that – look, when I say this and it sounds hokey, but you have to create the win-win. But we are in a better position today to negotiate what we think is a fair deal for us than we were the last couple years. So we are absolutely seen the ability to get what we think is fair market value. And the good news is given the occupancy cost, our retailers are – we’re getting deals done. So we’re finding that happy win-win.\nSamir Khanal: Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey, good evening. So David, there was a fairly substantial increase in month-to-month leases, increasing from 1.9% to 5.4%. Just curious what the primary drivers there were and what the opportunity is for leasing those potentially to maybe longer-term leases?\nDavid Simon: Well, I think what you’re seeing is the fact that we have some big account leasing that we are not rushing to do, but doing it in a thoughtful manner, because we – these are really good properties and really important for the retailer and we’re taking our time to get that done. And that’s really what you’re seeing. So whereas – last year or the year before, you might have seen a rush to get those signed up and in the door, we’re taking a more strategic approach to create the kind of the win-win that I talked to, I mentioned earlier. So it’s really part of our strategy and it’ll – my anticipation without the question that number will be way down for Q2.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. So this is just a during negotiation phase increase, but no kind of expectation for loss of those tenants and more so all shifting to long-term leases.\nDavid Simon: Absolutely not. And that was more of a decision on our side to get the right kind of deal that we have with some of our larger national accounts, so no issue there.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Haendel Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel Juste: Hey, good evening. Dave, I wanted to ask you about, I guess, capital allocation given where the stock price is. Now you put out the valuation discount. As you consider the debt market. I guess, would you buy back stock now? And then in the same answer, how are you thinking about acquisitions? There is rumor to be a very large seller out there, some pretty good malls. So just curious of under any scenario, would you be a buyer of some. Thanks?\nDavid Simon: Sure. Well, as I said to you earlier, I mean, we got the authorization because we want to buy our stock back because we think it’s under-valued. So because of the technicalities we really can’t get into the market until the 16. But this is not window dressing, I expect us to be in the market. And all I can say to you and I really don’t like to comment on the stuck that’s out there on M&A. But I would throw caution note to all that I would suggest that please don’t believe any rumours or media reports concerning our M&A activity, okay. We’re – we are very focused on what I said to you, see our – if you want to able to listen to my prepared remarks, you’ll see kind of what I said on that front we’re really, really focused internally. And obviously, given where the stock has performed over the last couple of months, I mean, we think it’s an opportunity to be opportunistic in terms of buying our stock back. So that’s kind of – I mean, again, that’s kind of how I look at things. So don’t believe what you read or any rumours out there. We’re really focused on growing our existing platforms and taking advantage of the opportunities that our lower stock price represents.\nHaendel Juste: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nConnor Mitchell: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So could you please tell us what percent of tenants are now on percent rent deals and how those tenants are performing in the current environment if different at all?\nDavid Simon: I don’t – I mean, every one of our retailers generally has a percent rent clause, not every single one of them. I mean, some of our big boxes and our department stores do not. But all of our small shop retailers usually have some kind of percent rent aspect to the weeks. So, that’s a high percent, so that’s number one. And number two, look so far, we’re in an uncertain environment as a global economy. But what I would say to you just general terms so far from the better, the higher income folks, we have not seen any kind of slowdown. There may be a little bit of slowdown on the lower income consumer obviously, unfortunately the inflation is a huge issue and we need to do everything we can to figure out as a world and in the country, figure out how to deal with the impact on inflation for the lower income consumer. But we are not – so far, we’re not seeing it in our portfolio.\nConnor Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Bilerman: Great. Thank you. David, you talked a little bit about spending a lot of time internally, obviously leasing the portfolio. I was wondering if you can update us a little bit sort of on the external front, in terms of retailer investments or technologic – technology investments. I know you still have the SPAC out there, which obviously that market’s gotten a little choppier. But just how much time and what sort of opportunities are coming out of this macro environment for you to further moving this tanker towards a lot of those activities that you’ve been planting the seeds for a number of years.\nDavid Simon: I think Michael, our SPAC – we still have confidence in the SPAC. I mean, we have a clock running out. But we still have confidence that there’s a really good chance the SPAC will find a good opportunity. And I think the opportunity set clearly has increased given the market volatility even with existing public companies. And we were smart enough to not do a deal probably at the time after we raised the SPAC that would’ve been at the market top. So hopefully our investors in that obviously recognize that. And remember, this is immaterial for Simon Property Group. But I want to say that. So on the external front, I mentioned to you earlier, right now, we are really focused internally. Now we’re investing in all of the platforms that we have in our existing portfolio. Lots of redevelopment is still on the drawing board. And we’re – SPARC is making investments in its technology, Penney will be making investments. Those come from those entities, we don’t have to fund those. They’re self-sustaining, Penney has hundreds of millions of dollars of EBITDA. So they’re funding themselves. But right now our focus is what I mentioned to you before. And look, if we see an interesting add on here or there, or bolt-on for one of our properties or one of our investments, maybe there’s some capital allocation. But I think right now it’s capital allocation I see is either to the shareholders or to grow our existing book of business.\nMichael Bilerman: David, just as a follow-up, just in terms of just understanding sort of the value to Simon and the value for shareholders of all these investments you’ve made. The Board back in, I think it was like mid-February, granted, I think it was about $36 million to five senior executives. And I think a little bit more to 18 others for the successful investment in ABG. Now, I recognize you haven’t made money, you’ve exchanged stakes, you’ve invested more capital. But maybe just to step back, can you sort of share a little bit, at least at the Simon group level, how much of these investments have made for which the Board then paid the cash out to executives?\nDavid Simon: Well, I don’t even know how to answer that, Michael. I’m not going to talk about comp on this call. If you are an investor, would like to talk to our comp Chairman, we’re happy to arrange that for one of your investors directly. I think what you’re referring to is, we’ve made $1 billion on our ABG investment. And that was kind of – we were moonlighting in that activity, and I’ll leave it at that, but thanks for your question. And our Comp Committee Chair is available to any institutional investors and shareholders on the rationale for what they did, but we’ll move on from now.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. Yes. We’ve just been – we got asked what the math was [indiscernible].\nDavid Simon: We’re – like I said, any institutional investor, we’re more than happy to set up a phone call with our Chair of our Comp Committee. Thank you, Michael.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. Thank you, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good afternoon. Domestic property NOI growth was up 7.5% in the first quarter, which implies you’re expecting NOI growth to be only marginally positive for the remainder of the year based on the 2% NOI growth guidance you gave last quarter. Just given the contractual rent bumps and year-over-year occupancy gains that you should experience each quarter, what factors are negatively impacting the growth rate for the rest of the year?\nDavid Simon: Well, I don’t – again, we – it’s a completely appropriate question, and I thank you for that. We gave guidance, NOI guidance at the beginning of the year. We are always trying to be conservative, and we always hope to outperform it. We don’t update it during the year. But I have confidence based upon what I know today, that we’ll outperform our initial guidance. Obviously, we have a little more variability than maybe – and then again, I don’t want to overdramatize this, but we have a little more variability than maybe we did 10 years ago, because of the overage rent that we’ve structured. I think we’ve actually structured it pretty smartly, but it does create a little more variability. And that’s our only – that’s the only thing that’s out there to throw some caution to the wind. What we see now, we expect to outperform, but it’s – we don’t update it and it is an uncertain world, but we’re working extremely smartly and diligently to outperform our initial property NOI expectations, without a doubt.\nVince Tibone: If I may just kind of squeeze in a follow-up. I mean just is it – how should we think about leasing economics here? Because you took away the disclosure on the leasing spreads or a few quarters ago, which I think made sense, given it was no longer really conveying a ton of useful information. But just – because I think what I’m trying to get at is guidance implying that are releasing spreads could be negative or – like I’m just trying to figure out what the pullback years of expense is, because I get the variability portion. But to your point, is that…\nDavid Simon: Yes, I’m sorry, Vince, I didn’t mean to cut you off. It really is – it really does boil down to the sales part of the equation. It’s not – we’re seeing better rents than we anticipated. And we are seeing – look, if you Again, I don’t want to get into this, and we tried to get everybody to do the spreads the way we did it. But no one was interested in really doing what we did. If you really read the footnotes, and I don’t want to get into it, but it’s kind of – it’s comical what rent spreads are. Words are different, whatever. It’s not really important. Point is, the way you really see it is what is our portfolio NOI. And that manifests itself with everything, operating expenses, sales-based rent, overage rent, et cetera, occupancy. Our rents are firming. Our – if you really would do like just space to space, our spreads are basically positive and because we went through a lot of pain in the last couple of years. And again, because the overage was really quite exciting last year. We just don’t know if we can be as excited this year, and that’s why we’re being a little cautious, but we’re off to a good start.\nVince Tibone: Thank you. That’s helpful. Additional color.\nDavid Simon: Thank you , Vince.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMike Mueller: Yes. I’m curious, has your view on the pace or the magnitude of the occupancy recovery changed meaningfully thinking about for the next few years since the beginning of the year?\nDavid Simon: I would say to you, if I understand your question, I think, we are really happy at the pace of our accelerating occupancy and clearly based upon last year, I think we’re ahead of where we thought we would be. And I’m hoping that to get the occupancy up to kind of where we were prior to the COVID. So I think, we’re – and I mean demand again until the lease is signed, until it’s a piece of paper until I get that first month rent, it ain’t over until it’s over, but we feel pretty good. And like I mentioned in the call, I mean our terminations were at the lowest level they’ve been in a long, long time and our deal committee, I think we’ve had a – we have a really good leasing group. They’re energetic. They’re grinding away. They’re working. I mean, we’ve turned our leasing group kind of not over, but we’ve added a lot of new talent to the organization. And I think we’re in a pretty good spot, assuming, things are continue to be macro, continue to be reasonable. I don’t think we need, last year’s results, but I just, and don’t underestimate and I’m rambling on here. But don’t underestimate that our interest in our domestic portfolio is worldwide and as retailers or restaurant tours or entertainment operators, they’re not looking at China, South America’s a tough market for them, Europe is, it’s got the recovery play because of the COVID lockdown, but it’s relatively flat. And obviously you got the Ukraine issue, which is more there than here. And so the growth for the worldwide retailers is in the U.S. We were not at the top of mine three, four years ago. That was China. It is here, it’s happening domestic. So that’s exciting.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. So it sounds like the past couple of months really hasn’t derailed that at all?\nDavid Simon: Not at all.\nMike Mueller: Okay. That was it. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: Hi, good afternoon. How are you thinking about distribution channels for the various brands within your SPARC platform? What’s the best way to maximize the reach and visibility of these retailer investments?\nDavid Simon: Well, they still love physical stores. I think if I – look, I think each brand is different. So with Arrow, it’s the physical stores and the e-commerce with Nautica it’s stores, but wholesale business is very important. Brooks Bothers is a combination of e-commerce, wholesale and stores. Forever 21, the stores are really important. That’s the big differentiating factor it has compared to some of its peers. On the other hand, it needs to improve via e-commerce business. So it really within SPARC, there’s different brands and it really depends on the brand, but don’t underestimate. And I think, what we’ve seen since COVID, I mean, let’s not forget when we had COVID everybody said the stores are out of business, no stores, e-commerce, what we’re seeing is generally out performance, way out performance in the physical world, less performance on the internet or and that’s not just for our brands, but across every, essentially every retailer.\nLinda Tsai: And then how does JCPenney fit in there as a distribution channel?\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, they have their stores and their e-commerce business. I think the store business is doing well. And I think over time they’ll improve their e-commerce.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGreg Smith: Yes, thanks. David, what percent of expiring rents in 2022 have been addressed? And are you primarily working on 2023 at the ICSC leasing convention?\nDavid Simon: Well, we would, again, I think you missed part of the earlier call. So I’d say to you by the end of Q2, well, probably be in the 70%, 75% range of all of our leasing activity for 2022. And I would say we are doing a combination, at this point now you’re really more focused on 2023 deals, but we’re doing a combination of finishing lease to get lease assigned this year, some may open, but a lot of them opened in for 2023. And then I think the primary focus on at ICSC will be a new business, 2023 business.\nGreg Smith: Great. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, thanks for the time. Just wanted to talk a little bit about investment opportunities external. I know you said not to listen to what’s out there in the press, but not withstanding. Do you see better opportunities or would Simon be more interested the real estate company investing more in high-quality malls? Or is the idea of maybe looking at shopping center real estate kind of interesting, given what we’ve seen in some of the changes with COVID and consumer behaviors?\nDavid Simon: Well, that’s the policy. I mean, I don’t – I mean, our mall – outdoor versus indoor, our mall business is doing great. So I think that’s – and I would say to you one, good real estate can be indoors. It could be outdoors. It could be hybrid, and they don’t get carried away in the physical plan of great real estate. It could be a mixed use. It could be an outdoor center. It could be a big enclosed mall like Houston Galleria. So I know a lot of people spin it that way, but I will tell you, good retail real estate can come in a lot of different forms, a lot of different forms. So we’re not – we’re just – I can’t really answer the question because there’s not one project that we’re pursuing right now. And – like I said earlier, we think the opportunities – the greatest opportunities lie within Simon Property Group.\nJuan Sanabria: And just if I can, a quick follow-up. You mentioned you think your cap rate – your implied cap rate’s around 7%. What do you think high-quality malls are valued at today, given the move in interest rates? And just curious what your thoughts are on valuations.\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean I don’t know. I mean I know I wouldn’t be selling our stuff at a 7% cap rate. That’s all. I can only speak for myself.\nJuan Sanabria: Fair enough. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead. \nMichael Goldsmith: Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. David, we touched a lot on the outlook. But does the updated guidance consider any changes in expectation for the retailer investments for 2022? And then the $0.15 to $0.20 of additional investment expected for the year, what’s the expected cadence? Is that equally distributed through the year? Or is that hitting harder in the first or second half?\nDavid Simon: Okay. The first question is not really on the retail side. We’re anticipating more or less if they come in on plan. And then I didn’t follow. Brian, did you understand the second part of the question?\nBrian McDade: Can you repeat it, please?\nDavid Simon: Yes, Michael\nMichael Goldsmith: Last quarter, you talked about $0.15 to $0.20 of additional investment expected in the year, what’s the expected cadence of that?\nDavid Simon: Yes. That’s – okay. That’s what I thought, but I want to make sure. So Reebok closed. SPARC bought the U.S. operations of Reebok at the end of February, if I remember correctly. And we think that will come out most of – it’s kind of – it probably will come out in the Q2, Q3. But it’s not really – it’s kind of a work in progress or when those operating losses will take hold. They incur certain operating losses, I should say, they, we. SPARC concurs. Certain operating losses is part of the deal and then they’re capped, and it really is just a function of when those come. It’s – but we know it’s limited to kind of the number that I gave to you – but that’s probably a Q2, Q3 event.\nBrian McDade: Got to ramp up, Michael. So they’ve got to actually incur the cost to have the – so it’s just going to take a little bit of time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum [Compass Point]. Please go ahead.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Thanks for taking my question. David, maybe you touched upon the fact that your occupancy cost is low. If you could just – can you share that occupancy cost? And also, what was your occupancy cost prior to COVID and how quickly will you get back to those kinds of levels in your view?\nDavid Simon: Yes. So our – the number right now is 12.3%. What was it? What was – no, no, before COVID. No, it was higher than that. That was higher than that. Anyway, we’ll give you the number where it was pre-COVID, but I thought it was in the kind of the high 13%, 14% range. But we’ll get you – what was it?\nBrian McDade: 13 and change.\nDavid Simon: 13 and change. And look, I can’t tell you how long it’s going to take a function of it is just marking leases to market. But it’s fortunate for us and our retailers that they’re profitable in our stores. And yet, at the same time, we can mark the rents up to market and be able to grow our business, too. So that’s what we’re trying to achieve.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Great. And if I can maybe have a follow-up as well. Obviously, you cited your leased occupancy. What is the gap between occupied and leased space right now? And how do you see that trending over the next couple of quarters. And presumably, some of that lease space could be anchors, which could be slower to get online. So is that gap always going to be – remain steady? Or do you expect that to narrow over the next 12 months?\nDavid Simon: I think Tom can give you the exact numbers later, but I mean both trends are in the moving in the right direction. So Tom, to get you the actual numbers, but both are moving in the right direction. And I think that the gap between the two in a good market like we have now will narrow.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Great. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Sure. I think – oh, sorry, go ahead, sir.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Mr. David Simon for closing remarks.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Thank you and I’m sure we’ll see some of you in the next few weeks. Thank you.\nBrian McDade: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "I'm pleased to report our first quarter results. First quarter funds from operations were $1.046 billion or $2.78 per share prior to a non-cash unrealized loss of $0.08 from a mark-to-market in fair value of publicly held securities. Our domestic operations had an excellent quarter. Our international operations posted strong results in the quarter, despite being negatively impacted from the surging U.S. dollar. We are also very pleased with the results from our other platform investments. We generated $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year period. Domestic property NOI increased 7.5% year-over-year for the quarter and our international properties as I mentioned performed well, driving portfolio NOI growth to 8.8% occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 93.3%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to the prior year and a decrease of only 10 basis points compared to are seasonally high fourth quarter year-end of 2021. The number of tenant terminations in the first quarter was the lowest recorded in the last five years. And our TRG portfolio occupancy was 93.2% at quarter-end, average base minimum rent increased compared to the fourth quarter and was $54.14. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 900 leases for more than 3 million square feet in the quarter and had a significant number of leases in our pipeline. In fact, at our recent leasing deal committee, we approved the most deals since 2016 and overall, we recently have approved approximately 500 new deals representing 2 million square feet. Demand is very strong and interesting with the volatility of the world, our portfolio in the U.S. is in great demand from worldwide brands, restaurants, and entertainment operators, as most retailers and tenants view the U.S. as the place to be. Sales momentum continued for our retailers, mall sales volume for the first quarter were up 19% year-over-year, we reported retail sales per square foot reached another record in the first quarter at $734 per square foot, for the mall and outlet combined 43% increase and 669 per square foot for the Mills, which was a 50% increase. TRG reported 1,038 per square foot, which was a 52% year-over-year increase. Our occupancy cost is the lowest that we've had in seven years. We are pleased with the results of our other platform investments in the first quarter, including SPARC Group and J.C. Penney. J.C. Penney's liquidity position is strong at $1.3 billion and it has no borrowings on its line of credit and performed better than planned. I can say the same for SPARC, which also performed better than planned in the quarter. SPARC also completed the U.S. Reebok transaction, and we anticipate great things from this iconic brand. Remember we expect Reebok to incur operating losses for SPARC in 2022, due to the integration aspects of the transaction. SPARC financial position like Penney is strong with the recent refinancing of its ABL, and it is in fact, a net cash positive position. During the quarter, however, our investments in Soho House and Life Time Holdings, which both became public companies at the end of last year were impacted by overall market volatility, driving an $0.08 unrealized non-cash mark-to-market. These are high quality businesses that fit with our flywheel of unique companies, and we believe these investments will generate value above our bases as they fully reopen and reengage with their customers. On the balance sheet front, we completed very timely, a dual tranche U.S. senior notes offering that totaled $1.2 billion, including a 10-year fix rate offering at 2.65%. Early in the year, we used the net proceeds to pay off our amounts outstanding on our credit facility. We also refinanced seven mortgages for a total of $1.1 billion at an average interest rate of 2.92%. And our liquidity stands at $8 billion now. Today we announced our dividend of $1.70 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 21%. The dividend will be payable on June 30, including our dividends declared today, we paid more than $37 billion in dividends over our years as a public company, $37 billion. We also announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock repurchase program for up to $2 billion that will become effective on May 16. When we look at the valuation of our stock today at an FFO multiple of approximately 10 times relative to the historical valuations closer to 15 times, and an applied cap rate of around 7% for our real estate assets, we see substantial value in our stock, particularly given our belief and conviction in our future growth opportunities. Our balance sheet is strong, continues to be a significant advantage for us while our cash flow generation provides us with the flexibility to adapt as conditions warrant and as we have proved countless times. We will be thoughtful and opportunistic on the buyback and keep in mind, this is in addition to the more than 20% increase in our dividend we announced today. Now, given our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.50 to $11.70 per share to $11.60 to $11.75 per share, which compares to our comparable number of $11.44 last year. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the top or an 8% increase at the midpoint. This does not include the previously mentioned unrealized loss or gain that may occur the rest of the year on our fair value of investments that I mentioned and please keep in mind that this guidance increase comes in the face of a strong U.S. dollar and rising interest rates. Now, just to conclude, I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Tenant demand is excellent. And our real estate is a great hedge inflationary times, hopefully our operating results and our announced stock buyback authorization today reinforces that we are primarily focused internally and growing our existing platforms organically and I think that will conclude my comments. Ready for questions. Sure. I mean you're right. The reason Caitlin, we don't go through the detail is, we are a big company and there's a lot going on and we think it's better for the market just to focus on in our totality of our results, but what's better is very simple. Our retail operations, which is our other retail properties is trending to be better than our plan. That's number one. Most importantly, our property NOI growth is projecting to be better than plan. And the only negatives that are offsetting that are we have some exposure to floating rate debt. We're probably at the very, very low end of other real estate companies, but we do have some. But we don't have any commercial paper outstanding. We don't have any outstanding on our line except for $125 million, which is primarily for tax purposes. And then obviously the strong dollar, when we bring back our foreign earnings, we have to do it at a lower dollar that that has a more meaningful impact than the rising interest rate environment. But so far demand is really, really good. I don't want – we're not – we don't pound the table here too much we do sometimes we get carried away, but demand is great. Our leasing folks are very excited and our property NOI is better than what we anticipated, obviously because of the COVID a lot of restructurings on the leases and because of our high end tenant concentration and the amount of sales that they've had. I mean there's volatility in that I cannot pinpoint exactly where our sales will come out on that. And that will have some impact on ultimately our results, but we try to give you a range here that we feel very comfortable that we can produce. You're very kind to follow the rules. Okay. Thank you. Sure. I'll turn that over to Brian to walk you through actually put together, yes, a piece of paper there for you guys in the 8-K to walk you through that, because I know it's not confusing to us, but it might be to you. So hopefully this will help. Brian, take it over. And remember, international last year, really was suffering from more of a lockdown than the U.S. portfolio. Yes. Sure. So if you did it so politely, yes, and you're gentlemen, we're happy to hopefully – go ahead. Go ahead. Yes. So we have to – when you capture things, obviously, you put it to market value and then we amortize that investment over its life has nothing to do with cash flow. It's good news, by the way, just so you – I just don't want you to be confused. It's always good to have better performance. Thank you, Brian. Okay. Yes, I just want to put it in perspective. It's good to have better performance. Next question. Yes. I would say, generically that – look, when I say this and it sounds hokey, but you have to create the win-win. But we are in a better position today to negotiate what we think is a fair deal for us than we were the last couple years. So we are absolutely seen the ability to get what we think is fair market value. And the good news is given the occupancy cost, our retailers are – we're getting deals done. So we're finding that happy win-win. Sure. Well, I think what you're seeing is the fact that we have some big account leasing that we are not rushing to do, but doing it in a thoughtful manner, because we – these are really good properties and really important for the retailer and we're taking our time to get that done. And that's really what you're seeing. So whereas – last year or the year before, you might have seen a rush to get those signed up and in the door, we're taking a more strategic approach to create the kind of the win-win that I talked to, I mentioned earlier. So it's really part of our strategy and it'll – my anticipation without the question that number will be way down for Q2. Absolutely not. And that was more of a decision on our side to get the right kind of deal that we have with some of our larger national accounts, so no issue there. Sure. Sure. Well, as I said to you earlier, I mean, we got the authorization because we want to buy our stock back because we think it's under-valued. So because of the technicalities we really can't get into the market until the 16. But this is not window dressing, I expect us to be in the market. And all I can say to you and I really don't like to comment on the stuck that's out there on M&A. But I would throw caution note to all that I would suggest that please don't believe any rumours or media reports concerning our M&A activity, okay. We're – we are very focused on what I said to you, see our – if you want to able to listen to my prepared remarks, you'll see kind of what I said on that front we're really, really focused internally. And obviously, given where the stock has performed over the last couple of months, I mean, we think it's an opportunity to be opportunistic in terms of buying our stock back. So that's kind of – I mean, again, that's kind of how I look at things. So don't believe what you read or any rumours out there. We're really focused on growing our existing platforms and taking advantage of the opportunities that our lower stock price represents. Thank you. I don't – I mean, every one of our retailers generally has a percent rent clause, not every single one of them. I mean, some of our big boxes and our department stores do not. But all of our small shop retailers usually have some kind of percent rent aspect to the weeks. So, that's a high percent, so that's number one. And number two, look so far, we're in an uncertain environment as a global economy. But what I would say to you just general terms so far from the better, the higher income folks, we have not seen any kind of slowdown. There may be a little bit of slowdown on the lower income consumer obviously, unfortunately the inflation is a huge issue and we need to do everything we can to figure out as a world and in the country, figure out how to deal with the impact on inflation for the lower income consumer. But we are not – so far, we're not seeing it in our portfolio. Sure. I think Michael, our SPAC – we still have confidence in the SPAC. I mean, we have a clock running out. But we still have confidence that there's a really good chance the SPAC will find a good opportunity. And I think the opportunity set clearly has increased given the market volatility even with existing public companies. And we were smart enough to not do a deal probably at the time after we raised the SPAC that would've been at the market top. So hopefully our investors in that obviously recognize that. And remember, this is immaterial for Simon Property Group. But I want to say that. So on the external front, I mentioned to you earlier, right now, we are really focused internally. Now we're investing in all of the platforms that we have in our existing portfolio. Lots of redevelopment is still on the drawing board. And we're – SPARC is making investments in its technology, Penney will be making investments. Those come from those entities, we don't have to fund those. They're self-sustaining, Penney has hundreds of millions of dollars of EBITDA. So they're funding themselves. But right now our focus is what I mentioned to you before. And look, if we see an interesting add on here or there, or bolt-on for one of our properties or one of our investments, maybe there's some capital allocation. But I think right now it's capital allocation I see is either to the shareholders or to grow our existing book of business. Well, I don't even know how to answer that, Michael. I'm not going to talk about comp on this call. If you are an investor, would like to talk to our comp Chairman, we're happy to arrange that for one of your investors directly. I think what you're referring to is, we've made $1 billion on our ABG investment. And that was kind of – we were moonlighting in that activity, and I'll leave it at that, but thanks for your question. And our Comp Committee Chair is available to any institutional investors and shareholders on the rationale for what they did, but we'll move on from now. We're – like I said, any institutional investor, we're more than happy to set up a phone call with our Chair of our Comp Committee. Thank you, Michael. Well, I don't – again, we – it's a completely appropriate question, and I thank you for that. We gave guidance, NOI guidance at the beginning of the year. We are always trying to be conservative, and we always hope to outperform it. We don't update it during the year. But I have confidence based upon what I know today, that we'll outperform our initial guidance. Obviously, we have a little more variability than maybe – and then again, I don't want to overdramatize this, but we have a little more variability than maybe we did 10 years ago, because of the overage rent that we've structured. I think we've actually structured it pretty smartly, but it does create a little more variability. And that's our only – that's the only thing that's out there to throw some caution to the wind. What we see now, we expect to outperform, but it's – we don't update it and it is an uncertain world, but we're working extremely smartly and diligently to outperform our initial property NOI expectations, without a doubt. Yes, I'm sorry, Vince, I didn't mean to cut you off. It really is – it really does boil down to the sales part of the equation. It's not – we're seeing better rents than we anticipated. And we are seeing – look, if you Again, I don't want to get into this, and we tried to get everybody to do the spreads the way we did it. But no one was interested in really doing what we did. If you really read the footnotes, and I don't want to get into it, but it's kind of – it's comical what rent spreads are. Words are different, whatever. It's not really important. Point is, the way you really see it is what is our portfolio NOI. And that manifests itself with everything, operating expenses, sales-based rent, overage rent, et cetera, occupancy. Our rents are firming. Our – if you really would do like just space to space, our spreads are basically positive and because we went through a lot of pain in the last couple of years. And again, because the overage was really quite exciting last year. We just don't know if we can be as excited this year, and that's why we're being a little cautious, but we're off to a good start. Thank you , Vince. I would say to you, if I understand your question, I think, we are really happy at the pace of our accelerating occupancy and clearly based upon last year, I think we're ahead of where we thought we would be. And I'm hoping that to get the occupancy up to kind of where we were prior to the COVID. So I think, we're – and I mean demand again until the lease is signed, until it's a piece of paper until I get that first month rent, it ain't over until it's over, but we feel pretty good. And like I mentioned in the call, I mean our terminations were at the lowest level they've been in a long, long time and our deal committee, I think we've had a – we have a really good leasing group. They're energetic. They're grinding away. They're working. I mean, we've turned our leasing group kind of not over, but we've added a lot of new talent to the organization. And I think we're in a pretty good spot, assuming, things are continue to be macro, continue to be reasonable. I don't think we need, last year's results, but I just, and don't underestimate and I'm rambling on here. But don't underestimate that our interest in our domestic portfolio is worldwide and as retailers or restaurant tours or entertainment operators, they're not looking at China, South America's a tough market for them, Europe is, it's got the recovery play because of the COVID lockdown, but it's relatively flat. And obviously you got the Ukraine issue, which is more there than here. And so the growth for the worldwide retailers is in the U.S. We were not at the top of mine three, four years ago. That was China. It is here, it's happening domestic. So that's exciting. Not at all. Thank you. Well, they still love physical stores. I think if I – look, I think each brand is different. So with Arrow, it's the physical stores and the e-commerce with Nautica it's stores, but wholesale business is very important. Brooks Bothers is a combination of e-commerce, wholesale and stores. Forever 21, the stores are really important. That's the big differentiating factor it has compared to some of its peers. On the other hand, it needs to improve via e-commerce business. So it really within SPARC, there's different brands and it really depends on the brand, but don't underestimate. And I think, what we've seen since COVID, I mean, let's not forget when we had COVID everybody said the stores are out of business, no stores, e-commerce, what we're seeing is generally out performance, way out performance in the physical world, less performance on the internet or and that's not just for our brands, but across every, essentially every retailer. Well, I mean, they have their stores and their e-commerce business. I think the store business is doing well. And I think over time they'll improve their e-commerce. Well, we would, again, I think you missed part of the earlier call. So I'd say to you by the end of Q2, well, probably be in the 70%, 75% range of all of our leasing activity for 2022. And I would say we are doing a combination, at this point now you're really more focused on 2023 deals, but we're doing a combination of finishing lease to get lease assigned this year, some may open, but a lot of them opened in for 2023. And then I think the primary focus on at ICSC will be a new business, 2023 business. Thank you. Well, that's the policy. I mean, I don't – I mean, our mall – outdoor versus indoor, our mall business is doing great. So I think that's – and I would say to you one, good real estate can be indoors. It could be outdoors. It could be hybrid, and they don't get carried away in the physical plan of great real estate. It could be a mixed use. It could be an outdoor center. It could be a big enclosed mall like Houston Galleria. So I know a lot of people spin it that way, but I will tell you, good retail real estate can come in a lot of different forms, a lot of different forms. So we're not – we're just – I can't really answer the question because there's not one project that we're pursuing right now. And – like I said earlier, we think the opportunities – the greatest opportunities lie within Simon Property Group. Well, I mean I don't know. I mean I know I wouldn't be selling our stuff at a 7% cap rate. That's all. I can only speak for myself. Thank you. Okay. The first question is not really on the retail side. We're anticipating more or less if they come in on plan. And then I didn't follow. Brian, did you understand the second part of the question? Yes, Michael Yes. That's – okay. That's what I thought, but I want to make sure. So Reebok closed. SPARC bought the U.S. operations of Reebok at the end of February, if I remember correctly. And we think that will come out most of – it's kind of – it probably will come out in the Q2, Q3. But it's not really – it's kind of a work in progress or when those operating losses will take hold. They incur certain operating losses, I should say, they, we. SPARC concurs. Certain operating losses is part of the deal and then they're capped, and it really is just a function of when those come. It's – but we know it's limited to kind of the number that I gave to you – but that's probably a Q2, Q3 event. Yes. So our – the number right now is 12.3%. What was it? What was – no, no, before COVID. No, it was higher than that. That was higher than that. Anyway, we'll give you the number where it was pre-COVID, but I thought it was in the kind of the high 13%, 14% range. But we'll get you – what was it? 13 and change. And look, I can't tell you how long it's going to take a function of it is just marking leases to market. But it's fortunate for us and our retailers that they're profitable in our stores. And yet, at the same time, we can mark the rents up to market and be able to grow our business, too. So that's what we're trying to achieve. I think Tom can give you the exact numbers later, but I mean both trends are in the moving in the right direction. So Tom, to get you the actual numbers, but both are moving in the right direction. And I think that the gap between the two in a good market like we have now will narrow. Sure. I think – oh, sorry, go ahead, sir. Okay. Thank you and I'm sure we'll see some of you in the next few weeks. Thank you."

Before turning to the results, I would like to provide some perspective on our company as we celebrated our 30th anniversary as a public company in mid-December of last year. We have grown our company into a global leader of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations managing through and in some cases, very turbulent times. Over the last three decades from our base of 115 properties in 1993, we have acquired approximately 300 properties, developed more then 50, and disposed of approximately 250 resulting in our current domestic portfolio of about 215 assets. We expanded globally, and today have 35 international outlets, including world-renowned outlets in Asia, and our portfolio is differentiated by product type, geography enclosed and open-air centers located in large and dense catchment areas. Our portfolio is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet and a top management team. We are the largest landlords, the world's most important retailers, and not by accident, our diversified tenant base has solid credit, our mix is always changing and adapting, best illustrated by the fact that compared to 30 years ago, only one retailer is still in our current top 10 tenants. Our team's hard work has resulted in industry-leading results including some of the following; our annual revenue increased from $424 million to nearly $5.7 billion, our annual FFO generation increased 30 times from approximately $150 million to nearly $4.7 billion, a 12% CAGR. Total market capitalization has increased from $3 billion to $90 billion. We have paid over $42 billion in dividends to shareholders. We have assets in our portfolio that have been in business for more than 60 years. Those assets are still growing today with many generating a $100 million in NOI. These assets are in great locations, have a loyal and large customer base that is where the retailers want to be. No other asset type has longevity including the NOI generation and embedded future growth that these assets have, yes, they change. Yes, they evolve, yes they adapt, but yes, they also grow. Our collection of assets cannot be replicated. And there are hidden - always hidden opportunities within that. I want to thank the entire Simon team, who have contributed to 30 years of success as a public company. And now let me turn to our fourth quarter '23 results. We generated approximately $4.7 billion in funds from operation in 2023 or $12.51 per share and returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. For the quarter, FFO was $1.38 billion or $3.69 per share compared to $1.27 billion or $3.40 per share. Let me walk you through some of the highlights for this quarter compared to Q4 of 2022, domestic operations had a terrific performance this quarter and contributed $0.28 of growth primarily driven by higher rental income with lower operating expenses. Gains from investment activity in the fourth quarter were approximately $0.07 higher in a year-over-year comparison, other platform investments at $0.03 lower contribution compared to last year. FFO from our real estate business was $3.23 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $2.97 from last year. That's 8.7% growth and $11.78 per share for '23 compared to $11.39 last year. Domestic property NOI increased 7.3% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.8% for the year continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending operational excellence delivered results for the year, exceeding our initial expectations. Our NOI ended the year higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 7.2% for the quarter and 4.9% for the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the quarter, fourth quarter was 95.8%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to last year. The Mills occupancy was 97.8%, and occupancy is above year-end 2019 levels for all of our platforms. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 3.1% year-over-year and The Mills rents increased 4.3%, we signed more than 960 leases for approximately 3.4 million square feet in the fourth quarter. For the year, we signed over 4,500 leases, representing more than 18 million square feet approximately 30% of our leasing activity for the year were new deals, we're going-in rents of approximately $74 per square foot and renewals had going-in rents of approximately $65 per square foot. Leasing momentum for the last couple of years continues Into 2024. Reported retailer sales per square foot in the quarter was $743 for malls and outlets combined and $677 through The Mills. During the quarter, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG for gross proceeds of $300 million in cash and reported pretax and after-tax gains of $157 million and $118 million respectively. We opened our 11 outlet in Europe last year, construction continues on two outlets, yes, one in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and yes, one in Jakarta, Indonesia. We completed 13 significant re-developments. And we'll complete other major development projects this year. In addition, we expect to begin construction this year on five to six mixed-use projects representing around $800 million of spend from Orange County to Ann Arbor, to Boston, to Seattle, to Roosevelt Field, they are some of the ones that are planning to start this year. And we expect to fund these redevelopments to mixed-use projects with our internally generated cash flow of over $1.5 billion after dividend payments. During 2023, we completed $12 billion in financing activities, including three senior note offerings for approximately $3.1 billion including the Klépierre exchangeable offering. We recast and upsized our primary revolver credit facility to $5 billion and completed $4 billion of secured loan refinancings and extensions. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever, we have approximately $11 billion of liquidity. During 2023, we paid, as I mentioned earlier, $2.8 billion in common stock dividends. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of just over $110 per share in 2023, and today we announced our dividend of $1.95 per share for the first quarter and year-over-year increase of 8.3%. The dividend is payable on March 29 of 2024. Now moving onto 2024, our FFO guidance is $11.85 to $12.10 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions; domestic property NOI growth of at least 3%, increased net interest expense compared to 2023 of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 per share reflecting current market interest rates on both fixed and variable debt assumptions and cash balances. Contribution from other property, other platform investments of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share; no significant acquisition or disposition activity, and our current diluted share count of approximately 374 million shares. So, with that said. It's safe to say, we're excited to enter year '31 as a public company. Thank you for your time and we're ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good evening, David. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about kind of the leasing pipeline and where things stand today versus maybe the year ago and what sort of conversations are you having with the tenants and maybe how the pricing dynamic changed there, given that you're now kind of 95% leased and pretty full in the portfolio.\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, Steve, we're always adjusting our mix. We're always trying to - so even though we're 96% leased, we're always looking to improve our retailer mix and obviously, that's been beneficial to our NOI growth. I would say, just generically, obviously, I spend a lot of time myself on leasing and with my team on leasing. Demand remains very strong. And there is a real interest by all sorts of retailers and people that populate our shopping centers to be part of what we're doing it. So, I think as you probably saw our new deals are $74 a foot thereabouts, our renewals are $65 a foot, our expiring leases this year in the $56 - $57 range. So we're seeing generally positive spreads supply-and-demand is in our favor. Historically low supply in big properties across the country, I mean, there used to be 40 million square feet of retail real estate built every year, now there is essentially less than a few million here and there. So, and then there's been obsolescence too which makes the supply shrink as well. So - and then there's just great new retailers that we're very excited to do business with. I was on the West Coast seeing some of them. The importance of the bricks and mortar has never been higher. And the cost of all of the things that we said about, don't get me wrong e-commerce is critically important, but all of this stuff about e-commerce, cost of customer acquisition, returns, stickiness, et cetera, all continues to be a challenge. If you looked at the marketplaces, that pure online, they run into problems. So, you really - they really need to be connected to a bricks and mortar for survivability. So, all of those things are pointing to a positive picture, it's a function of execution. A function of being first a function of continuing to improve our properties, which we're very focused about, but now even though we've bounced back and had a couple of really good years in terms of lease-up from the depths of the pandemic, we're not finished and retail demand continues and it is strong and it's across the board. I mean, it's not one, category one retailer, but pretty much across-the-board.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks, that's it.\nDavid Simon: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, good evening, everyone. David, could you give some more detail on the ABG sale that you referenced, maybe how much you still own, how much you think your remaining OPI could be worth, and whether you plan to monetize more in '24 or maybe what could influence that decision?\nDavid Simon: Sure, well let me just - we sold about 2% of our ABG stock. So, we essentially went from just under 12 to just under 10. And we'll continue to look to monetize these investments, they've been by and large, very good investments across, not just the big ones, but the smaller ones as well. Obviously, there's number of them that are synergistic to us. But, we have a strict adherence to creating value. And we think we can deploy that capital into kind of what I'd call the mothership and can get better growth from that and that's where our number one priority will be. So, it wouldn't surprise me, Caitlin, for us to continue to monetize, obviously, the - some of these are bigger value - bigger investment. So, it's not that easy to do it in one big swoop, but We're very focused on portfolio management of those assets and If we can monetize and are we going to get a better return plowing it back into our core business.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it, thanks.\nDavid Simon: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. And first, congratulations on the anniversary. David, there is a lot of initiatives. So as you think about the next five years, I know it's probably difficult question, but Is there one or two key initiatives that you're most excited about as you think about the next five years?\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I'd say a couple of things. On the property level, there's no question that all of the mixed-use stuff that we're bringing in, plus the redevelopment of our department store boxes are probably the most interesting and exciting things that we're doing on the ground level. And so that would certainly be number one; number two is we're very excited about growing our outlet business in Southeast Asia. It's an incredibly robust market, young population and a growing - and I'm not, when I say Southeast Asia, I'm not like in Jakarta, places like that where it is not China, it is places like that where we see kind of what we can do in Japan and in Korea on the outlet side. Jeff you probably know that better than anybody. Based on your previous history with - in terms of that. So we - that's very exciting. I'd also say, we still are in the pursuit of bringing technology to our loyal consumers that allow them to handle enhance and their shopping experience with us. So, we've got a lot of initiatives on the marketing, loyalty. You know Simon search is a great example where our consumer either in property or pre-visit, can search our tenant base for what-if they're looking for a black dress where in this center can I buy it, what retail are obviously that ties into the marketplace we're building with premium outlets, there'll be some news there this year on that front. So, that whole system about customer interaction, reinforcing their shopping behavior, rewarding loyalty, expediting their trip to make it more useful is a big focus. And then as important, I think this is number four, really is just we've got to do a great job of continuing to evolve our retail mix. The exciting thing is, there are more-and-more entrepreneurs, there are more-and-more exciting retailers that are coming up with great concepts, proving them out, and then realizing that our centers are a good place for them to do business. So, those are the ones that come to mind, and I'm certain, there'll be ones that I haven't even thought of.\nJeff Spector: Very helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hi, good evening. Good evening out there, David. So, I think at the opening, you mentioned that NOI is now exceeding pre-pandemic, the dividend is within less than 10% of pre-pandemic and sort of - thinking about Jeff's and Steve's questions on reinvestment, as you think about getting back to that pre-pandemic dividend level, given the investment opportunities, especially, lack of supply, growing demand, people are once again really engaged in physical retail. Does that change your trajectory as you think about getting the dividend back to pre-pandemic, meaning, are there better investment opportunities with that capital or is the delta really a function of rising interest rates that's, meaning that the surpassing pre-pandemic NOI versus the dividend is really just a function of the higher interest expense now.\nDavid Simon: Well I mean, Alex, look, our yield is ridiculously hot, okay. So, that's really where we could financially pay $2.10 tomorrow, right. So, we have $1.5 billion of free cash flow after dividends. So, it has nothing to do with financial wherewithal. I mean we like our - we would like - we don't like trading at this high yield. So I think, I think that's kind of how we look at it, we still think as we have these, additional capital events. We still are anxious to continue to buy our stock back. And again, when I look at either the S&P 500, I look at the REIT peer group, I look at, what the strip center REITs - our yield is plenty high for investors. So tell all my investors, I could pay $2.10 tomorrow evening, okay, per quarter without a blink and our yield is too high. And, it will be there before you know it, but we would like to trade at a lower yield, because we think, certainly if you look at it on that basis, our yield is higher than it should be I mean, the S&P is under 102%, our REIT strip centers, Tom are in the 4s. We're close to s7, right - 6.5 - 7. So. I mean Alex, you should be pounding the table.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes, unfortunately, I'm a non-paying customer, the real customers are the ones listening to the call. We're just asking the questions.\nDavid Simon: No, I, I'm kidding. By the way, we're not - just so you know, we like you're welcome out there, we are west of the Hudson, but we're not going to tell you exactly where we are, okay? Somewhere in Indiana tonight, - we may not be in Indiana tonight, but we are west of the Hudson.\nAlexander Goldfarb: I assume you'll be in Las Vegas this Sunday.\nDavid Simon: Well, I can't tell you in my schedule.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon, and thanks a lot for taking my question. David, base minimum rents are up healthily in a low single-digit range year-over-year, while your tenant sales per square foot are down slightly. So, can you just talk a little bit about these dynamics. Is that a function of your range, kind of catching up to some of the street, the tenants have experienced before their sales have started to come down and just how long are these dynamics kind of sustainable like this? Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure . Good question, so I will say this. I think the rent - the going-in rents and renewals for new leases are very much sustainable. If you look at our occupancy costs, we are still at the low end of our historical range, and we're at 12.6% and we have run up to 14% plus before. And I would also, I would also caution report, these are the sales that our tenants are reporting to us, but they are somewhat affected by returns they it and so on. We actually think our sales per foot are higher than this. Some cases they have the ability to offset our returns in most cases, they don't. So, I just put that out there, so I wouldn't - and I mentioned this maybe two, three years ago, probably certainly pre-pandemic, but we report it. I know the market likes it. We actually think our sales were higher that come from our properties and then they are somewhat affected by returns. And we think some of - a lot of those returns are Internet sales returns. So, they don't even come from our properties. And so again, when we look at it, we feel like supply and demand, low occupancy cost, high retail sales, and just overall demand will be able to generate kind of the new leasing renewal spreads that we've seen over the last couple of years.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question. Floris, is your line on mute?\nDavid Simon: Floris. Looks like we lost for Floris.\nOperator: Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Mailman: Hi guys. Just - sorry. Just going back to maybe the reinvestments in here. You guys have plenty of cash after the dividend. And then just trying to curious at this point. What is the level of anchor box reinvestment you guys think you need to do just given what may be vacant today. And after you guys were spared kind of some of the recent Macy's closings. But just as you look at the portfolio today, kind of what do you think over the next two, three years, you guys could ultimately get back and have to re-tenant and just talked a lot about how the leasing environment is could. Just, what's the outlook for re-tenanting those boxes today? What's the targeted kind of make-up there and is luxury still doing enough to be able to be the primary kind of backfill option?\nDavid Simon: Well, on the - Craig, on the department store boxes, I don't have it off the top of my head, but the launch we own basically don't have a ton of work to do. We have a handful of boxes that we own that are in process, like for instance, I've mentioned Brea, but just briefly on the call, we did - that was a former Sears store we tore it down in development now under construction now. So the actual stores that we own are not many, probably under 10 at this point that are either currently under construction or in process. So, very small amounts of, kind of a less of an opportunity than you think. The ones that we felt Transformco still owns some boxes and so does Seritage. So you know well, in our properties. So, we'll see how that evolves. I mean, eventually some of those could be opportunities for us to buy and redevelop. We haven't made deals on those just because bid and the ask has been too great, but we - and I don't think luxury is really going to be the dominant theme on a lot of these mixed use - I'm sorry, on these boxes. I think a lot of it will be - continue to be a mixed-use development that we're doing. And obviously, opening up, if it's in a closed mall opening the center up with restaurants and entertainment and so on and it has worked very well. So, we have a number under construction or about to be under construction, but we don't really have that existing pipe that until we make more deals to buy some of the boxes back. It's not as big as you might think that it's only a handful. Now Macy's is right there, they announced some store closings none of which are ours. So, we're always very focused on knowing exactly where we might be at risk. And I would point out, very importantly when Sears went out of business, the whole market said, how are you going to survive, Sears going out of business. They had 800 department stores at that time, frankly they're down, I believe they were operating five, six, seven, eight. I think we actually have the most between us and the Taubman portfolio, but how are you going to survive, the fact of the matter is, it was a non-event to the mall customer, and If anything is we've gotten those boxes back. We've made the center better. So, as we look, we don't look at box - the changes in box as a concern, we view it really more aggressively and progressively. And that's something that will enhance the properties in the portfolio and the assets that we were worried about that couldn't survive that, basically don't exist in our portfolio anymore. So if you asked me that question 10 years ago, I might have a different answer.\nCraig Mailman: Great, thank you.\nDavid Simon: Craig, I hope you get better prior to the Citi Conference, I'm sure you well, but you sound like you've lost your voice.\nCraig Mailman: Yes. Hoping to be on the mend by then. Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: You will.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good evening . Could you help me better understand, how much incremental FFO, we should expect in '24 from development and redevelopment projects that stabilized either later in '23 or slated to be finished in '24, just any color to help us better understand the timing of incremental NOI and FFO from all the development activities would be helpful?\nDavid Simon: Yes, in fact, it's interesting you actually take us - I think in '24 we're taking a step back. I'll just give you a trivial example. And I mentioned, Brian now for the third time, but we have a whole wing that's connected to the former Sears department store that we're redeveloping. We'll have some outdoor shops, we're building Dick's Sporting Goods. We have a Lifetime Fitness resorts and then we'll do roughly 350 apartments or so, but that wing leading to Sears, we've had to de-lease it to ultimately put in, I am not sure, I am allowed to say it, but I'll say it anyway, Zara, Uniqlo and they won't open until end of '24, best-case. So. this advanced, by and large, all of this stuff in the U.K. that we've listed and I don't believe Brea's in the year if it is, just it will be there shortly. None that is really - affect that really gets in '24, we do have Tulsa opening in late-summer that will have a marginal impact leasing is going well. With all the redeveloping, this is really more of a '25 - '26 story. And the one that will see the benefit of this year and I have a number handy is 6, which we opened in '23. That's kind of the one that would say most meaningful of it. But most of the redevelopment is of '25 - '26 story.\nVince Tibone: No, that's really helpful. I mean, is there any like for just in terms of the get the $1.3 billion that's active today, plus $800 million you're going to start. I mean what's the fair assumption for '25 - '26, in terms of level of maybe spend stabilizing, I mean I have to look at how we model it, like, is $500 million stabilizing annually at, we'll call it, 7% - 8% yield a fair assumption, or that's something I'm trying to get at like how quickly.\nDavid Simon: No. I appreciate that. If you don't include what I saw ground up, new development, I would say probably about between $600 million and $800 million a year and our goal would hopefully be to bring that in at north of eight. Obviously, if It is multifamily, you can still create value at a lower yield than that, and in some cases, we're building at a lower yield than that, like for instance both Brea's apartments and the ones that we're building at the former Northgate Mall, where we're basically about to start construction there, will be sub-eight. So, it may being round down that 8%, but if you're targeting kind of everything else, we would hope to be north of that.\nVince Tibone: Thank you. That's all really helpful color. I appreciate it.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRon Kamdem: Great. Just a two-parter really quickly. Starting with the core NOI, just in '24, can you just touch on the tourist centers and how much recovery there is and how much upside for volume to '24 , as well as the variable to fixed conversion, just trying to get a sense of how much of a tailwind that is to the core. And then on the sort of other platform investments, maybe could you just touch on what seasonality should we be thinking about between sort of the first part of the year and 4Q . Thanks so much.\nDavid Simon: Sure, so - and Brian will chime in here. I will just give you some thoughts off my head and then Brian, hopefully, will agree or correct people. Three or correctly. So. I would say we saw in '23 really decent bounce-back from the tourist centers. I give you a great example. So, - and I was just happy to look at this having to look at this for now, I must have been probably doing my job. But, I noticed in Q4 as an example of the bounce back, the Woodbury Q4 sales were around $350 million. Sorry. Which to me is a real good indicator of bounce back and obviously, the highest fourth-quarter sales we've had zero in quite some time. So, I would say generally we're seeing a really good bounce-back in the tourist centers. I don't think we're the one area that the U.S. overall and obviously will have an impact on us. I do not think we'll see the Chinese. We do not expect the Chinese to come back the way they have beforehand before pandemic and they had - and just our tourist centers did outpace our sales for the portfolio for '23 on average. So, good bounce-back across-the-board and then I would on your variable rent, we continue to see that as lower percent revenues, both the vast majority as we increased our, the way to think about it and it's interesting is and again, hopefully Brian will need to correct me, but Brian's available to correct me. Our domestic operations at $0.28 of improvement Q-over-Q, that's $0.28, and within that $0.28, our variable income went down. So I think that gives you kind of a of a leading barometer, we're still working that way down and we're getting that into kind of our base rent. So and then your final on OPI, loss Q1 relatively flat Q2, Q3 and then most of it in Q4. Q2 is a little better than Q3 usual, but on the margins. And it's only growing projecting this year $0.10 to $0.15.\nBrian McDade: All right. Got it.\nRon Kamdem: Thanks so much.\nDavid Simon: Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg McGinniss: Hi, good evening, David. I just wanted to dig into the guidance a bit and that OPI that you just cited in particular. Is it fair to assume that the $0.10 to $0.15 includes gains or monetization similar to last year or operations expected to improve from the minus $0.02 contribution to FFO in 2023?\nDavid Simon: Yes, thank you for that question and the answer is no, that's pure operations. And no one-timer or sale gains or any of that are in there. And yes - I mean - just by - I mean, we had a tough '23 in our OPI. We didn't meet our both our budgeted expectations and our expectations kind of mid-year when we re-calibrated it. The team in OPI, again we're partners with, so it's not just us, where partners are making significant efforts within their own business to improve performance. And again, the overriding theme was - and we should be sensitive to this across the board, the overriding theme was the lower income consumers still, with inflation embedded even though inflation has subsided, they are still dealing with things that cost a lot more money than they used to. And the good news is, their income is increasing, but it's still not in a position that they have the discretionary income that they need and they deserve. And, we need to figure that out as a country.\nGreg McGinniss: So just to clarify.\nDavid Simon: So no - yes, so I hopefully I answered. So no one-time gains, hopefully, we're being conservative and that's kind of where the numbers are. And yes, just to take a step back, we're kind of getting OPI in this level where it was pre the extraordinary year of '21 '22, if you go back in time, this is kind of where the number was already cleared. We had - we really outpaced ourselves that extraordinary '21 and '22 and I think now we're kind of getting back to more of a more stabilized number.\nGreg McGinniss: So, just to clarify, so there's going to be some improvements in operations I guess, that are going to be kind of driving this year-over-year growth. But what do you think that implies in terms of the operational standpoint and the customer for your other tenants in the portfolio. And how are those retailers performing and are they going to be able to make the same sort of operational changes to benefit income?\nDavid Simon: Well, you're just talking about our tenant base now is that the question or...\nGreg McGinniss: Your tenants, yes.\nDavid Simon: Okay, well, like I said, the ones of SPARC and Penny I really spoke to. I mean, I think generally, the plan with that they have in place we think we're on the right track and we're all working very hard to produce these results, and hopefully, we'll do better than that. Again, I mentioned to you, we're kind of getting back to where we used to be and if you looked at it in conjunction with pre-pandemic '18, '19, that's kind of where the number was. And we really outperformed in '21, '22. And we really underperformed in '23, simple as that. Brands are good. Businesses have the right game plan and we're moving. I would - so that's SPARC, Penny, questions on that.\nGreg McGinniss: No.\nDavid Simon: Then I'll move to your other questions. I mean. Here retail is very specific. So, I think our retailers generally and the credit is in really good shape. There's always one or two or three tenants that we are somewhat nervous about. But there - they all understand the importance of bricks and mortar, they're reinvesting in their stores. They're spending less on technology, which is good for us, putting more money back in the stores. And there are open to buy and return on investment in stores is a proven financial model. They're doing that. So I'd say generally comfortable, very comfortable with all the retailers that we're doing business with, but there will always be a couple of here and there that have to sort of through their financial issues.\nGreg McGinniss: Great, thanks for the color, David.\nDavid Simon: Sure, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hong Zhang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nHong Zhang: Yes, hi guys. I guess, I was wondering if you could quantify the magnitude of the development drag this year. And also it seems like you saw a very strong rent and occupancy growth in the Taubman portfolio in the fourth quarter, measuring what drove that and what are your expectations for that portfolio this year as well.\nDavid Simon: Just on Taubman, and I mean, our expectations on the comp NOI are roughly right on in excess of 3%. What drove both portfolios really is supply and demand, multi-retail sales, operational excellence, all the things there I mentioned earlier. Listen, we're a big company, we did have some drag from redevelopment, but it's not, it's not an excuse. We don't worry about it, and it's not so much big redevelopment. You - when you re-tenant a mall you have downtime and as I've mentioned this before, the better the tenant, the better the build-out. And in some cases, build-out is six to nine months and restaurants it can be even close to a year. And as you know, we have - our portfolio restaurant new business is at least 100 new restaurants over the next year or so. So, it is a long, arduous process getting permits. I mean, we had a crazy thing in the Bay Area, where they couldn't hook up the gas for a while. Encourage you to read the Supreme Court, over-ruling an ordinance in Berkeley, that affected if you're really bored, you can read it. We finally got guests back into the year at center. And as you know, chefs like to cook with gas. So, it was - it cost us six months and the delay. I mean that's normal. But I'd say the bigger issue on just is not so much redevelopment, it is really re-tenanting and I would say by and large, if I had to it make-up a number, it costs this probably $0.10 to $0.20 a year, just downtime, but that's a guess.\nHong Zhang: Got it, thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. Just a couple of questions, first, your operating expenses were down in 4Q. I just curious what drove that and if that's sustainable.\nBrian McDade: Yes, Jason, this is Brian. Yes, we did see some savings on a year-over-year. There was some seasonality to it, weather was a little bit lighter. But yes, we do expect it's sustainable.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay, and on the ABG partial sale, was it down around valuation versus the $18 billion mark previously?\nDavid Simon: Down.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay, thank you.\nBrian McDade: Yes, remember that that was the enterprise value, added some debt. So that was an equity value. But it was - just when you say $18 billion that's enterprise value as opposed to equity because.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay, thank you.\nBrian McDade: Sure, no problem.\nOperator: Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hi, good evening out there.\nDavid Simon: How are you?\nHaendel St. Juste: I'm doing great, sir. Hope you're well too. Question I have is on your side, but not yet opened pipeline. I think last quarter or you previously outlined is about 200 basis points of embedded occupancy from that side but not yet open pipeline. So maybe you can give us an update on where that stands today. And then also maybe what's embedded in the guide for bad debt and lease term fees this year. Thank you.\nBrian McDade: So, Simon opens a little bit north of 200 basis points. We've been kind of holding that, we open stores and find new leases, so we're holding steady around 200 basis points. We are assuming a normal level of bad debt, which is about 25 basis points to total revenue would be our expectation on that.\nHaendel St. Juste: Lease term fees.\nBrian McDade: A normal rate of lease term fees. I think the answer - the number for the year is about $30 million.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Okay, thank you. Operator.\nOperator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good evening. Just a quick one for me, just curious on the current state of affairs with Jamestown, and how that relationship is progressing more talk about mixed-use, so just curious if there's anything In the works or in the planning stages that you're doing with them and how you are thinking about that particular relationship. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Yes, thank you. So, we haven't quite have the year under our belt, but very pleased with the relationship and the partnership and we continue to look at opportunities both within our pipeline and obviously, what they do on behalf of investors. So, a lot of good feedback going both ways and We we're working on one project. I mean we have one development project where we're working on together, but other than that it's a lot of corporate. There is - it is more strategic and more of a corporate discussion than property-level specifics other than one where we are partners on and going through the development process in that now in the Southeast.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to the management for closing comments.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Thank you. And obviously, Tom and Brian, are available. And we really appreciate everybody's participation. Talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Good evening. Thanks, Tom. Before turning to the results, I would like to provide some perspective on our company as we celebrated our 30th anniversary as a public company in mid-December of last year. We have grown our company into a global leader of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations managing through and in some cases, very turbulent times. Over the last three decades from our base of 115 properties in 1993, we have acquired approximately 300 properties, developed more then 50, and disposed of approximately 250 resulting in our current domestic portfolio of about 215 assets. We expanded globally, and today have 35 international outlets, including world-renowned outlets in Asia, and our portfolio is differentiated by product type, geography enclosed and open-air centers located in large and dense catchment areas. Our portfolio is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet and a top management team. We are the largest landlords, the world's most important retailers, and not by accident, our diversified tenant base has solid credit, our mix is always changing and adapting, best illustrated by the fact that compared to 30 years ago, only one retailer is still in our current top 10 tenants. Our team's hard work has resulted in industry-leading results including some of the following; our annual revenue increased from $424 million to nearly $5.7 billion, our annual FFO generation increased 30 times from approximately $150 million to nearly $4.7 billion, a 12% CAGR. Total market capitalization has increased from $3 billion to $90 billion. We have paid over $42 billion in dividends to shareholders. We have assets in our portfolio that have been in business for more than 60 years. Those assets are still growing today with many generating a $100 million in NOI. These assets are in great locations, have a loyal and large customer base that is where the retailers want to be. No other asset type has longevity including the NOI generation and embedded future growth that these assets have, yes, they change. Yes, they evolve, yes they adapt, but yes, they also grow. Our collection of assets cannot be replicated. And there are hidden - always hidden opportunities within that. I want to thank the entire Simon team, who have contributed to 30 years of success as a public company. And now let me turn to our fourth quarter '23 results. We generated approximately $4.7 billion in funds from operation in 2023 or $12.51 per share and returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. For the quarter, FFO was $1.38 billion or $3.69 per share compared to $1.27 billion or $3.40 per share. Let me walk you through some of the highlights for this quarter compared to Q4 of 2022, domestic operations had a terrific performance this quarter and contributed $0.28 of growth primarily driven by higher rental income with lower operating expenses. Gains from investment activity in the fourth quarter were approximately $0.07 higher in a year-over-year comparison, other platform investments at $0.03 lower contribution compared to last year. FFO from our real estate business was $3.23 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $2.97 from last year. That's 8.7% growth and $11.78 per share for '23 compared to $11.39 last year. Domestic property NOI increased 7.3% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.8% for the year continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending operational excellence delivered results for the year, exceeding our initial expectations. Our NOI ended the year higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 7.2% for the quarter and 4.9% for the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the quarter, fourth quarter was 95.8%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to last year. The Mills occupancy was 97.8%, and occupancy is above year-end 2019 levels for all of our platforms. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 3.1% year-over-year and The Mills rents increased 4.3%, we signed more than 960 leases for approximately 3.4 million square feet in the fourth quarter. For the year, we signed over 4,500 leases, representing more than 18 million square feet approximately 30% of our leasing activity for the year were new deals, we're going-in rents of approximately $74 per square foot and renewals had going-in rents of approximately $65 per square foot. Leasing momentum for the last couple of years continues Into 2024. Reported retailer sales per square foot in the quarter was $743 for malls and outlets combined and $677 through The Mills. During the quarter, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG for gross proceeds of $300 million in cash and reported pretax and after-tax gains of $157 million and $118 million respectively. We opened our 11 outlet in Europe last year, construction continues on two outlets, yes, one in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and yes, one in Jakarta, Indonesia. We completed 13 significant re-developments. And we'll complete other major development projects this year. In addition, we expect to begin construction this year on five to six mixed-use projects representing around $800 million of spend from Orange County to Ann Arbor, to Boston, to Seattle, to Roosevelt Field, they are some of the ones that are planning to start this year. And we expect to fund these redevelopments to mixed-use projects with our internally generated cash flow of over $1.5 billion after dividend payments. During 2023, we completed $12 billion in financing activities, including three senior note offerings for approximately $3.1 billion including the Klépierre exchangeable offering. We recast and upsized our primary revolver credit facility to $5 billion and completed $4 billion of secured loan refinancings and extensions. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever, we have approximately $11 billion of liquidity. During 2023, we paid, as I mentioned earlier, $2.8 billion in common stock dividends. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of just over $110 per share in 2023, and today we announced our dividend of $1.95 per share for the first quarter and year-over-year increase of 8.3%. The dividend is payable on March 29 of 2024. Now moving onto 2024, our FFO guidance is $11.85 to $12.10 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions; domestic property NOI growth of at least 3%, increased net interest expense compared to 2023 of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 per share reflecting current market interest rates on both fixed and variable debt assumptions and cash balances. Contribution from other property, other platform investments of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share; no significant acquisition or disposition activity, and our current diluted share count of approximately 374 million shares. So, with that said. It's safe to say, we're excited to enter year '31 as a public company. Thank you for your time and we're ready for Q&A. Well, I mean, Steve, we're always adjusting our mix. We're always trying to - so even though we're 96% leased, we're always looking to improve our retailer mix and obviously, that's been beneficial to our NOI growth. I would say, just generically, obviously, I spend a lot of time myself on leasing and with my team on leasing. Demand remains very strong. And there is a real interest by all sorts of retailers and people that populate our shopping centers to be part of what we're doing it. So, I think as you probably saw our new deals are $74 a foot thereabouts, our renewals are $65 a foot, our expiring leases this year in the $56 - $57 range. So we're seeing generally positive spreads supply-and-demand is in our favor. Historically low supply in big properties across the country, I mean, there used to be 40 million square feet of retail real estate built every year, now there is essentially less than a few million here and there. So, and then there's been obsolescence too which makes the supply shrink as well. So - and then there's just great new retailers that we're very excited to do business with. I was on the West Coast seeing some of them. The importance of the bricks and mortar has never been higher. And the cost of all of the things that we said about, don't get me wrong e-commerce is critically important, but all of this stuff about e-commerce, cost of customer acquisition, returns, stickiness, et cetera, all continues to be a challenge. If you looked at the marketplaces, that pure online, they run into problems. So, you really - they really need to be connected to a bricks and mortar for survivability. So, all of those things are pointing to a positive picture, it's a function of execution. A function of being first a function of continuing to improve our properties, which we're very focused about, but now even though we've bounced back and had a couple of really good years in terms of lease-up from the depths of the pandemic, we're not finished and retail demand continues and it is strong and it's across the board. I mean, it's not one, category one retailer, but pretty much across-the-board. Thank you, Steve. Sure, well let me just - we sold about 2% of our ABG stock. So, we essentially went from just under 12 to just under 10. And we'll continue to look to monetize these investments, they've been by and large, very good investments across, not just the big ones, but the smaller ones as well. Obviously, there's number of them that are synergistic to us. But, we have a strict adherence to creating value. And we think we can deploy that capital into kind of what I'd call the mothership and can get better growth from that and that's where our number one priority will be. So, it wouldn't surprise me, Caitlin, for us to continue to monetize, obviously, the - some of these are bigger value - bigger investment. So, it's not that easy to do it in one big swoop, but We're very focused on portfolio management of those assets and If we can monetize and are we going to get a better return plowing it back into our core business. Yes, thank you. Well, look, I'd say a couple of things. On the property level, there's no question that all of the mixed-use stuff that we're bringing in, plus the redevelopment of our department store boxes are probably the most interesting and exciting things that we're doing on the ground level. And so that would certainly be number one; number two is we're very excited about growing our outlet business in Southeast Asia. It's an incredibly robust market, young population and a growing - and I'm not, when I say Southeast Asia, I'm not like in Jakarta, places like that where it is not China, it is places like that where we see kind of what we can do in Japan and in Korea on the outlet side. Jeff you probably know that better than anybody. Based on your previous history with - in terms of that. So we - that's very exciting. I'd also say, we still are in the pursuit of bringing technology to our loyal consumers that allow them to handle enhance and their shopping experience with us. So, we've got a lot of initiatives on the marketing, loyalty. You know Simon search is a great example where our consumer either in property or pre-visit, can search our tenant base for what-if they're looking for a black dress where in this center can I buy it, what retail are obviously that ties into the marketplace we're building with premium outlets, there'll be some news there this year on that front. So, that whole system about customer interaction, reinforcing their shopping behavior, rewarding loyalty, expediting their trip to make it more useful is a big focus. And then as important, I think this is number four, really is just we've got to do a great job of continuing to evolve our retail mix. The exciting thing is, there are more-and-more entrepreneurs, there are more-and-more exciting retailers that are coming up with great concepts, proving them out, and then realizing that our centers are a good place for them to do business. So, those are the ones that come to mind, and I'm certain, there'll be ones that I haven't even thought of. Thank you, Jeff. Well I mean, Alex, look, our yield is ridiculously hot, okay. So, that's really where we could financially pay $2.10 tomorrow, right. So, we have $1.5 billion of free cash flow after dividends. So, it has nothing to do with financial wherewithal. I mean we like our - we would like - we don't like trading at this high yield. So I think, I think that's kind of how we look at it, we still think as we have these, additional capital events. We still are anxious to continue to buy our stock back. And again, when I look at either the S&P 500, I look at the REIT peer group, I look at, what the strip center REITs - our yield is plenty high for investors. So tell all my investors, I could pay $2.10 tomorrow evening, okay, per quarter without a blink and our yield is too high. And, it will be there before you know it, but we would like to trade at a lower yield, because we think, certainly if you look at it on that basis, our yield is higher than it should be I mean, the S&P is under 102%, our REIT strip centers, Tom are in the 4s. We're close to s7, right - 6.5 - 7. So. I mean Alex, you should be pounding the table. No, I, I'm kidding. By the way, we're not - just so you know, we like you're welcome out there, we are west of the Hudson, but we're not going to tell you exactly where we are, okay? Somewhere in Indiana tonight, - we may not be in Indiana tonight, but we are west of the Hudson. Well, I can't tell you in my schedule. Sure . Good question, so I will say this. I think the rent - the going-in rents and renewals for new leases are very much sustainable. If you look at our occupancy costs, we are still at the low end of our historical range, and we're at 12.6% and we have run up to 14% plus before. And I would also, I would also caution report, these are the sales that our tenants are reporting to us, but they are somewhat affected by returns they it and so on. We actually think our sales per foot are higher than this. Some cases they have the ability to offset our returns in most cases, they don't. So, I just put that out there, so I wouldn't - and I mentioned this maybe two, three years ago, probably certainly pre-pandemic, but we report it. I know the market likes it. We actually think our sales were higher that come from our properties and then they are somewhat affected by returns. And we think some of - a lot of those returns are Internet sales returns. So, they don't even come from our properties. And so again, when we look at it, we feel like supply and demand, low occupancy cost, high retail sales, and just overall demand will be able to generate kind of the new leasing renewal spreads that we've seen over the last couple of years. Floris. Looks like we lost for Floris. Well, on the - Craig, on the department store boxes, I don't have it off the top of my head, but the launch we own basically don't have a ton of work to do. We have a handful of boxes that we own that are in process, like for instance, I've mentioned Brea, but just briefly on the call, we did - that was a former Sears store we tore it down in development now under construction now. So the actual stores that we own are not many, probably under 10 at this point that are either currently under construction or in process. So, very small amounts of, kind of a less of an opportunity than you think. The ones that we felt Transformco still owns some boxes and so does Seritage. So you know well, in our properties. So, we'll see how that evolves. I mean, eventually some of those could be opportunities for us to buy and redevelop. We haven't made deals on those just because bid and the ask has been too great, but we - and I don't think luxury is really going to be the dominant theme on a lot of these mixed use - I'm sorry, on these boxes. I think a lot of it will be - continue to be a mixed-use development that we're doing. And obviously, opening up, if it's in a closed mall opening the center up with restaurants and entertainment and so on and it has worked very well. So, we have a number under construction or about to be under construction, but we don't really have that existing pipe that until we make more deals to buy some of the boxes back. It's not as big as you might think that it's only a handful. Now Macy's is right there, they announced some store closings none of which are ours. So, we're always very focused on knowing exactly where we might be at risk. And I would point out, very importantly when Sears went out of business, the whole market said, how are you going to survive, Sears going out of business. They had 800 department stores at that time, frankly they're down, I believe they were operating five, six, seven, eight. I think we actually have the most between us and the Taubman portfolio, but how are you going to survive, the fact of the matter is, it was a non-event to the mall customer, and If anything is we've gotten those boxes back. We've made the center better. So, as we look, we don't look at box - the changes in box as a concern, we view it really more aggressively and progressively. And that's something that will enhance the properties in the portfolio and the assets that we were worried about that couldn't survive that, basically don't exist in our portfolio anymore. So if you asked me that question 10 years ago, I might have a different answer. Craig, I hope you get better prior to the Citi Conference, I'm sure you well, but you sound like you've lost your voice. You will. Yes, in fact, it's interesting you actually take us - I think in '24 we're taking a step back. I'll just give you a trivial example. And I mentioned, Brian now for the third time, but we have a whole wing that's connected to the former Sears department store that we're redeveloping. We'll have some outdoor shops, we're building Dick's Sporting Goods. We have a Lifetime Fitness resorts and then we'll do roughly 350 apartments or so, but that wing leading to Sears, we've had to de-lease it to ultimately put in, I am not sure, I am allowed to say it, but I'll say it anyway, Zara, Uniqlo and they won't open until end of '24, best-case. So. this advanced, by and large, all of this stuff in the U.K. that we've listed and I don't believe Brea's in the year if it is, just it will be there shortly. None that is really - affect that really gets in '24, we do have Tulsa opening in late-summer that will have a marginal impact leasing is going well. With all the redeveloping, this is really more of a '25 - '26 story. And the one that will see the benefit of this year and I have a number handy is 6, which we opened in '23. That's kind of the one that would say most meaningful of it. But most of the redevelopment is of '25 - '26 story. No. I appreciate that. If you don't include what I saw ground up, new development, I would say probably about between $600 million and $800 million a year and our goal would hopefully be to bring that in at north of eight. Obviously, if It is multifamily, you can still create value at a lower yield than that, and in some cases, we're building at a lower yield than that, like for instance both Brea's apartments and the ones that we're building at the former Northgate Mall, where we're basically about to start construction there, will be sub-eight. So, it may being round down that 8%, but if you're targeting kind of everything else, we would hope to be north of that. Thank you. Sure, so - and Brian will chime in here. I will just give you some thoughts off my head and then Brian, hopefully, will agree or correct people. Three or correctly. So. I would say we saw in '23 really decent bounce-back from the tourist centers. I give you a great example. So, - and I was just happy to look at this having to look at this for now, I must have been probably doing my job. But, I noticed in Q4 as an example of the bounce back, the Woodbury Q4 sales were around $350 million. Sorry. Which to me is a real good indicator of bounce back and obviously, the highest fourth-quarter sales we've had zero in quite some time. So, I would say generally we're seeing a really good bounce-back in the tourist centers. I don't think we're the one area that the U.S. overall and obviously will have an impact on us. I do not think we'll see the Chinese. We do not expect the Chinese to come back the way they have beforehand before pandemic and they had - and just our tourist centers did outpace our sales for the portfolio for '23 on average. So, good bounce-back across-the-board and then I would on your variable rent, we continue to see that as lower percent revenues, both the vast majority as we increased our, the way to think about it and it's interesting is and again, hopefully Brian will need to correct me, but Brian's available to correct me. Our domestic operations at $0.28 of improvement Q-over-Q, that's $0.28, and within that $0.28, our variable income went down. So I think that gives you kind of a of a leading barometer, we're still working that way down and we're getting that into kind of our base rent. So and then your final on OPI, loss Q1 relatively flat Q2, Q3 and then most of it in Q4. Q2 is a little better than Q3 usual, but on the margins. And it's only growing projecting this year $0.10 to $0.15. Thanks, Ron. Yes, thank you for that question and the answer is no, that's pure operations. And no one-timer or sale gains or any of that are in there. And yes - I mean - just by - I mean, we had a tough '23 in our OPI. We didn't meet our both our budgeted expectations and our expectations kind of mid-year when we re-calibrated it. The team in OPI, again we're partners with, so it's not just us, where partners are making significant efforts within their own business to improve performance. And again, the overriding theme was - and we should be sensitive to this across the board, the overriding theme was the lower income consumers still, with inflation embedded even though inflation has subsided, they are still dealing with things that cost a lot more money than they used to. And the good news is, their income is increasing, but it's still not in a position that they have the discretionary income that they need and they deserve. And, we need to figure that out as a country. So no - yes, so I hopefully I answered. So no one-time gains, hopefully, we're being conservative and that's kind of where the numbers are. And yes, just to take a step back, we're kind of getting OPI in this level where it was pre the extraordinary year of '21 '22, if you go back in time, this is kind of where the number was already cleared. We had - we really outpaced ourselves that extraordinary '21 and '22 and I think now we're kind of getting back to more of a more stabilized number. Well, you're just talking about our tenant base now is that the question or... Okay, well, like I said, the ones of SPARC and Penny I really spoke to. I mean, I think generally, the plan with that they have in place we think we're on the right track and we're all working very hard to produce these results, and hopefully, we'll do better than that. Again, I mentioned to you, we're kind of getting back to where we used to be and if you looked at it in conjunction with pre-pandemic '18, '19, that's kind of where the number was. And we really outperformed in '21, '22. And we really underperformed in '23, simple as that. Brands are good. Businesses have the right game plan and we're moving. I would - so that's SPARC, Penny, questions on that. Then I'll move to your other questions. I mean. Here retail is very specific. So, I think our retailers generally and the credit is in really good shape. There's always one or two or three tenants that we are somewhat nervous about. But there - they all understand the importance of bricks and mortar, they're reinvesting in their stores. They're spending less on technology, which is good for us, putting more money back in the stores. And there are open to buy and return on investment in stores is a proven financial model. They're doing that. So I'd say generally comfortable, very comfortable with all the retailers that we're doing business with, but there will always be a couple of here and there that have to sort of through their financial issues. Sure, thank you. Just on Taubman, and I mean, our expectations on the comp NOI are roughly right on in excess of 3%. What drove both portfolios really is supply and demand, multi-retail sales, operational excellence, all the things there I mentioned earlier. Listen, we're a big company, we did have some drag from redevelopment, but it's not, it's not an excuse. We don't worry about it, and it's not so much big redevelopment. You - when you re-tenant a mall you have downtime and as I've mentioned this before, the better the tenant, the better the build-out. And in some cases, build-out is six to nine months and restaurants it can be even close to a year. And as you know, we have - our portfolio restaurant new business is at least 100 new restaurants over the next year or so. So, it is a long, arduous process getting permits. I mean, we had a crazy thing in the Bay Area, where they couldn't hook up the gas for a while. Encourage you to read the Supreme Court, over-ruling an ordinance in Berkeley, that affected if you're really bored, you can read it. We finally got guests back into the year at center. And as you know, chefs like to cook with gas. So, it was - it cost us six months and the delay. I mean that's normal. But I'd say the bigger issue on just is not so much redevelopment, it is really re-tenanting and I would say by and large, if I had to it make-up a number, it costs this probably $0.10 to $0.20 a year, just downtime, but that's a guess. Thank you. Down. How are you? Okay, thank you. Operator. Yes, thank you. So, we haven't quite have the year under our belt, but very pleased with the relationship and the partnership and we continue to look at opportunities both within our pipeline and obviously, what they do on behalf of investors. So, a lot of good feedback going both ways and We we're working on one project. I mean we have one development project where we're working on together, but other than that it's a lot of corporate. There is - it is more strategic and more of a corporate discussion than property-level specifics other than one where we are partners on and going through the development process in that now in the Southeast. Sure. Okay. Thank you. And obviously, Tom and Brian, are available. And we really appreciate everybody's participation. Talk to you soon."

I'm pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Good evening. And I'm pleased to report our third-quarter results. Third quarter funds from operation were $1.2 billion or $3.20 per share. Let me walk you through some of the highlights for this quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2022, domestic and international operations had a very good performance this quarter, and contributed $0.17 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Non-cash after-tax gain -- gains of $0.32 in the third quarter were related to the partial sale of our ownership interest in SPARC and ABG as a result of ABG selling primary shares in the quarter. Higher interest expense was a setback of $0.07 year-over-year. We had a $0.15 lower contribution from our other property investment platform compared to Q3 2022, and a $0.02 loss on mark-to-market of publicly traded securities. FFO from our real estate business was $2.91 per share in the third quarter compared to $2.83 in the prior period last year. So far, our real estate has produced $8.55 per share for the first nine months compared to $8.40 from last year. We are pleased with the transaction SPARC completed with SHEIN during the third quarter that demonstrated the value that we have created in that business. The transaction was significantly above our basis. And as a result, we recognized a gain in the corner. And the transaction ultimately reduced our ownership interest in SPARC from 50% to 33% as we have managed SHEIN as a partner. Given our lower ownership interest in the back-end weighting profitability in the fourth quarter, we now expect $0.05 lower FFO contribution from SPARC in the fourth quarter of this year. During the third quarter, the Taubman family exercised their put right on a portion of their interest in TRG. We exchange 1.725 million partnership interest units for an additional 4% ownership interest. We now own 84% of TRG. Domestic property NOI increased 4.2% year-over-year for the quarter and 3.8% for the first nine months. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 4.3% for the quarter and 4% for the first nine months of the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 95.2%, an increase of 70 basis points compared to last year. Our third quarter occupancy is higher than fourth quarter of last year, which has not occurred historically. The mill's occupancy was 97.4%, and occupancy is above all year-end 2019 levels for all of our platforms. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 2.9% year-over-year and the mills was 3.6% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continues across our portfolio. We signed more than 970 leases for approximately $4.3 million square feet in the quarter. Through the first nine months of 2023, we signed more than 3,500 leases for 15 million square feet, which is expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue. We have an additional 1,100 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for another $400 million in revenue. We are seeing strong broad-based demand from retail community, including continued strength for many categories. Reported retail sales per square foot in the third quarter was $744 for the mills and outlets combined and $676 for mills. We continue to be active in redevelopment and new development. During the quarter, we started construction on a significant redevelopment at Brea Mall, and a new upscale outlet center in Jakarta, our first Premium Outlet in Indonesia. We completed the refinancing of 11 property mortgages during the first nine months of the year for a total of $960 million at an average rate of 6%. We have -- our balance sheet is strong with approximately $8.8 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced a dividend of $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter, which is a year-over-year increase of 5.6%. The dividend is payable on December 29th. And we also purchased approximately 1.27 million shares of our common stock for $140 million. We are increasing our full-year 2023 guidance from $11.85 to $11.95, to $12.15 to $12.25 per share. This is an increase of $0.30 at the midpoint. So to conclude, I'm pleased with our third-quarter results. Our business is performing well and is ahead of our plan. Tenant demand is strong. Occupancy is increasing. Base minimum rent levels are at record levels. And we are very experienced at managing our business through volatile periods of time. And as you all know, this is when we do some of our best work. So, we're now ready for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nRon Kamdem: Great. Thanks so much. Just one on some of the guideposts you've given in the past. As we're flipping the calendar to 2024, you talked about sort of 3% organic growth as achievable. Just wondering how you're thinking about that and how we should think about potential interest costs, headwinds as debt sort of rolls? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Sure. Look, I think we feel good about that kind of comparable NOI growth. Our debt is reasonably laddered. So yes, we'll have some interest expense headwinds, but we still think we'll end up growing our business next year with that said.\nRon Kamdem: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Go ahead, Ron.\nRon Kamdem: I was just going to say if I could ask a follow up just on the $0.30 cent guidance raise. I think you talked about $0.32 cent gain and then $0.05 cents lower from the retailers. Just wondering is there any other sort of puts and takes that we should be mindful of? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Sure. No, we're going to have $0.05 lower because of the SPARC-SHEIN deal. We lost a couple of cents from our mark to market on a couple of our public securities that we own last quarter. And essentially the real estate business has been very significant to our growth and we'll kind of see where the fourth quarter ends up but I think it's -- 97% of our business is going to outperform what we thought from originally what we had budgeted.\nRon Kamdem: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, good evening everyone. David, I know you gave some numbers on recent leasing activity which sounds really strong. I was wondering if you could give some additional context maybe to how that leasing activity compares to recent and pre-pandemic years, maybe what that means for pricing and how that could impact permanent occupancy?\nDavid Simon: Well, thank you, Caitlin. So I would say, let me try and address your questions in no particular word. I think we'll be, year-end occupancy will be obviously higher than it is today. I don't know that it will be our highest ever, but it it'll be within distance pretty close. Even with all the volatility in the world and the market, we still expect -- we still see demand very strong. I mean, we're -- frankly, we're cautious, we're waiting for shoes to drop, but we haven't seen it on our new deals, whether it's F&B, entertainment, high-end luxury tenants, athleisure, just to name some categories. We're seeing -- we're still seeing a lot of demand on that front. And I would say from a pricing element, we feel -- I would say we feel comparable to the way we felt in ‘15, ‘16, ‘17 era, in terms of era. I guess that was almost seven, eight years ago, but lots happened over those seven or eight years. But we still feel like that's kind of -- we're in that good shape where we're driving rents up and it's okay for the retailers. They're making deals and supplying demands in our favor. Obviously we cycled through a lot of poor performing retailers due to COVID. And the ones that we are doing new deals with are excited to do business with us. So pricing is for sure going in the right direction. Occupancy is going up. And tenant demand is pretty strong across the whole spectrum. And even in certain categories, just to take luxury, yes, there are some that are being more cautious, but there's plenty that are growing new stores. So it's really retail specific. Obviously bricks and mortar through the pandemic to today has proven its value to retailers. I'm sure you hear that on the conference calls from retailers. So in that sense, we're making a lot of good stuff happen. Brian, did you have something on the occupancy?\nBrian McDade: I was just going to say we continue to see about 30% of our deals being new deals in the quarter. So that's consistent with the prior quarter as well. So there is definitely lots of activity on a new deal basis.\nCaitlin Burrows: Great, sounds encouraging. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nSamir Khanal: Good evening, everyone. David, maybe provide color on how your malls are performing versus outlets, maybe from a regional standpoint, coastal, non-coastal, Sun Belt, just trying to see if there's any differences from a leasing standpoint? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Sure. It's interesting. I would say we're seeing pretty good tenant sales growth on the tourism properties, whether they're outlet or malls. Now, the most of our pure tourist properties are really the outlet centers, and we're seeing good growth in that category. Traffic, generally, is slightly above last year, still slightly below ‘19, but obviously conversions way up because our sales are on a per square foot basis are much higher than ‘19. I would say generally whether mall or outlet, the Sun Belt area has produced pretty good results in terms of sales year-to-date. We saw actually a decent pickup in California which was encouraging, but really good growth in a Woodbury Common that is finally getting the tourism back to where it is. And, [Prairie] (ph) has been strong in the outlet business. There's no question people are looking for a little more value or maybe they're looking for a lot more value given the higher inflation that the consumers had to deal with. Not a huge bifurcation between malls and outlets. It's very property specific. The different -- as you know, we reported flat sales basically quarter-over-quarter and there's no real difference between outlets and malls in that number. Luxury probably, well didn't probably, it did flatten out in the third quarter of this year for sure, but it wasn't across the board. It was more a couple specific retailers had a tough Q3, others were up. So it was really retailer-specific. Jewelry, malls may have a little more exposure to jewelry. So that was a category that took a little more on the chin. Yet some of our higher end retailers in the jewelry category performed well. So it was basically not a real trend. I'd say the most important thing to come away with is that the Sun Belt continues to perform well and we're seeing the tourist centers kind of make a nice comeback. They've been lagging a little bit more than the others over time, and a little bit of flatlining in the luxury category. Tom, Brian, anything you want to add?\nBrian McDade: No, I think you covered it, David.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good evening. Good evening out there, David. So I'll do one question and I'll hold the follow-up. As you guys gain leverage with the tenants, are you seeing tangible ability to get more favorable terms? One of the issues with retail over time has been the tenants, especially the larger tenants or the more anchorage or more fashion, like the hot tenants of the day are driving lease terms traditionally. Curious if you're seeing a change in that which would translate to an ability to accelerate rent growth, NOI growth, et cetera.\nDavid Simon: Well, we don't have -- I mean, thank you for the question, Alex. We're not that far away. You always say out here, we're really not that far away. But put that aside, it's not a question of leverage over the retailers. I think what we have going for us is a great diverse portfolio. It's the best in the industry from mills to our outlets to our full price malls. And that's unique, its size, its scale, its quality that we’ve built up over many, many years. And as you remember, I don't think it was last quarter, maybe it was, Tom, but when we went through the transformation of the portfolio, was it last quarter? So we've done a lot to try to improve the quality of the portfolio. And I would say that obviously there's not a lot of new retail being built. There's not a lot of retailers closing stores and -- or going bankrupt. And I think most retailers today know kind of the good malls and the good properties versus the not so good. And when you add that up, supply and demand is in our favor and we're generating market rents. It's neither here nor there. But importantly, and I think I'd like to address this with you is that, and again, I'm sure retailers have different point of view, but I think the most interesting fact, or the most interesting thing that we have going for us in addition to the quality, diversity, et cetera, that I mentioned, they know we're going to be around. So -- and they know that we'll stick to a deal, we'll make it happen. When we say we're going to redevelop something, we do it. And I think that when there are open to buys, we tend to get our fair share of those or more than because of some of the factors that I mentioned, quality, scale, but also the fact that they know we're going to get the job done. And obviously there's been a lot of changes in mall ownership over the years. Balance sheet and quality of operations is a two-way street. It's both. As we look at retailers, we assess that. They certainly assess us. And I think that gives us an advantage that we've worked very hard, as you know, to achieve and, I mean, how do I say this? I mean, we've really outpaced our peer group dramatically in any measure you want, growth, earnings, dividend, quality of operations, scale, balance sheet, the -- I know we all focus quarter to quarter and this and that, but if you take a step back and you go, what do you got going for you? And again, we don't -- this sounds a little braggadocious. I don't want it to, but I mean, we've really outpaced, if you look over the last 10 -- 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 years, you know, we've dramatically outpaced our peer group.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you. No follow-up. I stumped you. I love it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJeff Spector: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. David, just want to tie in some of the leasing comments, the momentum you're seeing, the deals in the pipeline, the high occupancy levels to the redevelopment pipeline. And just, I guess, how are you thinking about that pipeline and the ability to increase that? Like, how are you going to satisfy some of the needs out there and continue to capture that market share maybe even more?\nDavid Simon: Thank you, Jeff. So look, I think we have the ability to develop and redevelop because we're not -- essentially what I said earlier, we're not -- listen, we've got to be stewards of capital, we've got to be very focused but we're not capital constrained the way some others might be. And our ability to invest in our portfolio is unmatched. So we intend to do that. Now at the same time, Jeff, rates are up. Returns for us have to be up. And so you haven't seen a really big change in our 8-K redevelopment, but that takes time because a lot of the stuff was put in place. But when we build something new or we redevelop, we're going to have to do a better job of leasing and returns and to warrant that capital because just about everything we do, I mean we still want to maintain our leadership position, but just about every amount of capital we spend, I have to measure it in my own mind against buying our stock back. And, I mean our stock, as you saw we bought stock back, so our stock is pretty compelling. So we want to redevelop, we want to new develop, but we've got a high hurdle that we've got to jump over. So like we've done historically, I expect us to find the right balance between continuing and to maintain our leadership position, investing in our properties for the benefit of shareholders, communities, retailers alike, but at the same time, we've got to be economic animals. And that's what -- everybody here understands that process, and that's what we try and achieve.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. David, you specifically mentioned the performance of the real estate business on this call several times, which has been strong. At the same time this quarter you sold off some of SPARC. So how can you continue to refine some of the ancillary parts of the business so that the strength that we're seeing and that you're talking about on the core business can continue to shine through?\nDavid Simon: Well, listen, it's a very good question and it's less and less of our business. As you know, it's under 5% of our earnings. You also have to understand that, when we add to the -- when we add it to our FFO, it's net income, which in many of these cases, you don't add -- well, all of these cases, you don't add back depreciation. So EBITDA and our FFO contribution are much different. Importantly, these have all been profitable endeavors. But we understand that even this small amount of earnings that we get in comparison to our total earnings power is volatile. People don't like the volatility. We'll, like we did with SPARC earlier, we're going to continue to harvest our investments over time. And as we do that, we're going to -- if you ask me today, we'll monetize things over time and we're going to buy our stock back because it's wildly accreted because let's look at it. You know what I trade at as a multiple of FFO and you know I have investment value in these investments, but they give us very little earnings because of GAAP. And if you do the math, you can see the accretion we would get on a buyback. So they're basically, I get no earnings from them, but I've got value and it's our job to get the value into cash, take the cash, buy our stock back or invest in properties and have it a bygone era of the time. But with an asterisk that said, attaboy, you made a lot of money. So that's the strategy. I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed.\nFloris van Dijkum: Hey David. Thanks for taking my question. So I was curious on TRG. So I noticed the occupancy dipped a little bit. You essentially -- you want to, increasing your ownership by 4% by issuing some OPUs. What price was the stock issued at and what yield are you buying? What's the implied cap rate on the TRG business and how should we think about that also as it relates to other potential opportunities in the market and how much flexibility was there and then maybe I guess in terms of the timing of the next sort of puts or hurdles that you have for increasing your interest in that business going forward?\nDavid Simon: Yeah, let me -- I'll just talk about the exchange a little bit, and then Brian can give you an idea. The occupancy is no big deal, but I'll let Brian go through that. So Taubman has the right to put their interest, their 4% interest for the next five years and it's basically at essentially appraised value. It's either a negotiation or we get appraisal firms. We decided to negotiate in good faith. We made a deal and then we issued the stock. And, I mean the reality is we're trading, Simon Property Group unequivocally is trading below appraised value. So one of the reasons we bought our stock back was, I'm not a big fan of issuing stock at this moment in time, so we'll use our capital to basically get rid of the dilution that we did issue. Now, Taubman had that right. They exercised it appropriately. We had a good faith negotiation, made a deal, and it was more or less at their appraised value. And to put it in perspective, for today's value, it's probably pretty close to where we negotiated our deal with Taubman pre-COVID and then obviously we got the COVID adjustment, but it was in that range, kind of where the deal was announced publicly. And so we're going to quarterize that dilution by buying our stock back. We started that once we made the deal. And I think the family's pretty smart. They said, Simon Property Group stock’s undervalued, and I like the dividend, and why not? So I think, I don't know what will happen next year. It could be the same thing, but at this point they have 16% left in TRG. We're happy to own 100% of TRG. I think they're happy, to do what they're doing and we'll deal with it as time goes on. But nothing can happen the rest of this year and it's sometime next year that this all recycles. So with that said, I hope that answers that, but I'll --Brian, if you want to add anything to that, please.\nBrian McDade: Nothing on that, but, Floris, on your question about their occupancy, it is back 110 basis points. There were really two major spaces that they had to take out of commission that they come back online in the fourth quarter. So you will see that come back on and then some in the fourth quarter, it's just simply timing.\nFloris van Dijkum: Got it. And if I may -- if you don't mind, the -- if I recall correctly after you look at my notes but the cap rate at the time that you did the deal was, it had a six handle on it. Is that the right way to think about the appraised value for TRG?\nDavid Simon: Well, again, this was a negotiated deal. Their view of appraised value started much higher than that with all due respect for us, which you might imagine. But we settled on a deal that today, if you go back in time to -- Taubman pre-COVID would have attributed Taubman's per share number in the $51 range. So somewhere in that range, we ended up, if you remember, doing COVID at $43 a share. I will tell you that their NOI today is higher than it was in ‘19. Portfolios change here and there, so it's really hard to do an apple on apple, but at the end of the day, that gives you the sense of things. But you're not that far off. I think that's a reasonable estimate. But that kind of puts all the metrics out there. And again, not a huge deal in the scheme of things, under a couple hundred million today. So -- but it gives you a perspective of kind of that. I think they would argue the appraised value is much higher than what they exchange at, but we ultimately did not go through the appraisal process.\nFloris van Dijkum: Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good afternoon. So minimum base rents were about 3% year-over-year, which is about the same level as contractual bumps. So I'm just trying to get a sense of leasing spread economics here. Like, does that mean leasing spreads are also in the low single-digit range or are there other factors influencing this metric, one way or another?\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, I'll see if Brian will add to it. Just remember, this is the total portfolio, so to move this thing up takes a lot, right? And spreads are just a moment -- leases that come in and go out. So you can't really look at it that way. So for us to move the entire portfolio gives you a sense of leasing spreads. Now, if you look at whatever pages on the 8-K, the new -- we added some new information there on the 29 -- 21. That -- you'll see some of that -- some of these that are going in there now are driving the rent. Those numbers now include our new leases that are driving that base minimum rent up.\nBrian McDade: Yes. I mean we typically only touch about 10% of our leases a year, Vince. So you got to factor that in as well. So renewals are about 10%, but the balance is our new leases, which as David said, are really driving the higher -- or contributing to the higher average base minimum rents.\nVince Tibone: But was my statement fair though, that contracts will bump for base rents still around 3% or are they lower than that, the overall portfolio?\nBrian McDade: No, they're right in that range, Vince.\nVince Tibone: And then just -- is there any color you can share about renewal spreads? And I know it's hard to move the overall portfolio with 10%, but this kind of conversation means they're not too far away from the average contractual bumps. Because if they were plus 30%, to take an extreme example, we could see that in the metrics. So I'm just trying to ultimately get some more color here on renewal economics.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. I mean, I guess, again Vince, in order to have the average base minimum rent go up for 20,000 leases, okay, of 3%, versus 10% to 15% that calculate spread, you're going to be -- mathematically going to have rent spreads that are higher than the 3%. And we'll walk you through that later, but that, just from a math point of view, there's just no way that that can drive that number up, but we'll walk you through that. So when you say that, we would say to you that's not reality because in order to drive up average base minimum rent for 20,000 leases or thereabouts, you're going to have to outperform much more than the 3% on just what's rolling over.\nVince Tibone: We can take it offline. I appreciate the time.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey, good evening David and Brian. I'll keep this to 1.5 questions for you. So last quarter you spoke about potentially being more active with asset recycling or reallocating real estate capital. Have the challenges facing the financing market changed those expectations at all? Or how are you thinking about that today? And how are higher interest rates impacting your customers and tenants?\nDavid Simon: Well, I'll take the last first. So I would say higher interest rates/inflation clearly is affecting a good portion of the consumer out there. So their affordability for -- and we're seeing this most on the consumer on what I'd call the kind of the more -- the brands that are focused on the more moderate income consumer. So there's no question that that's having some impact. But the good news is you've got employment and you've got wage growth that is counter balancing that, but they're definitely being more cautious. So that's not necessarily affecting a higher income consumer to the extent that you might otherwise think, but it's clearly affecting the lower or more moderate income consumer that they're being more cautious. And from our standpoint, from a retail point of view, demand, like I said earlier, we haven't seen it affecting retailers too much in terms of their growth plans. But we obviously monitor that every day. So from our standpoint, our cost of capital is up. So any investment we make, as I mentioned earlier, is in the -- is measured against return we would get from buying our stock back to return that we would get from redevelopment or development. And given that, that's why we haven't been active on the acquisition front. And I don't expect that to really change. In addition, we're always looking at monetizing our assets, whether it's real estate or otherwise, and to the extent that we can make the math work and we create liquidity through asset sales, the math is very compelling for us to do that to buy our stock back. And so you'll see more of that trend continue.\nGreg McGinniss: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMike Mueller: Yeah. Hi, just a quick one here. I know this is a bit of a hypothetical, but do you think you would have bought stock back if you didn't issue the shares to Taubman?\nDavid Simon: I think we would buy, I'm sorry, I think we're looking -- it's a good question, a fair question, and let me say this, the way I'm thinking about it. So to the extent that we have additional liquidity events or in the case of Taubman, dealing with the dilution of issuing stock at this price, there's no question we're going to buy our stock back. To the extent that we don't, I don't have an answer for you yet on whether we would have done it absent the TRG issuance or enhanced liquidity from asset sales. But like I said, our development pipeline, redevelopment pipeline is very much, very much measured up against the stock buyback. And every asset I've got, I don't have to own anything at this point. I'm happy to sell assets at the right price to buy our stock back. And I think you'll see more of that from us over time. And that could be real estate and/or other stuff.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay. And real quick, and just in case I missed this, was there any change to the OPI guidance that's embedded in your current FFO outlook?\nDavid Simon: Yes, we've lowered it. We've lowered it. Other than the -- you understand the $0.05 because we own less of SPARC. We have lowered it for the fourth quarter by roughly guys -- for the fourth quarter it would be about $0.20.\nBrian McDade: Yeah,\nDavid Simon: Roughly $0.20 in the fourth quarter. Lower contribution -- if you look in total for the year, and our share of that is roughly -- if you take out the $0.05, we've lowered it about $0.15 cents.\nMike Mueller: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. It’s actually Nick Joseph here with Craig. David, you've talked a lot on the share buybacks and it sounds like in your answer to the last question, we're open to asset sales and other monetization opportunities. What are you seeing in the transaction market today in terms of those asset sales? Where are cap rates? What's the buyer pool like? Are you seeing an opportunity to try to crystallize some of that disconnect between the stock price and where you'd hope to sell an asset?\nDavid Simon: Well look, I think domestic retail is not a lot of transactions, but we have assets throughout the world. That's one. Two is obviously we've got investments in our OPI category. But frankly, domestic assets other than maybe some of our residential stuff, hotel stuff, there's just not a lot happening. And we might see some stuff, but I think that won't be really driving kind of the activity that we would anticipate.\nNick Joseph: Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nLinda Tsai: Hi, thanks for taking my question. About 6% of ABR is on month-to-month leasing and then 12% expiring for ‘24. How much of the month-to-month is getting converted to permanent or should that number grow? And then in terms of the 12% expiring in ‘24, what's been addressed from a renewal standpoint from where you stand today?\nDavid Simon: Yeah, I know that there's a number of leases in ‘23 that are basically agreed to. We're just finalizing the documentation. So that's the first. And I would think that generally we're more than halfway through ‘24 right now on a kind of a negotiated, not papered basis. So, Brian, I don't know if you want to add anything to it, but that would be -- that's kind of where we are generically.\nBrian McDade: And Linda, you can see the material change, Q2 over to Q3, we've cleared about 2.2 million square feet out of that category. It's just a matter of processing. We talked about it on our last call. There's just a lag effect on the processing of those leases. So we do expect that to continue.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, good evening out there. Dave, I just had a quick follow-up on the consumer retail sales line of question from earlier. I think you noted your portfolio sales were flattish during the quarter. We've heard from other sectors, storage, apartments, which seemed like the consumer hit a bit of a wall during the third quarter in September. I'm curious if you saw anything within the quarter, maybe in September of that sort? And then perhaps what your expectations in the near-term outlook for retail sales for your portfolio and the consumer as we head into the holiday season the next year? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Sure. Well, generally, as we said earlier in the year, we expect to be more or less flat. So that's kind of what our expectations continue to be in terms of retail -- reported retailer sales. Again, we feel pretty good about the higher income consumer. We've also got a balancing act in terms of -- some of our value-oriented centers will maybe play a more important role for our consumer today that they might not have otherwise played last couple of years. But, it's unknown. I mean, we're being extra cautious because of the -- inflation is still a little bit there, still taking a bite out of the consumer and obviously you've got rates that are beginning to filter through the economic system. So cautious, flat, we're not anticipating a downturn, but not a robust sales growth for the fourth quarter, relatively flat.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Appreciate that. If I could squeeze in a follow-up, I think you mentioned earlier as well that you started, I think it was [$960 million] (ph) of new redevelopment at 6% yields, and you talked about a higher hurdle rate, maybe some color on perhaps what that hurdle rate today is and where the next batch of redevelopment yields or projects would need to be and where we could see them migrate to? Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure. Yeah, I think the -- it's a little bit dependent upon the real estate. So, and what we're trying to accomplish and what the benefits of that real estate are and where the market is for that. So, for instance, when we build a new residential apartment house, we look at kind of where the value and the cap rates for that are. They may be obviously lower than our own, but to the extent that we feel like we might sell it and make the arbitrage, we'll do that. Again, if we've got an asset that's a 6% cap rate, we're building to an 8%, that's creating value. On the other hand, if we have an 8% asset that we're building to a 6%, it ain't going to happen. So there's no -- we have themes. We have points of view. But just like anything else, every transaction we do, every redevelopment we do really is grounded by what we're trying to accomplish with that real estate. So -- but overall, again, like I said earlier, we've got to push it higher because, our cost of capital regardless is up across the board. So we don't have the luxury to build dilutive deals. And as you know, we've never really bought dilutive. We've never really built dilutive. And we certainly don't anticipate in doing that today. We've always had a spread to our financing and to the quality of what we built. We expect that to continue but that -- obviously those thresholds have been raised.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nJuan Sanabria: Saving the best for last. I love it. Thanks for the time. I'm just curious if you could comment on kind of the watch list you've commented about the consumer, but maybe what the bad debt has been here to date with the historical levels is in your perspective as you think about ‘24.\nDavid Simon: The watch list on retailers?\nJuan Sanabria: Yes sir.\nDavid Simon: Yeah, it's relatively low. There are a couple that were there today that probably weren't there last year. Obviously I'm not going to name those. So it certainly hasn't grown all that much, but there are one or two retailers that we're paying close attention to. And I probably wouldn't have said that last year. So I think that -- I mean it's not a very good answer, but it's probably the best way to explain it without naming names. But there are a couple on that list today that didn't exist yesterday. But they're not 10 names, they're a couple. Brian, you want to add anything?\nBrian McDade: No, I think that's right, David. It is certainly expanded, but by only two or three names. And it's at a relatively low point relative to history.\nDavid Simon: Yeah, and I want to just confirm with everyone that that is, as you look at our, what page is our top tenant list on?\nBrian McDade: It's on 22.\nDavid Simon: 22? It's certainly none of the category that is in our top 10 or top 20. So -- and as you know, our department stores don't pay -- really don't pay all that much. Well, you have the rent there in terms of what they pay.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Simon for closing comments.\nDavid Simon: Well, thank you, and we finished a little bit earlier. So I think, enjoy the rest of the evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Good evening. And I'm pleased to report our third-quarter results. Third quarter funds from operation were $1.2 billion or $3.20 per share. Let me walk you through some of the highlights for this quarter. Compared to the same quarter of 2022, domestic and international operations had a very good performance this quarter, and contributed $0.17 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Non-cash after-tax gain -- gains of $0.32 in the third quarter were related to the partial sale of our ownership interest in SPARC and ABG as a result of ABG selling primary shares in the quarter. Higher interest expense was a setback of $0.07 year-over-year. We had a $0.15 lower contribution from our other property investment platform compared to Q3 2022, and a $0.02 loss on mark-to-market of publicly traded securities. FFO from our real estate business was $2.91 per share in the third quarter compared to $2.83 in the prior period last year. So far, our real estate has produced $8.55 per share for the first nine months compared to $8.40 from last year. We are pleased with the transaction SPARC completed with SHEIN during the third quarter that demonstrated the value that we have created in that business. The transaction was significantly above our basis. And as a result, we recognized a gain in the corner. And the transaction ultimately reduced our ownership interest in SPARC from 50% to 33% as we have managed SHEIN as a partner. Given our lower ownership interest in the back-end weighting profitability in the fourth quarter, we now expect $0.05 lower FFO contribution from SPARC in the fourth quarter of this year. During the third quarter, the Taubman family exercised their put right on a portion of their interest in TRG. We exchange 1.725 million partnership interest units for an additional 4% ownership interest. We now own 84% of TRG. Domestic property NOI increased 4.2% year-over-year for the quarter and 3.8% for the first nine months. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 4.3% for the quarter and 4% for the first nine months of the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 95.2%, an increase of 70 basis points compared to last year. Our third quarter occupancy is higher than fourth quarter of last year, which has not occurred historically. The mill's occupancy was 97.4%, and occupancy is above all year-end 2019 levels for all of our platforms. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 2.9% year-over-year and the mills was 3.6% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continues across our portfolio. We signed more than 970 leases for approximately $4.3 million square feet in the quarter. Through the first nine months of 2023, we signed more than 3,500 leases for 15 million square feet, which is expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue. We have an additional 1,100 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for another $400 million in revenue. We are seeing strong broad-based demand from retail community, including continued strength for many categories. Reported retail sales per square foot in the third quarter was $744 for the mills and outlets combined and $676 for mills. We continue to be active in redevelopment and new development. During the quarter, we started construction on a significant redevelopment at Brea Mall, and a new upscale outlet center in Jakarta, our first Premium Outlet in Indonesia. We completed the refinancing of 11 property mortgages during the first nine months of the year for a total of $960 million at an average rate of 6%. We have -- our balance sheet is strong with approximately $8.8 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced a dividend of $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter, which is a year-over-year increase of 5.6%. The dividend is payable on December 29th. And we also purchased approximately 1.27 million shares of our common stock for $140 million. We are increasing our full-year 2023 guidance from $11.85 to $11.95, to $12.15 to $12.25 per share. This is an increase of $0.30 at the midpoint. So to conclude, I'm pleased with our third-quarter results. Our business is performing well and is ahead of our plan. Tenant demand is strong. Occupancy is increasing. Base minimum rent levels are at record levels. And we are very experienced at managing our business through volatile periods of time. And as you all know, this is when we do some of our best work. So, we're now ready for your questions. Sure. Look, I think we feel good about that kind of comparable NOI growth. Our debt is reasonably laddered. So yes, we'll have some interest expense headwinds, but we still think we'll end up growing our business next year with that said. Go ahead, Ron. Sure. No, we're going to have $0.05 lower because of the SPARC-SHEIN deal. We lost a couple of cents from our mark to market on a couple of our public securities that we own last quarter. And essentially the real estate business has been very significant to our growth and we'll kind of see where the fourth quarter ends up but I think it's -- 97% of our business is going to outperform what we thought from originally what we had budgeted. Sure. Well, thank you, Caitlin. So I would say, let me try and address your questions in no particular word. I think we'll be, year-end occupancy will be obviously higher than it is today. I don't know that it will be our highest ever, but it it'll be within distance pretty close. Even with all the volatility in the world and the market, we still expect -- we still see demand very strong. I mean, we're -- frankly, we're cautious, we're waiting for shoes to drop, but we haven't seen it on our new deals, whether it's F&B, entertainment, high-end luxury tenants, athleisure, just to name some categories. We're seeing -- we're still seeing a lot of demand on that front. And I would say from a pricing element, we feel -- I would say we feel comparable to the way we felt in ‘15, ‘16, ‘17 era, in terms of era. I guess that was almost seven, eight years ago, but lots happened over those seven or eight years. But we still feel like that's kind of -- we're in that good shape where we're driving rents up and it's okay for the retailers. They're making deals and supplying demands in our favor. Obviously we cycled through a lot of poor performing retailers due to COVID. And the ones that we are doing new deals with are excited to do business with us. So pricing is for sure going in the right direction. Occupancy is going up. And tenant demand is pretty strong across the whole spectrum. And even in certain categories, just to take luxury, yes, there are some that are being more cautious, but there's plenty that are growing new stores. So it's really retail specific. Obviously bricks and mortar through the pandemic to today has proven its value to retailers. I'm sure you hear that on the conference calls from retailers. So in that sense, we're making a lot of good stuff happen. Brian, did you have something on the occupancy? Thank you. Sure. It's interesting. I would say we're seeing pretty good tenant sales growth on the tourism properties, whether they're outlet or malls. Now, the most of our pure tourist properties are really the outlet centers, and we're seeing good growth in that category. Traffic, generally, is slightly above last year, still slightly below ‘19, but obviously conversions way up because our sales are on a per square foot basis are much higher than ‘19. I would say generally whether mall or outlet, the Sun Belt area has produced pretty good results in terms of sales year-to-date. We saw actually a decent pickup in California which was encouraging, but really good growth in a Woodbury Common that is finally getting the tourism back to where it is. And, [Prairie] (ph) has been strong in the outlet business. There's no question people are looking for a little more value or maybe they're looking for a lot more value given the higher inflation that the consumers had to deal with. Not a huge bifurcation between malls and outlets. It's very property specific. The different -- as you know, we reported flat sales basically quarter-over-quarter and there's no real difference between outlets and malls in that number. Luxury probably, well didn't probably, it did flatten out in the third quarter of this year for sure, but it wasn't across the board. It was more a couple specific retailers had a tough Q3, others were up. So it was really retailer-specific. Jewelry, malls may have a little more exposure to jewelry. So that was a category that took a little more on the chin. Yet some of our higher end retailers in the jewelry category performed well. So it was basically not a real trend. I'd say the most important thing to come away with is that the Sun Belt continues to perform well and we're seeing the tourist centers kind of make a nice comeback. They've been lagging a little bit more than the others over time, and a little bit of flatlining in the luxury category. Tom, Brian, anything you want to add? Okay. Thank you. Well, we don't have -- I mean, thank you for the question, Alex. We're not that far away. You always say out here, we're really not that far away. But put that aside, it's not a question of leverage over the retailers. I think what we have going for us is a great diverse portfolio. It's the best in the industry from mills to our outlets to our full price malls. And that's unique, its size, its scale, its quality that we've built up over many, many years. And as you remember, I don't think it was last quarter, maybe it was, Tom, but when we went through the transformation of the portfolio, was it last quarter? So we've done a lot to try to improve the quality of the portfolio. And I would say that obviously there's not a lot of new retail being built. There's not a lot of retailers closing stores and -- or going bankrupt. And I think most retailers today know kind of the good malls and the good properties versus the not so good. And when you add that up, supply and demand is in our favor and we're generating market rents. It's neither here nor there. But importantly, and I think I'd like to address this with you is that, and again, I'm sure retailers have different point of view, but I think the most interesting fact, or the most interesting thing that we have going for us in addition to the quality, diversity, et cetera, that I mentioned, they know we're going to be around. So -- and they know that we'll stick to a deal, we'll make it happen. When we say we're going to redevelop something, we do it. And I think that when there are open to buys, we tend to get our fair share of those or more than because of some of the factors that I mentioned, quality, scale, but also the fact that they know we're going to get the job done. And obviously there's been a lot of changes in mall ownership over the years. Balance sheet and quality of operations is a two-way street. It's both. As we look at retailers, we assess that. They certainly assess us. And I think that gives us an advantage that we've worked very hard, as you know, to achieve and, I mean, how do I say this? I mean, we've really outpaced our peer group dramatically in any measure you want, growth, earnings, dividend, quality of operations, scale, balance sheet, the -- I know we all focus quarter to quarter and this and that, but if you take a step back and you go, what do you got going for you? And again, we don't -- this sounds a little braggadocious. I don't want it to, but I mean, we've really outpaced, if you look over the last 10 -- 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 years, you know, we've dramatically outpaced our peer group. Thank you. No follow-up. I stumped you. I love it. Thank you, Jeff. So look, I think we have the ability to develop and redevelop because we're not -- essentially what I said earlier, we're not -- listen, we've got to be stewards of capital, we've got to be very focused but we're not capital constrained the way some others might be. And our ability to invest in our portfolio is unmatched. So we intend to do that. Now at the same time, Jeff, rates are up. Returns for us have to be up. And so you haven't seen a really big change in our 8-K redevelopment, but that takes time because a lot of the stuff was put in place. But when we build something new or we redevelop, we're going to have to do a better job of leasing and returns and to warrant that capital because just about everything we do, I mean we still want to maintain our leadership position, but just about every amount of capital we spend, I have to measure it in my own mind against buying our stock back. And, I mean our stock, as you saw we bought stock back, so our stock is pretty compelling. So we want to redevelop, we want to new develop, but we've got a high hurdle that we've got to jump over. So like we've done historically, I expect us to find the right balance between continuing and to maintain our leadership position, investing in our properties for the benefit of shareholders, communities, retailers alike, but at the same time, we've got to be economic animals. And that's what -- everybody here understands that process, and that's what we try and achieve. Well, listen, it's a very good question and it's less and less of our business. As you know, it's under 5% of our earnings. You also have to understand that, when we add to the -- when we add it to our FFO, it's net income, which in many of these cases, you don't add -- well, all of these cases, you don't add back depreciation. So EBITDA and our FFO contribution are much different. Importantly, these have all been profitable endeavors. But we understand that even this small amount of earnings that we get in comparison to our total earnings power is volatile. People don't like the volatility. We'll, like we did with SPARC earlier, we're going to continue to harvest our investments over time. And as we do that, we're going to -- if you ask me today, we'll monetize things over time and we're going to buy our stock back because it's wildly accreted because let's look at it. You know what I trade at as a multiple of FFO and you know I have investment value in these investments, but they give us very little earnings because of GAAP. And if you do the math, you can see the accretion we would get on a buyback. So they're basically, I get no earnings from them, but I've got value and it's our job to get the value into cash, take the cash, buy our stock back or invest in properties and have it a bygone era of the time. But with an asterisk that said, attaboy, you made a lot of money. So that's the strategy. I hope that answers your question. Yeah, let me -- I'll just talk about the exchange a little bit, and then Brian can give you an idea. The occupancy is no big deal, but I'll let Brian go through that. So Taubman has the right to put their interest, their 4% interest for the next five years and it's basically at essentially appraised value. It's either a negotiation or we get appraisal firms. We decided to negotiate in good faith. We made a deal and then we issued the stock. And, I mean the reality is we're trading, Simon Property Group unequivocally is trading below appraised value. So one of the reasons we bought our stock back was, I'm not a big fan of issuing stock at this moment in time, so we'll use our capital to basically get rid of the dilution that we did issue. Now, Taubman had that right. They exercised it appropriately. We had a good faith negotiation, made a deal, and it was more or less at their appraised value. And to put it in perspective, for today's value, it's probably pretty close to where we negotiated our deal with Taubman pre-COVID and then obviously we got the COVID adjustment, but it was in that range, kind of where the deal was announced publicly. And so we're going to quarterize that dilution by buying our stock back. We started that once we made the deal. And I think the family's pretty smart. They said, Simon Property Group stock's undervalued, and I like the dividend, and why not? So I think, I don't know what will happen next year. It could be the same thing, but at this point they have 16% left in TRG. We're happy to own 100% of TRG. I think they're happy, to do what they're doing and we'll deal with it as time goes on. But nothing can happen the rest of this year and it's sometime next year that this all recycles. So with that said, I hope that answers that, but I'll --Brian, if you want to add anything to that, please. Well, again, this was a negotiated deal. Their view of appraised value started much higher than that with all due respect for us, which you might imagine. But we settled on a deal that today, if you go back in time to -- Taubman pre-COVID would have attributed Taubman's per share number in the $51 range. So somewhere in that range, we ended up, if you remember, doing COVID at $43 a share. I will tell you that their NOI today is higher than it was in ‘19. Portfolios change here and there, so it's really hard to do an apple on apple, but at the end of the day, that gives you the sense of things. But you're not that far off. I think that's a reasonable estimate. But that kind of puts all the metrics out there. And again, not a huge deal in the scheme of things, under a couple hundred million today. So -- but it gives you a perspective of kind of that. I think they would argue the appraised value is much higher than what they exchange at, but we ultimately did not go through the appraisal process. Thank you. Well, I mean, I'll see if Brian will add to it. Just remember, this is the total portfolio, so to move this thing up takes a lot, right? And spreads are just a moment -- leases that come in and go out. So you can't really look at it that way. So for us to move the entire portfolio gives you a sense of leasing spreads. Now, if you look at whatever pages on the 8-K, the new -- we added some new information there on the 29 -- 21. That -- you'll see some of that -- some of these that are going in there now are driving the rent. Those numbers now include our new leases that are driving that base minimum rent up. Yeah. I mean, I guess, again Vince, in order to have the average base minimum rent go up for 20,000 leases, okay, of 3%, versus 10% to 15% that calculate spread, you're going to be -- mathematically going to have rent spreads that are higher than the 3%. And we'll walk you through that later, but that, just from a math point of view, there's just no way that that can drive that number up, but we'll walk you through that. So when you say that, we would say to you that's not reality because in order to drive up average base minimum rent for 20,000 leases or thereabouts, you're going to have to outperform much more than the 3% on just what's rolling over. Thank you. Well, I'll take the last first. So I would say higher interest rates/inflation clearly is affecting a good portion of the consumer out there. So their affordability for -- and we're seeing this most on the consumer on what I'd call the kind of the more -- the brands that are focused on the more moderate income consumer. So there's no question that that's having some impact. But the good news is you've got employment and you've got wage growth that is counter balancing that, but they're definitely being more cautious. So that's not necessarily affecting a higher income consumer to the extent that you might otherwise think, but it's clearly affecting the lower or more moderate income consumer that they're being more cautious. And from our standpoint, from a retail point of view, demand, like I said earlier, we haven't seen it affecting retailers too much in terms of their growth plans. But we obviously monitor that every day. So from our standpoint, our cost of capital is up. So any investment we make, as I mentioned earlier, is in the -- is measured against return we would get from buying our stock back to return that we would get from redevelopment or development. And given that, that's why we haven't been active on the acquisition front. And I don't expect that to really change. In addition, we're always looking at monetizing our assets, whether it's real estate or otherwise, and to the extent that we can make the math work and we create liquidity through asset sales, the math is very compelling for us to do that to buy our stock back. And so you'll see more of that trend continue. Thank you. I think we would buy, I'm sorry, I think we're looking -- it's a good question, a fair question, and let me say this, the way I'm thinking about it. So to the extent that we have additional liquidity events or in the case of Taubman, dealing with the dilution of issuing stock at this price, there's no question we're going to buy our stock back. To the extent that we don't, I don't have an answer for you yet on whether we would have done it absent the TRG issuance or enhanced liquidity from asset sales. But like I said, our development pipeline, redevelopment pipeline is very much, very much measured up against the stock buyback. And every asset I've got, I don't have to own anything at this point. I'm happy to sell assets at the right price to buy our stock back. And I think you'll see more of that from us over time. And that could be real estate and/or other stuff. Yes, we've lowered it. We've lowered it. Other than the -- you understand the $0.05 because we own less of SPARC. We have lowered it for the fourth quarter by roughly guys -- for the fourth quarter it would be about $0.20. Roughly $0.20 in the fourth quarter. Lower contribution -- if you look in total for the year, and our share of that is roughly -- if you take out the $0.05, we've lowered it about $0.15 cents. Thank you. Well look, I think domestic retail is not a lot of transactions, but we have assets throughout the world. That's one. Two is obviously we've got investments in our OPI category. But frankly, domestic assets other than maybe some of our residential stuff, hotel stuff, there's just not a lot happening. And we might see some stuff, but I think that won't be really driving kind of the activity that we would anticipate. Thank you. Yeah, I know that there's a number of leases in ‘23 that are basically agreed to. We're just finalizing the documentation. So that's the first. And I would think that generally we're more than halfway through ‘24 right now on a kind of a negotiated, not papered basis. So, Brian, I don't know if you want to add anything to it, but that would be -- that's kind of where we are generically. Sure. Well, generally, as we said earlier in the year, we expect to be more or less flat. So that's kind of what our expectations continue to be in terms of retail -- reported retailer sales. Again, we feel pretty good about the higher income consumer. We've also got a balancing act in terms of -- some of our value-oriented centers will maybe play a more important role for our consumer today that they might not have otherwise played last couple of years. But, it's unknown. I mean, we're being extra cautious because of the -- inflation is still a little bit there, still taking a bite out of the consumer and obviously you've got rates that are beginning to filter through the economic system. So cautious, flat, we're not anticipating a downturn, but not a robust sales growth for the fourth quarter, relatively flat. Sure. Yeah, I think the -- it's a little bit dependent upon the real estate. So, and what we're trying to accomplish and what the benefits of that real estate are and where the market is for that. So, for instance, when we build a new residential apartment house, we look at kind of where the value and the cap rates for that are. They may be obviously lower than our own, but to the extent that we feel like we might sell it and make the arbitrage, we'll do that. Again, if we've got an asset that's a 6% cap rate, we're building to an 8%, that's creating value. On the other hand, if we have an 8% asset that we're building to a 6%, it ain't going to happen. So there's no -- we have themes. We have points of view. But just like anything else, every transaction we do, every redevelopment we do really is grounded by what we're trying to accomplish with that real estate. So -- but overall, again, like I said earlier, we've got to push it higher because, our cost of capital regardless is up across the board. So we don't have the luxury to build dilutive deals. And as you know, we've never really bought dilutive. We've never really built dilutive. And we certainly don't anticipate in doing that today. We've always had a spread to our financing and to the quality of what we built. We expect that to continue but that -- obviously those thresholds have been raised. Thank you. The watch list on retailers? Yeah, it's relatively low. There are a couple that were there today that probably weren't there last year. Obviously I'm not going to name those. So it certainly hasn't grown all that much, but there are one or two retailers that we're paying close attention to. And I probably wouldn't have said that last year. So I think that -- I mean it's not a very good answer, but it's probably the best way to explain it without naming names. But there are a couple on that list today that didn't exist yesterday. But they're not 10 names, they're a couple. Brian, you want to add anything? Yeah, and I want to just confirm with everyone that that is, as you look at our, what page is our top tenant list on? 22? It's certainly none of the category that is in our top 10 or top 20. So -- and as you know, our department stores don't pay -- really don't pay all that much. Well, you have the rent there in terms of what they pay. Thank you. Well, thank you, and we finished a little bit earlier. So I think, enjoy the rest of the evening."

I'm pleased to introduce, David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report our second quarter results. Second quarter funds from operation were $1.08 billion or $2.88 per share. I'll walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q2 of 2022. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.08 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Higher interest income, and other income of $0.04. Higher interest expense cost us $0.08 in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, a $0.05 lower contribution from our other platform investments and publicly held securities compared to Q2 2022. FFO from our real estate business was $2.81 per share in the second quarter compared to $2.78 per share in the prior year period and year-to-date that comparison is $5.65 per share in 2023 compared to $5.58 in 2022. Our real estate business is performing ahead of our plan and overcoming the headwinds from higher interest expense and we are also pleased with our OPI results in the quarter and continue to expect the business to meet our original 2023 guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. We believe the market value of our OPI platform is approximately $3.5 billion or roughly $10 per share. We generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $2.1 billion year-to-date. Domestic property NOI increased 3.3% quarter-over-quarter and 3.6% for the first half of the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.7% for the quarter and 3.8% for the first half of the year. Our mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 94.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the prior year. The mills occupancy was 97.3% and TRG was 93.7%. Average base minimum rent for the malls and outlets was $56.27 per foot, an increase of 3.1% year-over-year. This is an all-time high for our BMR and the mills rent increased 4.3% to an all-time high of $36.02 per foot. Leasing momentum continued across our portfolio. We signed more than 1,300 leases for more than 5.0 million square feet for the quarter, and we are up to 11 million square feet year-to-date. We have 1,100 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for approximately $470 million and occupancy cost more than 30% of our total lease activity in the first half of the year was new deal volume. We continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community across many categories. Reported retail sales per square foot in the second quarter was $747 per foot for our malls and outlets, the mills at $677 per foot. We also hosted our second annual National Outlet Shopping Day in June was very successful for shoppers and participating retailers. We generated more than 3 million shopper visits over that weekend. Feedback has been great. We are also excited to continue to build on this annual event, and we expect it to continue to get bigger and bigger each year. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of nine property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of $820 million at an average rate of 6%. Our balance sheet is strong. We have $8.8 billion of liquidity. Today, we are proud to announce our dividend of $1.90 per share for the third quarter. That's a year-over-year increase of 8.6%. The dividend will be payable on September 29. We have now paid over $40 billion in dividends since we've been public. We are increasing our full-year guidance of 2023 from $11.80 per share to $11.95 per share to $11.85 and respectively $11.95 per share. This is an increase of $0.05 at the bottom end of the range and $0.02 at the midpoint. Now, let me give you food for thought, if I may. We have built a world class portfolio over our long period of time since we've been public. Following our DeBartolo transaction in 1996, our portfolio consisted of 119 malls and 65 strip centers primarily in the Midwest. Since then, we have acquired 220 properties, developed more than 50 and disposed of approximately 250 properties. Of the original 184 properties in 1996, 37 remain in our portfolio today. So our high productive portfolio is a result of constant asset rotation. Finally, let me conclude by saying our business is performing well and is head of our internal plan. Tenant demand is excellent. Occupancy is increasing. Basement and rents are at record levels. Property NOI is growing and again, beating our internal expectations that we set at the beginning of the year. And we are now, operator, ready for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Mr. Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Sakwa: Thanks. Good afternoon, David.\nDavid Simon: How are you doing, Steve?\nStephen Sakwa: Good. I just wanted to follow-up on your leasing comments in the pipeline. Everything sounds really good and maybe even getting better as the year unfolds. So where do you ultimately think that occupancy in kind of the mall portfolio can ultimately settle out? And are you seeing an accelerating trend in pricing power across the portfolio?\nDavid Simon: Steve, first of all, I think will be north of 95% by year-end. And I want to be – I don't like the word pricing power so much. I think, our asset rotation that I mentioned earlier has allowed us to create kind of a portfolio that's really unrivaled in our industry. And given our strong tenant relationships, we're in a good spot to find kind of the win-win that needs to happen when you lease as much space as we do. The physical environment in terms of bricks-and-mortar sales is as important as ever. That's been reinforced by essentially every retailer and anyone that's in the e-commerce business. All look to that. I think there was obviously a long period of time where many felt, many of the [pundits] felt that bricks-and-mortar just don't matter. That's the furthest thing from the truth. So we continue to think our rollover. By and large is going to be positive. And we have the ability now with new tenant demand to replace retailers that aren't producing sales and which will allow us to generate higher rent. So I do think we're pushing up rents. I think we're doing it hopefully thoughtfully by and large and we expect that trend to continue. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ms. Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. David, you gave those details on the asset rotation since 1996, so I guess that's making me wonder, and I'm guessing everybody else. Should that be a suggestion to us that you're looking to get more active in asset recycling kind of near-term, medium-term acquisitions dispositions? Or was that just more a comment on kind of the Simon historical strategy?\nDavid Simon: Well, I would say, we've been very active, right? So I think, because of our size, it does get lost in translation that we're always recycling, always looking to improve the quality of the portfolio. So I would think our trend would continue in that sense and will always recycle assets. We find to the extent that we can do that and generate more liquidity. We find our – and not just it's every asset that we have to the extent that we think there's a good trade to do, whether it's to sell or to buy, we're going to pursue that. And I think it's been an important component of our success over time. At the same time, we've done it. As we all know, we've done it in a way where others have done it in a way to generate the quickest short-term returns through a lot of leverage. We've done it as thoughtfully in terms of maintaining the balance sheet as anyone. So that's been another key component of our ability to grow yet recycle. So I don't think I'm signaling, but maybe you have these epiphanies, so maybe it's possible, right, that there'll be some – we'll be more active on reallocating capital to different assets than we have today.\nCaitlin Burrows: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good afternoon down there, David. And also thank you for moving your call to avoid an overlap. Appreciated. So question, there was a recent press article and not that article, not which I'll let you opine if you want. But just talking about luxury sales, and my question is this, we all look at luxury as sort of like the ultimate, the driver of retail, if you will. But my question is really given how customer preferences have changed lifestyle, people changing how they live, sort of curious when you look at the tenant landscape. Are there any sectors that you would say are now, I guess going back to [Kaitlyn's] early 90s example. Are there any sectors now where you're like, hey, 20, 30 years ago, this sector was nowhere and now it's 20% of retail or it's the absolute must have. And I'm just sort of curious if luxury is still sort of that dominant place in retail, or if it's more nichey and it works in certain malls, but for the bulk of what really drives your cash flow to bottom line, maybe it's other sectors. I'm just trying to understand how the face of retail has changed using your analogy of over the past 30 years, what the company looked like then in the Midwest versus now?\nDavid Simon: Yes. Look, I would say, unquestionably the – some of the best retailers in the world like Kering or an LVMH Group, have the best brands, and they do the most volume. They build the best stores. They think longer term over any retailer that we've ever experienced. They're true to their business. So we admire what they do. We admire how they build their brand. We admire how they maintained their brand. They have loyal customers. So there's no better companies to do business with that belief, and we aspire to be more like them than, than anything. And I think how they maintain their stores and how they treat their customers and how they're true to themselves. So the luxury business is here to stay. It's growing. It's really important. It's worldwide. It's a great consumer that loves physical retail, that wants to go shop and do other things at our centers. So we want to do as much business as we can with them. They're still very focused. Obviously sales have flattened a little bit compared to Q2 of 2022. But if you look at where they are and Tom and Brian, I don't know off the top of my head, Alex, but they can – we're 20%, 30%, 40% above where we were in 2019. But I don't remember the exact number. But they can give it to you later. So one of the interesting things is LVMH Group, and really if you look at our 8-K, they're now our – in our top 10 tenants. We couldn't be more proud of that relationship and the brands that they have. So this is not a niche business. This is a growing business. It's for exactly the affluent shopper, the established shopper, but also the affluent shopper. And the fact that we do so much business with them is something that we're extremely proud of. And we will – I don't like the word lean in, but we will do as much as we can to continue to foster those relationships. And that is a huge differentiating point that we have at Simon Property Group. So it's all systems go there. Yes, sales will flatten, they'll go up, they'll go down, but their commitment to their customer and what they do in the stores, I think goes unabated. And they really – I admire the fact that they take – they're not a quarter-to-quarter company, they take a much longer view of their brand and where they want to plant their flag and how they want to treat their customers. So they are true partners and great generally across the board. We love doing business with them. And it's not a niche. And that business is growing, it's growing worldwide. And in fact, if anything, we'd like to follow kind of where they're headed because we think there's great business to do together. I hear you typing. Is that – another question?\nAlexander Goldfarb: Sorry. No, I think Tom said and Federal is right after you guys, so I thought my mic was already cut, so I didn't know you could…\nDavid Simon: We're kidding. We're only kidding. We'll talk to you later. Thanks, Alex.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good afternoon. Could you discuss the [current thread] between leased and physical occupancy? And then kind of the cadence in what visibility your store openings for leases that have been executed, but are not yet open?\nBrian McDade: So this is Brian. We are still hovering right around 200 basis points of unopened. That ebbs and flows as you might imagine every month given the velocity of our business. We do think we're going to carry that through year end. And certainly, we do expect that we are going to continue to see openings throughout the balance of the year, as retailers open later this month and into September and October.\nDavid Simon: And I would say, just on follow-up on that, Vince, is that, a lot of the business that we have signed leases on and/or about to be signed is still – and I don't – I mean, we can give you the exact number. I don't have it again at the top of my tongue, but – at the tip of my tongue. But there is a lot of the business that we've signed or about to be signed is really 2024 and even 2025 business. And especially, when we're in the – we're talking the restaurant business, you're talking nine months build out, you're talking permits that are required to get – it's a little more complicated getting restaurant permits, liquor license, et cetera. We've got some great restaurants going into Forum, Crystal, Stanford, Boca, but you're literally talking about a year to get permitted, get opened. To some extent some of this was delayed also with just equipment because of the COVID and the – all of the supply chain issues associated with it. So – and again, when you're talking about our full price business, build outs are longer than the outlet or the mills business. So the pipe on that sense is pretty good, which is not in these numbers. But we also on that front have boxes that are scheduled to open in 2024, 2025. That is obviously serious long time, a year plus build out. A lot of business with Dick's, Primark, Life Time Fitness, et cetera that even Barnes is doing new deals. We're building a new store with Kohl's. Stuff that just takes time – and hours to shields, et cetera, even though they just recently opened in Wichita to a great opening, which is one of our 37, by the way, just for a fun fact. So the build out is frustrating in that, it does take time, but it's – so we still expect some really interesting things to happen in 2024, 2025 as these tenants open. And remember in a lot of cases, the more interesting the retailer, the longer the build out there is a correlation there.\nVince Tibone: Yes. That makes sense. That's all really helpful color. I appreciate that. My next question, I was hoping you could discuss how demand today [differ by] retail format and geography. I'd be curious to hear anything between malls and outlets and also between gateway markets and suburban centers.\nDavid Simon: Simply, I thought, as I go back in time, I think the – and I'm trying to go through COVID. I think the demand in the outlet business has picked up more. It was slower to pick up than the mall business, and I think it's finally picked up to kind of where the mall business has been. So I think demand from a product type is kind of even now, and that's not to say malls have slowed down, the outlet took a little bit longer to pick back up. Mills was somewhat unabated in that. And as you know, it's a combination of any and all. Regionally, by and large, the super regional suburban sites have a high level of interest across the board. We don't have a lot of city center stuff. So it's – we're not the right guy to ask. But I am happy that our portfolio is positioned in the high catchment areas in the suburbs. And then finally, regionally, as you might imagine, where you're seeing population growth, Texas, Tennessee, Florida, those kind of places are seeing a little bit more of the outsized demand. But again, in real estate, you could still have the best location in kind of a micro environment that does unbelievably well because it still is the center of attention. So you got to be careful on these geographic trends one way or another. It really is, as we all know. Real estate is very location oriented. But I would say those are just kind of generic trends hasn't changed all that much. But the suburbs continue to be as we said a few years ago, well ahead of most. We still felt like that was the place to be, and we're happy to see that. Not that we make a lot of predictions, but we're happy to see that prediction. At least one of them came true.\nVince Tibone: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Just one quick one. Just thinking about the growth function of the business. You talk about getting to 95% occupancy by the end of the year. Obviously, that annualizes in 2024. So when I think about the occupancy boost, the rent bumps, re-leasing spreads, it doesn't seem like a stretch to get to a 3% plus number next year in growth. So I'm trying to understand what are some of the moving pieces we should be thinking about as we're building out the growth function of the business in 2024?\nDavid Simon: Well, I think it's all of the likely suspects. It's lease-up, it's renewal spreads, it's new business, Obviously, it's overage or percent sales and sales activity. So there's nothing new there. I mean it's all the stuff that has allowed us to grow our comp NOI over a long period of time through a lot of volatility, COVID – real estate recessions, e-commerce, proliferation of this, that and the other. So it's all of those likely suspects. I mean I think we feel generally positive about our ability to grow comp NOI. But it's all the likely suspects and it's all the same metrics that we have to produce to generate that. And we still have the ability, even as we get up to 95%, thereabouts, we still have the ability to – which we can't lose sight of, we have the ability to replace retailers with better ones that will just common sense, we'll be able to pay higher rent because they'll be more productive. It's really that simple. So – but Ron, it's all the same stuff. And we're focused on hitting all of those cylinders certainly to finish this year, but also in 2024, 2025. And the added benefit that we have in 2024, 2025 is that we've got a lot in the pipeline that will finally open.\nRonald Kamdem: Helpful. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Thanks. Hey, good afternoon, guys. I had – unfortunately, I have to limit it to one. So I won't focus on the less important OPI stuff. But maybe if you can talk a little bit more about the 200 basis points of sign-on open. Presumably, that's higher in your mall portfolio than your outlets? And maybe if you could also quantify in terms of dollar amount or NOI impact, I know that a lot of those leases in that. So there's a lot of luxury tenants, which typically pay significantly higher rents. So presumably, it has a greater impact on your NOI and ABR than your – than the percentage just in terms of occupancy?\nDavid Simon: Look, we don't want to get into that level of detail. We certainly will for 2024 as we outlined what our comp NOI growth is. But you're 100% right that the – it is much easier and quicker to open an outlet store. The build-out can be anywhere between 30 and 90 days. And the mall generally can be six months plus. And then when you get to complicated tenants or where the build-out is expensive. You're talking nine months plus restaurants in that area. But we do – and it goes back to, I think, Floris, you were one of the original analyst that was very focused on when we're going to get back to 2019 levels. And I'm happy to say that we will be back. We better be back, okay, but we will be back in there in 2024. And a lot of that really at the end of this year, we annualize it, so it really is a function of getting those retailers open. But the specific numbers, I mean, I'll – if the guys want to talk offline and go through it, I'm certainly happy to do that. But that's – I think it's better answered as we go through 2024 our comp NOI plan with you early next year.\nFloris Van Dijkum: Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. Good afternoon. A follow-up question, David, on your comment on potentially allocating to money or investments into other assets. I mean, you've been doing that really since world financial crisis, investing in the best properties. You've been densifying assets with apartments, et cetera. Is there anything else that you're thinking of changing that you've noticed a change, let's say, between the difference in the assets you own or what you're seeing out in the retail landscape? Or really sticking with those programs as well?\nDavid Simon: I think, Jeff, we're going to more or less stick to our programs, but what we've done historically, I think it's been the right strategy. We'll nick and neck, I mean, we've had good experience by and large, not perfect, but good experience experimenting here and there. But our core business is high-quality retail real estate. We're not moving away from that by any stretch of the imagination. We have lots of levers in that category to pull in terms of how we want to allocate capital. Do we want to put more here versus there, do we want to sell this and reinvest that. So I think that – if I had the ability to express it, we think about that all of the time. We never really talk about it. But as we – the sole purpose of going through that asset rotation was to tell you that we do think about this stuff all the time. And beyond just think about it, we actually do stuff about it. So – and sometimes communicating that to investors and analysts is important to know that we're going to reallocate capital where we think the growth is, and we're not afraid to sell or buy or hold or whatever kind of we think is the right thing to do. So that's really it. I wouldn't make – this is not like – we're not trying to like here we go, something is big around the corner. It's just – we've done this, and we just wanted to point it out.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Mueller: Yes. Hi. Can you give us a sense as to how rent spreads compare when you move from the mall and outlet portfolio to TRG to the mills?\nDavid Simon: Well, I don't want to really talk about TRG so much, but I would say the spreads are – when you look at mills, outlets and malls, it's all pretty decent. We still see – our occupancy cost now is around 12%, right? So we're feeling better about our ability to generate positive rent spreads. It's not always going to happen on every space in every mall or outlet, but we're seeing it pretty much across the board. And as again, I would say to you from what might shift is where I thought our outlet business was a little slower coming out of COVID. We're seeing a much better pickup over the last year or so there. And so we're optimistic that, that's going to continue as well.\nMichael Mueller: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. In your opening remarks, you talked about the deals in the pipeline and that 30% of lease activity in the first half was new deal volume. How does that compare to the past? And what does this indicate? Does this indicate that there is greater interest for new concepts to – that are interested in leasing or is there some other meaning behind this data point that you provided? Thank you.\nDavid Simon: I just think it – most importantly, it reinforces the importance of our product and it reinforces how retailers feel about our – the mall and the outlet business. So it's a great sign. I mean it's a great sign that we have new concepts. And I would say, generally, the 30% has really developed over the last, say, two months and whether it's direct-to-consumer, whether it's the luxury, whether it's a restaurant business, whether it's entertainment, we're seeing entertainment pickup like we did pre-COVID. So I think it's a testament to the product, the new retailers that want to open new stores in our existing product is a great sign and a great testament. And that level is certainly much higher than I've seen since I mean, it goes – I'm going to say, almost seven, eight years because the 2020 – I'm sorry, in 2019, we probably didn't have that level of percentage of new tenants. So it's clearly higher than it was in the 2019, 2018, 2017 level, and it kind of goes back to where we were in the 2014, 2015, 2016 level. So it's a good sign for sure.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi. Good afternoon. Two-part question. One, it looks like there's a $0.10 or $0.11 gain in the P&L. Just curious if you could talk a little bit about what that is and if that was assumed in the guidance the prior guidance? And then secondly, if you have any comments on the prior quarter's comments on domestic property NOI of at least 3%. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: No, no, no, I know that. But the two – what did you say 2%?\nJuan Sanabria: 3%.\nDavid Simon: 3%, let me start there. So yes, we're feeling very comfortable that we'll be above the 3%. The after-tax gain is associated with the ABG raising of primary capital, which we get diluted down. So it's a – we have a dilution gain after tax, it was $0.07.\nBrian McDade: Yes, there's $0.03 of tax in the tax line, Michael, for that transaction.\nJuan Sanabria: Okay. And that wasn't in the prior guidance, I'm assuming, correct?\nDavid Simon: Well, we didn't – I don't – we give a pretty big range and really wasn't in our guidance so much to speak because that's really out of our control.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey. Good afternoon. So quick two-parter on Taubman from me. NOI was down 3% from last quarter, while occupancy was up 40 basis points. Just curious what the drivers were of that decline. And then in line with your comments on asset recycling, can you remind us the process by which you would recapture the remaining 20% of that investment and whether you're planning to do so? Or maybe that's one of the assets that you might be looking to recycle?\nDavid Simon: Well, I'm not going to comment on that. So there are puts and calls associated with Taubman over basically a five-year period. They have the right to kind of slowly put 20% of their interest to us, and then we eventually have a call associated with it. So that's that. And Brian, why don't you go through the – it really was more of a function of kind of the percent rent or overage rent that they had in Q2 of last year. But you can – do you have any other comment on it.\nBrian McDade: Yes, Greg, that's exactly what it was. You can see on a year-to-date basis, we're still ahead, but they did have a higher percent of rent contribution in Q2 of last year than they did this year.\nDavid Simon: The other thing on Taubman, if you on TRG, so our FFO contribution this quarter versus last quarter is lower, and it's primarily three things. Number one is, we've got D&O insurance reimbursement in Q2 of 2022. That's number one. Number two is we also had a land sale. And then obviously, number three is the higher interest expense. So there are a little more exposure to floating rate debt there. And I think the spread difference between our FFO contribution from TRG to Q2 of 2022 over 2023 was – how many cents? $0.07, something like this?\nBrian McDade: $0.07.\nDavid Simon: $0.07, okay? So I still remember numbers. So if you go through – so our FFO contribution from Taubman TRG where we own 80% was $0.07 lower this quarter than Q2 of last quarter of 2022, okay? So that might be helpful to you. Those are the order of magnitude, if there's any details on that call Tom or Brian. But that's generally it. So we had a lower contribution. Is that the right number, Adam?\nAdam Reuille: Yes.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Thank you. That's the right number. So there's really not much to ask.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey. Good evening out there. David, can you talk about…\nDavid Simon: To be technical, we're really not out there. We're actually in New York City today. So I know Indiana is considered out there, which I will not comment on, but we're actually right here. I don't know where you are, but we're right here in New York City.\nHaendel St. Juste: I'm not too far from you. So can you talk about the outlook for retail sales in the back half of the year given the macro and the expiration of the student loan payments and what you think that will do or impact that will have on the business. And maybe some commentary also on year-to-date debt how that's trending and early thoughts on potential improvement on that line item in 2024? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Yes. I would say we're actually optimistic on the back half of this year because comps or sales, I should say, in the second half of 2022 really started to decelerate because of the – obviously, the increase in interest rates, gas prices, inflation. So I think across the board, our comps get easier for our retailers in the second half – so we're actually optimistic. And I think generally, the economy, as we all know, is seems to relatively stable. Obviously, it's a very uncertain world. So anything can happen. But we're actually optimistic on sales for the second half, and we expect it to comp up on – with respect to bad debt, we're not seeing – I mean it continues to be lean and mean – and it's a little more than maybe last year, but it's like – it's still comparatively historical lows.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLinda Tsai: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of 3% NOI growth, is that the level you think you could sustain next year?\nDavid Simon: I would hope so, yes.\nLinda Tsai: Any color around that?\nDavid Simon: Not one of my qualities, but that was the most succinct answer that all day. Do you have another question, Linda?\nLinda Tsai: Sure. I guess on Page 19, you also broke out mixed-use in franchise operations income and also the same line item for expense. Maybe just a little more color?\nDavid Simon: Yes. I think Brian and Tom felt because we're doing – and these are only consolidated assets, so we have a – we have a big franchise operation with Starbucks in terms of our – where we franchise some Starbucks location plus, obviously, we're building hotels. And the – and it was all lumped into the other income, other expense, and we thought instead of having all the questions on why is this number growing and this number growing? We kind of – we just felt like it would be better to separate it. For your – believe it or not, for your benefit.\nLinda Tsai: And then how do we model that going forward?\nDavid Simon: Look, I think the hotel business is pretty straightforward in that we're building it. We have certain returns. And I think we pretty much outlined our returns in our 8-K. So I think that's pretty. Obviously, it takes time for apartments or hotels or any mixed use to stabilize. But I think that will be pretty easily. At the end of the day, the Starbucks business is not over – it's not even material. So there is some profit embedded in there, but it's – we view it more as an amenity that we can make some margin on. And it's grown a little bit bigger than what it was historically because we took over some of the operations during COVID. And so that's not an overly material number and we can kind of give you order of magnitude of revenue and expense. The only problem this year really some of these just came on board. So I'd say to you in 2024 will be the kind of the first full-year, and that will probably be – we can certainly outline what it is. But the net profit is not overly important. Does that's help?\nLinda Tsai: Yes. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Mailman: Good afternoon. David, just a quick clarification on one of the earlier questions about the $0.07 net gain. You guys raised guidance here by $0.05 at the midpoint. Could you just run through if there are any other puts and takes that moved around with guidance this quarter or maybe this wasn't the sole driver, but maybe something operational, and this could have offset something else? Just trying to get a sense that was this the reason guidance went up and had this not happened, you guys would have ended up kind of lowering the range here on the margin?\nDavid Simon: No. I mean I think we're always pretty conservative. So we'll see how the – we're always trying to beat and improve our numbers. I think we have as good a history of anybody to do that. And again, we always – I know that might frustrate folks, but there's always puts and takes in a company our size. I mean we have $80 billion of assets. We're not a small strip center company that's got – there's going to be some volatility. We've got a $3.5 billion asset portfolio. But so far, this year has thrown off zero earnings, FFO essentially, it's mostly back-half – back-end weighted. Again, we have $3.5 billion of value market doesn't value. It's not in our earnings. I think the number to look at is our – the number we gave you, which is our kind of FFO real estate earnings. That was at 281, if I remember that was hurt by $0.08 of rising interest rates. That's 289. I think we give you comp NOI, you're going to have some volatility because of OPI. I think OPI is really simple. $3.5 billion, it's going to make $0.50, $0.60. And it's on our books for a lot less – and again, in terms of investments and monetization and everything else associated with that, we're always going to do the right thing. So that's really it. I think obviously, overage rent has stabilized. So it's a little more conservative. We want to make sure we're conservative as we look at the year. If sales do grow on the back-end weighted that we think will be our overage number, which we mean we'll beat our guidance. But we don't have a crystal ball, but we've been – we've raised our guidance from the beginning of the year. That's the important thing. We've had headwinds with that rising rates went up higher than we thought – is probably the biggest headwind. And then second, the OPI's side has been more back-end weighted than we originally anticipated. And that's simple as that. The other thing to remember is – so ABG just raised money at basically a $20 billion enterprise value because of their growth, we got – we own 12% of the company. We got zero funds from operation contribution from them because of all of their onetime charges. We had the same situation in Penney, and that's why we are giving you this real estate FFO number, put a multiple on it. It's too low. Whatever multiple you think it is, I would add a couple of 100 basis points. It's too low then add $10 a share, and that's our NAV and then enjoy the rest of the summer. That's how I would think about it. Are you still there?\nCraig Mailman: I am. Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Okay. You buy that argument?\nCraig Mailman: We need to talk about.\nDavid Simon: All right. Thank you for listening. Okay. So I think we're out of questions, and I owe it to Don Wood. Now I want to tell you a story, okay? So we – Don initially stole our 5:00 o’clock time period – so we were not very happy and we said we'll do it together. And then I said, you know what, we're we loved Don, we want to be friendly. So not only did we move our time, but we gave Don the option of whether he wanted to do 4:30 or 5:30 and he chose 5:30. So if you don't like our time or you don't like his time, blame Don, but I'll hand it over to Don. I feel like Ed McMahon and Don is Johnny Carson. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

We do think we're going to carry that through year end. And certainly, we do expect that we are going to continue to see openings throughout the balance of the year, as retailers open later this month and into September and October. Yes, there's $0.03 of tax in the tax line, Michael, for that transaction. Yes, Greg, that's exactly what it was. You can see on a year-to-date basis, we're still ahead, but they did have a higher percent of rent contribution in Q2 of last year than they did this year. $0.07."

            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report our second quarter results. Second quarter funds from operation were $1.08 billion or $2.88 per share. I'll walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q2 of 2022. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.08 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Higher interest income, and other income of $0.04. Higher interest expense cost us $0.08 in the quarter-over-quarter comparison, a $0.05 lower contribution from our other platform investments and publicly held securities compared to Q2 2022. FFO from our real estate business was $2.81 per share in the second quarter compared to $2.78 per share in the prior year period and year-to-date that comparison is $5.65 per share in 2023 compared to $5.58 in 2022. Our real estate business is performing ahead of our plan and overcoming the headwinds from higher interest expense and we are also pleased with our OPI results in the quarter and continue to expect the business to meet our original 2023 guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. We believe the market value of our OPI platform is approximately $3.5 billion or roughly $10 per share. We generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and $2.1 billion year-to-date. Domestic property NOI increased 3.3% quarter-over-quarter and 3.6% for the first half of the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.7% for the quarter and 3.8% for the first half of the year. Our mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 94.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the prior year. The mills occupancy was 97.3% and TRG was 93.7%. Average base minimum rent for the malls and outlets was $56.27 per foot, an increase of 3.1% year-over-year. This is an all-time high for our BMR and the mills rent increased 4.3% to an all-time high of $36.02 per foot. Leasing momentum continued across our portfolio. We signed more than 1,300 leases for more than 5.0 million square feet for the quarter, and we are up to 11 million square feet year-to-date. We have 1,100 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for approximately $470 million and occupancy cost more than 30% of our total lease activity in the first half of the year was new deal volume. We continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community across many categories. Reported retail sales per square foot in the second quarter was $747 per foot for our malls and outlets, the mills at $677 per foot. We also hosted our second annual National Outlet Shopping Day in June was very successful for shoppers and participating retailers. We generated more than 3 million shopper visits over that weekend. Feedback has been great. We are also excited to continue to build on this annual event, and we expect it to continue to get bigger and bigger each year. Turning to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of nine property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of $820 million at an average rate of 6%. Our balance sheet is strong. We have $8.8 billion of liquidity. Today, we are proud to announce our dividend of $1.90 per share for the third quarter. That's a year-over-year increase of 8.6%. The dividend will be payable on September 29. We have now paid over $40 billion in dividends since we've been public. We are increasing our full-year guidance of 2023 from $11.80 per share to $11.95 per share to $11.85 and respectively $11.95 per share. This is an increase of $0.05 at the bottom end of the range and $0.02 at the midpoint. Now, let me give you food for thought, if I may. We have built a world class portfolio over our long period of time since we've been public. Following our DeBartolo transaction in 1996, our portfolio consisted of 119 malls and 65 strip centers primarily in the Midwest. Since then, we have acquired 220 properties, developed more than 50 and disposed of approximately 250 properties. Of the original 184 properties in 1996, 37 remain in our portfolio today. So our high productive portfolio is a result of constant asset rotation. Finally, let me conclude by saying our business is performing well and is head of our internal plan. Tenant demand is excellent. Occupancy is increasing. Basement and rents are at record levels. Property NOI is growing and again, beating our internal expectations that we set at the beginning of the year. And we are now, operator, ready for your questions. How are you doing, Steve? Steve, first of all, I think will be north of 95% by year-end. And I want to be – I don't like the word pricing power so much. I think, our asset rotation that I mentioned earlier has allowed us to create kind of a portfolio that's really unrivaled in our industry. And given our strong tenant relationships, we're in a good spot to find kind of the win-win that needs to happen when you lease as much space as we do. The physical environment in terms of bricks-and-mortar sales is as important as ever. That's been reinforced by essentially every retailer and anyone that's in the e-commerce business. All look to that. I think there was obviously a long period of time where many felt, many of the [pundits] felt that bricks-and-mortar just don't matter. That's the furthest thing from the truth. So we continue to think our rollover. By and large is going to be positive. And we have the ability now with new tenant demand to replace retailers that aren't producing sales and which will allow us to generate higher rent. So I do think we're pushing up rents. I think we're doing it hopefully thoughtfully by and large and we expect that trend to continue. Thank you. Well, I would say, we've been very active, right? So I think, because of our size, it does get lost in translation that we're always recycling, always looking to improve the quality of the portfolio. So I would think our trend would continue in that sense and will always recycle assets. We find to the extent that we can do that and generate more liquidity. We find our – and not just it's every asset that we have to the extent that we think there's a good trade to do, whether it's to sell or to buy, we're going to pursue that. And I think it's been an important component of our success over time. At the same time, we've done it. As we all know, we've done it in a way where others have done it in a way to generate the quickest short-term returns through a lot of leverage. We've done it as thoughtfully in terms of maintaining the balance sheet as anyone. So that's been another key component of our ability to grow yet recycle. So I don't think I'm signaling, but maybe you have these epiphanies, so maybe it's possible, right, that there'll be some – we'll be more active on reallocating capital to different assets than we have today. Yes. Look, I would say, unquestionably the – some of the best retailers in the world like Kering or an LVMH Group, have the best brands, and they do the most volume. They build the best stores. They think longer term over any retailer that we've ever experienced. They're true to their business. So we admire what they do. We admire how they build their brand. We admire how they maintained their brand. They have loyal customers. So there's no better companies to do business with that belief, and we aspire to be more like them than, than anything. And I think how they maintain their stores and how they treat their customers and how they're true to themselves. So the luxury business is here to stay. It's growing. It's really important. It's worldwide. It's a great consumer that loves physical retail, that wants to go shop and do other things at our centers. So we want to do as much business as we can with them. They're still very focused. Obviously sales have flattened a little bit compared to Q2 of 2022. But if you look at where they are and Tom and Brian, I don't know off the top of my head, Alex, but they can – we're 20%, 30%, 40% above where we were in 2019. But I don't remember the exact number. But they can give it to you later. So one of the interesting things is LVMH Group, and really if you look at our 8-K, they're now our – in our top 10 tenants. We couldn't be more proud of that relationship and the brands that they have. So this is not a niche business. This is a growing business. It's for exactly the affluent shopper, the established shopper, but also the affluent shopper. And the fact that we do so much business with them is something that we're extremely proud of. And we will – I don't like the word lean in, but we will do as much as we can to continue to foster those relationships. And that is a huge differentiating point that we have at Simon Property Group. So it's all systems go there. Yes, sales will flatten, they'll go up, they'll go down, but their commitment to their customer and what they do in the stores, I think goes unabated. And they really – I admire the fact that they take – they're not a quarter-to-quarter company, they take a much longer view of their brand and where they want to plant their flag and how they want to treat their customers. So they are true partners and great generally across the board. We love doing business with them. And it's not a niche. And that business is growing, it's growing worldwide. And in fact, if anything, we'd like to follow kind of where they're headed because we think there's great business to do together. I hear you typing. Is that – another question? We're kidding. We're only kidding. We'll talk to you later. Thanks, Alex. And I would say, just on follow-up on that, Vince, is that, a lot of the business that we have signed leases on and/or about to be signed is still – and I don't – I mean, we can give you the exact number. I don't have it again at the top of my tongue, but – at the tip of my tongue. But there is a lot of the business that we've signed or about to be signed is really 2024 and even 2025 business. And especially, when we're in the – we're talking the restaurant business, you're talking nine months build out, you're talking permits that are required to get – it's a little more complicated getting restaurant permits, liquor license, et cetera. We've got some great restaurants going into Forum, Crystal, Stanford, Boca, but you're literally talking about a year to get permitted, get opened. To some extent some of this was delayed also with just equipment because of the COVID and the – all of the supply chain issues associated with it. So – and again, when you're talking about our full price business, build outs are longer than the outlet or the mills business. So the pipe on that sense is pretty good, which is not in these numbers. But we also on that front have boxes that are scheduled to open in 2024, 2025. That is obviously serious long time, a year plus build out. A lot of business with Dick's, Primark, Life Time Fitness, et cetera that even Barnes is doing new deals. We're building a new store with Kohl's. Stuff that just takes time – and hours to shields, et cetera, even though they just recently opened in Wichita to a great opening, which is one of our 37, by the way, just for a fun fact. So the build out is frustrating in that, it does take time, but it's – so we still expect some really interesting things to happen in 2024, 2025 as these tenants open. And remember in a lot of cases, the more interesting the retailer, the longer the build out there is a correlation there. Simply, I thought, as I go back in time, I think the – and I'm trying to go through COVID. I think the demand in the outlet business has picked up more. It was slower to pick up than the mall business, and I think it's finally picked up to kind of where the mall business has been. So I think demand from a product type is kind of even now, and that's not to say malls have slowed down, the outlet took a little bit longer to pick back up. Mills was somewhat unabated in that. And as you know, it's a combination of any and all. Regionally, by and large, the super regional suburban sites have a high level of interest across the board. We don't have a lot of city center stuff. So it's – we're not the right guy to ask. But I am happy that our portfolio is positioned in the high catchment areas in the suburbs. And then finally, regionally, as you might imagine, where you're seeing population growth, Texas, Tennessee, Florida, those kind of places are seeing a little bit more of the outsized demand. But again, in real estate, you could still have the best location in kind of a micro environment that does unbelievably well because it still is the center of attention. So you got to be careful on these geographic trends one way or another. It really is, as we all know. Real estate is very location oriented. But I would say those are just kind of generic trends hasn't changed all that much. But the suburbs continue to be as we said a few years ago, well ahead of most. We still felt like that was the place to be, and we're happy to see that. Not that we make a lot of predictions, but we're happy to see that prediction. At least one of them came true. Thank you. Well, I think it's all of the likely suspects. It's lease-up, it's renewal spreads, it's new business, Obviously, it's overage or percent sales and sales activity. So there's nothing new there. I mean it's all the stuff that has allowed us to grow our comp NOI over a long period of time through a lot of volatility, COVID – real estate recessions, e-commerce, proliferation of this, that and the other. So it's all of those likely suspects. I mean I think we feel generally positive about our ability to grow comp NOI. But it's all the likely suspects and it's all the same metrics that we have to produce to generate that. And we still have the ability, even as we get up to 95%, thereabouts, we still have the ability to – which we can't lose sight of, we have the ability to replace retailers with better ones that will just common sense, we'll be able to pay higher rent because they'll be more productive. It's really that simple. So – but Ron, it's all the same stuff. And we're focused on hitting all of those cylinders certainly to finish this year, but also in 2024, 2025. And the added benefit that we have in 2024, 2025 is that we've got a lot in the pipeline that will finally open. Sure. Look, we don't want to get into that level of detail. We certainly will for 2024 as we outlined what our comp NOI growth is. But you're 100% right that the – it is much easier and quicker to open an outlet store. The build-out can be anywhere between 30 and 90 days. And the mall generally can be six months plus. And then when you get to complicated tenants or where the build-out is expensive. You're talking nine months plus restaurants in that area. But we do – and it goes back to, I think, Floris, you were one of the original analyst that was very focused on when we're going to get back to 2019 levels. And I'm happy to say that we will be back. We better be back, okay, but we will be back in there in 2024. And a lot of that really at the end of this year, we annualize it, so it really is a function of getting those retailers open. But the specific numbers, I mean, I'll – if the guys want to talk offline and go through it, I'm certainly happy to do that. But that's – I think it's better answered as we go through 2024 our comp NOI plan with you early next year. Sure. I think, Jeff, we're going to more or less stick to our programs, but what we've done historically, I think it's been the right strategy. We'll nick and neck, I mean, we've had good experience by and large, not perfect, but good experience experimenting here and there. But our core business is high-quality retail real estate. We're not moving away from that by any stretch of the imagination. We have lots of levers in that category to pull in terms of how we want to allocate capital. Do we want to put more here versus there, do we want to sell this and reinvest that. So I think that – if I had the ability to express it, we think about that all of the time. We never really talk about it. But as we – the sole purpose of going through that asset rotation was to tell you that we do think about this stuff all the time. And beyond just think about it, we actually do stuff about it. So – and sometimes communicating that to investors and analysts is important to know that we're going to reallocate capital where we think the growth is, and we're not afraid to sell or buy or hold or whatever kind of we think is the right thing to do. So that's really it. I wouldn't make – this is not like – we're not trying to like here we go, something is big around the corner. It's just – we've done this, and we just wanted to point it out. Sure. Well, I don't want to really talk about TRG so much, but I would say the spreads are – when you look at mills, outlets and malls, it's all pretty decent. We still see – our occupancy cost now is around 12%, right? So we're feeling better about our ability to generate positive rent spreads. It's not always going to happen on every space in every mall or outlet, but we're seeing it pretty much across the board. And as again, I would say to you from what might shift is where I thought our outlet business was a little slower coming out of COVID. We're seeing a much better pickup over the last year or so there. And so we're optimistic that, that's going to continue as well. Sure. I just think it – most importantly, it reinforces the importance of our product and it reinforces how retailers feel about our – the mall and the outlet business. So it's a great sign. I mean it's a great sign that we have new concepts. And I would say, generally, the 30% has really developed over the last, say, two months and whether it's direct-to-consumer, whether it's the luxury, whether it's a restaurant business, whether it's entertainment, we're seeing entertainment pickup like we did pre-COVID. So I think it's a testament to the product, the new retailers that want to open new stores in our existing product is a great sign and a great testament. And that level is certainly much higher than I've seen since I mean, it goes – I'm going to say, almost seven, eight years because the 2020 – I'm sorry, in 2019, we probably didn't have that level of percentage of new tenants. So it's clearly higher than it was in the 2019, 2018, 2017 level, and it kind of goes back to where we were in the 2014, 2015, 2016 level. So it's a good sign for sure. No, no, no, I know that. But the two – what did you say 2%? 3%, let me start there. So yes, we're feeling very comfortable that we'll be above the 3%. The after-tax gain is associated with the ABG raising of primary capital, which we get diluted down. So it's a – we have a dilution gain after tax, it was $0.07. Well, we didn't – I don't – we give a pretty big range and really wasn't in our guidance so much to speak because that's really out of our control. Well, I'm not going to comment on that. So there are puts and calls associated with Taubman over basically a five-year period. They have the right to kind of slowly put 20% of their interest to us, and then we eventually have a call associated with it. So that's that. And Brian, why don't you go through the – it really was more of a function of kind of the percent rent or overage rent that they had in Q2 of last year. But you can – do you have any other comment on it. The other thing on Taubman, if you on TRG, so our FFO contribution this quarter versus last quarter is lower, and it's primarily three things. Number one is, we've got D&O insurance reimbursement in Q2 of 2022. That's number one. Number two is we also had a land sale. And then obviously, number three is the higher interest expense. So there are a little more exposure to floating rate debt there. And I think the spread difference between our FFO contribution from TRG to Q2 of 2022 over 2023 was – how many cents? $0.07, something like this? $0.07, okay? So I still remember numbers. So if you go through – so our FFO contribution from Taubman TRG where we own 80% was $0.07 lower this quarter than Q2 of last quarter of 2022, okay? So that might be helpful to you. Those are the order of magnitude, if there's any details on that call Tom or Brian. But that's generally it. So we had a lower contribution. Is that the right number, Adam? Okay. Thank you. That's the right number. So there's really not much to ask. To be technical, we're really not out there. We're actually in New York City today. So I know Indiana is considered out there, which I will not comment on, but we're actually right here. I don't know where you are, but we're right here in New York City. Yes. I would say we're actually optimistic on the back half of this year because comps or sales, I should say, in the second half of 2022 really started to decelerate because of the – obviously, the increase in interest rates, gas prices, inflation. So I think across the board, our comps get easier for our retailers in the second half – so we're actually optimistic. And I think generally, the economy, as we all know, is seems to relatively stable. Obviously, it's a very uncertain world. So anything can happen. But we're actually optimistic on sales for the second half, and we expect it to comp up on – with respect to bad debt, we're not seeing – I mean it continues to be lean and mean – and it's a little more than maybe last year, but it's like – it's still comparatively historical lows. Thank you. I would hope so, yes. Not one of my qualities, but that was the most succinct answer that all day. Do you have another question, Linda? Yes. I think Brian and Tom felt because we're doing – and these are only consolidated assets, so we have a – we have a big franchise operation with Starbucks in terms of our – where we franchise some Starbucks location plus, obviously, we're building hotels. And the – and it was all lumped into the other income, other expense, and we thought instead of having all the questions on why is this number growing and this number growing? We kind of – we just felt like it would be better to separate it. For your – believe it or not, for your benefit. Look, I think the hotel business is pretty straightforward in that we're building it. We have certain returns. And I think we pretty much outlined our returns in our 8-K. So I think that's pretty. Obviously, it takes time for apartments or hotels or any mixed use to stabilize. But I think that will be pretty easily. At the end of the day, the Starbucks business is not over – it's not even material. So there is some profit embedded in there, but it's – we view it more as an amenity that we can make some margin on. And it's grown a little bit bigger than what it was historically because we took over some of the operations during COVID. And so that's not an overly material number and we can kind of give you order of magnitude of revenue and expense. The only problem this year really some of these just came on board. So I'd say to you in 2024 will be the kind of the first full-year, and that will probably be – we can certainly outline what it is. But the net profit is not overly important. Does that's help? Sure. Thank you. No. I mean I think we're always pretty conservative. So we'll see how the – we're always trying to beat and improve our numbers. I think we have as good a history of anybody to do that. And again, we always – I know that might frustrate folks, but there's always puts and takes in a company our size. I mean we have $80 billion of assets. We're not a small strip center company that's got – there's going to be some volatility. We've got a $3.5 billion asset portfolio. But so far, this year has thrown off zero earnings, FFO essentially, it's mostly back-half – back-end weighted. Again, we have $3.5 billion of value market doesn't value. It's not in our earnings. I think the number to look at is our – the number we gave you, which is our kind of FFO real estate earnings. That was at 281, if I remember that was hurt by $0.08 of rising interest rates. That's 289. I think we give you comp NOI, you're going to have some volatility because of OPI. I think OPI is really simple. $3.5 billion, it's going to make $0.50, $0.60. And it's on our books for a lot less – and again, in terms of investments and monetization and everything else associated with that, we're always going to do the right thing. So that's really it. I think obviously, overage rent has stabilized. So it's a little more conservative. We want to make sure we're conservative as we look at the year. If sales do grow on the back-end weighted that we think will be our overage number, which we mean we'll beat our guidance. But we don't have a crystal ball, but we've been – we've raised our guidance from the beginning of the year. That's the important thing. We've had headwinds with that rising rates went up higher than we thought – is probably the biggest headwind. And then second, the OPI's side has been more back-end weighted than we originally anticipated. And that's simple as that. The other thing to remember is – so ABG just raised money at basically a $20 billion enterprise value because of their growth, we got – we own 12% of the company. We got zero funds from operation contribution from them because of all of their onetime charges. We had the same situation in Penney, and that's why we are giving you this real estate FFO number, put a multiple on it. It's too low. Whatever multiple you think it is, I would add a couple of 100 basis points. It's too low then add $10 a share, and that's our NAV and then enjoy the rest of the summer. That's how I would think about it. Are you still there? Okay. You buy that argument? All right. Thank you for listening. Okay. So I think we're out of questions, and I owe it to Don Wood. Now I want to tell you a story, okay? So we – Don initially stole our 5:00 o'clock time period – so we were not very happy and we said we'll do it together. And then I said, you know what, we're we loved Don, we want to be friendly. So not only did we move our time, but we gave Don the option of whether he wanted to do 4:30 or 5:30 and he chose 5:30. So if you don't like our time or you don't like his time, blame Don, but I'll hand it over to Don. I feel like Ed McMahon and Don is Johnny Carson. Thank you."

First quarter funds from operation were $1.03 billion or $2.74 per share. Let me walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q1 of 2022. Domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.15 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Our international operations also performed well and contributed $0.02 of growth. These positive contributions were partially offset by declines from the headwind from a strong U.S. dollar of $0.02, higher interest rate expense of $0.05, lower lease settlement income of $0.06 compared to Q1 of 2022, and we had a mark-to-market gain on publicly-held securities of $0.06 for the quarter, and a $0.13 lower contribution from our other platform investments compared to Q1 2022. Let me walk you through some of that and remind everyone that for OPI results, we are generally on our plan. Please keep in mind OPI was up against very tough comparisons from last year's Q1. This quarter also includes one-time transaction cost from ABG's recent acquisition activity, JCPenney's deployment of their new beauty initiative, and investments related to physical stores, IT, and one-time reorganization expenses, all flowing through our FFO number. The retailer part of our OPI investments has seasonality associated with it generally with losses in the first quarter and the majority of our profit in the fourth quarter and should be modeled accordingly. Overall, we continued to expect OPI to meet our 2023 guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, which is similar -- which will be a similar FFO contribution that was compared to 2022. Now, domestic property NOI increased 4% year-over-year for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 3.9% for the quarter. Our mills, malls, and outlets occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 94.4%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Mills was 97.3%, and TRG was 93.3%. Importantly, average base minimum rent was $55.84 per square foot, an increase of 3.1% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1,200 leases for more than 5.9 million square feet in the quarter. We have an additional 1,500 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for approximately $570 million in gross occupancy cost. More than 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We're seeing strong broad-based demand from the retail community, including continued strength for many categories. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to be approximately 75% complete with our 2023 expiration. Retail sales momentum continued. Reported retail sales per square foot reached another record in the first quarter at $759 per square foot for malls and premium outlets combined, an increase of 3.3%. All platforms achieved record sales level, including the mills at $683 a foot, a 2.2%, and TRG was $1,100 per square foot, a 6% increase. Good news is, tourism is returning with our tourist-oriented centers outperforming the portfolio average in terms of sales. Our occupancy cost at the end of the first quarter was 12%. We opened our West Paris Designer Outlet in Normandy, France last week, our 35th international outlet center. During the quarter, construction restarted on our upscale outlet center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which will now open in the fall of 2024. We have several densification projects under construction and a pipeline of identified projects that includes approximately 2,000 residential units and hotel rooms. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We completed a dual-tranche U.S. senior notes offering that totaled $1.3 billion at a combined average term of 20 years at an average coupon of 5.67%. We closed on our new $5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with a maturity in 2028. Importantly, the pricing is unchanged from our prior facility. The traditional secured mortgage markets continued to support the refinancing of our assets across geographies and property types. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced our dividend of $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 9%. The dividend is payable on June 30 of this quarter. Guidance for this quarter -- given the results of this quarter and our current view of the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2023 guidance range from $11.70 to $11.95 per share to $11.80 to $11.95 per share compared to last year of $11.87. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the midpoint, excuse me. And I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Tenant demand is excellent, and brick-and-mortar stores are where shoppers want to be. And even with the economic uncertainty, we are running ahead of our internal plan. Excuse me, here. I have some kind of a frog in my throat, but we're ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question, Caitlin.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, good evening, everyone. Maybe regarding upcoming lease maturities and what that means for potential cash flow changes going forward, the ABR for '23 maturities is around $62 versus the portfolio overall at $56. So, would you think it's fair to say that the rest of the '23 maturities may face a headwind on renewal, but then the '24 maturities, which are 12% of rents and have an ABR of $54, have significant opportunity? I'm guessing it's not that straightforward. So, wondering if you could discuss that rent maturity and mark-to-market outlook.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. Thank you, Caitlin, for the question. One of the numbers I threw out there while I was coughing during my presentation was, our renewals and new leases will add $570 million of basically gross rental income. In that is included some renewals, which is the roll-off of the numbers that you quoted. We are renewing above our overall -- above our expiring rents. So, even with that said, we expect to continue to have positive rental spreads even with the higher number for the balance of this year and certainly in '24. So, the outlook on that front is very positive and unchanged since our commentary at the -- certainly at the beginning of this year and fourth quarter of last year as well.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks, good evening, David.\nDavid Simon: How are you, Steve?\nSteve Sakwa: Good. I was wondering if you could just maybe shed a little more light on the leasing demand that you're seeing. Is there anything that you could discuss with us on kind of price point either luxury versus more moderate tenants, anything by region, anything by product type, whether it's the mills, the outlets, or the traditional malls? Just looking for a little color given what we're going through and kind of what your tenants are telling you. Just kind of curious where the strongest demand is and maybe to the extent that there are any weak spots, what would you call out?\nDavid Simon: Well, I mean, I know this is kind of in the face of a lot of economic uncertainty, but demand really has not changed one iota. Now, let's talk about the luxuries side. Clearly, they're running up against tough comps compared to Q1 of last year. But those brands and those companies think long-term. And I mean, the best example is, if we were at the opening of Tiffany store in -- on 57th Street, you have to take a long-term view when you open stores like that. And all of those brands whether LVMH Group, Kering, Richemont, et cetera, they're looking at '23, '24, '25, we're -- making commitments. Nothing there is really abated. So all systems go on that front, even though they are running up against tough comps compared to Q1. You look at the restaurant category, very strong demand, lots of new deals across lots of price points from P.F. Chang's, Cheesecake Factory to some of the chef-driven brands. So, all systems go there. You've got the box demand. Lots of new business with Dick's, Life Time Fitness, the best of the best [shields] (ph). Department store demand by [indiscernible] is happening. Then you look at the athleisure, Vuori, ALO, Lululemon, Brooks Brothers, all of that pretty much across the board, we're seeing new stores. So, I said this at the end of last year, early this year, even with -- even though comps are going to be tougher this year in terms of sales compared to last year, the demand on leasing really has not changed. We're seeing the entertainment concepts come back, theatre business is positive. So, we feel it's -- we're feeling very good. Obviously, we're cautious. We don't expect sales like they were over '21 and '22, and we planned accordingly. But demand, we check every day and there's certainly a couple here or there that slowed down, but nothing really noteworthy. VF, North Face, Timberland, Cotton On, they're all growing and it's all pretty healthy.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question, Ronald.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Thanks. I remember last quarter we talked about domestic property NOI growth of at least 2%. You're thinking about looking at 1Q already at 4%, just maybe can you give us an update how you're thinking about that number for the rest of the year? And looking at the guidance raise, how much is that property -- core property NOI versus maybe other factors? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Sure. Yeah, we're going to be 2%. And I would hope we would do at least 3% plus. I mean, there is some -- it's very interesting, the first six months from the retail point-of-view, comps will be tough. But we think the second half for the retailers will be more positive, lots of economic uncertainty out there with the big macro things. But assuming sales come in the way we initially budgeted, we should be hopefully at least 3%. If we have an uptick in sales, we'll do better.\nRonald Kamdem: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question, Alexander.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thanks, and good evening, David.\nDavid Simon: How are you?\nAlexander Goldfarb: So -- I'm doing well. So, first, thank you for all the detail on the retailer platform and the emphasis on the seasonality, that's helpful. My question is bigger. You guys seem to have a lot of positive trends with the redevelopment program coming back, retailer demand healthy, obviously, some of your competitors are having trouble on the capital side, it strengthens your portfolio. So, my question is, as you look over the next few years to invest incremental capital, is your focus still on the best returns are internal in your existing malls and adding more densification? Or are you starting to see some external opportunities where it may make sense to use capital? And whether that's domestically or abroad? Sort of curious.\nDavid Simon: Yeah, I don't see -- let me do it in pieces with no particular order. I do see -- I still do feel strongly that the best use of our capital is making our existing portfolio better and better. I think that we have spent $8-plus billion over the last several years upgrading the portfolio and doing new development. So, we continue to see that as our best use. I don't see -- and as I mentioned in the call, I mean, we have a residential pipeline that looks really attractive in hotels that are generating really good accretive values of around 2,000 units. Now, that's not going to happen overnight, but that's going to happen over the next few years. So that for us is a real opportunity. I don't see much of our external capital doing any kind of acquisition opportunities internationally. I still think we'll grow our International Asia outlet portfolio with redevelopment and new development over time, essentially, recycling the capital, the cash flow that we have there and accretive new development. And where we -- we're looking at everything domestically here and nothing really has -- I think, I could say this wet our whistle here to make us -- I can say that, right? Okay, so nothing here that would...\nAlexander Goldfarb: You said it.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. I said it, true, good point. Nothing here that would really like we're not jumping up and down to do external transaction. So it's mostly the same stuff that we've been doing and just keep plugging away on that. And look, I do think we have to respect the capital markets. The capital markets are telling all companies to be more prudent, to do more accretive investments, and we are listening very closely to that.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Vince Tibone from Green Street. Please proceed with your question, Vince.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on your comment regarding the 2,000 residential and hotel units in the upcoming pipeline. Just curious how quickly you could start these projects, how much spend this could potentially represent, and this is something that you're going to maybe do through joint ventures or will be wholly-owned on the balance sheet? Kind of any color on some of these points would be helpful.\nDavid Simon: Sure. All right. So, I think we will do selective JVs on certain of the residential development. So, that's -- and it may -- it also may be that we could potentially bring in third-party equity too. So that would -- we'll look at each deal individually, but that's certainly a possibility. And then I think, Vince, essentially, we're looking at to reach all those 2,000 units. It's really probably a five-year build process. We expect to start several this year. But yet, we're, frankly, being a little bit cautious. We're still permitting some things in California and the Northwest. So, we don't -- we're going to just see how the world is, but we don't have to make a decision yet. And I would think, at the end of the day -- rather Brian give you more scientific number, because a lot of these are part of redevelopments too, and so to really isolate the hotel apartment or rental stuff, I'd want to give you a number, but I -- my instinct would be probably about $1.5 billion. But I think Brian can give you more detailed number, but somewhere in that range. And these go from Austin, Texas to Orange County, California to Seattle, some hotels in Florida, some residential in Florida, multifamily. So it's kind of where you'd expect it to be where supply and demand is in our favor. But we're considering building a hotel in Cape Cod, because we think there's a good supply-demand imbalance there. So, it really is across. And every, I'd say generally as we get back real estate through our redevelopment efforts, the big focus is on where we can add some mixed uses, because we do think like what we did in Buckhead is having a tremendous impact on the overall value of that real estate. So, not only does -- is it accretive from a value point of view just on the cost to the return on the build versus what's the value of that is after it's built, but also the residual benefits that we see from them all.\nVince Tibone: Got it. No, that's all super helpful. And then, somewhat related follow-up question. Just curious if you could share any updates on the Carson outlet project, and if you think you'd be moving forward there in the near term?\nDavid Simon: That's a complicated one. We are -- that's a complicated one, but we're -- every day, we make progress. So, it's terrific real estate, very complicated transaction, but we continued to make progress. But no final decision has been made to do it. But I expect one to be made over the next few months.\nVince Tibone: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Mailman from Citi. Please proceed with your question, Craig.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. It's actually Nick Joseph on here with Craig. David, just on executive comp and the $24 million one-time cash bonus related to OPI, I know at least one of the proxy analysis firms has raised some concerns on it. So, I was hoping if you could give some more color on both -- rationale behind it in terms of the amount and the structure of it ahead of the vote later this week?\nDavid Simon: Yeah, look, I think this was essentially paid '23, '24 executives last February, so about 15 months ago, fully disclosed in an 8-K. Our rationale and reasoning by the comp committee was fully disclosed in our filed proxy as well as supplemental lever to our shareholders. I think if you look at the company in totality, which is important -- I mean, we can always take a moment in time to say why this, why that, but if you look at the history of the company, you look at the executive comp, you look at our stock program, you look at our burn rate, you look at our G&A as a function of our NOI or asset value, we are at the lowest of the low. Anybody can pick up one particular number they don't like. But if you look at it in totality, we are absolutely proud of how we run this business. If you want to get more detail, I encourage you to talk to Head of our Comp Committee or Lead Independent Director, any shareholder can do that. But I would encourage everyone to look at the totality of our history and then come to whatever conclusion they think. And we're very happy to talk to anybody that would like to go through it from a shareholder point of view.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Greg McGinnis from Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question, Greg.\nGreg McGinnis: Hey, good evening, David. I just want to make sure that I understand that $570 million gross rental income number that you mentioned. Is that new and renewal leases? Is it on a pro-rata basis inclusive of international and TRG? How much of that, I guess, is incremental to in-place rents? Or is all of it? And then what's the timeframe [indiscernible] contributing?\nDavid Simon: All terrific questions. And we highlighted that just to give you a sense of the scope of the business that's going on here. So that's a huge number. That's just one lease -- one level of activity in a year and it's bigger than some companies that exist today. So, let me try to unpack it. It does include renewals. It's just SPG. It's just domestic. And if you look at the renewals in the new business, there is a really good uptick from kind of the in-place income on that. And that will come in not really this year, but over '24 and '25 as those stores get opened. And I think it just adds a sense of our future growth that we see in front of us from our existing portfolio. But I'm not in a position to break it up between renewals and new incremental business. But you'll see that flow through the NOI in the upcoming quarters.\nGreg McGinnis: Okay. So, it is both though, because you mentioned $100 million of new income last quarter of new NOI.\nDavid Simon: Correct. Yeah, it includes both, correct.\nGreg McGinnis: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question, Derek.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Occupancy is now at 94.4% and that's just 70 bps below pre-pandemic levels. Do you expect to surpass 4Q '19's 95.1% occupancy this year? And given the leasing demand we've discussed, how is the team weighing occupancy versus rates now that the gap is so narrow?\nDavid Simon: Well, let me take that part first. I do think -- the good news is that when we're -- and again every lease is different, every relationship is different, rollovers -- some rollovers go down. But I would say, generally speaking, we are finally seeing renewals that are overall above the expiry rents. So that -- and part of that is just supply-demand is in our favor and we are getting -- because one is, I think, from the retailers' point of view, there is a real appreciation for bricks-and-mortar, one. Two is they know we're a landlord that they can rely on and that we're going to do the right thing to maintain and reinvest in these properties and we have the capability of doing so. And generally, it's more demand that we're seeing, and the retailers are in -- having survived COVID are in better shape and want to grow their business. So that is all happening. And getting into your first point, will we beat it this year? It will be close. I'm not -- I can't guarantee it, but I am hopeful that we will beat that number, in the not -- certainly within the next 12 months, assuming we can continue to maintain reasonably decent economic conditions.\nDerek Johnston: All right. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Floris van Dijkum from Compass Point. Please proceed with your question, Floris.\nFloris van Dijkum: Thanks. Good evening, guys. David, so maybe, if you can give us a little bit more of an update, I know, in the past you've talked about your signed non-open pipeline being around 200 basis points. Your leased occupancy just increased by 110 basis points. Is that SNO pipeline relatively similar? And then maybe, I mean, the -- if I look at the base rent going up by 3.1% approximately and if you get about 10% of your space back, I mean, it assumes pretty healthy re-leasing spreads, if my math is correct. I mean, how should we be thinking? Clearly, it appears that leasing spreads are accelerating in your core business.\nDavid Simon: I think that's a fair statement. And I would say that the pipeline is similar to what it's been. Right, Brian?\nBrian McDade: Yeah. Floris, we're still hanging right around 200 basis points at this point in the year.\nDavid Simon: So, I do think as we've been saying over the last few couple of quarters, I mean, we have finally turned the corner on lease spreads, demand, better properties, more commitments from retailers, more -- and more retailers wanting to open stores, all driving pretty good demand, which allows us to get to spreads that we're accustomed to. But we were flat-lining pre-COVID. Obviously, we got hurt during COVID and we've bounced back nicely. So from that standpoint, it's good to see.\nFloris van Dijkum: And if I can maybe follow up, David, on Jamestown, and you mentioned external capital. How are you thinking about -- how is the Jamestown acquisition embedding in? And is that potentially a source of external capital that you can bring into some of that -- the apartment or hotel investments, and/or how are the synergies between those two businesses working out, in particular, I'm thinking like Atlanta with the street retail right near your two fortress malls?\nDavid Simon: Yeah. Look, to separate, just to be clear. So, we bought into the asset management business and we bought -- we partnered with Jamestown for a couple of -- several reasons, but a couple to highlight here. One is, they're really good asset managers. Two is, they have a development capability that's very interesting to us. And they have excellent institutional relationships. And we think with our partnership, we can grow that business. We did not -- other than -- there is a big future development -- master plan development that they're working on in Charleston where we did partner with them directly. We did not buy any of their existing real estate that's owned by the various funds, whether it's the German funds or the premier fund. Jamestown is in the process of raising their 32nd German fund. They have a lot of separate account interest. It's really good for us, because we get to learn those institutional investors better and more. And I just think we're early days there, but I think the thesis that we had going in, continues to be very, very valid. This is a long-term relationship that I think will grow. Eventually, I see us partnering with institutional money that will be managed by Jamestown that will partner with us to build XYZ or buy XYZ or build a big community in Charleston -- North Charleston. So, yeah, I think all of the elements of potential growth with Jamestown are out there. We do like the asset management business as a platform. We dipped our toe into it. But I think, again, just as we look at the landscape for real estate owners and managers, we think -- when we look at Blackstone, when we looked at our Brookfield, obviously, they own, they asset image for us to have some scale or some role in that business, I think ultimately we will annur to the benefit of the Simon Property Group. And that's what we're after.\nFloris van Dijkum: Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question, Craig.\nCraig Schmidt: Thank you. Given the seasonality of the OPI business, which quarter do you expect that number to turn positive?\nDavid Simon: I think it will be -- no, Craig, you know about retailers. So just to reinforce the retail part of the OPI, remember, the vast majority of the OPI value is in our ABG stock, but we still have a very profitable business with both Penny and SPARC, and then other investments that are in that including RGG and so on. So, just important to put it in context. So the retail part, the pure retailer part, Penny and SPARC, is seasonal. Last quarter, Q1 of '22 was just stimulus whatever was really tough comparison for the retail -- retailer part of OPI. With that said, it will -- we expect it to be profitable in Q2 and Q3. And -- but the vast -- the majority of -- the vast majority of it will be Q4, like all the other retailers. So, when you see retailers report this quarter that are public, I think generally, they'll probably all have tough comps against Q1 of last year. Yes, the comps get a lot easier. This is a lot more information for a business that's -- we have no cash investment remember, and it does create a little volatility of our earnings for better or worse. In this case, this quarter, it's worse, fourth quarter will be much better, does create a little volatility. But it will -- you'll see it map out -- part of that OPI map out just like other retailers where the loss will be in Q1, profitability Q2 and three and then 70% -- 65%, 70% in Q4.\nCraig Schmidt: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question, Juan.\nJuan Sanabria: Hi, good afternoon. Just hoping to get a little color on the month-to-month leases, they ticked up from about 4.5% to 7.5% sequentially in the first quarter while you did a fantastic job chopping wood and reducing the rest of the '23 expiration. But just curious on why the increase in the month-to-month basis and what's going on behind that?\nDavid Simon: Yeah. One of the comments I made was, we expect to be basically 75% by the end of Q2. It's just a process. It's just -- we're negotiating, the retailers are negotiating, the stores are open and operating. But we -- it's just a typical drawn-out process that is the, so to speak, the art of the negotiation, but a lot of that's already handshake committed to that we're just going through and processing now.\nBrian McDade: If you look historically, Juan, it's normal seasonality of that line items at this point time of the year.\nJuan Sanabria: Great, that was my follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Mueller from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question, Mike.\nMike Mueller: Thanks. I was wondering, has there been any notable change in lease duration for what you're signing so far in 2023 compared to last year?\nDavid Simon: Not really. Not at all.\nMike Mueller: Okay. That was it. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Haendel Juste from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel Juste: Hey, good evening. David, I think earlier you mentioned that new leases were 25% deal volume in the first quarter. I guess, I'm curious if that's why CapEx picked up 8% in the quarter. And if this is also a new level -- new versus renewal leasing that you should expect near term? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: We have a tough connection. Did you guys hear that?\nBrian McDade: Haendel, can you repeat your question, please? You kind of broke up a bit there.\nHaendel Juste: Sure. Sorry about that. So my question was on, David, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that new leases were 25% of the deal volume in the first quarter. So I'm curious if that's why CapEx was up I think 8% in the first quarter. And also if this level of new leases, 25% or so would be kind of the right way to think about new versus renewal leasing going forward? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Yeah, I think -- I guess on the TA line, there is some -- we are doing more deals. So there is probably more TA associated with it. So I'm not sure the CapEx line or you are looking at the TA line. But generally, the answer is yes, we're doing a lot more new business and in some cases that does mean a little bit more TA. And I still had a hard time on the last part. Did anybody hear it? No, we didn't hear -- unfortunately, we didn't hear it, but if you want to call back with that, we're happy to answer that.\nOperator: Thank you. Moving on to the next question. The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks, good afternoon. Going back to your comments on international tourism, David, can you remind us where international tourism levels are for your portfolio today versus, let's say, pre-COVID? And if it should return to that normal level, what does that mean for Simon's NOI or earnings, however, you want to look at it?\nDavid Simon: Well. I would say, generally speaking, we -- just to give you a sense, our sales for our tourist properties that we identify was up 8% quarter-over-quarter, right, generally?\nBrian McDade: Yes.\nDavid Simon: So, the bottom line is, it is really going to result in overage rent that we've probably flat-line more or less on those properties. So -- and that will manifest itself once we reach the breakpoint, so later in the year. But we're seeing -- we're starting to see, I mean like Vegas, we have our tourist property in Florida, which has been pretty strong, but we're seeing more and more international tourism there. Woodbury, here in the New York area -- I'd say, here in Indianapolis, but in the New York area, is really starting to see a lot more international tourism. California has been kind of the weak link. But we're starting to see more and more sales there. And then, Vegas is just going crazy. Vegas -- we -- and we have really important exposure in Vegas between Forum and Crystal, our two outlet centers. Vegas is as good as it gets. It's -- the casinos, what's going on with the city, the movement from California to Nevada. All of the football, baseball, sporting activity, Formula One, it just -- it's a great place to have a lot of retail real estate, and we're seeing real benefits in that. So, this will manifest itself in the fourth quarter as we're seeing that, but as we reached the breakpoints, but we're finally seeing the international tourists to come back to the States. Little weaker dollar helps, and obviously all the -- I think, finally, you don't have a vaccine card or whatever is required to come here, all of that kind of yesterday's news, as of today or yesterday. So, we're -- I think we're finally starting to see that come back like it was pre-pandemic.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. And a quick question for Brian. You guys have a pretty healthy cash balance of over $1 billion, yet you still carry a balance in a revolver. I'm sure there is a pretty logical simple answer to this, but just curious.\nBrian McDade: Yeah, that's exactly right, the outstandings on our revolver are denominated in euros and they serve as a net investment hedge against our asset base in Europe. We do have a heavy -- a sizable cash balance as we did our offering earlier in this year and pre-funded the balance of our unsecured maturities for this year. So, we're carrying cash and we'll pay off the June maturities at par at maturity.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nBrian McDade: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please proceed with your question, Michael.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. David, your base minimum rent growth is accelerating. You have a nice SNO pipeline. You're talking about blowing past your 2% NOI growth guidance for the year. All sounds great. I guess the question is, how sustainable is this algorithm? How long can it continue? What are the factors that are ultimately going to weigh on this momentum that you have?\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I mean I think -- I see it continuing. We see good demand. We are tied to the general economic condition, but supply-demand is in our favor. I think our spot in our industry is well established. We have the confidence with our retail partners. We know what we want to do with our properties. We're not -- we don't [indiscernible] 1,000, we make mistakes all the time, but we know where we want to position them. And so, I hate using kind of this, but I -- it's really going to be the external environment that could slow this down, meaning what happens, do we do a recession or that? And I honestly think some of these markets are -- when people ask me that I actually think if we do go into recession, it will be \"kind of regional recession.\" I just don't see markets right now, they may flatten, they may not grow as much, but I don't see Florida's, Texas, Nevada's of the world, Georgia's, I just don't see them slowing. I don't see them going into a recession. So if there is one, we've always heard, well, it's going to be a regional one, this one might be one. But who -- I really don't know, but I think that's what slows us down. Obviously, we do have some headwinds with higher interest rates. We do have debt maturity at low rates, but rollover will cost us some growth. But we just have to kind of go through that and deal with it.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question, Linda.\nLinda Tsai: Hi. How do you think about the longer-term growth profile of the OPI business versus growth in overall portfolio NOI? Do you think the OPI business requires more consistent investment before it generates more stable returns?\nDavid Simon: Well. I think you have to look at it, the individual investments. And like for instance Authentic Brands Group is a growth machine. They're buying brands left and right. They're buying Billabong. They are buying Vince. They've got a huge pipeline. So, I've really seen that company growing, growing, growing. SPARC and Penny are -- SPARC is opening new stores, getting better at ecommerce, getting better operating. I'm sure -- they added Reebok to its portfolio last year, that still hasn't been fully integrated. So, I expect EBITDA growth to accelerate in the later half of '23 and '24. RGG, which includes Rue La La and Gilt, and importantly, Shop Premium Outlets. Remember we contributed that to that joint venture. Shop Premium Outlet is on fire. We're growing our GMV by leaps and bounds. I really think this was an idea we had years ago. We kind of got it off the ground, maybe not quite as good as [indiscernible] but we got it off the ground. We merged it in the RGG. And it's really rocking and rolling. We've got -- we're signing up good retailers all the time. That's got a great story to it. And we have some smaller investments in that. So, I think I see a real growth pattern in all of those. Penny is reinvesting. I think Penny has found its mojo. It's getting better brands in the store. We're making the stores look better. It's got growth in beauty that's investing. So the retailer side of OPI has a little more exposure in the economy because retail just does. But I think they all in their own way, have their own growth story. And -- but you know what, we're economic animals to extent that we get fair value. We've got lots of opportunities to invest in our company or other transactions that will add value. So, we look at these very clinical. And I just remember we've created a lot of value here with very little capital. And what's amazing, it's in our earnings now and which is a good sign because it means it's earning money. And given the small investment, it's been -- if you just want to look on return on our earnings and return on investment, it's been outstanding. So, very proud of it, very profitable. Not our core focus yet, while -- I used the executive team here to leverage our capabilities, intellectual firepower, et cetera, to make those companies better and I think we've done a pretty darn good job. We've had good partners across the board. So we've done it in a very prudent way and it's been very beneficial for us and I expect growth to continue. We'll have more ups and downs, it won't be a straight line, but I have -- I expect more growth from that category, same time 10 years from now or five years from now, we don't have to own any of these companies.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up. Do you have a sense of how much mixed-use development could become as a percentage of portfolio NOI? And could you give us a sense of what that might represent today?\nDavid Simon: It's not very big today, what is it like 3%, 4%?\nBrian McDade: Yes, about 3%.\nDavid Simon: 3%. So, we're a big company. So to do a lot, to get to, like 8% to 10%, we take a lot, would be a few years down the road, but I don't see any reason why -- we certainly should try to strive to get up there if we can do it accretively in this kind of the 7% to 8% range, but that would be roughly $500-plus million of NOIs. So it's not -- it's going to take time.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question -- the final question comes from Haendel Juste from Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel Juste: Hey, there, thanks for letting me back in. I wanted to get to the second part of my question, and then I have one more. So the second part of my earlier question was, if you are expecting new lease volume to be about 25% of the overall leasing volume as it were in the first quarter over the near term?\nDavid Simon: Yeah. I think that's a reasonable number, yes, in that range.\nHaendel Juste: Okay. And then the second question I have was on foot traffic. We saw some recent placer foot traffic data for March, indicating that year-over-year foot traffic at enclosed retail malls is down 8% year-over-year in March. I'm curious if you're seeing similar trends at your properties? And if you think that's a reflection of the consumer and that's coming up in lease negotiations in the current environment? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Well. Yeah, that's -- I'm glad you asked that because I have -- we keep track of that ourselves. And just to give you March over March -- '23 over March '22, we are 105.5% for malls, 105.6% for mills and 120.2% for outlets for 108% above last year this time. In January and February, we were actually much higher month-over-month. So, we -- for our portfolio, we're above -- traffic is above where it was this time last year, year-to-date, month-on-month.\nHaendel Juste: Okay, thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nBrian McDade: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to David Simon for closing remarks. Thank you, sir.\nDavid Simon: Okay, thank you and I appreciate the questions, and we'll talk soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you very much for your participation.",

If you look historically, Juan, it's normal seasonality of that line items at this point time of the year. Haendel, can you repeat your question, please? You kind of broke up a bit there. Yes. Yeah, that's exactly right, the outstandings on our revolver are denominated in euros and they serve as a net investment hedge against our asset base in Europe. We do have a heavy -- a sizable cash balance as we did our offering earlier in this year and pre-funded the balance of our unsecured maturities for this year. So, we're carrying cash and we'll pay off the June maturities at par at maturity. Sure. Yes, about 3%. Thank you."

            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon. And I'm pleased to report our first quarter results. We are off to a good start with results that exceeded our plan. First quarter funds from operation were $1.03 billion or $2.74 per share. Let me walk through some variances for this quarter compared to Q1 of 2022. Domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.15 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income. Our international operations also performed well and contributed $0.02 of growth. These positive contributions were partially offset by declines from the headwind from a strong U.S. dollar of $0.02, higher interest rate expense of $0.05, lower lease settlement income of $0.06 compared to Q1 of 2022, and we had a mark-to-market gain on publicly-held securities of $0.06 for the quarter, and a $0.13 lower contribution from our other platform investments compared to Q1 2022. Let me walk you through some of that and remind everyone that for OPI results, we are generally on our plan. Please keep in mind OPI was up against very tough comparisons from last year's Q1. This quarter also includes one-time transaction cost from ABG's recent acquisition activity, JCPenney's deployment of their new beauty initiative, and investments related to physical stores, IT, and one-time reorganization expenses, all flowing through our FFO number. The retailer part of our OPI investments has seasonality associated with it generally with losses in the first quarter and the majority of our profit in the fourth quarter and should be modeled accordingly. Overall, we continued to expect OPI to meet our 2023 guidance we provided at the beginning of the year, which is similar -- which will be a similar FFO contribution that was compared to 2022. Now, domestic property NOI increased 4% year-over-year for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 3.9% for the quarter. Our mills, malls, and outlets occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 94.4%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Mills was 97.3%, and TRG was 93.3%. Importantly, average base minimum rent was $55.84 per square foot, an increase of 3.1% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1,200 leases for more than 5.9 million square feet in the quarter. We have an additional 1,500 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for approximately $570 million in gross occupancy cost. More than 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We're seeing strong broad-based demand from the retail community, including continued strength for many categories. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to be approximately 75% complete with our 2023 expiration. Retail sales momentum continued. Reported retail sales per square foot reached another record in the first quarter at $759 per square foot for malls and premium outlets combined, an increase of 3.3%. All platforms achieved record sales level, including the mills at $683 a foot, a 2.2%, and TRG was $1,100 per square foot, a 6% increase. Good news is, tourism is returning with our tourist-oriented centers outperforming the portfolio average in terms of sales. Our occupancy cost at the end of the first quarter was 12%. We opened our West Paris Designer Outlet in Normandy, France last week, our 35th international outlet center. During the quarter, construction restarted on our upscale outlet center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which will now open in the fall of 2024. We have several densification projects under construction and a pipeline of identified projects that includes approximately 2,000 residential units and hotel rooms. Now, turning to the balance sheet. We completed a dual-tranche U.S. senior notes offering that totaled $1.3 billion at a combined average term of 20 years at an average coupon of 5.67%. We closed on our new $5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with a maturity in 2028. Importantly, the pricing is unchanged from our prior facility. The traditional secured mortgage markets continued to support the refinancing of our assets across geographies and property types. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced our dividend of $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 9%. The dividend is payable on June 30 of this quarter. Guidance for this quarter -- given the results of this quarter and our current view of the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2023 guidance range from $11.70 to $11.95 per share to $11.80 to $11.95 per share compared to last year of $11.87. This is an increase of $0.10 at the bottom end of the range and $0.05 at the midpoint, excuse me. And I'm pleased with our first quarter results. Tenant demand is excellent, and brick-and-mortar stores are where shoppers want to be. And even with the economic uncertainty, we are running ahead of our internal plan. Excuse me, here. I have some kind of a frog in my throat, but we're ready for questions. Yeah. Thank you, Caitlin, for the question. One of the numbers I threw out there while I was coughing during my presentation was, our renewals and new leases will add $570 million of basically gross rental income. In that is included some renewals, which is the roll-off of the numbers that you quoted. We are renewing above our overall -- above our expiring rents. So, even with that said, we expect to continue to have positive rental spreads even with the higher number for the balance of this year and certainly in '24. So, the outlook on that front is very positive and unchanged since our commentary at the -- certainly at the beginning of this year and fourth quarter of last year as well. How are you, Steve? Well, I mean, I know this is kind of in the face of a lot of economic uncertainty, but demand really has not changed one iota. Now, let's talk about the luxuries side. Clearly, they're running up against tough comps compared to Q1 of last year. But those brands and those companies think long-term. And I mean, the best example is, if we were at the opening of Tiffany store in -- on 57th Street, you have to take a long-term view when you open stores like that. And all of those brands whether LVMH Group, Kering, Richemont, et cetera, they're looking at '23, '24, '25, we're -- making commitments. Nothing there is really abated. So all systems go on that front, even though they are running up against tough comps compared to Q1. You look at the restaurant category, very strong demand, lots of new deals across lots of price points from P.F. Chang's, Cheesecake Factory to some of the chef-driven brands. So, all systems go there. You've got the box demand. Lots of new business with Dick's, Life Time Fitness, the best of the best [shields] (ph). Department store demand by [indiscernible] is happening. Then you look at the athleisure, Vuori, ALO, Lululemon, Brooks Brothers, all of that pretty much across the board, we're seeing new stores. So, I said this at the end of last year, early this year, even with -- even though comps are going to be tougher this year in terms of sales compared to last year, the demand on leasing really has not changed. We're seeing the entertainment concepts come back, theatre business is positive. So, we feel it's -- we're feeling very good. Obviously, we're cautious. We don't expect sales like they were over '21 and '22, and we planned accordingly. But demand, we check every day and there's certainly a couple here or there that slowed down, but nothing really noteworthy. VF, North Face, Timberland, Cotton On, they're all growing and it's all pretty healthy. Thank you. Sure. Yeah, we're going to be 2%. And I would hope we would do at least 3% plus. I mean, there is some -- it's very interesting, the first six months from the retail point-of-view, comps will be tough. But we think the second half for the retailers will be more positive, lots of economic uncertainty out there with the big macro things. But assuming sales come in the way we initially budgeted, we should be hopefully at least 3%. If we have an uptick in sales, we'll do better. Thank you. How are you? Yeah, I don't see -- let me do it in pieces with no particular order. I do see -- I still do feel strongly that the best use of our capital is making our existing portfolio better and better. I think that we have spent $8-plus billion over the last several years upgrading the portfolio and doing new development. So, we continue to see that as our best use. I don't see -- and as I mentioned in the call, I mean, we have a residential pipeline that looks really attractive in hotels that are generating really good accretive values of around 2,000 units. Now, that's not going to happen overnight, but that's going to happen over the next few years. So that for us is a real opportunity. I don't see much of our external capital doing any kind of acquisition opportunities internationally. I still think we'll grow our International Asia outlet portfolio with redevelopment and new development over time, essentially, recycling the capital, the cash flow that we have there and accretive new development. And where we -- we're looking at everything domestically here and nothing really has -- I think, I could say this wet our whistle here to make us -- I can say that, right? Okay, so nothing here that would... Yeah. I said it, true, good point. Nothing here that would really like we're not jumping up and down to do external transaction. So it's mostly the same stuff that we've been doing and just keep plugging away on that. And look, I do think we have to respect the capital markets. The capital markets are telling all companies to be more prudent, to do more accretive investments, and we are listening very closely to that. Thank you. Sure. All right. So, I think we will do selective JVs on certain of the residential development. So, that's -- and it may -- it also may be that we could potentially bring in third-party equity too. So that would -- we'll look at each deal individually, but that's certainly a possibility. And then I think, Vince, essentially, we're looking at to reach all those 2,000 units. It's really probably a five-year build process. We expect to start several this year. But yet, we're, frankly, being a little bit cautious. We're still permitting some things in California and the Northwest. So, we don't -- we're going to just see how the world is, but we don't have to make a decision yet. And I would think, at the end of the day -- rather Brian give you more scientific number, because a lot of these are part of redevelopments too, and so to really isolate the hotel apartment or rental stuff, I'd want to give you a number, but I -- my instinct would be probably about $1.5 billion. But I think Brian can give you more detailed number, but somewhere in that range. And these go from Austin, Texas to Orange County, California to Seattle, some hotels in Florida, some residential in Florida, multifamily. So it's kind of where you'd expect it to be where supply and demand is in our favor. But we're considering building a hotel in Cape Cod, because we think there's a good supply-demand imbalance there. So, it really is across. And every, I'd say generally as we get back real estate through our redevelopment efforts, the big focus is on where we can add some mixed uses, because we do think like what we did in Buckhead is having a tremendous impact on the overall value of that real estate. So, not only does -- is it accretive from a value point of view just on the cost to the return on the build versus what's the value of that is after it's built, but also the residual benefits that we see from them all. That's a complicated one. We are -- that's a complicated one, but we're -- every day, we make progress. So, it's terrific real estate, very complicated transaction, but we continued to make progress. But no final decision has been made to do it. But I expect one to be made over the next few months. Thank you. Yeah, look, I think this was essentially paid '23, '24 executives last February, so about 15 months ago, fully disclosed in an 8-K. Our rationale and reasoning by the comp committee was fully disclosed in our filed proxy as well as supplemental lever to our shareholders. I think if you look at the company in totality, which is important -- I mean, we can always take a moment in time to say why this, why that, but if you look at the history of the company, you look at the executive comp, you look at our stock program, you look at our burn rate, you look at our G&A as a function of our NOI or asset value, we are at the lowest of the low. Anybody can pick up one particular number they don't like. But if you look at it in totality, we are absolutely proud of how we run this business. If you want to get more detail, I encourage you to talk to Head of our Comp Committee or Lead Independent Director, any shareholder can do that. But I would encourage everyone to look at the totality of our history and then come to whatever conclusion they think. And we're very happy to talk to anybody that would like to go through it from a shareholder point of view. Thank you. All terrific questions. And we highlighted that just to give you a sense of the scope of the business that's going on here. So that's a huge number. That's just one lease -- one level of activity in a year and it's bigger than some companies that exist today. So, let me try to unpack it. It does include renewals. It's just SPG. It's just domestic. And if you look at the renewals in the new business, there is a really good uptick from kind of the in-place income on that. And that will come in not really this year, but over '24 and '25 as those stores get opened. And I think it just adds a sense of our future growth that we see in front of us from our existing portfolio. But I'm not in a position to break it up between renewals and new incremental business. But you'll see that flow through the NOI in the upcoming quarters. Correct. Yeah, it includes both, correct. Thank you. Well, let me take that part first. I do think -- the good news is that when we're -- and again every lease is different, every relationship is different, rollovers -- some rollovers go down. But I would say, generally speaking, we are finally seeing renewals that are overall above the expiry rents. So that -- and part of that is just supply-demand is in our favor and we are getting -- because one is, I think, from the retailers' point of view, there is a real appreciation for bricks-and-mortar, one. Two is they know we're a landlord that they can rely on and that we're going to do the right thing to maintain and reinvest in these properties and we have the capability of doing so. And generally, it's more demand that we're seeing, and the retailers are in -- having survived COVID are in better shape and want to grow their business. So that is all happening. And getting into your first point, will we beat it this year? It will be close. I'm not -- I can't guarantee it, but I am hopeful that we will beat that number, in the not -- certainly within the next 12 months, assuming we can continue to maintain reasonably decent economic conditions. Thank you. I think that's a fair statement. And I would say that the pipeline is similar to what it's been. Right, Brian? So, I do think as we've been saying over the last few couple of quarters, I mean, we have finally turned the corner on lease spreads, demand, better properties, more commitments from retailers, more -- and more retailers wanting to open stores, all driving pretty good demand, which allows us to get to spreads that we're accustomed to. But we were flat-lining pre-COVID. Obviously, we got hurt during COVID and we've bounced back nicely. So from that standpoint, it's good to see. Yeah. Look, to separate, just to be clear. So, we bought into the asset management business and we bought -- we partnered with Jamestown for a couple of -- several reasons, but a couple to highlight here. One is, they're really good asset managers. Two is, they have a development capability that's very interesting to us. And they have excellent institutional relationships. And we think with our partnership, we can grow that business. We did not -- other than -- there is a big future development -- master plan development that they're working on in Charleston where we did partner with them directly. We did not buy any of their existing real estate that's owned by the various funds, whether it's the German funds or the premier fund. Jamestown is in the process of raising their 32nd German fund. They have a lot of separate account interest. It's really good for us, because we get to learn those institutional investors better and more. And I just think we're early days there, but I think the thesis that we had going in, continues to be very, very valid. This is a long-term relationship that I think will grow. Eventually, I see us partnering with institutional money that will be managed by Jamestown that will partner with us to build XYZ or buy XYZ or build a big community in Charleston -- North Charleston. So, yeah, I think all of the elements of potential growth with Jamestown are out there. We do like the asset management business as a platform. We dipped our toe into it. But I think, again, just as we look at the landscape for real estate owners and managers, we think -- when we look at Blackstone, when we looked at our Brookfield, obviously, they own, they asset image for us to have some scale or some role in that business, I think ultimately we will annur to the benefit of the Simon Property Group. And that's what we're after. Thank you. I think it will be -- no, Craig, you know about retailers. So just to reinforce the retail part of the OPI, remember, the vast majority of the OPI value is in our ABG stock, but we still have a very profitable business with both Penny and SPARC, and then other investments that are in that including RGG and so on. So, just important to put it in context. So the retail part, the pure retailer part, Penny and SPARC, is seasonal. Last quarter, Q1 of '22 was just stimulus whatever was really tough comparison for the retail -- retailer part of OPI. With that said, it will -- we expect it to be profitable in Q2 and Q3. And -- but the vast -- the majority of -- the vast majority of it will be Q4, like all the other retailers. So, when you see retailers report this quarter that are public, I think generally, they'll probably all have tough comps against Q1 of last year. Yes, the comps get a lot easier. This is a lot more information for a business that's -- we have no cash investment remember, and it does create a little volatility of our earnings for better or worse. In this case, this quarter, it's worse, fourth quarter will be much better, does create a little volatility. But it will -- you'll see it map out -- part of that OPI map out just like other retailers where the loss will be in Q1, profitability Q2 and three and then 70% -- 65%, 70% in Q4. Thank you. Yeah. One of the comments I made was, we expect to be basically 75% by the end of Q2. It's just a process. It's just -- we're negotiating, the retailers are negotiating, the stores are open and operating. But we -- it's just a typical drawn-out process that is the, so to speak, the art of the negotiation, but a lot of that's already handshake committed to that we're just going through and processing now. Not really. Not at all. Thank you. We have a tough connection. Did you guys hear that? Yeah, I think -- I guess on the TA line, there is some -- we are doing more deals. So there is probably more TA associated with it. So I'm not sure the CapEx line or you are looking at the TA line. But generally, the answer is yes, we're doing a lot more new business and in some cases that does mean a little bit more TA. And I still had a hard time on the last part. Did anybody hear it? No, we didn't hear -- unfortunately, we didn't hear it, but if you want to call back with that, we're happy to answer that. Well. I would say, generally speaking, we -- just to give you a sense, our sales for our tourist properties that we identify was up 8% quarter-over-quarter, right, generally? So, the bottom line is, it is really going to result in overage rent that we've probably flat-line more or less on those properties. So -- and that will manifest itself once we reach the breakpoint, so later in the year. But we're seeing -- we're starting to see, I mean like Vegas, we have our tourist property in Florida, which has been pretty strong, but we're seeing more and more international tourism there. Woodbury, here in the New York area -- I'd say, here in Indianapolis, but in the New York area, is really starting to see a lot more international tourism. California has been kind of the weak link. But we're starting to see more and more sales there. And then, Vegas is just going crazy. Vegas -- we -- and we have really important exposure in Vegas between Forum and Crystal, our two outlet centers. Vegas is as good as it gets. It's -- the casinos, what's going on with the city, the movement from California to Nevada. All of the football, baseball, sporting activity, Formula One, it just -- it's a great place to have a lot of retail real estate, and we're seeing real benefits in that. So, this will manifest itself in the fourth quarter as we're seeing that, but as we reached the breakpoints, but we're finally seeing the international tourists to come back to the States. Little weaker dollar helps, and obviously all the -- I think, finally, you don't have a vaccine card or whatever is required to come here, all of that kind of yesterday's news, as of today or yesterday. So, we're -- I think we're finally starting to see that come back like it was pre-pandemic. Well, look, I mean I think -- I see it continuing. We see good demand. We are tied to the general economic condition, but supply-demand is in our favor. I think our spot in our industry is well established. We have the confidence with our retail partners. We know what we want to do with our properties. We're not -- we don't [indiscernible] 1,000, we make mistakes all the time, but we know where we want to position them. And so, I hate using kind of this, but I -- it's really going to be the external environment that could slow this down, meaning what happens, do we do a recession or that? And I honestly think some of these markets are -- when people ask me that I actually think if we do go into recession, it will be \"kind of regional recession.\" I just don't see markets right now, they may flatten, they may not grow as much, but I don't see Florida's, Texas, Nevada's of the world, Georgia's, I just don't see them slowing. I don't see them going into a recession. So if there is one, we've always heard, well, it's going to be a regional one, this one might be one. But who -- I really don't know, but I think that's what slows us down. Obviously, we do have some headwinds with higher interest rates. We do have debt maturity at low rates, but rollover will cost us some growth. But we just have to kind of go through that and deal with it. Thank you. Well. I think you have to look at it, the individual investments. And like for instance Authentic Brands Group is a growth machine. They're buying brands left and right. They're buying Billabong. They are buying Vince. They've got a huge pipeline. So, I've really seen that company growing, growing, growing. SPARC and Penny are -- SPARC is opening new stores, getting better at ecommerce, getting better operating. I'm sure -- they added Reebok to its portfolio last year, that still hasn't been fully integrated. So, I expect EBITDA growth to accelerate in the later half of '23 and '24. RGG, which includes Rue La La and Gilt, and importantly, Shop Premium Outlets. Remember we contributed that to that joint venture. Shop Premium Outlet is on fire. We're growing our GMV by leaps and bounds. I really think this was an idea we had years ago. We kind of got it off the ground, maybe not quite as good as [indiscernible] but we got it off the ground. We merged it in the RGG. And it's really rocking and rolling. We've got -- we're signing up good retailers all the time. That's got a great story to it. And we have some smaller investments in that. So, I think I see a real growth pattern in all of those. Penny is reinvesting. I think Penny has found its mojo. It's getting better brands in the store. We're making the stores look better. It's got growth in beauty that's investing. So the retailer side of OPI has a little more exposure in the economy because retail just does. But I think they all in their own way, have their own growth story. And -- but you know what, we're economic animals to extent that we get fair value. We've got lots of opportunities to invest in our company or other transactions that will add value. So, we look at these very clinical. And I just remember we've created a lot of value here with very little capital. And what's amazing, it's in our earnings now and which is a good sign because it means it's earning money. And given the small investment, it's been -- if you just want to look on return on our earnings and return on investment, it's been outstanding. So, very proud of it, very profitable. Not our core focus yet, while -- I used the executive team here to leverage our capabilities, intellectual firepower, et cetera, to make those companies better and I think we've done a pretty darn good job. We've had good partners across the board. So we've done it in a very prudent way and it's been very beneficial for us and I expect growth to continue. We'll have more ups and downs, it won't be a straight line, but I have -- I expect more growth from that category, same time 10 years from now or five years from now, we don't have to own any of these companies. It's not very big today, what is it like 3%, 4%? 3%. So, we're a big company. So to do a lot, to get to, like 8% to 10%, we take a lot, would be a few years down the road, but I don't see any reason why -- we certainly should try to strive to get up there if we can do it accretively in this kind of the 7% to 8% range, but that would be roughly $500-plus million of NOIs. So it's not -- it's going to take time. Thank you. Yeah. I think that's a reasonable number, yes, in that range. Well. Yeah, that's -- I'm glad you asked that because I have -- we keep track of that ourselves. And just to give you March over March -- '23 over March '22, we are 105.5% for malls, 105.6% for mills and 120.2% for outlets for 108% above last year this time. In January and February, we were actually much higher month-over-month. So, we -- for our portfolio, we're above -- traffic is above where it was this time last year, year-to-date, month-on-month. Thank you. Okay, thank you and I appreciate the questions, and we'll talk soon. Thank you."

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I am pleased to introduce David Simon.\nDavid Simon: Good morning, everybody. And I’m pleased with our financial and operational performance in the third quarter. We saw increased leasing volumes, occupancy gains and total retail sales volumes. Demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is strong and steady and we continue to strengthen our unique retail real estate platform through our growing development and redevelopment pipeline. This, combined with our A-rated balance sheet, really sets us apart and allows us to focus on the future. We raised our dividend again to $2.10. We’re now at our historical high, overcoming the arbitrary capricious closing of our real estate during COVID. We have a low payout ratio. I’m going to now turn it over to Brian, who will cover our third quarter results and full year guidance in more detail, Brian.\nBrian McDade: Thank you, David, and good morning. Real estate FFO was $3.05 per share in the third quarter, compared to $2.91 in the prior year, a 4.8% growth rate. Domestic and International operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.15 of growth, driven by a 3% increase in lease income. Third quarter funds from operation were $1.07 billion or $2.84 per share, as compared to $1.2 billion or $3.20 per share last year. Third quarter results include $0.13 per share of non-cash net loss and fair value adjustments from the mark to market on the Klépierre exchangeable bonds we issued in November of 2023, which mature in November of 2026. The non-cash loss on derivative is due to the outperformance of Klépierre’s stock price, which increased 18% during the third quarter. As a result of the stock appreciation, the market value of our Klépierre investment increased by approximately $400 million during the third quarter. OPI was an eight cent loss in the quarter due to reduced discretionary spending by the lower income consumer at two SPARC brands and also from the loss of income from ABG in the prior year due to the sale of our interest earlier this year. As a reminder, the prior year results include $0.32 per share in non-cash gains from the partial sale of our ownership in SPARC in the third quarter of 2023. Domestic NOI increased 5.4% year-over-year for the quarter due to continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered the results exceeding our plan for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our International properties at constant currency grew 5% for the quarter. Malls and Outlet occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 96.2%, an increase of 1% compared to the prior year. The Mills occupancy was 98.6% at the end of the quarter. Average base minimum rent for the Malls and Outlets increased 2.3% year-over-year and The Mills increased 4.5% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed approximately 1,200 leases for 4 million square feet in the quarter. Through the first nine months of 2024, we have signed more than 3,900 leases for 15 million square feet, which is expected to generate more than $1 billion of revenue. We have an additional 1,800 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for more than $600 million of revenue. We continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community, including continued strength for many categories. Reported retailer sales per square foot was $737 for the Mall and Premium Outlets combined, and was up approximately 1% year-over-year, excluding two retailers. Importantly, total sales volumes, excluding those same two retailers, were up approximately 1.5% year-over-year. The end of the quarter, our occupancy cost was 12.8%. Turning to new development and redevelopment, we opened Tulsa Premium Outlets on August 15th at 100% lease and we also opened a significant expansion at Busan Premium Outlets in South Korea in September. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across all platforms in the U.S. and Internationally, with our share of net cost of $1.3 billion at a blended yield of 8%. Turning to other platform investments, our OPI results for the third quarter at SPARC underperformed as the lower-income consumer continues to be more cautious in their spending. We first highlighted the inflationary impact in the second half of 2022 relative to this consumer. Performance was below expectations at Forever 21 and Reebok. SPARC and J.C. Penney did, however, record sequential improvements in comp sales during the third quarter, which sets these brands up well for the important upcoming holiday season. We are not sitting still and we expect to have some positive announcements by year end with respect to these businesses. Turning to our balance sheet, during the quarter, we amended and extended our $3.5 billion supplemental revolving credit facility for three years on existing terms. We also issued $1 billion in senior notes with a term of 10 years and a 4.75% interest rate. This was clearly good timing on our part. During the first nine months of the year, we completed refinancings of 14 property mortgages for a total of approximately $1.3 billion at an average rate of 6.13%. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.1 billion of liquidity and at the end of the quarter on October -- subsequent to the end of the quarter on October 1st, we repaid our last remaining unsecured maturity for 2024 of $900 million. We constantly innovate in both our physical and digital worlds to create world-class convenience for our shoppers and drive incremental sales for our brand partners. In continuing this effort and building upon the success of Shop Premium Outlets, we rebranded our digital marketplace ShopSimon to take advantage of all of our assets, including shopper email lists totaling over 25 million customers. The expanded and rebranded digital marketplace adds on-sale and discounted merchandise while continuing to offer Outlet products from leading brands. This is the next phase in our journey to create the ultimate omnichannel experience. We also launched a new nationwide marketing campaign, Meet Me @themall. The campaign celebrates the shopping mall’s continued cachet as the go-to destination for all generations. Turning to our dividend, today we announced our dividend of $2.10 per share for the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 10.5%. The dividend is payable on December 30th. This is the fourth consecutive quarter we have increased our dividend and the dividend is now back to our pre-pandemic record high. Finally, turning to guidance, we are affirming our guidance range of $12.80 per share to $12.90 per share, which excludes $0.14 per share year-to-date impact of the non-cash loss and steer value adjustments from the mark-to-market on the Klépierre exchangeable bond, which prior to the third quarter was only a $0.01 net non-cash loss, but is now $0.14 and needed to be highlighted. With that, thank you for your time today. David and I are now available for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, David and Brian. It sounds like you’ve got great momentum on the leasing front and with the portfolio north of 96%. I’m just curious how you guys are attacking the lease expiration schedule over the next couple of years and whether you feel like pricing power is moving materially in your favor, just given the interplay with sales being a little bit flat, but obviously there being strong demand for high-quality retail space?\nDavid Simon: Yeah. Steve, I’ll answer that simplistically, I guess. I would say that our job is to continue to improve the merchandise mix at our real estate and so it’s more than -- it’s a lot more than just what rent you can charge. It’s really what is the right retailer, tenant, et cetera. What’s the right mix for that property? And we take more of a holistic approach to how we re-merchandise centers. We’re still undergoing significant re-merchandising across the portfolio, because we’re seeing better retailers. When I say retailers, it could be restaurants, et cetera. I’m using that as a generic term. We’re seeing a lot more interesting and better retailers that are interested in our portfolio. So we need to take advantage of that and that’s the focus. So obviously, supply and demand. I mean, construction costs are up 60% from pre-pandemic numbers. I mean, a pretty staggering number. We’re basically one of the few that can build and overcome that. So there is no real new supply and that does put us in a positive light. But our job is to make the properties better and not just focus on the highest rent per square foot we can get. So, with that, we have a balanced approach. Obviously, we think we still have growth as leases expire or we bring in new tenants. But I don’t -- I really don’t like the term pricing power. I really don’t like the focus on that. Just how do you continue to make the portfolio better is really the number one focus for our team. We just literally had a three-day marathon session. We go property-by-property with our leasing folks. We did the Malls this week. We’ll do the Outlets and Mills next week. And if you participated in it, I think I offered somebody one time down the road to who was it? Alex, probably? Yeah, Alex is the only guy that would want to sit through it. But if you sat through it, the primary focus is how do we make the property better? We still have work to do there. But I think at the end of the day, when you do that, you’ll get the property growth that we’re all looking for. So I would characterize it that way, Steve. The good news is supply and demand is in our favor. We have the capital to invest in our portfolio to make it better, overcome the unbelievable rise in construction costs when you think about it and that’s the focus.\nSteve Sakwa: All right. Well, I’m free next week if you want me to sit in on the meeting. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: You’re more than welcome. You get to choose Outlets or mills, right? Let Tom know, okay?\nSteve Sakwa: All right. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nBrian McDade: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi. Good morning, everyone. David, you mentioned a growing development and redevelopment pipeline. I was wondering if you can go through how deep this opportunity is for Simon’s portfolio now, considering all that you’ve already done. To what extent is there still potential for anchor replacement or other retail redevelopments and then also the larger mixed-use projects?\nDavid Simon: Yeah. I think that continues, Caitlin, to be a huge focus for us. So I would -- our pipeline is probably around $4 billion right now. That doesn’t mean we’re going to do all of it. But we have massive mixed-use opportunities ahead of us and we still don’t have all the anchors redevelop the way we want to. So we have opportunities at like a Barton Creek or down the line, if you looked at some of the Sears. Fashion Valley is a great opportunity where we’re going to get the J.C. Penney space back and probably do about a $500 million redevelopment between retail and mixed-use. Our residential pipeline, as an example of that, is over a $1 billion today. And without including kind of the Fashion Valleys or the Barton Creeks of the world that we think could do residential. We continue to see an interesting relationship between residential development adjacent or part of or existing retail format. They actually go hand in glove. It’s very encouraging to see. I think if you listen to Don Wood, he’ll tell you the same thing. So that is exciting. We’re going full steam ahead. As you know, that supply, it’s probably, in certain markets been oversupplied, but the reality is nobody building now. And if you think how we’re looking at it, it’s going to take two years to three years to four years, and as we bring these on, there’ll be no new supply. And I think that’ll put us in a in an advantageous situation. So long story short, say $4 billion and roughly a third of that is probably resi.\nBrian McDade: Let’s throw one off.\nDavid Simon: Let’s throw one off. But some office, like for instance, we’re -- we just approved a deal and I don’t think it’s in our, in our 8-K, but we just approved a deal at Clearfork, which is in Fort Worth, kind of a newer center and we just approved a deal with our partner to build an office and retail on the ground floor. The office is going to be, I don’t know if I can say it, but basically, we don’t -- it’s not big -- it’s -- I don’t know, 50,000 square feet and Wells is going to take the majority of it. And so we’ll still do smatterings of those kind of projects as we go forward. But building a big spec office out of our pipeline.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. And just to confirm, I know in there, you were talking about retail office, well, not so much office and the multifamily, you mentioned at one point in there over building that was on the residential side, correct?\nBrian McDade: Correct.\nDavid Simon: Correct. Yeah. Correct.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeffrey Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. Thank you. Maybe just following up on the first question topic, David, your comments on merchandising mix, maybe something else that is sometimes overlooked. I know you guys talked about your -- the omnichannel experience and what you’re doing there, Meet Me @themall. Can you expand a little bit on some of the key initiatives that the company is doing to, again, engage customers, bring them to the centers, and how this may evolve over the next few years? I know, of course, this holiday season, you have some great programs? Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure. Sure. So, I would say, Jeff that, the Mall continues to be a unique gathering place. And we get -- I think we all get too focused on whether it’s enclosed or has a roof on it. I mean, it really -- to me it really doesn’t matter. It’s kind of what is the best retail project in that training area. And we believe that, and if you talk to, really new and exciting companies like Ascian or other, SKIMS or kind of the new wave of retailers/marketplaces. They all believe in our product. And so -- and we’re seeing a rejuvenation of the younger consumers wanting to hang out at the Mall. I think it’s our obligation, both for us and our investors, et cetera. And also for the retailers to really highlight that. Now, we don’t have unlimited budgets, like, the tech companies, right? But we try to do the best we can to reinforce that, hey, this is cool. Now, at the same time, digital is important, right? So 14%, 15% of our commerce is digital and we think we can play a role in that. We think the best way to do that is through ShopSimon. We made sure we had proof-of-concept before we put kind of our brand on it. If you remember, it started Shop Premium Outlets. We floundered around until we partnered with Michael Rubin and RGG. We’ve created -- we hired some top-notch talent there. We’re building our marketplace. We had proof-of-concept. And then we decided to rebrand it under ShopSimon. So, we do think, and then, ultimately, this will add, we’ll hang a loyalty product on that, which will be important. And then, ultimately, we have Simon Search, which will hang on that. And we’ll end up with ship from store, pick up at the Mall, et cetera. So it’s, the flywheel is starting to fill itself out. But in the meantime, we want to reaffirm the positive nature that our product means to the community, means to our retailers, as we grow on. And we can’t ignore digital because, well, let’s face it, this is around that 14%, 15%. It’s not growing the way it used to, but we have to assume it might. So we have to play in there. And I think with ShopSimon, we’ve got the right product. Our retailer relationships and faith they have in us gives me confidence. We have the right team. We have the right partner. And RGG, I think, gives us confidence that, we’ll continue to create real value out of that platform. But it’s not overnight, it takes time, takes investment, creative investment and that’s what we’re doing.\nJeffrey Spector: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed to your question.\nDavid Simon: Hi, Craig.\nCraig Mailman: Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up on the ShopSimon concept, David. As you guys are looking to re-merchandise Malls and there could be some more anchor fallout over time. I mean, is the idea here to hopefully get this up and running to where you guys can convert part of the Mall to last mile distribution and be able to bring that logistics angle to your business to help your retailers and also be able to monetize it or am I reading a little bit too much into it?\nDavid Simon: Well, I do think there is absolutely a role that we can play in search at your local store that happens to be in our center. And then maybe there’s a distribution angle and certainly pick up in store is an angle that we can help facilitate with our retailers. Whether we’ll build a mini distribution center or not, I mean, we look at those things and there’s possibilities of certain retailers or certain centers that, we might be able to do a micro or mini distribution facility. We’re also looking at last mile in the power area because obviously that’s going crazy and that, there is -- our real estate is unbelievably well located and it does --it is not -- we’re not out in the hinterlands and last mile is very important and we’re usually have real estate that’s, A1A. So, there’s possibilities. It’s not going to be dominant or whatever. It’ll be selective, but there are potential possibilities.\nCraig Mailman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey. Good morning. Hey. Congrats on the strong leasing quarter crossing 96% in occupancy ahead of…\nDavid Simon: Yeah. You’ve broke up there.\nGreg McGinniss: …go for your functionally full.\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I think, we can still increase our occupancy, but also beyond occupancy, and I said earlier, it’s really, we’re really focused on merchandising. So -- and but we still have room to grow our occupancy, but more important is that, bringing in the right tenants, in the right center, in the right location. That’s a huge focus for us. But we still think we have plenty of opportunity to grow our occupancy.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. Thanks. And just one quick one on FFO per share guidance. We’re trying to better understand the successful year contribution from real estate as opposed to some of the noise that’s generated by other platform investments. Are you still anticipating around zero cents from OPI or is that lower now and maybe offset by better real estate performance?\nBrian McDade: Greg, it’s Brian. I think we now think the OPI contribution is going to be a minus 5 to minus 10 for the year, but it’s being offset by significant improvement in the real estate FFO extension.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. So overall…\nDavid Simon: Let me -- we expect it to improve in the fourth quarter, for sure.\nGreg McGinniss: Right. But I guess, overall, I think my takeaway is that the real estate business guidance would be increased this quarter if it were standalone.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. If we -- if OPI is, you’re breaking up, I don’t know if it’s our phone or yours, but OPI has been a drag this year from an FFO point of view. Now, remember, we essentially have four assets in OPI, okay? We have our investment in RGG, we have our investment in Jamestown, we have our interest in SPARC and J.C. Penney. When you put it all together, we have positive EBITDA in those business of a meaningful amount, but again, when you own an interest in a retailer, you’ve got lots of depreciation, lots of expenses that end up hurting FFO, but not necessarily the EBITDA line. So, I just want everybody to put in that perspective. And again, I would also mention to you that, our investment in both Penney and SPARC is de minimis at this point. We have a little bit more investment in RGG and Jamestown, but the size of our company is the right thing to do. So, with that said, and Brian said in our call, well, we are still not standing still on our retail side, which is Penney and SPARC, and I do think we’ll have some positive announcements with respect to those businesses near year-end or early 2025. So, we’re working hard on that. But the bottomline is it has been a drag this year. Part of that drag was because we sold ABG, so we lost that income that we thought that we -- when we gave you our budget, we weren’t anticipating. We’re extremely happy with that sale. So that was the right thing to do at the right time. And --but so we tackled one opportunity, we’re tackling the next. We view RGG and Jamestown as long-term investments at this point. Obviously, that can change, but we view those as long-term investments. And again, so, and if you go back in history, which I think is important, when we got into the retail business, it was the right thing to do at that particular time. We are less -- given today’s time, it’s probably not the right thing to do and that’s why we haven’t done a retail investment in a few years, four years. So, we’re smart, we get it, but we’re focused in, we have an investment that’s worth something with no capital in it, so our job is to make it better and that’s what we’re focused on.\nGreg McGinniss: Yeah. thank you.\nDavid Simon: A little, yeah, a diversion from what you wanted, but I give you the full story, okay.\nGreg McGinniss: All the colors appreciated. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: No worries. Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Simon: Ron? Looks like we lost Ron.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good morning out there, David, and yeah, I’ll happy to coordinate with Tom and Steve on sitting in on one of those leasing sessions with you.\nDavid Simon: Well, we’ll do it. You might -- you’ll either be fully impressed or you will -- the detail might overwhelm you, so we’ll see.\nAlexander Goldfarb: I look forward to being overwhelmed. So question, David, just getting back to the commentary on the 96% plus leased performance of the portfolio and the comments that you’ve made about the opportunity in the Malls. As you look at the bottom tier, for a long time you talked about the bottom 20% driving cash flow to reinvest in the top Malls, but given how competitive the retail environment has become, lack of new supply, are you seeing new opportunities in your bottom 20% of Malls that previously you would have just harvested for cash flow, but because of the changing landscape you now see opportunities that didn’t exist a few years ago?\nDavid Simon: That’s a good -- that’s a really interesting question and a good point. I think based on, if you asked everybody on the last three days of the Mall portfolio, we absolutely, not every asset in the bottom tier, and again, we -- I don’t like that phrase, but I’m going to use it anyway. I would tell you, if you talk to our team, our leaders in that area, Jon Murphy and Eric Sadi, Rick, God love him, still loves to go through it, and John Rulli, et cetera. I would say to you, one of the real opportunities for this company is to improve the bottom 20, and because you’re right, there’s no new supply in those markets. Just like human nature, we always want to work on the second half, right? So, I do think there’s a real potential to improve that, because in many cases, we’re the only game in town and given lack of supply and our ability to reinvest, I do think we can make real strides in the bottom tier, again, not every asset. But the majority plus of them. So, that’s a big focus going into 2025 without question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.\nFloris van Dijkum: Good morning, guys. Thanks. Question on the leasing. By the way, I thought the response to Alex’s question was fascinating, by the way, because we believe that, the B malls or the lower-quality malls, financing might finally be coming back to that market now, too. But maybe if you can talk about your S&O pipeline. Last quarter, you mentioned it was 250 basis points. How has that moved? I saw that HERMÈS just opened up its store in Phipps, and what percentage of that S&O pipeline is luxury in your view? Is it meaningful and are there other Phipps-type luxury projects planned in the portfolio going forward?\nDavid Simon: Yeah. Let me, yeah, interesting question again, and I would say, I have it right in front of me. I used to. But here, okay, so we have executed 75 new luxury deals covering 208,000 square feet and we have another 47 out for signature. So that’s kind of a total out there at this point, but again, we’re increasing that every day as we speak. So, yeah, we, even though, the sales for certain brands has slowed in that area. They are continuing to commit and for us, as you know, I mean, the build out and the time for those retailers to open is probably compared to kind of a traditional retailer is longer, but we’ve got a very impressive pipe on that with a lot of square footage that will open over the next few years and growing to this day.\nBrian McDade: And Flores, the sign but not open number is about 300 basis points. And importantly here though, as you’ve heard David talk about multiple times, this is about merchandising mix. So this isn’t all incremental. We’re swapping out underperforming retailers with better retailers. And we do have retailers making commitments well into the future in that number as well.\nFloris van Dijkum: Thanks guys.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street.\nVince Tibone: Hi. Good morning. Could you provide some color on the cadence of stabilization for the development and redevelopment pipeline? Specifically, if you could share, how much incremental NOI are expecting in 2025 from the pipeline on a net basis, all the openings this year and next offset by any, just rubber downtime with new projects, that would be super helpful for forecasting?\nBrian McDade: Yeah. Vince, we think we’re ultimately going to deliver about 30% of the portfolio investment in 2025. So, against the 8% on lever deals. I think you get back into the estimated income contribution from that -- those data points.\nVince Tibone: And is that like an average then or I think that it’s like 30% on average will stabilize because like stuff that, delivered the third quarter, for example, this year is obviously going to be creative to 2025. Just wanted to clarify that point?\nBrian McDade: Yeah. I think that’s a decent run rate for expectation relative to our development business, but a third probably stabilizes.\nVince Tibone: Great, that’s helpful. And if I can squeeze in one more follow up, can you just provide a quick description of any Mall redevelopment started in the quarter? I saw the spend increased some, but no description in the release of the project.\nBrian McDade: So we started a resi project at Briarwood, and we started a redevelopment at Tacoma. Those were the two big ones in the quarter that really, that we added to the pipeline.\nVince Tibone: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.\nJuan Sanabria: Good morning. Just given where we are with the election next week, just curious on your thoughts on potential positives or negatives that could come out, depending on which side wins. And I guess specifically also, what would be your view on tariffs? Is that positive or negative for Simon’s business as a whole? Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I am of the view that, we should -- we -- look, I’m of the view that CEOs, whether they’re founders, kind of like the way I feel or up through the ranks, ought to stay out of politics, okay? That’s not to say that they shouldn’t lobby, because there are a lot of things that go on in Washington that may affect the company and that’s their job. So I’m going -- and I’m not here to endorse, kind of take the Washington Post view that, that we have to be ready for all sorts of outcomes. I do think because of that the vitriol that’s occurring and that’s why we’re cautious with respect to kind of our guidance for the fourth quarter is that it’s an uncertain time, right? So not only here domestically and here globally. But beyond that, I really am not going to get into that. I think the decision ought to be left to the -- to individuals. People like me should stay out of trying to influence the people, the people are what matter and we’ll see what happens. We’ll be prepared, there’s basically six potential outcomes, right, if I had to do it right. You could have a Democratic sweep, you could have a Republican sweep, and then you can, I used to be able to do that, but three times, I think it’s six, right? So you could have six possible outcomes, we’ve got to be ready for all six. And I’m not going to tell you what outcome I want. I don’t think it’s my job. I do think it’s my job to lobby once we understand, what’s happening, like, maybe on the de minimis rule or et cetera, that hurts our retailers or hurts our consumer. But beyond that, if I could be so -- I don’t know -- I want to -- I don’t know if I should say this sounds, guys like me, who knows what guys like me means. But we ought to like, just let the people decide, without this overbearing influence from outside people, that that’s my personal kind of view and we just need to be ready for six possible outcomes.\nJuan Sanabria: Fair enough. Understood. Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Maybe just tying some of the themes that we’ve heard from the call together. Your occupancy crossed 96%, you feel like there’s more room to grow, you’re focused on merchandising and being selective and it also looks like you’re expiring rates for 2026 maturities are below 2025 by 67%. So you’ve been throwing it together, does that give you confidence or visibility to sustainable mid-single-digit NOI growth over the next couple of years?\nBrian McDade: Hey, Michael. It’s Brian. Yes. We do believe that we will have the momentum in our NOI will continue. All of the things you highlighted are certainly part of it, plus the investment of capital back into the business. As you’ve heard David say, we will be opening up projects in 2025, 2026 and 2027, but there’s going to be no new supplies. So that is certainly going to support our growth as well.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide some color on the quarter-over-quarter improvement in Domestic and portfolio NOI? And then how do you think about NOI growth in 2025 as an initial guidepost?\nBrian McDade: Well, Linda, I think, the quarter we continue to see rent growth, occupancy growth, conversion of temp to perm. I think you see the quarter reflecting us executing on our business plan to a high degree. And as I just said, I think we carry that momentum into next year as we continue to execute.\nLinda Tsai: Any color on 2025, though, in terms of the same level continuing?\nBrian McDade: Well, Linda, we give our guidance in February, so we’ll update you at that point in time, but I do believe that we have momentum.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nBrian McDade: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Muller with JPMorgan.\nMike Muller: Yeah. Hi. Two questions. First, do you think you’ll see more acquisition opportunities over the next few years compared to what you’ve seen over the past five years or 10 years? And then the second question on development, redevelopment, what do you see as the average spend level for the next three years?\nDavid Simon: Yeah. I will answer and let Brian take number two, but I’ll answer one. I do -- listen, I think, a company like ours has been always structured, built, financed to buy high quality retail real estate has obviously been our primary focus. So it’s hard to know whether it’ll be similar to what we’ve done the last five years or 10 years. But there will be opportunities for us to grow. We really haven’t done much of any acquisitions since the TRG deal, which was, I can still remember that, it was in the height of, well, it was a week, two weeks before COVID. And then Bobby forgot to tell me, he should have known because, he has those assets to China, but he forgot to tell me about COVID. But it worked out for everybody involved. But so it’s really been a while. That doesn’t mean that we’re not looking, paying attention to it, but we’re being very thoughtful about what we would like to buy and at what price. And I would tell you that’s not going to change, but I do think there’ll be opportunities as we go forward. But again, it’s hard to compare it to five years or 10 years ago, but I do think over time we’ll grow through acquisition. Go ahead on the pipe.\nBrian McDade: And Michael, I think, you think about the development and redevelopment pipeline. You heard David talk today about there’s about a $4 billion shadow pipeline. We’ve got a $1.2 billion committed. I think you’re going to continue to see us committed for a $1.5 billion a year. That could ebb and flow by a couple hundred million on either side, just given the size of the projects and the delivery of the projects. So we do see that level of investment available to us over in the future.\nMike Muller: Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nBrian McDade: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning.\nDavid Simon: Good morning.\nKi Bin Kim: Just going back to ShopSimon.com, can you just provide some high level parameters on the progress you’re making, the traction you’re gaining and also curious about the backend logistics side of it. If you -- are -- given the multiple brands we have, are the shipments being consolidated or is it still each individual retailer sending shipments?\nDavid Simon: Yeah. Just -- I’ll answer that first. I mean, look, we’re early days in using ShopSimon for delivery. Remember, it’s mostly a marketplace, but we think over time that’ll be a service that we’ll be able to offer through the ShopSimon app or website. And I would say we’ve had remarkable growth in our GMV. We just rebranded it. So I’m only hesitant because we do have a partner in that and I’m not sure I should disclose that to you, but we’ve got a meaningful growth in our GMV there. And now that we’re going to use our brand and our, as Brian mentioned in his remarks, our 25 million email list and add loyalty, we think there’ll be more retailers on which will add to GMV, which will add to the overall volume of the site So I’m just going to be cautious, Ki Bin, because, we have a partner there. So the good news is we’re making a lot of progress and we’ve got real traction. We’ve got a number of retailers. I don’t remember exactly, but Brian or Tom can tell you after the call, but I’ll hold off on the GMV right now, maybe at some point we’ll be able to disclose that.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRon Kamdem: Hey. Just a quick one for me. Just looking at the sort of the Domestic NOI growth, almost 5%, which is pretty strong. In the past you’d sort of made some comments about next year sort of hitting that 3% number. Just curious to get some update and comments on what you’re seeing on the ground and any sort of differentiation between the traditional Mall and Outlet business, as well would be helpful? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Yeah. Listen, I think, overall, they’re all kind of moving in that direction. So I appreciate you trying to get us to disclose our 2025 comp NOI growth. We will do so in February. We’re just going through the phase of that now, which is, as I mentioned to you, we did the Malls this week. We do the Outlets and The Mills next week. But we’ll absolutely share that with you with our year-end earnings in early Feb and -- but again, I think, the momentum that we’re seeing over the last couple of years continues. That’s the important point.\nRon Kamdem: Thanks so much.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nBrian McDade: Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I’d like to hand the floor back over to David Simon for any closing comments.\nDavid Simon: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate all the questions and interest, and we’ll talk soon if we don’t talk of a good holiday season. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, David, and good morning. Real estate FFO was $3.05 per share in the third quarter, compared to $2.91 in the prior year, a 4.8% growth rate. Domestic and International operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.15 of growth, driven by a 3% increase in lease income. Third quarter funds from operation were $1.07 billion or $2.84 per share, as compared to $1.2 billion or $3.20 per share last year. Third quarter results include $0.13 per share of non-cash net loss and fair value adjustments from the mark to market on the Klépierre exchangeable bonds we issued in November of 2023, which mature in November of 2026. The non-cash loss on derivative is due to the outperformance of Klépierre's stock price, which increased 18% during the third quarter. As a result of the stock appreciation, the market value of our Klépierre investment increased by approximately $400 million during the third quarter. OPI was an eight cent loss in the quarter due to reduced discretionary spending by the lower income consumer at two SPARC brands and also from the loss of income from ABG in the prior year due to the sale of our interest earlier this year. As a reminder, the prior year results include $0.32 per share in non-cash gains from the partial sale of our ownership in SPARC in the third quarter of 2023. Domestic NOI increased 5.4% year-over-year for the quarter due to continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered the results exceeding our plan for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our International properties at constant currency grew 5% for the quarter. Malls and Outlet occupancy at the end of the third quarter was 96.2%, an increase of 1% compared to the prior year. The Mills occupancy was 98.6% at the end of the quarter. Average base minimum rent for the Malls and Outlets increased 2.3% year-over-year and The Mills increased 4.5% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed approximately 1,200 leases for 4 million square feet in the quarter. Through the first nine months of 2024, we have signed more than 3,900 leases for 15 million square feet, which is expected to generate more than $1 billion of revenue. We have an additional 1,800 deals in our pipeline, including renewals for more than $600 million of revenue. We continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community, including continued strength for many categories. Reported retailer sales per square foot was $737 for the Mall and Premium Outlets combined, and was up approximately 1% year-over-year, excluding two retailers. Importantly, total sales volumes, excluding those same two retailers, were up approximately 1.5% year-over-year. The end of the quarter, our occupancy cost was 12.8%. Turning to new development and redevelopment, we opened Tulsa Premium Outlets on August 15th at 100% lease and we also opened a significant expansion at Busan Premium Outlets in South Korea in September. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across all platforms in the U.S. and Internationally, with our share of net cost of $1.3 billion at a blended yield of 8%. Turning to other platform investments, our OPI results for the third quarter at SPARC underperformed as the lower-income consumer continues to be more cautious in their spending. We first highlighted the inflationary impact in the second half of 2022 relative to this consumer. Performance was below expectations at Forever 21 and Reebok. SPARC and J.C. Penney did, however, record sequential improvements in comp sales during the third quarter, which sets these brands up well for the important upcoming holiday season. We are not sitting still and we expect to have some positive announcements by year end with respect to these businesses. Turning to our balance sheet, during the quarter, we amended and extended our $3.5 billion supplemental revolving credit facility for three years on existing terms. We also issued $1 billion in senior notes with a term of 10 years and a 4.75% interest rate. This was clearly good timing on our part. During the first nine months of the year, we completed refinancings of 14 property mortgages for a total of approximately $1.3 billion at an average rate of 6.13%. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.1 billion of liquidity and at the end of the quarter on October -- subsequent to the end of the quarter on October 1st, we repaid our last remaining unsecured maturity for 2024 of $900 million. We constantly innovate in both our physical and digital worlds to create world-class convenience for our shoppers and drive incremental sales for our brand partners. In continuing this effort and building upon the success of Shop Premium Outlets, we rebranded our digital marketplace ShopSimon to take advantage of all of our assets, including shopper email lists totaling over 25 million customers. The expanded and rebranded digital marketplace adds on-sale and discounted merchandise while continuing to offer Outlet products from leading brands. This is the next phase in our journey to create the ultimate omnichannel experience. We also launched a new nationwide marketing campaign, Meet Me @themall. The campaign celebrates the shopping mall's continued cachet as the go-to destination for all generations. Turning to our dividend, today we announced our dividend of $2.10 per share for the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 10.5%. The dividend is payable on December 30th. This is the fourth consecutive quarter we have increased our dividend and the dividend is now back to our pre-pandemic record high. Finally, turning to guidance, we are affirming our guidance range of $12.80 per share to $12.90 per share, which excludes $0.14 per share year-to-date impact of the non-cash loss and steer value adjustments from the mark-to-market on the Klépierre exchangeable bond, which prior to the third quarter was only a $0.01 net non-cash loss, but is now $0.14 and needed to be highlighted. With that, thank you for your time today. David and I are now available for your questions. Operator? Thank you. Let's throw one off. Correct. Greg, it's Brian. I think we now think the OPI contribution is going to be a minus 5 to minus 10 for the year, but it's being offset by significant improvement in the real estate FFO extension. And Flores, the sign but not open number is about 300 basis points. And importantly here though, as you've heard David talk about multiple times, this is about merchandising mix. So this isn't all incremental. We're swapping out underperforming retailers with better retailers. And we do have retailers making commitments well into the future in that number as well. Yeah. Vince, we think we're ultimately going to deliver about 30% of the portfolio investment in 2025. So, against the 8% on lever deals. I think you get back into the estimated income contribution from that -- those data points. Yeah. I think that's a decent run rate for expectation relative to our development business, but a third probably stabilizes. So we started a resi project at Briarwood, and we started a redevelopment at Tacoma. Those were the two big ones in the quarter that really, that we added to the pipeline. Hey, Michael. It's Brian. Yes. We do believe that we will have the momentum in our NOI will continue. All of the things you highlighted are certainly part of it, plus the investment of capital back into the business. As you've heard David say, we will be opening up projects in 2025, 2026 and 2027, but there's going to be no new supplies. So that is certainly going to support our growth as well. Well, Linda, I think, the quarter we continue to see rent growth, occupancy growth, conversion of temp to perm. I think you see the quarter reflecting us executing on our business plan to a high degree. And as I just said, I think we carry that momentum into next year as we continue to execute. Well, Linda, we give our guidance in February, so we'll update you at that point in time, but I do believe that we have momentum. Thank you. And Michael, I think, you think about the development and redevelopment pipeline. You heard David talk today about there's about a $4 billion shadow pipeline. We've got a $1.2 billion committed. I think you're going to continue to see us committed for a $1.5 billion a year. That could ebb and flow by a couple hundred million on either side, just given the size of the projects and the delivery of the projects. So we do see that level of investment available to us over in the future. Thank you, Michael. Thanks, Ron."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "Good morning, everybody. And I'm pleased with our financial and operational performance in the third quarter. We saw increased leasing volumes, occupancy gains and total retail sales volumes. Demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is strong and steady and we continue to strengthen our unique retail real estate platform through our growing development and redevelopment pipeline. This, combined with our A-rated balance sheet, really sets us apart and allows us to focus on the future. We raised our dividend again to $2.10. We're now at our historical high, overcoming the arbitrary capricious closing of our real estate during COVID. We have a low payout ratio. I'm going to now turn it over to Brian, who will cover our third quarter results and full year guidance in more detail, Brian. Yeah. Steve, I'll answer that simplistically, I guess. I would say that our job is to continue to improve the merchandise mix at our real estate and so it's more than -- it's a lot more than just what rent you can charge. It's really what is the right retailer, tenant, et cetera. What's the right mix for that property? And we take more of a holistic approach to how we re-merchandise centers. We're still undergoing significant re-merchandising across the portfolio, because we're seeing better retailers. When I say retailers, it could be restaurants, et cetera. I'm using that as a generic term. We're seeing a lot more interesting and better retailers that are interested in our portfolio. So we need to take advantage of that and that's the focus. So obviously, supply and demand. I mean, construction costs are up 60% from pre-pandemic numbers. I mean, a pretty staggering number. We're basically one of the few that can build and overcome that. So there is no real new supply and that does put us in a positive light. But our job is to make the properties better and not just focus on the highest rent per square foot we can get. So, with that, we have a balanced approach. Obviously, we think we still have growth as leases expire or we bring in new tenants. But I don't -- I really don't like the term pricing power. I really don't like the focus on that. Just how do you continue to make the portfolio better is really the number one focus for our team. We just literally had a three-day marathon session. We go property-by-property with our leasing folks. We did the Malls this week. We'll do the Outlets and Mills next week. And if you participated in it, I think I offered somebody one time down the road to who was it? Alex, probably? Yeah, Alex is the only guy that would want to sit through it. But if you sat through it, the primary focus is how do we make the property better? We still have work to do there. But I think at the end of the day, when you do that, you'll get the property growth that we're all looking for. So I would characterize it that way, Steve. The good news is supply and demand is in our favor. We have the capital to invest in our portfolio to make it better, overcome the unbelievable rise in construction costs when you think about it and that's the focus. You're more than welcome. You get to choose Outlets or mills, right? Let Tom know, okay? Thank you. Yeah. I think that continues, Caitlin, to be a huge focus for us. So I would -- our pipeline is probably around $4 billion right now. That doesn't mean we're going to do all of it. But we have massive mixed-use opportunities ahead of us and we still don't have all the anchors redevelop the way we want to. So we have opportunities at like a Barton Creek or down the line, if you looked at some of the Sears. Fashion Valley is a great opportunity where we're going to get the J.C. Penney space back and probably do about a $500 million redevelopment between retail and mixed-use. Our residential pipeline, as an example of that, is over a $1 billion today. And without including kind of the Fashion Valleys or the Barton Creeks of the world that we think could do residential. We continue to see an interesting relationship between residential development adjacent or part of or existing retail format. They actually go hand in glove. It's very encouraging to see. I think if you listen to Don Wood, he'll tell you the same thing. So that is exciting. We're going full steam ahead. As you know, that supply, it's probably, in certain markets been oversupplied, but the reality is nobody building now. And if you think how we're looking at it, it's going to take two years to three years to four years, and as we bring these on, there'll be no new supply. And I think that'll put us in a in an advantageous situation. So long story short, say $4 billion and roughly a third of that is probably resi. Let's throw one off. But some office, like for instance, we're -- we just approved a deal and I don't think it's in our, in our 8-K, but we just approved a deal at Clearfork, which is in Fort Worth, kind of a newer center and we just approved a deal with our partner to build an office and retail on the ground floor. The office is going to be, I don't know if I can say it, but basically, we don't -- it's not big -- it's -- I don't know, 50,000 square feet and Wells is going to take the majority of it. And so we'll still do smatterings of those kind of projects as we go forward. But building a big spec office out of our pipeline. Correct. Yeah. Correct. Thank you. Sure. Sure. So, I would say, Jeff that, the Mall continues to be a unique gathering place. And we get -- I think we all get too focused on whether it's enclosed or has a roof on it. I mean, it really -- to me it really doesn't matter. It's kind of what is the best retail project in that training area. And we believe that, and if you talk to, really new and exciting companies like Ascian or other, SKIMS or kind of the new wave of retailers/marketplaces. They all believe in our product. And so -- and we're seeing a rejuvenation of the younger consumers wanting to hang out at the Mall. I think it's our obligation, both for us and our investors, et cetera. And also for the retailers to really highlight that. Now, we don't have unlimited budgets, like, the tech companies, right? But we try to do the best we can to reinforce that, hey, this is cool. Now, at the same time, digital is important, right? So 14%, 15% of our commerce is digital and we think we can play a role in that. We think the best way to do that is through ShopSimon. We made sure we had proof-of-concept before we put kind of our brand on it. If you remember, it started Shop Premium Outlets. We floundered around until we partnered with Michael Rubin and RGG. We've created -- we hired some top-notch talent there. We're building our marketplace. We had proof-of-concept. And then we decided to rebrand it under ShopSimon. So, we do think, and then, ultimately, this will add, we'll hang a loyalty product on that, which will be important. And then, ultimately, we have Simon Search, which will hang on that. And we'll end up with ship from store, pick up at the Mall, et cetera. So it's, the flywheel is starting to fill itself out. But in the meantime, we want to reaffirm the positive nature that our product means to the community, means to our retailers, as we grow on. And we can't ignore digital because, well, let's face it, this is around that 14%, 15%. It's not growing the way it used to, but we have to assume it might. So we have to play in there. And I think with ShopSimon, we've got the right product. Our retailer relationships and faith they have in us gives me confidence. We have the right team. We have the right partner. And RGG, I think, gives us confidence that, we'll continue to create real value out of that platform. But it's not overnight, it takes time, takes investment, creative investment and that's what we're doing. Thank you. Hi, Craig. Well, I do think there is absolutely a role that we can play in search at your local store that happens to be in our center. And then maybe there's a distribution angle and certainly pick up in store is an angle that we can help facilitate with our retailers. Whether we'll build a mini distribution center or not, I mean, we look at those things and there's possibilities of certain retailers or certain centers that, we might be able to do a micro or mini distribution facility. We're also looking at last mile in the power area because obviously that's going crazy and that, there is -- our real estate is unbelievably well located and it does --it is not -- we're not out in the hinterlands and last mile is very important and we're usually have real estate that's, A1A. So, there's possibilities. It's not going to be dominant or whatever. It'll be selective, but there are potential possibilities. Yeah. You've broke up there. Well, look, I think, we can still increase our occupancy, but also beyond occupancy, and I said earlier, it's really, we're really focused on merchandising. So -- and but we still have room to grow our occupancy, but more important is that, bringing in the right tenants, in the right center, in the right location. That's a huge focus for us. But we still think we have plenty of opportunity to grow our occupancy. Let me -- we expect it to improve in the fourth quarter, for sure. Yeah. If we -- if OPI is, you're breaking up, I don't know if it's our phone or yours, but OPI has been a drag this year from an FFO point of view. Now, remember, we essentially have four assets in OPI, okay? We have our investment in RGG, we have our investment in Jamestown, we have our interest in SPARC and J.C. Penney. When you put it all together, we have positive EBITDA in those business of a meaningful amount, but again, when you own an interest in a retailer, you've got lots of depreciation, lots of expenses that end up hurting FFO, but not necessarily the EBITDA line. So, I just want everybody to put in that perspective. And again, I would also mention to you that, our investment in both Penney and SPARC is de minimis at this point. We have a little bit more investment in RGG and Jamestown, but the size of our company is the right thing to do. So, with that said, and Brian said in our call, well, we are still not standing still on our retail side, which is Penney and SPARC, and I do think we'll have some positive announcements with respect to those businesses near year-end or early 2025. So, we're working hard on that. But the bottomline is it has been a drag this year. Part of that drag was because we sold ABG, so we lost that income that we thought that we -- when we gave you our budget, we weren't anticipating. We're extremely happy with that sale. So that was the right thing to do at the right time. And --but so we tackled one opportunity, we're tackling the next. We view RGG and Jamestown as long-term investments at this point. Obviously, that can change, but we view those as long-term investments. And again, so, and if you go back in history, which I think is important, when we got into the retail business, it was the right thing to do at that particular time. We are less -- given today's time, it's probably not the right thing to do and that's why we haven't done a retail investment in a few years, four years. So, we're smart, we get it, but we're focused in, we have an investment that's worth something with no capital in it, so our job is to make it better and that's what we're focused on. A little, yeah, a diversion from what you wanted, but I give you the full story, okay. No worries. Thanks, Greg. Ron? Looks like we lost Ron. Well, we'll do it. You might -- you'll either be fully impressed or you will -- the detail might overwhelm you, so we'll see. That's a good -- that's a really interesting question and a good point. I think based on, if you asked everybody on the last three days of the Mall portfolio, we absolutely, not every asset in the bottom tier, and again, we -- I don't like that phrase, but I'm going to use it anyway. I would tell you, if you talk to our team, our leaders in that area, Jon Murphy and Eric Sadi, Rick, God love him, still loves to go through it, and John Rulli, et cetera. I would say to you, one of the real opportunities for this company is to improve the bottom 20, and because you're right, there's no new supply in those markets. Just like human nature, we always want to work on the second half, right? So, I do think there's a real potential to improve that, because in many cases, we're the only game in town and given lack of supply and our ability to reinvest, I do think we can make real strides in the bottom tier, again, not every asset. But the majority plus of them. So, that's a big focus going into 2025 without question. Sure. Yeah. Let me, yeah, interesting question again, and I would say, I have it right in front of me. I used to. But here, okay, so we have executed 75 new luxury deals covering 208,000 square feet and we have another 47 out for signature. So that's kind of a total out there at this point, but again, we're increasing that every day as we speak. So, yeah, we, even though, the sales for certain brands has slowed in that area. They are continuing to commit and for us, as you know, I mean, the build out and the time for those retailers to open is probably compared to kind of a traditional retailer is longer, but we've got a very impressive pipe on that with a lot of square footage that will open over the next few years and growing to this day. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Well, look, I am of the view that, we should -- we -- look, I'm of the view that CEOs, whether they're founders, kind of like the way I feel or up through the ranks, ought to stay out of politics, okay? That's not to say that they shouldn't lobby, because there are a lot of things that go on in Washington that may affect the company and that's their job. So I'm going -- and I'm not here to endorse, kind of take the Washington Post view that, that we have to be ready for all sorts of outcomes. I do think because of that the vitriol that's occurring and that's why we're cautious with respect to kind of our guidance for the fourth quarter is that it's an uncertain time, right? So not only here domestically and here globally. But beyond that, I really am not going to get into that. I think the decision ought to be left to the -- to individuals. People like me should stay out of trying to influence the people, the people are what matter and we'll see what happens. We'll be prepared, there's basically six potential outcomes, right, if I had to do it right. You could have a Democratic sweep, you could have a Republican sweep, and then you can, I used to be able to do that, but three times, I think it's six, right? So you could have six possible outcomes, we've got to be ready for all six. And I'm not going to tell you what outcome I want. I don't think it's my job. I do think it's my job to lobby once we understand, what's happening, like, maybe on the de minimis rule or et cetera, that hurts our retailers or hurts our consumer. But beyond that, if I could be so -- I don't know -- I want to -- I don't know if I should say this sounds, guys like me, who knows what guys like me means. But we ought to like, just let the people decide, without this overbearing influence from outside people, that that's my personal kind of view and we just need to be ready for six possible outcomes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I will answer and let Brian take number two, but I'll answer one. I do -- listen, I think, a company like ours has been always structured, built, financed to buy high quality retail real estate has obviously been our primary focus. So it's hard to know whether it'll be similar to what we've done the last five years or 10 years. But there will be opportunities for us to grow. We really haven't done much of any acquisitions since the TRG deal, which was, I can still remember that, it was in the height of, well, it was a week, two weeks before COVID. And then Bobby forgot to tell me, he should have known because, he has those assets to China, but he forgot to tell me about COVID. But it worked out for everybody involved. But so it's really been a while. That doesn't mean that we're not looking, paying attention to it, but we're being very thoughtful about what we would like to buy and at what price. And I would tell you that's not going to change, but I do think there'll be opportunities as we go forward. But again, it's hard to compare it to five years or 10 years ago, but I do think over time we'll grow through acquisition. Go ahead on the pipe. Thank you. Good morning. Yeah. Just -- I'll answer that first. I mean, look, we're early days in using ShopSimon for delivery. Remember, it's mostly a marketplace, but we think over time that'll be a service that we'll be able to offer through the ShopSimon app or website. And I would say we've had remarkable growth in our GMV. We just rebranded it. So I'm only hesitant because we do have a partner in that and I'm not sure I should disclose that to you, but we've got a meaningful growth in our GMV there. And now that we're going to use our brand and our, as Brian mentioned in his remarks, our 25 million email list and add loyalty, we think there'll be more retailers on which will add to GMV, which will add to the overall volume of the site So I'm just going to be cautious, Ki Bin, because, we have a partner there. So the good news is we're making a lot of progress and we've got real traction. We've got a number of retailers. I don't remember exactly, but Brian or Tom can tell you after the call, but I'll hold off on the GMV right now, maybe at some point we'll be able to disclose that. Thank you. Yeah. Listen, I think, overall, they're all kind of moving in that direction. So I appreciate you trying to get us to disclose our 2025 comp NOI growth. We will do so in February. We're just going through the phase of that now, which is, as I mentioned to you, we did the Malls this week. We do the Outlets and The Mills next week. But we'll absolutely share that with you with our year-end earnings in early Feb and -- but again, I think, the momentum that we're seeing over the last couple of years continues. That's the important point. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate all the questions and interest, and we'll talk soon if we don't talk of a good holiday season. Thank you."

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to one question. I'm pleased to introduce David Simon,\nDavid Simon: Good evening, everyone. I'm pleased with our financial and operational performance in the second quarter. We are seeing increased leasing volumes, occupancy gains, shopper traffic, and retail sales volumes resulted in the company's highest level of real estate NOI for the second quarter in our company's history. Demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is strong and steady. Our company is focused on creating value through unique and disciplined investment activities that will continue to deliver long-term growth and cash flow, funds from operations and dividends, as you've seen by our recent increase in our dividend per share. And importantly, make our properties better for the communities in which they operate. I'm now going to turn the call over to Brian, who will cover our second quarter results and the full-year guidance in more detail.\nBrian McDade: Thank you, David. Second quarter funds from operations were $1.09 billion or $2.90 per share compared to $1,800 million or $2.88 per share last year. FFO from our real-estate business was $2.93 per share in the second quarter compared to $2.81 in the prior year, a 4.3% growth. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.12 of growth. As a reminder, the prior year included a non-cash gain of $0.07 from investment activity related to ABG. Domestic NOI increased 5.2% year-over-year for the quarter. Continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered results exceeding our plan for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 4.8% for the quarter. Malls and outlet occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 95.6%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year. The mills occupancy was 98.2%. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 3% year-over-year and the mills increased 3.9%. As David mentioned, leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1,400 leases for approximately 4.8 million square feet in the quarter. Approximately 30% of our leasing activity in the second quarter was new deal volume. Our traffic in the second quarter was up 5% compared to last year. And importantly, total sales volumes increased approximately 2% year-over-year. Reported retailer sales per square foot in the second-quarter was $741 for the mall and premium outlets combined. We hosted our third Annual National Outlet Shopping Day in June, and it was very successful for shoppers and for participating retailers. More than 3 million shoppers visit our premium outlets and mill centers over the shopping weekend. Feedback from shoppers and retailers following the event has been great. Since launching this unique event three years ago, participating retailer and shopping momentum has built each year with more than 475 retailers this year, and we look forward to an even bigger event next year. Our occupancy cost at the end of the second quarter was 12.7%. Turning to new development and redevelopment. We will open our Tulsa premium outlets on August 15th at 100% leased and we will also open a significant expansion at Busan Premium Outlets in South Korea this fall. We also started construction in the quarter on our first phase of a new luxury residential development at Northgate Station. This project will include 234 units and adds other elements that further transforms Northgate into the ultimate live, work, skate, stay and shop destination. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across all platforms in the US and internationally with our share of net cost of $1.1 billion and a blended yield of 8%. Now to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of 10 property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of approximately $1.1 billion, an average rate of 6.36%. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.2 billion of liquidity. Turning to the dividend, today, we announced our dividend of $2.05 per share for the third-quarter, a year-over-year increase of 7.9%. The dividend is payable on September 30th. And now finally for guidance. We are increasing our full-year 2024 guidance range to $12.80 to $12.90 per share compared to $12.51 last year. This is an increase of $0.05 at the bottom end of the range and $0.02 at the midpoint and reflects overcoming approximately $0.15 per share from certain retailer restructurings, lower lease settlement and land sales, land sales income this year. With that, that concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you. David and I are now available for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJeff Spector: Great. Good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter.\nDavid Simon: Thank you, Jeff.\nJeff Spector: Yes. My first question -- I guess my only question at this point, I would say circle back in. I guess let's focus on the consumer, given you service to the consumer across various formats from the malls to premium outlets to mills, what is your latest thoughts on the consumer today? Clearly, the market is panicking that we may see a consumer-led recession. And maybe if you could tie it to what you're seeing from retailers and how they're acting today? Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure, Jeff. This is David. I'll take that. So look, I think we've been pretty consistent for well over a year that the lower-income consumer has been under pressure for quite some time, primarily because of the inflation that's affected them. So that continues to be the case, they are very focused on managing their bills and discretionary expenditures have been obviously not where we'd like to see them. So we're optimistic that we're going to cycle out of that from the lower-end consumer as given the inflation picture that we see now, which is relatively benign. It's way too early, Jeff. We haven't seen a slowdown in the higher-end consumer. Obviously, the market is in an interesting point. We have not seen the wealth impact at all impact that higher-end consumer. So we're still pretty sanguine about it. I think, as you know, we kind of budgeted at the beginning of the year flat sales. We're a little bit above that. So we've got a little bit of cushion. But the higher-end or the better end-consumer, I think is in a good spot. Your liquidity is in a decent spot. So we don't expect anything dramatic. But obviously, they're going to take their cue from now what's going to happen in the overall market and what the employment picture looks like. So in summary, I think we're going to cycle more positive in the lower-end consumer and I think the higher-end consumer steady as she goes currently. Yes, Jeff, you can always ask another question, but Tom Ward has put a pretty tough restriction on people.\nJeff Spector: No, thank you. That's all be respectful. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nSamir Khanal: Hi, David. I guess what are you seeing in terms of leasing or pricing power? I mean, are you seeing any tenants taking a bit of a pause or taking a bit longer to sign new leases given what's happened with the macro and I guess any color on July would be also helpful in terms of traffic or sales? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Yes, I don't have color on July. We don't really get those numbers until August 20th, which is my birthday by the way, but it's usually 20 days after the month so no early returns on that. So we had a deal committee meeting, Brian, a week ago and what I am told that I don't participate in these because I would probably be disruptive, but what I am told, it was the best new deal committee in we've had ever. So I think what we're seeing is demand and what I said earlier in my opening remarks, demand is strong and steady, not abating. It's really unabated. Obviously, retailers and so we're all sensitive to economic conditions. So as those develop, we have to be sensitive to them. But as we currently speak, we had a great deal committee and the team is working in all cylinders. So that's kind of the news from the front.\nSamir Khanal: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. Maybe just following up on that retailer demand side. So portfolio occupancy has increased nicely over the last year. It sounds like leasing remains strong. You just mentioned the best new deal committee. So that would support further occupancy increases. I'm just wondering versus the current 95.6%, how much further upside do you think you have? Or is there some reason to expect this rate of increase can or cannot continue going forward?\nBrian McDade: Hey, Caitlin, it is Brian. I think we're pretty comfortable thinking that we're going to end the year north of 96%. Certainly still a little bit of noise out there, but given the robust demand in the type of environment we're in, we think we're north of 96% by the end of the year.\nCaitlin Burrows: I mean, again, yes.\nDavid Simon: I'm sorry, I was just going to add that I think obviously, it's also not just the occupancy number, it's also replacing retailers that aren't performing with better retailers. So it's a mix issue too, which the team is very much focused on. Go ahead, Caitlin.\nCaitlin Burrows: Yes, I was just going to say bigger picture, like, Brian, you just mentioned north of 96, is there any reason to think maybe based on what David said, that's kind of a ceiling or there could still be continued upside potential?\nBrian McDade: Well, I'd be cautious and that's a pretty good number for us year-end. Tom knows every number, but he's [indiscernible]. So it's a pretty good increase from last year, 95.5. Not that good at that. So maybe there's upside.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good afternoon. And David, certainly good to hear you on the call. Hope the recovery and all the stuff is going well. Just a question for you big-picture. Jeff kicked it off and a number of -- my peers have all asked the same question. But as we look at the environment today, certainly there's a lot less retail availability. There's been a big shake-up not only among the retailers themselves, but also the landlords and certainly cost for new development has gone through the roof. So as you look at the picture today, with the economic concerns, but also at the same time that the tenants seem to be in better capital positions. Are you as worried today when you see weak economic data? And does that impact the way you think about expanding, putting money to work and how the leasing conversations are going? Or do you think that we're in a better situation or worse situation? Like how do you judge where we are now just given that the environment seems to be different than it has been over the past few decades.\nDavid Simon: Well, thank you, Alex, for the thoughts. And let me just answer your question. So I frankly think that listen, it sounds like I'm, talking our book, which obviously you would expect us to do, but we have never been better-positioned. So if we do -- so I don't look at the -- that the current uncertainty and even a potential recession no one wants to go through that but given how we're positioned I think we're in an absolute unequivocal position to improve and better our company. So again, we don't want to go through recession, but if we do, the gap between us and everybody else just gets bigger and bigger. Our gap, if you look at kind of where we started three years ago and where we are today, the gap is pretty damn big, it will only get bigger and that's a testament to the team and everybody else. So -- and honestly, I'm not looking at a current potential recession or tough market as any basis to slow down. I look at an example, we just started construction in Northgate, building 234 [projects] (ph). And we expect to do another phase of that probably in the next nine months as we go through the pricing. So from our standpoint, we're not slowing down. And if the economy slows dramatically, the gap between us and just about everybody else will only get bigger and that's -- that gives us opportunities to do some interesting projects.\nAlexander Goldfarb: And you see the same confidence from your retailer, from your partners, your tenants or are they're waffling?\nDavid Simon: I think the better retailers that are -- we have a number of retailers that are in really good financial standing and I think they take a longer view just like we do. Not everyone, but I would tell you the majority of who we're doing new business with is definitely taking a longer-term view. So they're looking to gain sales and market share as well. So we're certainly not on the defensive into the kind of the turmoil over the last few weeks. And if anything, we'll step up our investment activity, but not foolishly. I mean, we'll do it like we do everything else, but we don't see it as a reason to rain in at this point.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You continue to drive nice NOI growth driven by both occupancy gains and higher rents. Now we've talked a little bit on the call about occupancy potentially approaching a potential ceiling. So do you see increasing pricing power with that to maybe offset that? I'm just trying to get a better understand of how the algorithm kind of looks in the coming quarters? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Well, again, occupancy is like any statistic people want. And again, to be clear, we do think we'll increase our occupancy. The bigger opportunity for us is again to continue to increase better than mix. So -- and that drives, obviously the better the mix, the higher the sales, the higher the sales, the more likelihood that you're going to have higher rents. So that's the big focus as we continue to merchandise our properties. Brian, I don't know if you want to add anything to here.\nBrian McDade: Yes, Michael. Look, we continue to see pricing power. Roughly rents are similar where we've seen an escalation last year that we talked about rents in the 70s for new deals. That's continuing. And as we find more-and-more retailers and update the mix to drive demand and ultimately drives our pricing power. So there's a recurring premier relative to that.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much. Good luck in the back half.\nOperator: Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nCraig Mailman: Hey, guys. Maybe shifting gears a bit on to the balance sheet and just the rate environment here. Just your thoughts generally with a three, eight, 10 year. If that's at all changing your view on kind of the upcoming debt maturities in the back-half of the year and how to fund those versus how much cash to keep on hand versus, David, maybe your commentary about the gap between you and others, your ability to be on the offensive to make investments now that if we do go into recession by the time they're done, you're kind of on the other side of it and you're well-positioned. So I'm just kind of curious, I know it's a broader question, but just how kind of the softening rate environment here, does that change anything you're doing or how you want to be positioned on the margin?\nBrian McDade: Craig, it's Brian. Look, one day doesn't really change our financing plans for the year. We're sitting on $3.1 billion of cash. We had $1.9 billion in maturities in the back-half of the year. Current plan is still to refinance those out with cash on hand. But to the extent we were to see opportunity to do alternatively or the market opened up with tight spreads, certainly, we could access the market in the back half of the year as well. But no current plans to do so at present.\nDavid Simon: Yes. And I would just say, look, we got $11 billion of liquidity, so obviously a lower interest-rate environment does increase our earnings potential. There's all sorts of things associated with a lower interest-rate environment, but by and large, that's beneficial to real estate. So if that's the case, that's going to be better than what we planned initially for this year and what we were thinking for next year. So that's good news in a nutshell. But again, remember, we got -- we're not living, mortgage to mortgage, we're a different kind of company. So we don't have the Holy Toledo, I'm going to say another word, Holy Toledo, we can't refinance this mortgage. So anyway, so -- but by and large, if rates go lower, that's better for this company.\nOperator: Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nJuan Sanabria: Thanks for the time. And David, I hope your recovery is going well as well. I'm just curious on the investment front, you clearly sound more bullish or wanting to invest more capital in debt and re-debt. But just curious about external acquisitions with the statement that you said that you're only going to kind of widen the gap between yourself and others. Would that make you want to wait because there's going to be better -- a better maybe spread down the road between your performance and those of others or not necessarily?\nDavid Simon: Well, it's a good question and that's when I would just say judgment comes into play. I mean we have been as you know, right, because if there was any material, we disclose it. We haven't really done anything external for quite some time and we're going to just be looking at quality stuff where we can add value that's appropriately priced. And up until this point, frankly, we haven't found it. So that doesn't mean that we're discouraged, but we'll keep doing that because that is an element of what this company is good at. And we would like to add quality where we could add value at the right price and if it's not at the right price or if it's not at the right quality, there's just nothing there for us to do. We're not -- we're basically out-of-the portfolio business. So that as far as I can see, I mean things change, but I just don't see us buying another big portfolio that where we'd have to swap off a handful of properties. So we're really going to be selective and -- but again, it's going to be at the right price. And if we can't get it at the right price, then we've got plenty to do and that will keep our liquidity and keep doing what we're doing.\nJuan Sanabria: Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Best wishes to you, David, as well Mike. Just a quick one from me. Just could we double-click on some of the strength that you talked about in the portfolio, but maybe breaking it down between maybe malls versus outlets or some of the tourist centers as well would be helpful.\nBrian McDade: Well, Ron, I think you're seeing broad-based demand across all of our platforms. So it's difficult to kind of give you an individual kind of thumbnail into it. But certainly, we see -- we over-index in our outlet business, certainly towards international towards and that's still very strong for us. That's a driving factor kind of in our outlet business results. But certainly, the retailers are doing business across all three formats. You're going to say the highest occupancy ever. So the demand is broad-based from all retailers across all three major platforms of ours at this point. David, I don't know if you want to add anything?\nDavid Simon: Yes. It's kind of interesting. I just don't think there's like a unique trend, so it's not Florida or Texas, it's not outlets room halls, it's not enclosed versus outdoors, it's really very property-specific and I would say that the quality and the good stuff is getting better and it's almost our traffic which is a good indicator was pretty much across the board. So I think there's no unique -- unlike COVID where when you came out of COVID, it was Florida and Texas kind of the smile states and whatever, I think it's really the -- it's really property-specific. And it's not -- so you could have a great property in X, Y, Z city and a not-so-good one in X, Y, Z city and they're a tale of the two stories. So I really think the -- I really think it's property-specific. And I don't think there's any one particular trend to focus on at least in this quarter. You might have a better sense of it by year-end and see how things shake out, but not right now.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hi, thank you. And David as well, I wanted to wish you best wishes and hopes for a speedy recovery here. My question tonight is, I wanted to go back to the strong and broad-based demand you mentioned you're seeing for space across the portfolio. I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on the size of the backlog of leases that are coming online, maybe some color on the timing of that? And is there also any update you can provide on the 3% or the at least 3% domestic NOI growth from last quarter for the core? Thanks.\nBrian McDade: Hey, Haendel, it's Brian. As we think about demand, we've got a signed but not open pipeline of about 300 basis-points. You heard David talk about mix and so we are moving some tenants around. So that's not all just additive. There'll be some coming out-of-the bottom of that for sure. But that's just a further indication of the work that our team has done in demand for space to have 300 basis points signed, but not open pipeline for us. So really, really kind of that defines or kind of really gives you a really good sense of the breadth of what's out there for us as far as demand for space,\nHaendel St. Juste: 3% at least? Yes 3% max?\nBrian McDade: As you know, we don't update that as we go. We established it at the beginning of the year, and to see that our best to exceed that number which we have thus far.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Thank you\nOperator: Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good evening. How much do you think changes in the stock market impacts consumer spending at the higher-end? Just from your experience over the years, like at what point does stock market volatility really start impacting consumer behavior and consumer sales?\nDavid Simon: I think it's more -- that's a -- I wish I had an algorithm. I don't, but I'm sure we could get AI to do something for us. I would -- my history would suggest short-term fluctuations mean absolutely nothing. But over time, if you had a down-market for six or nine months, you're going to rein in consumer spending. So I do think it's going to have to take the downward trend or the negative -- the volatility is not going to really impact the consumer in the next short period of time. But if you see it for several months, then I would expect us to see some slowdown in consumer spending. So it does take time to see, but I think that the consumer is used to seeing some volatility and they have some probably built-in gains that they never thought they would have had, right? So when companies get valued in trillions -- I remember when a $50 billion market cap was did, when companies get valued at trillions of dollars, and that's a lot of retail, I hope those retail investors are smart enough to sell and then spend the money in our malls, I mean that would be a good cycle for us, okay? So I think even if these levels were in pretty good shape, if you have a -- if you have kind of a longer downturn, then it's realistic to think that consumer spending is going to be reined in. But offsetting that obviously will be, low inflation, lower interest rates and you can -- you could potentially see a scenario that we dealt with pre-COVID, right? So it's -- if there's a lot of variabilities out there. And -- but I don't think short-term fluctuation is going to have an immediate impact.\nVince Tibone: It makes sense. If I could maybe ask one quick follow-up along those lines like just how should we think about the sensitivity of Simon's cash flows to tenant sales? I mean, with all kind of the COVID changes, it seems like most of that's unwinded at this point. But kind of just, yes, is there any guidepost you can share of like how much rent or how much of your total revenue rather is made up of overtime percentage rent or just how much volatility is there on your business from if tenant sales were to be?\nDavid Simon: Yes. Look, I'll -- Brian may have a number. I would just say big-picture, a lot less coming out of COVID, but higher probably than pre-COVID. And so I don't know what perspect that is, Brian, if you don't, well, we could probably give that number to you. But it's certainly a lot less than when we started in COVID, but higher than probably pre-COVID.\nBrian McDade: We'll follow-up offline, Vince.\nVince Tibone: Great. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please proceed.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey, good afternoon. David, we share birthday, so I'm pretty excited about that. But my question, first --\nDavid Simon: How old are you going to be?\nGreg McGinniss: No, you really want me to share that?\nDavid Simon: No, no, no, not at all.\nGreg McGinniss: So we noticed that the overall same-store NOI growth this quarter was healthy and but largely driven by the consolidated portfolio. We had international NOI was down 1% year-over-year. JV revenues down about 4% versus last year. Is there anything in particular that's impacting the international and JV assets this quarter? And do you expect to see those return to year-over-year growth in the back half?\nBrian McDade: Greg, from an international perspective, Greg, last year, we did recognize a one-time performance fee in our McArthurGlen business to some third-party managed capital there. So that did not repeat this year. So that's why you see a decline in that line item. That will normalize itself just by sheer operation going forward.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay.\nDavid Simon: Yes. I would just say our international assets both in Asia and in Europe are pretty much on plan if not a little bit better. So [indiscernible], as you know, reported last week to better results. And they're obviously nicely positioned going forward. And Europe and Asia is some movements in the different countries, Japan having extraordinary growth because of the yuan, a couple of other markets flat. But generally speaking, international -- this got good -- as Brian mentioned, good comp NOI growth this year and pretty much on budget.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay, thank you very much.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please proceed.\nFloris van Dijkum: Hey, thanks. Glad to hear you're doing well, David. You sound great. Question on Value Retail. I know you guys own a stake in that. It's sold at an incredibly low cap-rate to Catterton, who I think is the investment arm of LVMH. Could you maybe talk about maybe -- and I think that's -- it's a different market, obviously, but if you could talk about the cap rates environment in Europe versus here and maybe also the long-term nature of some of these big luxury brands? And do you see them putting money to work at those kinds of cap rates? I mean, I guess they have already on Fifth Avenue, but in the mall business as well in the US in your view?\nDavid Simon: Well, let me -- thank you. Let me try to unpack that a little bit, okay? So, for us, let me -- I would say, first of all, L Catterton are very smart investors and Value Retail is a unique structure. So I don't think you can look through their investment that was at a significant discount to NAV to get to a cap rate without really having intimate inside knowledge which you or I don't have, okay? But they're very smart investors and I don't think this is a -- so that's the first point I'd like to make just on that question. Second is I think, again, it depends on what brands you're talking about, whether it's luxury or higher-end or whatever, a better moderate. Every retailer is different, everyone's looking to increase their sales and every brand is different. So it's you cannot paint a luxury investor by one broad stroke. So and even within some of the larger groups, their brands are different. You may have one brand growing, one shrinking, what have you? I don't expect, and again L Catterton is also owned by the principals of Catterton. So it's not just the group. I don't think there is a trend for them to suddenly invest, got some money in retail real estate, but I could be wrong. And I think it really depends on each brand and what their strategy is.\nFloris van Dijkum: And if I may follow-up, I mean, are you having -- how are your discussions going with your institutional partners here in the US in the mall business? Are they -- are those partners happy? And would you -- are there opportunities for you to maybe buy some of them out or are they pretty comfortable owning some of those top malls that you typically JV with them?\nDavid Simon: Well, I would say overall, we hope that our relationships with our institutional partners is excellent. And again, it's -- there is very hard to paint a broad brush. I would say by and large, most are very complementary, very happy to be our partner. There's always an asset here or there that may not fit with them long-term, but I would say generally, it's kind of business-as-usual with our institutional investors.\nFloris van Dijkum: Thanks, David.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nLinda Tsai: Hi, good afternoon. On the 300 basis points of signed but not occupied, what does that represent in dollars? What's the timing of that coming online? And would you expect this to compress going into next year?\nBrian McDade: Linda, most of that's going to be back-end weighted to -- there'll be a little bit this year. Most of it will really manifest itself next year just given where we are in the year and how retailers traditionally position their store fleet to get most of it open before we're back-to-school holidays. So most of it is going to be back-end weighted for next year -- front-end weighted for next year, excuse me.\nLinda Tsai: And would this signed but not occupied be down year-on-year at the end of next year from where you sit today?\nBrian McDade: It's really difficult to predict what's going to happen 12 months from now. So it is what it is right now. Ultimately, as we continue to kind of move through, we've seen some consistency in that number and some increase, right? We were talking about it is about 200 basis points a year-ago. So we would see an increase over the past 12 months to get to 300 basis-points.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks. And what's that represent in dollars?\nBrian McDade: I don't have that number in front of me here.\nDavid Simon: Yes, that's usually not something that weren't. That's something we're not going to really disclose because then you add all leases up and annualize the number, but it's a big number.\nLinda Tsai: Great. Thank you.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Muller with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMike Muller: Yes. Hi, David, we're glad you're on the call as well. For the question, TRG's year-over-year base rent growth looks like it was over 8% in the second quarter. Can you talk about what's driving that growth?\nBrian McDade: It's just a mix of the deals that they're doing at the assets they're doing, Michael. So they're doing some better leasing at their better assets and that's really coming through the average rents for that period of time. Not every space is creates equal, not every asset is created equal. So they're seeing great wins at their best assets that have the best pricing. And it's not a small portfolio. So you're getting a bigger percentage. It's a smaller portfolio, a much smaller portfolio than ours. So you're just getting a bigger percentage jump from it.\nMike Muller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. And good to see you sounding better, David. So just curious, if there was a consumer downturn, could you discuss how your portfolio might perform today versus a few years ago? I realize the tenancy might have changed significantly over the years towards less apparel, more services, restaurants or other uses. And trying to look at this from a sales sensitivity standpoint versus maybe a credit sensitivity standpoint, because I can understand those two things might be different.\nDavid Simon: Yes, sure. I'll take a shot at it. So I mean historical recessionary times. And again, we're not in that camp just yet. I mean you call me in two months and we might be. But I would say our NOI cash flow tends to flatten out. It's very obviously there's so many variables that go into it, but I hate still talking about COVID, but we really didn't see other recessions, really didn't see cash-flow from the properties go down, they flattened. I would think not knowing exactly if and what kind of recession it is and how hard and how deep and all that other stuff. It would be hard to give you a number other than to say history would indicate our cash-flow was relatively flat. We weathered pretty nicely because what happens is tends to happen as big-ticket items tend to go in the back-burner and the stuff that we sell at our properties tends to maintain itself. So that would be the best guess at this point, but it is almost impossible without kind of knowing exactly what kind of market that we're in. But again, we're not in that camp yet. And we might be later on in the year or whenever but I would think our cash flows would be relatively flat assuming it's -- you just -- it's hard to say what a typical recession is anymore, but I would say that's probably the best guess at this point.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay, thank you, David.\nDavid Simon: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, again, this has been a very efficient call. I guess maybe on retailer bankruptcies Express and Rue 21 were retailer bankruptcies of 2024 and I'm guessing you have had exposure from a rent perspective to additional smaller ones also that maybe aren't as obvious. So could you comment on how the outcomes of the 2024 bankruptcies on Simon's financials have ended up versus your expectations and then give a broader update on the current watchlist and going forward?\nDavid Simon: Well, I'll just say you know in Brian's remarks, we definitely have a decent impact from the retailer restructurings. I mean, also we have a little lower lease own income, a little lower of land sales than we had budgeted. But if you put those three categories together, it's about $0.15 that we had planned on being there that aren't there this year. So obviously, we factored in the Express restructurings and rule and so on. So those numbers are reflective of our new guidance. It doesn't reflect if there's a material new one coming up, but we don't -- we haven't -- we don't know of anyone that's on the road. So, Brian, you can add whatever you want to add.\nBrian McDade: Yes, watch list continues to be relatively flat. Those things that have happened, we had a thought that they would and it planned ahead. We don't really see much on the horizon at this point. No new additions in the watch-list at this point.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. And then maybe one more if I could. Just the contribution to the portfolio from the retailers. I think your latest comment was for a flattish contribution in 2024. So just wondering if there was any update to that and maybe like your visibility or confidence in the back-half of the year? Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Well, look, I think we continue to work through it. It's -- if you look at that whole, Penney, Sparc, RGG, Jamestown, we basically have around $200 million plus or minus EBITDA in that kind of OPI bucket now that APG is out. And it'll be plus or minus a couple of cents here or there. So because again, we have accounting, we've got lots of depreciation. You don't know that fast and the brands within Sparc, the lower-income consumer continue to fight through a tough market for that consumer. So there's not a lot of new news other than the team at Sparc is working very hard. The new stuff that they're buying is working but it continues to be a very competitive marketplace.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. Thanks.\nDavid Simon: Thank you.\nBrian McDade: Thank you,\nDavid Simon: I think this wraps it up. Let me just say to everybody, thank you. I got a lot of well wishes during this tough time for me and I'm working at it and appreciate all your support and we'll talk in the near future. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, David. Second quarter funds from operations were $1.09 billion or $2.90 per share compared to $1,800 million or $2.88 per share last year. FFO from our real-estate business was $2.93 per share in the second quarter compared to $2.81 in the prior year, a 4.3% growth. Domestic and international operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.12 of growth. As a reminder, the prior year included a non-cash gain of $0.07 from investment activity related to ABG. Domestic NOI increased 5.2% year-over-year for the quarter. Continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered results exceeding our plan for the quarter. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 4.8% for the quarter. Malls and outlet occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 95.6%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year. The mills occupancy was 98.2%. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 3% year-over-year and the mills increased 3.9%. As David mentioned, leasing momentum continued across the portfolio. We signed more than 1,400 leases for approximately 4.8 million square feet in the quarter. Approximately 30% of our leasing activity in the second quarter was new deal volume. Our traffic in the second quarter was up 5% compared to last year. And importantly, total sales volumes increased approximately 2% year-over-year. Reported retailer sales per square foot in the second-quarter was $741 for the mall and premium outlets combined. We hosted our third Annual National Outlet Shopping Day in June, and it was very successful for shoppers and for participating retailers. More than 3 million shoppers visit our premium outlets and mill centers over the shopping weekend. Feedback from shoppers and retailers following the event has been great. Since launching this unique event three years ago, participating retailer and shopping momentum has built each year with more than 475 retailers this year, and we look forward to an even bigger event next year. Our occupancy cost at the end of the second quarter was 12.7%. Turning to new development and redevelopment. We will open our Tulsa premium outlets on August 15th at 100% leased and we will also open a significant expansion at Busan Premium Outlets in South Korea this fall. We also started construction in the quarter on our first phase of a new luxury residential development at Northgate Station. This project will include 234 units and adds other elements that further transforms Northgate into the ultimate live, work, skate, stay and shop destination. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across all platforms in the US and internationally with our share of net cost of $1.1 billion and a blended yield of 8%. Now to the balance sheet. We completed the refinancing of 10 property mortgages during the first half of the year for a total of approximately $1.1 billion, an average rate of 6.36%. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.2 billion of liquidity. Turning to the dividend, today, we announced our dividend of $2.05 per share for the third-quarter, a year-over-year increase of 7.9%. The dividend is payable on September 30th. And now finally for guidance. We are increasing our full-year 2024 guidance range to $12.80 to $12.90 per share compared to $12.51 last year. This is an increase of $0.05 at the bottom end of the range and $0.02 at the midpoint and reflects overcoming approximately $0.15 per share from certain retailer restructurings, lower lease settlement and land sales, land sales income this year. With that, that concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you. David and I are now available for your questions. Hey, Caitlin, it is Brian. I think we're pretty comfortable thinking that we're going to end the year north of 96%. Certainly still a little bit of noise out there, but given the robust demand in the type of environment we're in, we think we're north of 96% by the end of the year. Well, I'd be cautious and that's a pretty good number for us year-end. Tom knows every number, but he's [indiscernible]. So it's a pretty good increase from last year, 95.5. Not that good at that. So maybe there's upside. Yes, Michael. Look, we continue to see pricing power. Roughly rents are similar where we've seen an escalation last year that we talked about rents in the 70s for new deals. That's continuing. And as we find more-and-more retailers and update the mix to drive demand and ultimately drives our pricing power. So there's a recurring premier relative to that. Craig, it's Brian. Look, one day doesn't really change our financing plans for the year. We're sitting on $3.1 billion of cash. We had $1.9 billion in maturities in the back-half of the year. Current plan is still to refinance those out with cash on hand. But to the extent we were to see opportunity to do alternatively or the market opened up with tight spreads, certainly, we could access the market in the back half of the year as well. But no current plans to do so at present. Well, Ron, I think you're seeing broad-based demand across all of our platforms. So it's difficult to kind of give you an individual kind of thumbnail into it. But certainly, we see -- we over-index in our outlet business, certainly towards international towards and that's still very strong for us. That's a driving factor kind of in our outlet business results. But certainly, the retailers are doing business across all three formats. You're going to say the highest occupancy ever. So the demand is broad-based from all retailers across all three major platforms of ours at this point. David, I don't know if you want to add anything? Hey, Haendel, it's Brian. As we think about demand, we've got a signed but not open pipeline of about 300 basis-points. You heard David talk about mix and so we are moving some tenants around. So that's not all just additive. There'll be some coming out-of-the bottom of that for sure. But that's just a further indication of the work that our team has done in demand for space to have 300 basis points signed, but not open pipeline for us. So really, really kind of that defines or kind of really gives you a really good sense of the breadth of what's out there for us as far as demand for space, As you know, we don't update that as we go. We established it at the beginning of the year, and to see that our best to exceed that number which we have thus far. We'll follow-up offline, Vince. Greg, from an international perspective, Greg, last year, we did recognize a one-time performance fee in our McArthurGlen business to some third-party managed capital there. So that did not repeat this year. So that's why you see a decline in that line item. That will normalize itself just by sheer operation going forward. Linda, most of that's going to be back-end weighted to -- there'll be a little bit this year. Most of it will really manifest itself next year just given where we are in the year and how retailers traditionally position their store fleet to get most of it open before we're back-to-school holidays. So most of it is going to be back-end weighted for next year -- front-end weighted for next year, excuse me. It's really difficult to predict what's going to happen 12 months from now. So it is what it is right now. Ultimately, as we continue to kind of move through, we've seen some consistency in that number and some increase, right? We were talking about it is about 200 basis points a year-ago. So we would see an increase over the past 12 months to get to 300 basis-points. I don't have that number in front of me here. It's just a mix of the deals that they're doing at the assets they're doing, Michael. So they're doing some better leasing at their better assets and that's really coming through the average rents for that period of time. Not every space is creates equal, not every asset is created equal. So they're seeing great wins at their best assets that have the best pricing. And it's not a small portfolio. So you're getting a bigger percentage. It's a smaller portfolio, a much smaller portfolio than ours. So you're just getting a bigger percentage jump from it. Yes, watch list continues to be relatively flat. Those things that have happened, we had a thought that they would and it planned ahead. We don't really see much on the horizon at this point. No new additions in the watch-list at this point. Thank you,"

            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "Good evening, everyone. I'm pleased with our financial and operational performance in the second quarter. We are seeing increased leasing volumes, occupancy gains, shopper traffic, and retail sales volumes resulted in the company's highest level of real estate NOI for the second quarter in our company's history. Demand for our space from a broad spectrum of tenants is strong and steady. Our company is focused on creating value through unique and disciplined investment activities that will continue to deliver long-term growth and cash flow, funds from operations and dividends, as you've seen by our recent increase in our dividend per share. And importantly, make our properties better for the communities in which they operate. I'm now going to turn the call over to Brian, who will cover our second quarter results and the full-year guidance in more detail. Thank you, Jeff. Sure, Jeff. This is David. I'll take that. So look, I think we've been pretty consistent for well over a year that the lower-income consumer has been under pressure for quite some time, primarily because of the inflation that's affected them. So that continues to be the case, they are very focused on managing their bills and discretionary expenditures have been obviously not where we'd like to see them. So we're optimistic that we're going to cycle out of that from the lower-end consumer as given the inflation picture that we see now, which is relatively benign. It's way too early, Jeff. We haven't seen a slowdown in the higher-end consumer. Obviously, the market is in an interesting point. We have not seen the wealth impact at all impact that higher-end consumer. So we're still pretty sanguine about it. I think, as you know, we kind of budgeted at the beginning of the year flat sales. We're a little bit above that. So we've got a little bit of cushion. But the higher-end or the better end-consumer, I think is in a good spot. Your liquidity is in a decent spot. So we don't expect anything dramatic. But obviously, they're going to take their cue from now what's going to happen in the overall market and what the employment picture looks like. So in summary, I think we're going to cycle more positive in the lower-end consumer and I think the higher-end consumer steady as she goes currently. Yes, Jeff, you can always ask another question, but Tom Ward has put a pretty tough restriction on people. Thanks, Jeff. Yes, I don't have color on July. We don't really get those numbers until August 20th, which is my birthday by the way, but it's usually 20 days after the month so no early returns on that. So we had a deal committee meeting, Brian, a week ago and what I am told that I don't participate in these because I would probably be disruptive, but what I am told, it was the best new deal committee in we've had ever. So I think what we're seeing is demand and what I said earlier in my opening remarks, demand is strong and steady, not abating. It's really unabated. Obviously, retailers and so we're all sensitive to economic conditions. So as those develop, we have to be sensitive to them. But as we currently speak, we had a great deal committee and the team is working in all cylinders. So that's kind of the news from the front. Sure. I'm sorry, I was just going to add that I think obviously, it's also not just the occupancy number, it's also replacing retailers that aren't performing with better retailers. So it's a mix issue too, which the team is very much focused on. Go ahead, Caitlin. Yes. Thanks. Well, thank you, Alex, for the thoughts. And let me just answer your question. So I frankly think that listen, it sounds like I'm, talking our book, which obviously you would expect us to do, but we have never been better-positioned. So if we do -- so I don't look at the -- that the current uncertainty and even a potential recession no one wants to go through that but given how we're positioned I think we're in an absolute unequivocal position to improve and better our company. So again, we don't want to go through recession, but if we do, the gap between us and everybody else just gets bigger and bigger. Our gap, if you look at kind of where we started three years ago and where we are today, the gap is pretty damn big, it will only get bigger and that's a testament to the team and everybody else. So -- and honestly, I'm not looking at a current potential recession or tough market as any basis to slow down. I look at an example, we just started construction in Northgate, building 234 [projects] (ph). And we expect to do another phase of that probably in the next nine months as we go through the pricing. So from our standpoint, we're not slowing down. And if the economy slows dramatically, the gap between us and just about everybody else will only get bigger and that's -- that gives us opportunities to do some interesting projects. I think the better retailers that are -- we have a number of retailers that are in really good financial standing and I think they take a longer view just like we do. Not everyone, but I would tell you the majority of who we're doing new business with is definitely taking a longer-term view. So they're looking to gain sales and market share as well. So we're certainly not on the defensive into the kind of the turmoil over the last few weeks. And if anything, we'll step up our investment activity, but not foolishly. I mean, we'll do it like we do everything else, but we don't see it as a reason to rain in at this point. Sure. Well, again, occupancy is like any statistic people want. And again, to be clear, we do think we'll increase our occupancy. The bigger opportunity for us is again to continue to increase better than mix. So -- and that drives, obviously the better the mix, the higher the sales, the higher the sales, the more likelihood that you're going to have higher rents. So that's the big focus as we continue to merchandise our properties. Brian, I don't know if you want to add anything to here. Yes. And I would just say, look, we got $11 billion of liquidity, so obviously a lower interest-rate environment does increase our earnings potential. There's all sorts of things associated with a lower interest-rate environment, but by and large, that's beneficial to real estate. So if that's the case, that's going to be better than what we planned initially for this year and what we were thinking for next year. So that's good news in a nutshell. But again, remember, we got -- we're not living, mortgage to mortgage, we're a different kind of company. So we don't have the Holy Toledo, I'm going to say another word, Holy Toledo, we can't refinance this mortgage. So anyway, so -- but by and large, if rates go lower, that's better for this company. Well, it's a good question and that's when I would just say judgment comes into play. I mean we have been as you know, right, because if there was any material, we disclose it. We haven't really done anything external for quite some time and we're going to just be looking at quality stuff where we can add value that's appropriately priced. And up until this point, frankly, we haven't found it. So that doesn't mean that we're discouraged, but we'll keep doing that because that is an element of what this company is good at. And we would like to add quality where we could add value at the right price and if it's not at the right price or if it's not at the right quality, there's just nothing there for us to do. We're not -- we're basically out-of-the portfolio business. So that as far as I can see, I mean things change, but I just don't see us buying another big portfolio that where we'd have to swap off a handful of properties. So we're really going to be selective and -- but again, it's going to be at the right price. And if we can't get it at the right price, then we've got plenty to do and that will keep our liquidity and keep doing what we're doing. Sure. Yes. It's kind of interesting. I just don't think there's like a unique trend, so it's not Florida or Texas, it's not outlets room halls, it's not enclosed versus outdoors, it's really very property-specific and I would say that the quality and the good stuff is getting better and it's almost our traffic which is a good indicator was pretty much across the board. So I think there's no unique -- unlike COVID where when you came out of COVID, it was Florida and Texas kind of the smile states and whatever, I think it's really the -- it's really property-specific. And it's not -- so you could have a great property in X, Y, Z city and a not-so-good one in X, Y, Z city and they're a tale of the two stories. So I really think the -- I really think it's property-specific. And I don't think there's any one particular trend to focus on at least in this quarter. You might have a better sense of it by year-end and see how things shake out, but not right now. Sure. I think it's more -- that's a -- I wish I had an algorithm. I don't, but I'm sure we could get AI to do something for us. I would -- my history would suggest short-term fluctuations mean absolutely nothing. But over time, if you had a down-market for six or nine months, you're going to rein in consumer spending. So I do think it's going to have to take the downward trend or the negative -- the volatility is not going to really impact the consumer in the next short period of time. But if you see it for several months, then I would expect us to see some slowdown in consumer spending. So it does take time to see, but I think that the consumer is used to seeing some volatility and they have some probably built-in gains that they never thought they would have had, right? So when companies get valued in trillions -- I remember when a $50 billion market cap was did, when companies get valued at trillions of dollars, and that's a lot of retail, I hope those retail investors are smart enough to sell and then spend the money in our malls, I mean that would be a good cycle for us, okay? So I think even if these levels were in pretty good shape, if you have a -- if you have kind of a longer downturn, then it's realistic to think that consumer spending is going to be reined in. But offsetting that obviously will be, low inflation, lower interest rates and you can -- you could potentially see a scenario that we dealt with pre-COVID, right? So it's -- if there's a lot of variabilities out there. And -- but I don't think short-term fluctuation is going to have an immediate impact. Yes. Look, I'll -- Brian may have a number. I would just say big-picture, a lot less coming out of COVID, but higher probably than pre-COVID. And so I don't know what perspect that is, Brian, if you don't, well, we could probably give that number to you. But it's certainly a lot less than when we started in COVID, but higher than probably pre-COVID. Thank you. How old are you going to be? No, no, no, not at all. Yes. I would just say our international assets both in Asia and in Europe are pretty much on plan if not a little bit better. So [indiscernible], as you know, reported last week to better results. And they're obviously nicely positioned going forward. And Europe and Asia is some movements in the different countries, Japan having extraordinary growth because of the yuan, a couple of other markets flat. But generally speaking, international -- this got good -- as Brian mentioned, good comp NOI growth this year and pretty much on budget. Sure. Well, let me -- thank you. Let me try to unpack that a little bit, okay? So, for us, let me -- I would say, first of all, L Catterton are very smart investors and Value Retail is a unique structure. So I don't think you can look through their investment that was at a significant discount to NAV to get to a cap rate without really having intimate inside knowledge which you or I don't have, okay? But they're very smart investors and I don't think this is a -- so that's the first point I'd like to make just on that question. Second is I think, again, it depends on what brands you're talking about, whether it's luxury or higher-end or whatever, a better moderate. Every retailer is different, everyone's looking to increase their sales and every brand is different. So it's you cannot paint a luxury investor by one broad stroke. So and even within some of the larger groups, their brands are different. You may have one brand growing, one shrinking, what have you? I don't expect, and again L Catterton is also owned by the principals of Catterton. So it's not just the group. I don't think there is a trend for them to suddenly invest, got some money in retail real estate, but I could be wrong. And I think it really depends on each brand and what their strategy is. Well, I would say overall, we hope that our relationships with our institutional partners is excellent. And again, it's -- there is very hard to paint a broad brush. I would say by and large, most are very complementary, very happy to be our partner. There's always an asset here or there that may not fit with them long-term, but I would say generally, it's kind of business-as-usual with our institutional investors. Sure. Yes, that's usually not something that weren't. That's something we're not going to really disclose because then you add all leases up and annualize the number, but it's a big number. Thank you. Yes, sure. I'll take a shot at it. So I mean historical recessionary times. And again, we're not in that camp just yet. I mean you call me in two months and we might be. But I would say our NOI cash flow tends to flatten out. It's very obviously there's so many variables that go into it, but I hate still talking about COVID, but we really didn't see other recessions, really didn't see cash-flow from the properties go down, they flattened. I would think not knowing exactly if and what kind of recession it is and how hard and how deep and all that other stuff. It would be hard to give you a number other than to say history would indicate our cash-flow was relatively flat. We weathered pretty nicely because what happens is tends to happen as big-ticket items tend to go in the back-burner and the stuff that we sell at our properties tends to maintain itself. So that would be the best guess at this point, but it is almost impossible without kind of knowing exactly what kind of market that we're in. But again, we're not in that camp yet. And we might be later on in the year or whenever but I would think our cash flows would be relatively flat assuming it's -- you just -- it's hard to say what a typical recession is anymore, but I would say that's probably the best guess at this point. Sure. Well, I'll just say you know in Brian's remarks, we definitely have a decent impact from the retailer restructurings. I mean, also we have a little lower lease own income, a little lower of land sales than we had budgeted. But if you put those three categories together, it's about $0.15 that we had planned on being there that aren't there this year. So obviously, we factored in the Express restructurings and rule and so on. So those numbers are reflective of our new guidance. It doesn't reflect if there's a material new one coming up, but we don't -- we haven't -- we don't know of anyone that's on the road. So, Brian, you can add whatever you want to add. Well, look, I think we continue to work through it. It's -- if you look at that whole, Penney, Sparc, RGG, Jamestown, we basically have around $200 million plus or minus EBITDA in that kind of OPI bucket now that APG is out. And it'll be plus or minus a couple of cents here or there. So because again, we have accounting, we've got lots of depreciation. You don't know that fast and the brands within Sparc, the lower-income consumer continue to fight through a tough market for that consumer. So there's not a lot of new news other than the team at Sparc is working very hard. The new stuff that they're buying is working but it continues to be a very competitive marketplace. Thank you. I think this wraps it up. Let me just say to everybody, thank you. I got a lot of well wishes during this tough time for me and I'm working at it and appreciate all your support and we'll talk in the near future. Thank you."

For those who would like to participate in the question-and-answer session, we ask that you please respect our request to limit yourself to 1 question.\n I'm pleased to introduce David Simon. \nDavid Simon: Good evening. We're off to a good start with results that exceeded our plan. First quarter funds from operation were $1.33 billion or $3.56 per share compared to $1.03 billion or $2.74 per share last year. Let me walk you through some highlights for this quarter compared to Q1 of '23. Domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.09 of growth driven by higher rental income. Gains from investment activity in the first quarter were approximately $0.75 higher year-over-year. OPI had a $0.02 after-tax lower contribution compared to last year.\n Funds from operation from our real estate business was $2.91 per share in the first quarter compared to $2.82 in the prior year period, a 3.2% growth rate. Domestic property NOI increased 3.7% year-over-year. We have continued leasing momentum. Resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered these results that were above our plan for the first quarter.\n Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.9% for the quarter. NOI from OPI in the first quarter includes a $33 million charge in one-time restructuring charges at SPARC and JCPenney. Excluding these one-time charges and a bargain purchase gain from Reebok transaction last year, NOI from OPI improved $5 million year-over-year and was on plan for the quarter. Remember, these retailers are on a fiscal year end of January 31, and the charges were part of the year-end closing process. They were not budgeted.\n Mall occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 95.5%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Mills was 97.7%. Average base minimum rent for our malls and outlets increased 3% year-over-year and at The Mills, 3.8% increase. Leasing momentum continued. As I mentioned, we signed more than 1,300 leases for approximately 6.3 million square feet. Approximately 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We are approximately 65% complete with our 24 lease expirations, and we continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community.\n Retail sales volume across the portfolio increased 2.3% for the first quarter compared to last year. Our tourist-oriented properties outperformed the portfolio average in the quarter with a 6% increase in sales. Reported retail sales per square foot in the first quarter was $745 a foot for our outlets and malls combined, which was flat year-over-year, excluding 2 retailers. Retail sales per square foot from our premium outlet platform reached an all-time high this quarter. Occupancy costs at the end of the first quarter was 12.6%.\n Now, let me talk about other platform investments, affectionately known as OPI. We sold our remaining interest in Authentic Brands Group during the first quarter for gross proceeds of close to $1.2 billion and recorded a pretax and after-tax gain of $415 million and $311 million, respectively.\n The sale in the first quarter, combined with the sale in the fourth quarter, yielded gross proceeds of $1.45 billion. We generated substantial value from the ABG investment and a 7x multiple on our net invested capital during our short ownership period. As a result of the sale of ABG and the restructuring charges that I mentioned earlier, one-time in nature at SPARC and Penney in the first quarter, we now expect FFO contribution from OPI to be around breakeven this year compared to the initial guidance of $0.10 to $0.15. For your reference, we budgeted the -- at OPI, the FFO from ABG around $0.08 per share, so roughly half of that was associated with ABG.\n Now moving on to new development and redevelopment. We opened an AC Hotel at St. Johns Center. We are opening Tulsa Premium Outlets this summer. Leasing is going great, and we have a significant expansion at Busan Premium Outlets in South Korea this fall. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across our platforms in the U.S. and internationally as well with our share of net cost of $930 million at a blended yield of 8%.\n We expect to start construction on additional projects in the next few months, including just shortly, our residential project at Northgate Station in Seattle. What's interesting for us is we're able to build when others need to rely on construction lending market, which is, as you might imagine, very difficult right now. We expect our starts to be around $500 million this year.\n Now, on our balance sheet, we retired $600 million of senior notes in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.2 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced our dividend of $2 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 8.1%. The dividend is payable on June 28. And given the transactions for this quarter and our results for this quarter, our current view for the remainder of the year, we're increasing the full range of our full year guidance of 2024 in the guidance range of $11.85 to $12 -- I'm sorry, let me restate that. We're increasing our range to $12.75 to $12.90 per share compared to $12.51 last year. This is an increase of $0.90 at the bottom end of the range and $0.85 at the midpoint.\n Needless to say, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results, and our business and tenant demand continues to remain strong. Despite a cloudy macro environment, occupancy is increasing, property NOI is growing. We made a significant profit on our ABG investment, and everything is kind of moving in all the right directions.\n Thank you. We're ready for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. \nCaitlin Burrows: Congrats on the solid quarter operationally and execution on the ABG sale. I guess there have been news reports that you could get involved in Express. So whether it's related to Express that's Simon's strategy going forward, can you give some insight to your current thinking on having ownership in brands, what type of terms are attractive to you and how you balance that with the potential earnings volatility? \nDavid Simon: Well, no one likes earnings volatility unless it's volatility in the right direction, okay? So Caitlin, thank you for the comments to start. But that's -- I don't like volatility either. Listen, on Express, we were approached by the IP owner. I think it's not overly complicated in the sense that they saw what we had done historically, both with ABG and SPARC and offered us to participate with no capital, but also add our expertise and our knowledge in what we've been -- what we've done in the past with SPARC. And because we have always valued Express as a retailer and as a client, we jumped at the opportunity. So we don't expect it -- we expect to be -- it's got to go through bankruptcy process, and that's out of our control. But if WHP does end up getting it, we'd be pleased to participate in the turnaround of Express.\n And again, we don't expect any capital as part of that participation. So when we get opportunities like that, we evaluate it, we look at the brand and the value of the brand. In this case, we're comfortable that Express is a good company, and it's a great brand and we can add value to it. And given the fact that we were able to hopefully turn around the retailers, save jobs, create value from our investment, it's -- we see it as a win-win situation with no capital from our standpoint. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America. \nElizabeth Yang Doykan: This is Lizzy Doykan on for Jeff. I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the key drivers of retailer sales as we started the year. And it seems like there's been some good outperformance from -- driven by especially your tourism-driven centers. So I'm just wondering how much that has been a factor into the first quarter of this year and how much upside there is remaining from tourism. \nDavid Simon: Sure. We feel very bullish on our portfolio in general. And then obviously, our tourist centers, especially in California and in the Northeast are starting to finally see the improvement that we have been seeing for quite some time in Florida. And Florida continues to be an unbelievably strong market as well. So we're finally seeing California, Northeast pick up. Obviously, the strong dollar vis-a-vis certain currency does have an effect, kind of an inhibitor effect. But even with that said, domestic tourism continues to excel.\n And I think people, at the end of the day, they as part of -- when they go on holiday, they love shopping as part of that experience, dining, shopping, being with their families. And as I said earlier, I mean, we feel like the mall has made a big comeback, physical stores or where it's happening. We're seeing a resurgence and reinvigoration of that whole product.\n So we're pleased it's kind of where we're seeing things. So certainly, the lower income consumer has been under pressure now for quite some time. We're very focused on that. Obviously, inflation has taken its toll. And even though inflation is moderating, the prices that the lower income consumers dealing with are quite daunting. So we'll continue to see volatility in that area, we anticipate.\n We're hoping that their cost of living moderates and to some extent their wages go up or their cost of living goes down, so we can see more discretionary income there. The higher-income consumer continues to spend and visits our properties, and it's good. And as a good example of that is our traffic for the first quarter, I think, was up around 2% for the year, right, guys? \nUnknown Executive: Yes. \nDavid Simon: So that's also a very good sign. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Evercore. \nSamir Khanal: David, Brian, you provided a same-store guide of at least 3% last quarter. I guess, how do you feel about that guide today? You're doing 3.7% in the first quarter. Clearly, leasing has been strong, but we've also seen some announcements from Express, Route 21. I guess how do you feel about that guide today? \nDavid Simon: Yes. Look, we don't update that, as you probably know. I think you know. We don't -- that's our goal for the year. We don't update it every quarter as some others might. But we still feel like that's -- even though we've got some -- unanticipated to some extent, I mean, we do create bogeys on our rental income stream on retailers that we do feel might come under pressure in the year. So we do have kind of adjustments in our budgeting process dealing with those. We still feel like our initial guidance on that is very achievable. So we don't update it every quarter, but if we didn't feel like we could achieve it, I think we would highlight that. But we don't see that even with some of the -- I mean, we might not overachieve, as we always want to, but I think we can still deliver the initial guidance. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. \nRonald Kamdem: Great. Just a quick one on the $500 million development starts, if you could just talk about sort of the opportunities there? And do you sort of still see opportunities to go on offense on sort of the mall space given that fundamentals are coming back and that there is going to be peers looking to sell assets? Are there opportunities and appetite to go on offense on sort of buying more assets? \nDavid Simon: Sure. I think we've seen rates more or less stabilized now. There was a volatility prior to that where it was hard to predict. Now, we're not anticipating a reduction in rates, but at least we feel like we're at a more or less a stable rate environment. That makes it easier to make investment decisions, so I would break it up into 2 buckets. The first bucket being our redevelopment effort, and most of that, frankly, is mixed use in our properties, and we feel very bullish on that.\n Remember, you're talking about bringing on -- if it's a 2- to 3-year process, you're talking about bringing on product in 2 to 3 years, not going to be any supply. We do a very good job of understanding the supply and demand. The new better product always wins. So we are unabated in our mixed use, and we'll be doing some multifamily development, both in Brea in Orange County, and as I mentioned, we just signed our GMP at Northgate Station to build about 300 units as part of that whole redevelopment.\n So that really goes unabated, that when you get to the external new deal environment, I would say, we have a lot of opportunities ahead of us. And I think our job is just to prioritize, make sure we're valuing the opportunities, right, and we don't take our eye off the ball with what we're doing with our existing portfolio.\n So long story short, I probably would venture to say that there could be more external opportunities for us. But again, it's got to be great quality at a fair price and have assets where we think our expertise can add cash flow growth to them. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. \nMichael Goldsmith: David, you highlighted the health of the consumer. It seems like doing all right or managing through the environment. Just given your positioning, the occupancy gains and the pricing power that you have, if there was some sort of macro slowdown, do you think -- how do you think you would be able to navigate it or, maybe said another way, do you think the business has become a little bit less macro-sensitive as you -- as there's been consolidation and you've kind of become the place where you've reached consumers in that luxury space? \nDavid Simon: Sure. Look, we are -- make no mistake about it, we are not immune to macro -- the macro environment. So we would have to deal with it, both from -- if it ultimately led to less consumer spending and more retail client stress. We're not immune to it. However, and this is a big -- the big underlying from my standpoint, I have always felt like we've done our best work when others are dealing with the macro environment. \n So -- and as I mentioned, we have $11 billion of liquidity, in our comments earlier. So I think when and if -- and frankly, I mean, it's realistic to assume we may go through a reasonable slowdown here coming up. I think that's when we do our best work. That's when others get tired and throw in the towel. That's where we get rejuvenated. Hopefully, we're rejuvenated now, but this is when we really get motivated.\n And as I think back, and I have had the luxury of being in the spot for 30 years, I think we do our very best work when the times get tough. So I'm not wishing that on us or anyone, but it's a realistic probability. We won't be immune for it, but I think we'll further separate this company from our peers. So that I know, that I have 100% confidence in that. If that does happen, we'll have further separation. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. \nAlexander Goldfarb: David, I just want to go back to Caitlin's question. In response to the retailers, you said that it brings a lot of volatility. Obviously, we all like volatility in the right way. But you can't deny that you guys have made a ton. I guess I could use a French word to describe the ton, but you guys have made a ton of money, billions from these retailer investments. Yes, they are volatile, but they've been lucrative. So I just want to get a better sense, is the express model sort of a future where you guys will participate if you put in no capital? Or just trying to understand how you weigh the money that you've made versus the short term or the quarterly earnings volatility because clearly, it's been a source of success for you. \nDavid Simon: Yes. That's -- it's interesting, Alex. It's a very good question. And I think, honestly, we really focus on -- to the extent we do put in fresh capital, we -- in addition to understanding what it means for our overall business, and the totality of our company, it's also absolutely driven by return on investment, just like building a new shopping center.\n And again, yes, we have volatility, but in the scheme of things, again, and the fact that we've made money, I hope most folks are understanding that the volatility is really on the margin. And I'll just give you a good example. And again, we take -- FFO, as you know, is net income plus depreciation. Well, the contribution we get from our retailers is net income, which is fully burdened by depreciation, so there's no add back. \n But to give you a simple analysis on just ABG as an example. So we cleared $1.450 billion of cash. And that produced about $0.08 of earnings because we just picked up our share of net income. We only got -- we only as a shareholder, they are only -- we only would get tax distribution. It's a subchapter as essentially. So we'd only get our tax distributions, which amounted to $2 million a quarter. So that's $8 million. And if you take the $1.450 billion and you invested in a bank at 5.5%, that's $70 million. So we went from $8 million in cash flow to $70 million, just selling that.\n So we look at every aspect of it, pretax, after-tax, what does it mean to the portfolio, what is -- we don't want volatility, but we'll have -- we'll certainly accept it if we think it's going to be a good investment. And it all kind of goes into the analysis. We understand the market is not thrilled with it. So we try to also do it in a way that really does not make it the store. It is on the margin, and it will always be on the margin. But we do think we can add value to the enterprise by some of these investments.\n And each investment is so idiosyncratic that it's hard to say -- again, if Express happens, it's hard to say that, that's the new model because -- I don't know that I can say that, I think every one of these things is somewhat idiosyncratic, but we do have the opportunity to do more than lease space in Alabama someplace. That's what this company is all about, we do more -- we're in South Korea, we're in Jakarta, we're building in Tulsa, we're building apartments in Seattle.\n So -- I mean I'm waxing a little bit here, but I -- we think of ourselves broader than I think the market thinks of us, that's incumbent upon us. And I think our disclosures have gotten better over time. I hope you read, Alex, on OPI, so you could see it, not to track from real estate, but at the same time, we're somewhat different than when you line us up to others that do some of what we do. \nAlexander Goldfarb: And that was the point that you guys have this special thing. It's sort of like Kimco has their retailer unique thing, and it would be a shame to do away with it if it was just volatility because clearly, it's made you a lot of cash. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. \nNicholas Joseph: It's Nick Joseph here with Craig. David, I just wanted to ask on kind of the opportunity and -- to roll out additional luxury, either VIP suites or retailers, we saw what you did at Woodbury. And I'm just curious on the opportunity for the remainder of the portfolio and what kind of demand do you think that will drive from some of these higher income clientele that you're seeking. \nDavid Simon: Listen, I think we've got a great portfolio of real estate that is focused on the very high income consumer. And I think we need to step up our game in all the services that need to be provided to that consumer. And I think Woodbury, Sawgrass are just the beginning of an effort to really -- I can't think of the right word, but really entertain that consumer to make it really special. And it's all the services that they're accustomed to, it's the fine dining, it's the ease of access, it's right -- having the right retailer mix. \n So we probably have around 20 to 25 properties that are -- that have this high -- our centers are really big, so they obviously appeal to a broader range of consumers, which is the way we like it because -- that's also you diversify the ebbs and flows. But that -- but those 20, 25 centers really need special attention. We've got a great team that's dedicated to them. And in many cases, we're the preferred or certainly a meaningful landlord to the best retailers in the world. And we want to -- we definitely want to stay in that spot. So a big push for us to step up our game when it's dealing with the very high-end consumer on all sorts of levels.\n And so I think what happens at Sawgrass with the Oasis and The Colonnade and what already happens at Woodbury, but we're just stepping up our game, will happen at Houston and King of Prussia. And if you saw what we did at Phipps in Atlanta and what's going on at Boca Raton in Florida, just to name a few that jump out at me, is really, really a high priority for the company. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. \nFloris Gerbrand van Dijkum: David, I was going to ask you about luxury, but I was pipped so instead I'm going to ask you about capital recycling. Presumably, your guidance -- I mean, you just -- you've cleared $1.2 billion on the ABG sale, sitting there in cash. And obviously, you do have some ongoing development, but that was essentially funded from your retained cash flow, if you will. So the guidance assumes that is that cash sits there uninvested essentially for the rest of the year? Or is there further upside, I guess, is what I'm getting at if you were to do something else with that cash and to redeploy that into higher-yielding investments? \nDavid Simon: Yes. Very good question. In fact, we cleared in 2 months $1.450 billion, as you know, Floris. So I just wanted to mention that. But yes, right now, our guidance just assume it sits in the bank and/or pays down debt. But that's basically it. So no really -- no real redeployment is contemplated in our numbers at this point.\n Brian, if you want to add anything? \nBrian McDade: Yes. No, that's right. We've just assumed that we would hold the cash for the time being. And we have debt maturities coming due here in September and October. And so we could use the cash on hand to fund that. We also were carrying cash from our activities -- from our capital markets activities last year. So the combination of it will address our upcoming maturities. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. \nVince Tibone: Could you elaborate on the charges taken in the first quarter related to SPARC and JCPenney? And then possibly related to that, kind of what is your near-term outlook in terms of JCPenney store closures, just given foot traffic trends in recent years has not been great? So just curious how long you think the current store count and fleet is sustainable? \nDavid Simon: Yes. The charges pretax were $33 million, so not -- most -- it's kind of funny -- because you know most charges were in the hundreds of millions of dollars, so -- yes, I think you have to put it in perspective. But with that said, it really dealt with personnel and inventory. So that were the 2 primary factors and more really on the inventory side because we had some clearance of inventory that in SPARC it was really focused on F21 and Penney just on basically clearing out some inventory. \n So Penney -- we're pleased with Penney. I'll just talk a moment about the store closings. They're very interesting. They don't -- Penney is able to produce positive EBITDA even if there's no -- not high sales, I think they do out of the box. So I don't really -- in fact, I think Penney always can be a beneficiary opening new stores as opposed to closing stores. I'm sure there will be a few here and there, but most all of their stores are positive EBITDA. And so they have a very good way of having positive EBITDA out of what I call low-volume stores.\n And again, this is what's interesting to us, Penney is not public. So you know what matters to me, Vince, cash flow, EBITDA and that, obviously, sales -- comp sales are important, right? But as long as we're profitable out of the stores, there's no Wall Street pressure that we've got to narrow the store count. I don't necessarily believe shrink to grow. It's very hard to achieve. Maybe you can achieve it. It's -- my history, not overly long, but long enough, it's -- I don't care what industry, it's very hard to do. Some have done it, but the -- but to me, if it's that positive EBITDA, there's nothing wrong with maintaining that store for the community.\n You certainly don't want to lower standards of how you operate it, but if you can create cash flow, doesn't necessarily mean you have to reinvest that much in it, and you can use that cash flow to reinvest in other elements of your business. So I don't anticipate -- long story short, I really don't anticipate much portfolio real estate activity at the JCP level. \nVince Tibone: That's really helpful color. Maybe just as a quick follow-up on that. I'm just curious, given the ownership structure, I mean are you guys able to pursue recapturing some of these boxes at your best properties to unlock mixed-use development opportunities? Or how would that work given your foot ownership with Brookfield? \nDavid Simon: Yes. Well, look, I think as part of the deal originally -- first of all, our relationship with Brookfield is excellent in our -- we both basically -- and ABG is an investor in there as well, but we very much see eye-to-eye on JCPenney and how it operates and how we should operate it. And I would say both of us, and now, my memory is a little bit cloudy, but when we did the restructuring, we did get -- both of us got the opportunity to reclaim certain space from JCPenney that we could redevelop it.\n So it's a good question. And the fact is we are about to embark upon, one, that you'll see an announcement in the near future where we are going to ultimately redevelop a JCPenney at one of our centers. So I don't remember the exact count. I don't remember exactly how much Brookfield, but as part of the bankruptcy process and negotiation with each other, we did give each other the right to do that. And so what happens there is we get notice to the company, it's already documented, then we get the -- we -- and we can -- in this case, it's a lease. So there's nothing to pay. We just cancel the lease.\n Now, obviously, store is a little bit profitable, very profitable for JCPenney. So we're going to have to find them some new opportunities to make up for it, but that's all part of the deal. So I think there'll be a handful like that, both from us and Brookfield that we'll be able to do. But -- and again, that was all prenegotiated. To the extent that there's one that wasn't part of that negotiation, that's pretty -- given our relationship with Brookfield, pretty straightforward, we come up with a value or they come up with a value. Obviously, the JCPenney management team would have to be part of that. And they would get the appropriate value to redevelop that project. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. \nJuan Sanabria: Just hoping to ask about the watchlist or bad debt. I believe you said you had assumed 25 basis points last quarter. Has that changed now at all? And if so, maybe if you could break out the Express impact. And in your prepared comments, you talked about sales on a per-square-foot basis being flat, stripping out 2 tenants. Just curious on the color of why those 2 tenants were stripped out, if there's any interesting development? \nDavid Simon: Yes. Let me answer that. I think the 2 tenants -- I mean, even if we didn't -- I think it's just color for you to know that generally, the portfolio was flat. We don't like to name tenants, so we don't focus on it. I'd also, I think, point out to you, the most important thing we look is total volume, and we were up quarter-over-quarter. What was the number again? 2.3%. That's really the number we look at. And again, remember, these are reported sales. We can get into this whole diatribe about some of the retailers credit their sales with Internet returns. So it's just information, okay? Do what you want with it, but it's just information.\n But our sales, if you include the 2 retailers, the last 12 months was down 1.8% on a rolling 12 basis. But total, because not all those are comp total, was up 2.3%, which is the more important number. Now, we'd also -- just to -- and Brian can add in here. Now that I'm talking I might as well just finish. We don't -- as part of our discussion, we don't -- we'll never get into a retailer-specific response.\n But obviously, bankruptcy for tenants has a lot of -- a lot goes on, leases have to be rejected and depending on where they were on that and what happens. So we -- in our comp NOI, we have our bad debt expense. I think I gave you some color. We still feel like it's achievable. So -- but again, I don't think, and Brian can add, we're not going to really give you a color too much on Express, but we do put in -- when we model our business for the year, we do put in unforeseen circumstances. And we try to budget appropriately for retailers that are under pressure. In this case, we kind of knew Express was in that spot. But a lot remains to be seen how Express comes out of bankruptcy and the ultimate financial impact. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. \nHaendel St. Juste: A quick 2-part here. First, I wanted to follow up on Floris' question on the uses for the cash on the retail monetization. The stock is $35 or so higher than what you lost back, so I assume it's fair -- that it's fair to assume that buying back stock is less likely here. And are there any special dividends that need to be paid on that game?\n And then my second part of the question is we noticed that the TRG property count dropped to 18 properties versus 20 last quarter, what happened there? \nDavid Simon: I'll let Brian, you can -- I hope you can answer all these. I expect you to... \nBrian McDade: I can. With respect to TRG, there were 2 properties. One was a partner buying out our interest, so the property count went down by 2 in the quarter. With respect to... \nDavid Simon: Tell him the 2. \nBrian McDade: Fair Oaks and Country Club are the 2 assets that when -- the partner is buying us out or bought us out. With respect to capital on the balance sheet, certainly, it's a capital allocation decision relative to stock buyback. But we -- with the amount of capital that we are generating, both free cash flow and what's on our balance sheet, it is still an appropriate use of capital throughout the balance of the year and would expect that we would have interest in buying back our stock at certain levels. \nDavid Simon: Yes. And I would just add to that, the ABG sale happened, I don't remember exactly, but near quarter end. And we were blacked out from that because of Q1 earnings. So I wouldn't read that the fact that it's sitting on the balance sheet to read too much into that. \nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Appreciate that. And the special dividend, anything on that front... \nBrian McDade: There is no required special dividend. These were -- this interest was owned in our taxable REIT subsidiaries. So there will be a tax, actual payment due, not actually a special dividend. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. \nLinda Yu Tsai: A 2-parter. I appreciate the fact that you won't provide capital to Express, but could you just give more color on how you would be providing assistance to the brand? \nDavid Simon: Well, I think obviously, there is a couple of elements, the first -- the most important one is that we have the history of running a retailer coming out of bankruptcy. So I think -- for better or worse, I think it's better, but others may not agree with me. There's a certain expertise in doing that, and we've -- we had. And I think what our potential partner sees on that is that, that we can bring to the table. So I wouldn't underestimate that. That's one.\n Number two is, as part of any bankruptcy, we're going to have a lease negotiation. Some leases will get restructured, some won't. Some will pay what the existing rent is and so on, so -- but that happens regardless of whether or not we're involved or not. So that's just part of the bankruptcy process. We go space by space and find out -- we kind of find out what we'd like to do, maybe short-term leases, so on and so forth, but that -- but we're not alone in that. Any other landlord will have to come to their own conclusion on what they want to do, if part of rent adjustment is necessary to get the brand on solid financial footing. \nLinda Yu Tsai: And do you have any clarity on the store closures at all, because one of your much smaller peers expects to close 65% of its stores in 2Q? \nDavid Simon: We are not involved in that process. That's really management. So I have no point of view or no opinion on that at all. That whole process is part of -- we really won't get involved until we're approved as the stalking horse bidder. So that -- all that's going on today with the depth and everything else is all part of -- it's all the existing management team. We have no involvement in that whatsoever. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. \nHong Zhang: It's Hong on for Mike. I guess I was wondering, can you give us an idea of where -- of what kind of CAGRs you're seeing most of the demand from in your malls? Is it -- I'm just wondering if it's broad-based and/or how much of it is apparel versus the other categories? \nDavid Simon: Honestly, it's across the board, restaurants, entertainment, athleisure, sports-related -- it's the bigger boxes, the UNIQLOs, Primarks of the world, Zara. It is -- this is where I give a shout-out to Rick as he used to go through it. But we're seeing it -- Abercrombie were doing a lot of new opportunities with Mango, Golden Goose, just to name a few; KnitWell, JD Sports, Alo, Lululemons growing with us, upsizing a lot of properties. Our House is a great company that we're doing business with, pinstripes, number of restaurants, restaurant tours. It's very, very, very encouraging because it's so diverse. \nHong Zhang: Got it. If I could sneak 1 other question. And I guess the $745 square foot sales, is that portfolio weighted or NOI weighted? \nDavid Simon: Portfolio weighted. I'm sorry, just portfolio, pure. If it was NOI weighted, where we used to do that, it's like $950 -- higher. \nBrian McDade: $950 plus or minus, basically. \nDavid Simon: Okay. $950, thereabouts. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. \nGreg McGinniss: David, just on looking at the volatility of the retail investments, what are the drivers to keep SPARC and JCPenney on balance sheet as opposed to the ABG investments? And would you look to sell those in the near future? \nDavid Simon: Well, again, they're equity accounted, so they're really not on our balance sheet just to make us clearer. So they're investments in them. Listen, they are -- we built a company where everything is core and nothing is core. So we saw ABG, we got an offer, we hit the bid. I would view that for any and all assets that we have, whether it's JCPenney, SPARC, XYZ mall. Call Uncle David and not -- most people don't hit my bid, but the only thing that's core is the company and its people and its balance sheet, but every other assets were sale at the right price, so nothing is critical long term. \n And again, look, guys, we're talking about volatility, and the reality is the volatility has been mostly on the upside. And again, we're a company that earns $12, and we're talking about $0.10 here or there. So I just want to put everything more or less in perspective. But there's nothing that I wouldn't sell at the right price across the company and worldwide, period, end of story. Because -- and it's very simple. You know why? I think because if we got the cash, I know we would find an appropriate investment that would replace the earnings lost, it's really that simple, or we give it to the shareholders or we buy our stock back. So I am at the point of the highest level of indifference about monetizing an asset as you'll see. \nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. David Simon for any closing comments. \nDavid Simon: Okay. Thank you. Sorry, we -- I know it's the end of earnings season, we're always late in the Q1 because we tie it to our annual meeting next -- on Wednesday. But thank you for your interest and your questions, very good questions. Appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

And so we could use the cash on hand to fund that. We also were carrying cash from our activities -- from our capital markets activities last year. So the combination of it will address our upcoming maturities. I can. With respect to TRG, there were 2 properties. One was a partner buying out our interest, so the property count went down by 2 in the quarter. With respect to... Fair Oaks and Country Club are the 2 assets that when -- the partner is buying us out or bought us out.

            "name": "David Simon",
            "content": "Good evening. We're off to a good start with results that exceeded our plan. First quarter funds from operation were $1.33 billion or $3.56 per share compared to $1.03 billion or $2.74 per share last year. Let me walk you through some highlights for this quarter compared to Q1 of '23. Domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.09 of growth driven by higher rental income. Gains from investment activity in the first quarter were approximately $0.75 higher year-over-year. OPI had a $0.02 after-tax lower contribution compared to last year.\n Funds from operation from our real estate business was $2.91 per share in the first quarter compared to $2.82 in the prior year period, a 3.2% growth rate. Domestic property NOI increased 3.7% year-over-year. We have continued leasing momentum. Resilient consumer spending and operational excellence delivered these results that were above our plan for the first quarter.\n Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency, grew 3.9% for the quarter. NOI from OPI in the first quarter includes a $33 million charge in one-time restructuring charges at SPARC and JCPenney. Excluding these one-time charges and a bargain purchase gain from Reebok transaction last year, NOI from OPI improved $5 million year-over-year and was on plan for the quarter. Remember, these retailers are on a fiscal year end of January 31, and the charges were part of the year-end closing process. They were not budgeted.\n Mall occupancy at the end of the first quarter was 95.5%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to the prior year. Mills was 97.7%. Average base minimum rent for our malls and outlets increased 3% year-over-year and at The Mills, 3.8% increase. Leasing momentum continued. As I mentioned, we signed more than 1,300 leases for approximately 6.3 million square feet. Approximately 25% of our leasing activity in the first quarter was new deal volume. We are approximately 65% complete with our 24 lease expirations, and we continue to see strong broad-based demand from the retail community.\n Retail sales volume across the portfolio increased 2.3% for the first quarter compared to last year. Our tourist-oriented properties outperformed the portfolio average in the quarter with a 6% increase in sales. Reported retail sales per square foot in the first quarter was $745 a foot for our outlets and malls combined, which was flat year-over-year, excluding 2 retailers. Retail sales per square foot from our premium outlet platform reached an all-time high this quarter. Occupancy costs at the end of the first quarter was 12.6%.\n Now, let me talk about other platform investments, affectionately known as OPI. We sold our remaining interest in Authentic Brands Group during the first quarter for gross proceeds of close to $1.2 billion and recorded a pretax and after-tax gain of $415 million and $311 million, respectively.\n The sale in the first quarter, combined with the sale in the fourth quarter, yielded gross proceeds of $1.45 billion. We generated substantial value from the ABG investment and a 7x multiple on our net invested capital during our short ownership period. As a result of the sale of ABG and the restructuring charges that I mentioned earlier, one-time in nature at SPARC and Penney in the first quarter, we now expect FFO contribution from OPI to be around breakeven this year compared to the initial guidance of $0.10 to $0.15. For your reference, we budgeted the -- at OPI, the FFO from ABG around $0.08 per share, so roughly half of that was associated with ABG.\n Now moving on to new development and redevelopment. We opened an AC Hotel at St. Johns Center. We are opening Tulsa Premium Outlets this summer. Leasing is going great, and we have a significant expansion at Busan Premium Outlets in South Korea this fall. At the end of the quarter, new development and redevelopment projects were underway across our platforms in the U.S. and internationally as well with our share of net cost of $930 million at a blended yield of 8%.\n We expect to start construction on additional projects in the next few months, including just shortly, our residential project at Northgate Station in Seattle. What's interesting for us is we're able to build when others need to rely on construction lending market, which is, as you might imagine, very difficult right now. We expect our starts to be around $500 million this year.\n Now, on our balance sheet, we retired $600 million of senior notes in the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately $11.2 billion of liquidity. Today, we announced our dividend of $2 per share for the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 8.1%. The dividend is payable on June 28. And given the transactions for this quarter and our results for this quarter, our current view for the remainder of the year, we're increasing the full range of our full year guidance of 2024 in the guidance range of $11.85 to $12 -- I'm sorry, let me restate that. We're increasing our range to $12.75 to $12.90 per share compared to $12.51 last year. This is an increase of $0.90 at the bottom end of the range and $0.85 at the midpoint.\n Needless to say, I'm very pleased with our first quarter results, and our business and tenant demand continues to remain strong. Despite a cloudy macro environment, occupancy is increasing, property NOI is growing. We made a significant profit on our ABG investment, and everything is kind of moving in all the right directions.\n Thank you. We're ready for questions. Well, no one likes earnings volatility unless it's volatility in the right direction, okay? So Caitlin, thank you for the comments to start. But that's -- I don't like volatility either. Listen, on Express, we were approached by the IP owner. I think it's not overly complicated in the sense that they saw what we had done historically, both with ABG and SPARC and offered us to participate with no capital, but also add our expertise and our knowledge in what we've been -- what we've done in the past with SPARC. And because we have always valued Express as a retailer and as a client, we jumped at the opportunity. So we don't expect it -- we expect to be -- it's got to go through bankruptcy process, and that's out of our control. But if WHP does end up getting it, we'd be pleased to participate in the turnaround of Express.\n And again, we don't expect any capital as part of that participation. So when we get opportunities like that, we evaluate it, we look at the brand and the value of the brand. In this case, we're comfortable that Express is a good company, and it's a great brand and we can add value to it. And given the fact that we were able to hopefully turn around the retailers, save jobs, create value from our investment, it's -- we see it as a win-win situation with no capital from our standpoint. Sure. We feel very bullish on our portfolio in general. And then obviously, our tourist centers, especially in California and in the Northeast are starting to finally see the improvement that we have been seeing for quite some time in Florida. And Florida continues to be an unbelievably strong market as well. So we're finally seeing California, Northeast pick up. Obviously, the strong dollar vis-a-vis certain currency does have an effect, kind of an inhibitor effect. But even with that said, domestic tourism continues to excel.\n And I think people, at the end of the day, they as part of -- when they go on holiday, they love shopping as part of that experience, dining, shopping, being with their families. And as I said earlier, I mean, we feel like the mall has made a big comeback, physical stores or where it's happening. We're seeing a resurgence and reinvigoration of that whole product.\n So we're pleased it's kind of where we're seeing things. So certainly, the lower income consumer has been under pressure now for quite some time. We're very focused on that. Obviously, inflation has taken its toll. And even though inflation is moderating, the prices that the lower income consumers dealing with are quite daunting. So we'll continue to see volatility in that area, we anticipate.\n We're hoping that their cost of living moderates and to some extent their wages go up or their cost of living goes down, so we can see more discretionary income there. The higher-income consumer continues to spend and visits our properties, and it's good. And as a good example of that is our traffic for the first quarter, I think, was up around 2% for the year, right, guys? So that's also a very good sign. Yes. Look, we don't update that, as you probably know. I think you know. We don't -- that's our goal for the year. We don't update it every quarter as some others might. But we still feel like that's -- even though we've got some -- unanticipated to some extent, I mean, we do create bogeys on our rental income stream on retailers that we do feel might come under pressure in the year. So we do have kind of adjustments in our budgeting process dealing with those. We still feel like our initial guidance on that is very achievable. So we don't update it every quarter, but if we didn't feel like we could achieve it, I think we would highlight that. But we don't see that even with some of the -- I mean, we might not overachieve, as we always want to, but I think we can still deliver the initial guidance. Sure. I think we've seen rates more or less stabilized now. There was a volatility prior to that where it was hard to predict. Now, we're not anticipating a reduction in rates, but at least we feel like we're at a more or less a stable rate environment. That makes it easier to make investment decisions, so I would break it up into 2 buckets. The first bucket being our redevelopment effort, and most of that, frankly, is mixed use in our properties, and we feel very bullish on that.\n Remember, you're talking about bringing on -- if it's a 2- to 3-year process, you're talking about bringing on product in 2 to 3 years, not going to be any supply. We do a very good job of understanding the supply and demand. The new better product always wins. So we are unabated in our mixed use, and we'll be doing some multifamily development, both in Brea in Orange County, and as I mentioned, we just signed our GMP at Northgate Station to build about 300 units as part of that whole redevelopment.\n So that really goes unabated, that when you get to the external new deal environment, I would say, we have a lot of opportunities ahead of us. And I think our job is just to prioritize, make sure we're valuing the opportunities, right, and we don't take our eye off the ball with what we're doing with our existing portfolio.\n So long story short, I probably would venture to say that there could be more external opportunities for us. But again, it's got to be great quality at a fair price and have assets where we think our expertise can add cash flow growth to them. Sure. Look, we are -- make no mistake about it, we are not immune to macro -- the macro environment. So we would have to deal with it, both from -- if it ultimately led to less consumer spending and more retail client stress. We're not immune to it. However, and this is a big -- the big underlying from my standpoint, I have always felt like we've done our best work when others are dealing with the macro environment. \n So -- and as I mentioned, we have $11 billion of liquidity, in our comments earlier. So I think when and if -- and frankly, I mean, it's realistic to assume we may go through a reasonable slowdown here coming up. I think that's when we do our best work. That's when others get tired and throw in the towel. That's where we get rejuvenated. Hopefully, we're rejuvenated now, but this is when we really get motivated.\n And as I think back, and I have had the luxury of being in the spot for 30 years, I think we do our very best work when the times get tough. So I'm not wishing that on us or anyone, but it's a realistic probability. We won't be immune for it, but I think we'll further separate this company from our peers. So that I know, that I have 100% confidence in that. If that does happen, we'll have further separation. Yes. That's -- it's interesting, Alex. It's a very good question. And I think, honestly, we really focus on -- to the extent we do put in fresh capital, we -- in addition to understanding what it means for our overall business, and the totality of our company, it's also absolutely driven by return on investment, just like building a new shopping center.\n And again, yes, we have volatility, but in the scheme of things, again, and the fact that we've made money, I hope most folks are understanding that the volatility is really on the margin. And I'll just give you a good example. And again, we take -- FFO, as you know, is net income plus depreciation. Well, the contribution we get from our retailers is net income, which is fully burdened by depreciation, so there's no add back. \n But to give you a simple analysis on just ABG as an example. So we cleared $1.450 billion of cash. And that produced about $0.08 of earnings because we just picked up our share of net income. We only got -- we only as a shareholder, they are only -- we only would get tax distribution. It's a subchapter as essentially. So we'd only get our tax distributions, which amounted to $2 million a quarter. So that's $8 million. And if you take the $1.450 billion and you invested in a bank at 5.5%, that's $70 million. So we went from $8 million in cash flow to $70 million, just selling that.\n So we look at every aspect of it, pretax, after-tax, what does it mean to the portfolio, what is -- we don't want volatility, but we'll have -- we'll certainly accept it if we think it's going to be a good investment. And it all kind of goes into the analysis. We understand the market is not thrilled with it. So we try to also do it in a way that really does not make it the store. It is on the margin, and it will always be on the margin. But we do think we can add value to the enterprise by some of these investments.\n And each investment is so idiosyncratic that it's hard to say -- again, if Express happens, it's hard to say that, that's the new model because -- I don't know that I can say that, I think every one of these things is somewhat idiosyncratic, but we do have the opportunity to do more than lease space in Alabama someplace. That's what this company is all about, we do more -- we're in South Korea, we're in Jakarta, we're building in Tulsa, we're building apartments in Seattle.\n So -- I mean I'm waxing a little bit here, but I -- we think of ourselves broader than I think the market thinks of us, that's incumbent upon us. And I think our disclosures have gotten better over time. I hope you read, Alex, on OPI, so you could see it, not to track from real estate, but at the same time, we're somewhat different than when you line us up to others that do some of what we do. Listen, I think we've got a great portfolio of real estate that is focused on the very high income consumer. And I think we need to step up our game in all the services that need to be provided to that consumer. And I think Woodbury, Sawgrass are just the beginning of an effort to really -- I can't think of the right word, but really entertain that consumer to make it really special. And it's all the services that they're accustomed to, it's the fine dining, it's the ease of access, it's right -- having the right retailer mix. \n So we probably have around 20 to 25 properties that are -- that have this high -- our centers are really big, so they obviously appeal to a broader range of consumers, which is the way we like it because -- that's also you diversify the ebbs and flows. But that -- but those 20, 25 centers really need special attention. We've got a great team that's dedicated to them. And in many cases, we're the preferred or certainly a meaningful landlord to the best retailers in the world. And we want to -- we definitely want to stay in that spot. So a big push for us to step up our game when it's dealing with the very high-end consumer on all sorts of levels.\n And so I think what happens at Sawgrass with the Oasis and The Colonnade and what already happens at Woodbury, but we're just stepping up our game, will happen at Houston and King of Prussia. And if you saw what we did at Phipps in Atlanta and what's going on at Boca Raton in Florida, just to name a few that jump out at me, is really, really a high priority for the company. Yes. Very good question. In fact, we cleared in 2 months $1.450 billion, as you know, Floris. So I just wanted to mention that. But yes, right now, our guidance just assume it sits in the bank and/or pays down debt. But that's basically it. So no really -- no real redeployment is contemplated in our numbers at this point.\n Brian, if you want to add anything? Yes. The charges pretax were $33 million, so not -- most -- it's kind of funny -- because you know most charges were in the hundreds of millions of dollars, so -- yes, I think you have to put it in perspective. But with that said, it really dealt with personnel and inventory. So that were the 2 primary factors and more really on the inventory side because we had some clearance of inventory that in SPARC it was really focused on F21 and Penney just on basically clearing out some inventory. \n So Penney -- we're pleased with Penney. I'll just talk a moment about the store closings. They're very interesting. They don't -- Penney is able to produce positive EBITDA even if there's no -- not high sales, I think they do out of the box. So I don't really -- in fact, I think Penney always can be a beneficiary opening new stores as opposed to closing stores. I'm sure there will be a few here and there, but most all of their stores are positive EBITDA. And so they have a very good way of having positive EBITDA out of what I call low-volume stores.\n And again, this is what's interesting to us, Penney is not public. So you know what matters to me, Vince, cash flow, EBITDA and that, obviously, sales -- comp sales are important, right? But as long as we're profitable out of the stores, there's no Wall Street pressure that we've got to narrow the store count. I don't necessarily believe shrink to grow. It's very hard to achieve. Maybe you can achieve it. It's -- my history, not overly long, but long enough, it's -- I don't care what industry, it's very hard to do. Some have done it, but the -- but to me, if it's that positive EBITDA, there's nothing wrong with maintaining that store for the community.\n You certainly don't want to lower standards of how you operate it, but if you can create cash flow, doesn't necessarily mean you have to reinvest that much in it, and you can use that cash flow to reinvest in other elements of your business. So I don't anticipate -- long story short, I really don't anticipate much portfolio real estate activity at the JCP level. Yes. Well, look, I think as part of the deal originally -- first of all, our relationship with Brookfield is excellent in our -- we both basically -- and ABG is an investor in there as well, but we very much see eye-to-eye on JCPenney and how it operates and how we should operate it. And I would say both of us, and now, my memory is a little bit cloudy, but when we did the restructuring, we did get -- both of us got the opportunity to reclaim certain space from JCPenney that we could redevelop it.\n So it's a good question. And the fact is we are about to embark upon, one, that you'll see an announcement in the near future where we are going to ultimately redevelop a JCPenney at one of our centers. So I don't remember the exact count. I don't remember exactly how much Brookfield, but as part of the bankruptcy process and negotiation with each other, we did give each other the right to do that. And so what happens there is we get notice to the company, it's already documented, then we get the -- we -- and we can -- in this case, it's a lease. So there's nothing to pay. We just cancel the lease.\n Now, obviously, store is a little bit profitable, very profitable for JCPenney. So we're going to have to find them some new opportunities to make up for it, but that's all part of the deal. So I think there'll be a handful like that, both from us and Brookfield that we'll be able to do. But -- and again, that was all prenegotiated. To the extent that there's one that wasn't part of that negotiation, that's pretty -- given our relationship with Brookfield, pretty straightforward, we come up with a value or they come up with a value. Obviously, the JCPenney management team would have to be part of that. And they would get the appropriate value to redevelop that project. Yes. Let me answer that. I think the 2 tenants -- I mean, even if we didn't -- I think it's just color for you to know that generally, the portfolio was flat. We don't like to name tenants, so we don't focus on it. I'd also, I think, point out to you, the most important thing we look is total volume, and we were up quarter-over-quarter. What was the number again? 2.3%. That's really the number we look at. And again, remember, these are reported sales. We can get into this whole diatribe about some of the retailers credit their sales with Internet returns. So it's just information, okay? Do what you want with it, but it's just information.\n But our sales, if you include the 2 retailers, the last 12 months was down 1.8% on a rolling 12 basis. But total, because not all those are comp total, was up 2.3%, which is the more important number. Now, we'd also -- just to -- and Brian can add in here. Now that I'm talking I might as well just finish. We don't -- as part of our discussion, we don't -- we'll never get into a retailer-specific response.\n But obviously, bankruptcy for tenants has a lot of -- a lot goes on, leases have to be rejected and depending on where they were on that and what happens. So we -- in our comp NOI, we have our bad debt expense. I think I gave you some color. We still feel like it's achievable. So -- but again, I don't think, and Brian can add, we're not going to really give you a color too much on Express, but we do put in -- when we model our business for the year, we do put in unforeseen circumstances. And we try to budget appropriately for retailers that are under pressure. In this case, we kind of knew Express was in that spot. But a lot remains to be seen how Express comes out of bankruptcy and the ultimate financial impact. I'll let Brian, you can -- I hope you can answer all these. I expect you to... Tell him the 2. Yes. And I would just add to that, the ABG sale happened, I don't remember exactly, but near quarter end. And we were blacked out from that because of Q1 earnings. So I wouldn't read that the fact that it's sitting on the balance sheet to read too much into that. Well, I think obviously, there is a couple of elements, the first -- the most important one is that we have the history of running a retailer coming out of bankruptcy. So I think -- for better or worse, I think it's better, but others may not agree with me. There's a certain expertise in doing that, and we've -- we had. And I think what our potential partner sees on that is that, that we can bring to the table. So I wouldn't underestimate that. That's one.\n Number two is, as part of any bankruptcy, we're going to have a lease negotiation. Some leases will get restructured, some won't. Some will pay what the existing rent is and so on, so -- but that happens regardless of whether or not we're involved or not. So that's just part of the bankruptcy process. We go space by space and find out -- we kind of find out what we'd like to do, maybe short-term leases, so on and so forth, but that -- but we're not alone in that. Any other landlord will have to come to their own conclusion on what they want to do, if part of rent adjustment is necessary to get the brand on solid financial footing. We are not involved in that process. That's really management. So I have no point of view or no opinion on that at all. That whole process is part of -- we really won't get involved until we're approved as the stalking horse bidder. So that -- all that's going on today with the depth and everything else is all part of -- it's all the existing management team. We have no involvement in that whatsoever. Honestly, it's across the board, restaurants, entertainment, athleisure, sports-related -- it's the bigger boxes, the UNIQLOs, Primarks of the world, Zara. It is -- this is where I give a shout-out to Rick as he used to go through it. But we're seeing it -- Abercrombie were doing a lot of new opportunities with Mango, Golden Goose, just to name a few; KnitWell, JD Sports, Alo, Lululemons growing with us, upsizing a lot of properties. Our House is a great company that we're doing business with, pinstripes, number of restaurants, restaurant tours. It's very, very, very encouraging because it's so diverse. Portfolio weighted. I'm sorry, just portfolio, pure. If it was NOI weighted, where we used to do that, it's like $950 -- higher. Okay. $950, thereabouts. Well, again, they're equity accounted, so they're really not on our balance sheet just to make us clearer. So they're investments in them. Listen, they are -- we built a company where everything is core and nothing is core. So we saw ABG, we got an offer, we hit the bid. I would view that for any and all assets that we have, whether it's JCPenney, SPARC, XYZ mall. Call Uncle David and not -- most people don't hit my bid, but the only thing that's core is the company and its people and its balance sheet, but every other assets were sale at the right price, so nothing is critical long term. \n And again, look, guys, we're talking about volatility, and the reality is the volatility has been mostly on the upside. And again, we're a company that earns $12, and we're talking about $0.10 here or there. So I just want to put everything more or less in perspective. But there's nothing that I wouldn't sell at the right price across the company and worldwide, period, end of story. Because -- and it's very simple. You know why? I think because if we got the cash, I know we would find an appropriate investment that would replace the earnings lost, it's really that simple, or we give it to the shareholders or we buy our stock back. So I am at the point of the highest level of indifference about monetizing an asset as you'll see. Okay. Thank you. Sorry, we -- I know it's the end of earnings season, we're always late in the Q1 because we tie it to our annual meeting next -- on Wednesday. But thank you for your interest and your questions, very good questions. Appreciate it. Thank you."
