My name is Sia, and I will be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Sia. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace Fourth Quarter 2020 and Full-year 2020 Results Conference Call. I\u2019m joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Toga Oal, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John, Tolga and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that this discussion will contain Forward-Looking Statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today\u2019s presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the appendix in today\u2019s presentation. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, PT, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter call. Following the same format as last quarter\u2019s earnings call. I plan to give an overview of the fourth quarter Howmet performance, Tolga will then speak to segment information, and Ken will provide further financial detail. I will return to talk to the outlook for the 2021 financial year. So please move to Slide number 4. And first, let me provide some qualitative commentary regarding the fourth quarter before moving on to specific numbers. The fourth quarter played out as expected and guided. In fact, the results were above both consensus and the improved outlook that we provided in November. Revenues rose compared to the third quarter due to the lesser impact of commercial aerospace inventory corrections. Performance improved again and the decremental margin year-over-year was 24%, which was an improvement from the decremental margin in the third quarter, which was 37%. The incremental margin on the revenues benefited from the utilization of labor that we held onto in the third quarter in order to meet the expected increase in fourth quarter revenues, which were 9% as approximately forecast. Furthermore, the third quarter included the $8 million write-down of a long-term contracts that we bought out. Moving to specific numbers. Revenues improved over the third quarter by 9% and were 29% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the reductions in commercial aerospace. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 22.8% and ahead of outlook. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin in 2020 was, in fact, the same as the fourth quarter of 2019, while mitigating the market reductions and commercial aerospace adverse mix. Performance was driven by permanent cost reductions and price increases. And lastly, the fourth quarter earnings per share was 21%, again, ahead of consensus and at the top end of our outlook range. Moving to cash. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was positive at $268 million, which is the third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow since separation. As you know, we define free cash flow very conservatively as the net cash after everything, i.e., after pension after AR securitization, paydown, et cetera. Q2 through the Q4 free cash flow was $487 million and above the outlook. The $487 million includes an $80 million reduction in accounts receivable securitization. A $70 million of cash flow to pay down in incremental voluntary pension contributions. $47 million of severance costs, and we did receive a $45 million tax refund. Without these onetime items, free cash flow would indeed have been $638 million. Full-year free cash flow as a percentage of net income was 115%, well above our guide of approximately 90%, and would have been approximately 160%, excluding the onetime items mentioned. Year-end cash balance was also ahead of outlook at $1.6 billion after repurchasing $73 million of common stock throughout the year at an average price of $18.98. Now let me turn it over to Tolga to highlight segment performance.\nTolga Oal: Thank you, John. So let\u2019s move to Slide number5, please. [indiscernible] of our people is a top priority as the COVID continue to increase worldwide in the fourth quarter. Our operations secured continuously and customer demand with no major events. Our segments remain focused on the cost containment and cash preservation targets in the fourth quarter. Structural cost reductions exceeded the outlook. Effective variable costs to the extent and furloughs continued in specific locations to manage the sales fluctuations in different segments. Cash management actions continue with Class B. Strict capital expenditure control, strong accounts receivable collections and effective inventory management with the key customers stranded inventory discussions in the background contributed to Howmet\u2019s fourth quarter cash performance. Let\u2019s move to slide 6 please. I will start with engine products. Commercial aerospace revenue showed quarterly improvement, with the third quarter seasonal shutdown impacts not repeating and inventory adjustments slowing in line with our expectations. Defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine growth continued in the fourth quarter. Effective variable cost flexing and driving permanent cost-outs ahead of the plan, have contributed to our incremental margins from the engine side in the fourth quarter. We are expecting the strengthen inventory discussion with our key customers to continue. Fastening Systems Industrial business continued to grow, balancing the timing of commercial aerospace distribution business in the fourth quarter. I mentioned in our last earnings release that the Fastening business is the highest number of locations and permanent cost reductions gained traction across these locations in fourth quarter. We continue to bridge the timing of pending reductions with targeted furloughs and successful variable cost flexing, improving our operating margins with relatively flat revenue in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. The Engineered Structures segment revenue showed a small increase in fourth quarter versus third quarter, while we continue level loading our operations for an optimized operating model for long lead time orders. We are ahead of our Costa plants as we implemented additional headcount reductions to get ready for the latest announcements in the 787 build rates. Costa plants are running ahead of plan and contributed to incremental margins also on the Structural segment. Commercial vehicle market recovery in the fourth quarter led to a record quarterly profit margin for the build segment. While the build markets continue to recover, increasing our low-cost country content, keeping permanent costs compressed and increasing the share of our revolutionary 39 pounds wheels, led to very healthy incremental margins in the fourth quarter. Let me now turn it over to Ken to provide more details on the financials.\nKenneth Giacobbe: Thank you, Tolga. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 7. For additional details on the fourth quarter, let\u2019s start with revenue. As expected, revenue was down 29% year-over-year, driven by a 51% reduction in commercial aerospace and a 10% reduction in commercial transportation. These markets were partially offset by continued growth in defense, aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. On a sequential basis, although commercial aerospace grew 5%, we do not expect a meaningful recovery in commercial aerospace in the first quarter of 2021 due to lingering customer inventory corrections. Regarding the defense aerospace, commercial transportation and IGT markets, they all had double-digit sequential growth. Operating income, excluding special items was down 28% year-over-year, with commercial aerospace representing 40% of total revenue compared to 60% in 2019. Permanent cost reductions and price increases continued in the quarter. Permanent cost reductions were $60 million in the quarter and $197 million for the year, which were ahead of our outlook. Price increases were $11 million for the quarter and $39 million for the year, which were in-line with our expectations. Decremental and margins improved to 24% in the fourth quarter compared to 37% in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.21, which was ahead of consensus and at the top end of the outlook range. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. John covered the full-year and post separation numbers, which were ahead of the outlook. I would add that in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with $1.6 billion of cash after repurchasing an additional $22 million of common stock in the quarter at an average price of $23.99. The remaining common stock repurchase authority from the Board of Directors is $277 million. Lastly, net debt-to-EBITDA was 3.2 times and our revolving credit facility of $1 billion remains undrawn. Please move to Slide 8. Slide 8 is a summary of EBITDA margin performance. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin of 22.8% was ahead of the outlook and at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2019 despite a 29% revenue decline in an unfavorable commercial aerospace mix. The improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by price increases, variable cost selection and permanent cost reductions. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 9. Before moving into the revenue and segment profitability, I would point out that the fourth quarter revenue was in-line with the outlook at 1.238 billion, while profit was more than 10% or $27 million better than the outlook. Now for more detail on fourth quarter year-over-year revenue performance. Revenue was down 29%, driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. As previously mentioned, commercial aerospace was down 51% year-over-year, which showed a 5% sequential increase. Our second largest market, defense aerospace continued to show growth and was up 24% in the quarter and 10% sequentially driven by demand for the joint strike fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. Our next largest market, commercial transportation, which impacts both the forged wheels and the Fastening Systems segments, was down 10% year-over-year. We continue to see favorable trends for increased demand in this market improved 15% sequentially. Finally, industrial and other markets, which is comprised of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was flat, but up 12% sequentially. IGT, which makes up 45% of this market continues to be strong, and was up 38% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Moving to Slide 10. We will quickly cover full-year revenue performance. For the full-year, revenue was down 29%, driven by commercial aerospace, which was down 38%. Commercial aerospace represented approximately 50% of revenue, which was down from approximately 60% in 2019. Defense aerospace was strong throughout the year and was up 14%. Defense aerospace represents almost 20% of the total revenue. Commercial transportation was down 31% for the year, but showed a strong recovery trend in the third and fourth quarters. Finally, the industrial and other markets was up 1%, with IGT up 28% as the IGT market rebounds from a weak level in 2019. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 11 for the segment results. As expected, engine products year-over-year revenue was down 33% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 58%, driven by customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 30% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 38% increase in IGT, as IGT benefits from continued favorable natural gas prices. Decremental margins for engines improved to 18% for the quarter compared to 34% in the third quarter. In the appendix of the presentation, we provided a schedule that shows how all of the segment\u2019s decremental margins improved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Now let\u2019s move to Fastening Systems on Slide 12. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was down 30% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 38%, and commercial transportation was down 21%. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in the commercial aerospace market. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems improved to 45% for the quarter compared to 58% in the third quarter. Now let\u2019s move to Engineered Structures on Slide 13. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was down 30% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 52%, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for both the 787 and 737 MAX platforms. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 40% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Decremental margins for engineered structures improved 24% for the quarter compared to 27% in the third quarter. Lastly, let\u2019s please move to Slide 14 for Forged Wheels. Forged Wheels revenue was down 6% year-over-year, but increased 18% sequentially as expected. Despite the lower revenues, the wheel segment\u2019s operating profit was higher than last year, and operating profit margin was at a record high of 30%. The improved margin was driven by continued cost reductions. Moreover, with the reduced volumes, we are able to shift production temporarily to low-cost countries, including Hungary and Mexico, which improved our margins. Lastly, we have been increasing market share with a new innovative 39-pound wheel. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 15 for special items. Special items for the quarter were a benefit of approximately $14 million after tax, primarily due to insurance proceeds received for fires at 2 of our plants. Additionally, a favorable outcome of a Spanish tax assessment primarily offset our severance cost. I would like to comment and provide further perspective on how much post separation special items. For the past two years, we have undertook a major restructuring and performance improvement program, including the separation of Arconic Corporation. Post separation, the after-tax charges of the 2020 were approximately $100 million driven by two items: first, a voluntary U.K. pension settlement charge of $55 million in the second quarter, which reduced our gross pension liability by $320 million. And then second, in April, we paid down and refinanced our debt and an after-tax cost of $50 million. The refinancing added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet and refinanced a portion of the 2021 and 2022 bonds to a maturity in May of 2025. Regarding the balance, the other special items, they have pretty much all netted out. So now let\u2019s move to the capital structure and liquidity on Slide 16. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. All debt is unsecured, and our next significant maturity is October 2024. Gross debt at the end of 2020 was $1.5 billion and net debt was $3.5 billion. Strong cash generation in the year has reduced our net debt by approximately $370 million since separation. Moreover, as we previously mentioned, we decreased our U.K. gross pension liability by $320 million. A few additional items of note. First, our $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Second, we have reduced our AR securitization by $100 million in 2020. This reduction in AR sold was effectively a repayment of debt, which increases working capital and reduced our 2020 adjusted free cash flow, as John mentioned. Lastly, on January 15, 2021, we used cash on hand to complete the redemption at par of our 2021 bonds that were due in April. By paying down the bonds three months early, had no additional cost. We saved $5 million of interest costs. On an annual basis, interest costs are reduced by approximately $19 million. Now let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you, Ken, and please move to Slide 17 for closing remarks on the fourth quarter and 2020 before we are talking about the 2021 outlook. Revenues is in line with the outlook, while profit and margin exceeded. Our differentiated products and ability to scale resulted in price increases in line with expectations. Permanent cost reductions continued and accelerated throughout the year, which also exceeded our outlook. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 22.8% exceeded the outlook and was at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2019 despite some 29% less revenue and an unfavorable commercial aerospace mix. Regarding liquidity, adjusted free cash flow and cash balance exceeded our outlook. Full-year accounts receivable securitization was reduced by $100 million and voluntary pension contributions were made of $70 million. While severance costs $51 million were incurred, albeit we had tax refunds of some $78 million. Full-year CapEx was favorable to the outlook at 3% of revenue. The $155 million spent was over $100 million less than the depreciation of $269 million. Adjusted free cash flow was ahead of outlook at $487 million for the second through fourth quarters, and $387 million for the full-year. Net debt was reduced by $370 million since separation. Additionally, the gross pension liability was reduced by some $320 million. Cash increased to $1.6 billion, a $100 million beat to guide after the repurchasing of $73 million of common stock throughout the year at an average price of $18.98. 2020 was another year of heavy lifting, after separation, we refinanced the balance sheet phased into the COVID pandemic and the impact on our operations and sales demand and further improved balance sheet. Now let\u2019s move on to Slide 18. First, let me comment on the 2021 outlook qualitatively. Our end markets of defense, aerospace, commercial transportation and industrial gas turbines continue to be healthy and growing. Commercial aerospace has less visibility and reflects our view regarding the global vaccine rollout, its acceptance and potential impact on travel. Airline travel should improve, especially for shortfall routes, which may help dissipate narrow-body inventories, especially for Boeing. We expect to improved clarity on these factors as we move through 2021. Regarding commercial aerospace, we expect increased aircraft build, especially as we move forward into 2022 and beyond. This will help both inventory clearance and shift to an inventory build situation, which will help rebuild the pipeline of aircraft parts. Now let\u2019s move to the specific numbers. Revenue for the first quarter is expected to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus $50 million. For EBITDA, we provided you with a baseline figure with a range of minus $5 million to plus $15 million, so between $245 million and $265 million. Our EBITDA margin is ranged from 20.8% to 21.3%. And earnings per share is at $0.16 baseline with a range of $0.15 to $0.19. In Q1 2021, we expect commercial aerospace to be down a little from Q4 due to lingering inventory corrections. Please note that for the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter average was $1.208 million, and the baseline guide is in-line with the average of the last three quarters. For the year, we expect revenues of $5.1 billion at baseline with a range of $5.05 billion to $525 billion, in other words, minus $50 plus $150. EBITDA baseline of $1.1 billion with a range of $1.07 billion to $1.15 billion, again, minus $32 plus $50. EBITDA margin, 21.6% for the year with a range of 21.2% to 21.9%.Earnings per share baseline at $0.80 with a range of $0.75 to $0.89. And free cash flow at $400 million, plus or minus $50 million. Let me provide you with a few assumptions. The cost restructuring carryover into 2021 will be $100 million. Price increases are expected to be above the 2020 increases. Pension/OPEB cash contributions are expected to be about $160 million compared to last year\u2019s $236 million. The operational tax rate is in the range 26.5% to 28.5%, similar to the average rate for 2020 at 27.5%. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is expected to be 115%, again above our long-term outlook of 90%. The cash tax rate will increase to about 15%. And CapEx, we have put in the range of $200 million to $220 million. Maybe a couple of further comments to put 2021 into perspective. You can see by the revenue guide of $1.2 billion for the first quarter versus $5.1 billion for the year at baseline, but there is an expectation that quarterly revenue begins to accelerate during the year. Margins are respectable and above 2020 year. And in our baseline versus the normal outlook award we use, we have a smaller, lower bandwidth to the downside and a higher bandwidth of the upside. That concludes my commentary before we move to question and answer. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Yes, thanks, good morning guys. John and Ken, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more of your assumptions on Q1 and 2021 guidance. Because it looks like it is sequentially lower in Q1, the implied EBITDA margin for the year is below that of Q4. And I\u2019m just wondering if mix worsened sequentially if the 787 situation has gotten worse from what you last updated us on in November. What kind of explains the sequential? And then If I could have a follow-up after that. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Let me have a go at that Gautam. And I mean, I will give you a round number. So last year, our second quarter revenues were 12 50, Q3 11 30, Q4 12 40, give or take, $1 million or so. And that average is at 1208. So what we placed what we call baseline, at 1,200 with a bandwidth around it plus or minus 50. So our view is that Q1 is essentially the same as the average of the last three quarters. With my feeling or I would say, statement is that Q2, we were not seeing much by way of customer inventory reductions, although we had the impact of certain customer plants being closed as we went into April last year. And then significant inventory corrections in the third quarter, in particular, and a lower correction in the first quarter. Right now, it just feels as though things are pretty opaque. And essentially, the rollout of the vaccine, the airline load factors. In fact, if anything, airline load factors have reduced substantially in Europe with the almost closing down of travel in certain countries, particularly into the U.K. and an international air travel has actually become, if anything, a little bit more problematical rather than improving. And so right now, there is little to observe and celebrate. And then you look at the rollout of the vaccine, in particular, and that feels also below that, which we could have or maybe should have expected. And indeed, some of the process to actually get that into people\u2019s arms has also been, I will say, underwhelming. And I can talk from personal experience, having got my first chart a couple of weeks ago, and just the whole process even trying to register and get the vaccine, never mind, is it going to be available for the second shot. So that whole rollout has been, let\u2019s say, underwhelming. And so when you think about travel at the moment and therefore, what is the impact on build, there is little to the upside and celebrate. And so we just say first quarter is roughly in line with the average of about three quarters. That is best we can see. I mean it is a bandwidth of variability around it. So it could be, as we put what we call baseline rather than outlook, to try to say this is what we think is like that what you can rely upon with a relatively small downside and with a relatively higher upside. So we have given you an asymmetrical picture compared to what we normally do of just giving you a midpoint and a plus or minus around it. And we did that at EBITDA margin in the first quarter. And then for the year, we also gave you an asymmetrical picture, calling one baseline and then a lesser reduction and a higher upside. And it really is - it is the degree of opaqueness regarding the future demand. I mean we have had the courage again to provide not just guidance for the quarter, but guidance for the year. And I just don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves ahead of our skis at the moment and say, do we really have the absolute foresight to see the full-year. And I think any reasonable person would say, it is difficult when there is so many factors that you don\u2019t yet understand. I mean, while commercial transportation feels pretty solid. The defense and industrial markets for us, still pretty solid. The oil and gas market is looking better, with the improvement in oil prices and natural gas is still sort of being the prevalent fossil fuel used in power stations. All of that is to the good. And then there is the commercial aerospace. Commercial aero, while we did see a lower inventory takeout in the fourth quarter, you are still 51% down year-on-year. And at the moment, we don\u2019t yet have the courage to say it is going to get significantly better either in the first quarter or in the first half of this year. I mean the bright news on the horizon appears to be that airbus have indicated an increasing build rate for the A320, which is great, and that will map up inventory, we think, in the course of the year and maybe give us a build situation. Whereas on the 737, we haven\u2019t had any significant news one way or the other. And on 787, it is a little bit reduced from what we thought. So again, taking in the context of it is a baseline, it is a view. And we are hoping that the view for the incremental revenues. We do see that as we move through the year. And that is why I commented $1.2 billion for the first quarter, let\u2019s say, 5.1 with that asymmetrical bundle with around that. Should give us, hopefully, I will say, a higher run rate into the back half of the year. Does that cover it out, Gautam?\nGautam Khanna: It does. And maybe you can give us, based on what you know as of now, late in Q1, middle of Q1. What segments do you expect to be sequentially up or sequentially down if you have that visibility at this point?\nJohn Plant: I probably have good thoughts around the commercial transportation business being slightly up and just find myself cautious around commercial aerospace. With the others, I\u2019m going to call it roughly in-line. I recognize I didn\u2019t really talk much to the margin question. You answered, let me cover that out as well. So in my thoughts around the first quarter is - we have guided in that, I think, give or take, 21% or possibly even a higher numbers over 2021. Conceivably, because I feel stronger about the margin than I do, the revenue side, you could be at the full end of that. But why do I think, first of all, it is higher than 2020, so I think that is good to say that we are confident that our first quarter is going to be at a run rate higher than 2020. And I do recognize that at the moment, we are saying that it is probably not quite as good as the fourth quarter. And put that, you can assume that is within the bandwidth of the whole of the uncertainty around the commercial aerospace market at the moment, which we choose to be cautious about. Because we just don\u2019t feel as that we know enough and don\u2019t feel on solid ground enough at this point in time. While we hope for better, we are just planning to be in the zone where we feel confident at this point. So hopefully that covers out the margin side of it as well for you.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nCarter Copeland: Hi good morning. Just a quick follow-up to that. On the variable cost flexing and furloughs, can you give us a sense of how much of that is a headwind to the profit in 2021 that is built into your plan?\nJohn Plant: At the moment, we have just said to ourselves, there is the potential that we may need, and we hope to bring people back from furlough. There may be some, let\u2019s say, required retraining, just to make sure we are on top of our game because we treat both quality promises and our delivery promise is very serious. Despite all that, I will say, pandemic disruption last year that are both our quality indices and every indices were actually improved again. And we do want to maintain that track record. So we have assumed that there may be a little bit of drag from bringing people back earlier than immediately for the demand profile. Just to make sure that the end of full train, fully ready to go. Just the same as in our third quarter, we did hold on to some labor ready for the fourth quarter, and you saw that was good. And so again, it is just a planning assumption. We have not brought anybody back just yet. But we are hopeful that we have that problem to do with because that does lead to better days ahead for us because that is what I call a high quality problem, and it is just a matter of then the efficiency in which we do that process, Carter.\nCarter Copeland: Okay. And then just another real quick one. On the forged wheels, low-cost sourcing and the Hungary move, can you give us a sense of how much of that transition has now taken place. Is it substantially complete? And when did it all get transferred over? Just is there any additional benefit that we should think it is still rolling its way in, in 2021?\nJohn Plant: Yes. So first of all, for the investment we made in, we have been utilizing that. And we have been increasingly staffing that. And there is still more to come in that regard from where we were in the third and fourth quarters last year. So in terms of utilization of that new plants because we have tend to try to use the move on say, necessarily some of the old because of the efficiency we can gain from it. And therefore, the margin, there is still some to come in the first half of 2021. We also been adjusting our manufacturing footprint, which, again, to the benefits and chosen to invest some more monies into Hungary for our wheels business. And that basically will come on stream during the fourth quarter of 2021, all leading to, I think, healthy towards the run rate as we exit the year, but really leading us to 2022. So my previous commentaries that we have seen, as you know, 2022 to be at similar levels to 2019 and then 2023 above, all of that still holds. And at the moment, you have seen what I think shows a really strong incremental margin in the fourth quarter. So as volume has come back into one of our divisions, then that incremental margin was tremendous. I hesitate to give you the number because it just sounds so good. I mean, you can give it later if it needs to. But basically, I will call, fabulous incremental margin on that, which if everything works out as planned, we hope to replicate that in our commercial aerospace businesses when we begin to see some volume recovery. And while we feel confident we are going to see recovery in the future. It is still a matter of what will it be and when.\nCarter Copeland: Great. Thanks for the color John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. John, I just had to follow-up on what you said earlier on Airbus and the A320 and also Boeing on the MAX. And the bottom line is this is how much inventory do you think there is still in the chain as it relates to your product? And when can we see this point where we go from sort of destocking to restocking and what sort of forecast have you built for that into your 2021 numbers?\nJohn Plant: Okay. So when we originally built plan for 2021, we just assumed the 40 A320s flat through the year. We also recognized that we had not been supplying parts at the 40 rate. So we were, let\u2019s say, 32 the 35 build sets we guesstimate. It is always difficult, both when you are at the both first year and through second-tier levels in the supply chain. And as you know, through our engine products business, we operate through both GE Aviation and also Pratt & Whitney for the two engine variants for the A320. My expectation is that destocking will - I\u2019m going to take a swag at this now. We think that will have completely dried up by the end of the second quarter. And we are going to have to start building some products ahead, particularly as it goes to the 45% rate in the fourth quarter this year. So that is what I call the - when we all won bright spots, and we have got two commercial transportation in this Airbus lift, and that gives us -- it brings a little bit of a smile to our face. On the other hand, for Boeing at the moment, they have been building at seven per month in the back end of 2020, whereas we know we have been supplying less than half of that rate. So small numbers. And we just expect that to continue certainly through the first half of this year. And then when they raise it to, is it 10 and 20, and then hopefully, into the 30s by the second quarter of 2022, then well before then, we will have start matching the run rate of part shipments to the build rate of aircraft. Now the question is when does that occur? I don\u2019t have a lot of information regarding the clearance of the Boeing inventory at this point. I note the RyanAir order. I note that there were 27 deliveries of the 737 out of the 450 aircraft parked up I think, in the fourth quarter, or by, which is great. But we know that given the fact that they built is aircraft in the fourth quarter. That is just a little bit low the build rate, more than the build rate, sorry. So there is still a lot to go. And so once we see that inventory dissipating as the information begins to flow this year, I think we will become increasingly confident in the Boeing stated build rates. Bear in mind to-date, in actual terms, all we have seen is reductions sequentially for the last 18-months. And we obviously note the planned increases. But for us to feel confident, we have got to see that aircraft park dissipated. And those increase in build rates reconfirm to us. So we tend to be a little bit cautious at this point in time.\nRobert Stallard: That is great. Thanks John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks good morning guys. Probably for Ken. A lot of moving pieces here on the free cash flow walk 2020 to 2021, it looks like you are at the midpoint forecasting about flat. Could you walk us through, Ken, just net working capital, kind of what you are thinking. I guess, pension is down a little, some cash taxes are up, CapEx is down, severance is down. And then what you are assuming for the securitization program? Is that a headwind this year as well?\nKenneth Giacobbe: Yes so a couple of things on the free cash flow that we have provided. We have got a nice improvement there on the pension cash contributions and OPEB contributions on a year-over-year basis. As you know, as we exited 2020 as the discount rate didn\u2019t work favorably for us. It was about 80 bps unfavorable, that cost us around $200 million on the liability side. Asset returns were very strong for the business, over 14%. So that kind of netted out. But when you look at the work that we have done on the pension and OPEB program, especially over the last 12-months, we are going to see a favorability there. The other things I would look at the tax rate pretty much the same as what we have had before. You can see interest expense though that is most likely going to be as you do the walk around $290 million for the year. And the big question, David, and I know you are focused on it like we are, is the working capital, right. As we look at 2020, working capital was not a source or use of cash in 2020, right. We took down the AR securitization program, which was a $100 million burn in that number. So that is all embedded there. So it wasn\u2019t a source or use even when we consider the bring down to the AR securitization program. So as we move into 2021, we think working capital, and this is all going to depend on, as John talked about the revenue ramp as we go to the second half of the year as well as some of the stranded inventory as we clear that out of the channel. I expect working capital to be a modest source of cash embedded in that $400 million guide that we gave you.\nJohn Plant: The one thing we didn\u2019t cover, Ken, was that we don\u2019t plan any change in AR. The $100 million is done. We think we will just leave that alone in 2021 at this point of time.\nKenneth Giacobbe: Yes, right. Sorry, John, I missed that. $250 million there, can be no change.\nDavid Strauss: Alright. And John, obviously, sitting with a pretty big cash balance, nothing on the debt side, I guess, to do. How are you thinking about share repurchase? And does your EPS guidance reflect any sort of capital deployment benefit or not?\nJohn Plant: No, we haven\u2019t assumed anything in our EPS regarding that. In my feelings on the cash balances. The thing I\u2019m focused on more than anything at the moment is our 2022 bond maturities. And let\u2019s say, if we wanted to, should we just roll them up on the due date or should we move early, that is a consideration, which we are sort of thinking about. So that is in the, I will call it, in the in basket. In terms of further share repurchases of any note. My thoughts there are is the trigger, I think, for us to be more aggressive in that regard would be seeing solidification of the on call, commercial aerospace build rate. And so the way I think about it is we have done some modest picking off of the shares over the last couple of quarters in terms of, would I want to be bolder than that in any significant way than it would be, once I\u2019m convinced that the aircraft builds skylines, solidify becomes [worst] (Ph) from a fluid state, is it this or is it last? What is the widebody rate really going to be? That is the trigger for me to be more aggressive on that side. So taking cash and deploying into the share buyback of any major notice. The trigger for that is all centered on. If the skylines solidifies to a build, I feel confident in. I see those skylines begin to lift, particularly as we go in the back half into 2022. I see inventory being put into the system because those builds are scheduled rather than just talked about. And the good news is that we are told that we are going to see those Airbus increases, actually scheduled in February. So we haven\u2019t seen them in the first two or three days. But we say, by the end of the month, we will see those in production releases. And then when you see that, you get more of a confidence than just a new skyline number. Because, as you know, that skyline, even on the more confident Airbus side move from - maybe it is going from 40 to 47 to, let\u2019s see 43 than a 45 before moving maybe to a 40, 18, 22. So I would like to see it in schedule form rather than just News media form, and we need to just see what is widebody doing and then the clearance of the inventory for Boeing. And I think that is the point where I say, yes, we are good. We will have a pretty good view of what our incremental margins will be as we see that demand increase and then it is off to the races, maybe in terms of any cash deployment for share buyback.\nDavid Strauss: Alright, it makes sense. Good luck. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi good morning. John, just getting maybe a little more specific. Are there any kind of one-off opportunities that might drive commercial aerospace up in 2021? What I\u2019m thinking of is that MTU talked about a 20% to 30% increase in MRO for them on the GTF on some incoming GTF work, low-pressure turbine upgrades, normal first time shop visits, hot section upgrades, those sorts of things. Are there some things there that can drive 2021 up?\nJohn Plant: Right now, we have said to ourselves, our space profile is not going to change over the first two quarters of 2021 compared to the last two quarters in 2020 in any regard. So when you think about last year compared to the $400 million normal revenues we have, for example, in our engine business for commercial aerospace, the effective run rate for the last couple of quarters, has been like 75%, 80%, even 85% down, if we look at certain months. So we have just assumed that, that just continues, and we are not seeing anything and not choosing to believe at the moment that there could be an increase just because what is still out there, what could be cannibalized than moved off. We note that a couple of our customers are providing commentary around solidification of that into the back half of the year. And I think we are willing to accept that, albeit at the moment, again, it is difficult to plan for it. I have always thought that we would see some narrow-body build rate increase is necessarily before we would see a large increase in MRO. But when it does come back, then clearly, that is going to be a benefit for us because striding along, let\u2019s call it, only 25% of normalized levels or less is pretty tough. And we just assume that is the case for the next two quarters.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then I know it is a delicate topic, but I thought I would revisit just the idea of Pratt and their new airfoils facility. And if there is any more insight into what is happening there? And if that is going to be work that might share in your markets or if it is separate and separate content from what you do?\nJohn Plant: First of all, it is not a delicate topic. It is pretty straightforward, really. Pratt decided back in 2017 in the year after they had sold their previous business in air oils to make selective reimbursement. They felt the need, first of all, to acquire some business to be able to provide more accurate coring for those castings because previously, they have never been able to achieve, I believe the yields, which are necessary to be cost-effective in that regard and obviously, the quality performance that comes out. The investment is exactly the same as previously stated, $650 million, as we think. It covers both the casting, coring, hole drilling, machining, coatings. So there is a lot of stuff in there. And our view is that the increase in spares demand let\u2019s call it in that 2023, 2025, 2027 time frame, the spares demand is slated to grow very significantly. Then all of that capacity could be used for that. What we also note is that we have renewed our LTA with Pratt in this area. And so all is good. Nothing to comment further, really, no information that we have had.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. We saw some nice growth in the defense end market, and you talked about further growth going forward. The main customer, I guess, Pratt & Whitney had some good growth in 2020. You talked about things sort of flattening out. Lockheed\u2019s talked about the F-35, production rate sort of nearing a run rate. So do we think about defense growth this year sort of the year-end run rate sort of normalizing and not driving the growth or have there been share gains or maybe places outside the F-35 that might be able to continue to drive growth there?\nJohn Plant: Yes. Again, maybe in perspective for yourself, F-35 is about 40% about defense sales. So it is less than half. So we do have a lot of significant defense business elsewhere. We supply GE with a lot of military FL applications and other structural casting applications as well as Pratt & Whitney. So I just wanted to baseline that for you. Military budgets, even in the course of the year don\u2019t necessarily move all in a similar percentage is often a little bit of a hike towards the end of the year. Money is spent. Budgets are when they are still deplete with money. And so my thought is that maybe the fourth quarter is a little bit higher just because we have seen that in previous years as well. Having said all of that, we believe our defense sales will be solid and increasing in 2021. The F-35 be a more modest part of that in terms of OE bill, maybe slightly more in spares build, but nothing of great note at this point and we just see generally the military budget for 2021, remains healthy. And it wouldn\u2019t surprise us, we see the similar cadence through the year of, again, slightly lower in the early part of the year and slightly higher in the second half of the year when any budget moneys are spent.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, the idea of inflation has come on to people\u2019s radar screens a little bit more recently. I think back at Arconic days occasionally in the TCS segment, there would occasionally be some aluminum impacts. Is that something we should be aware at all for the Forged Wheels business? And then in the rest, on the aerospace side, it is been striking to me the degree to which raw materials have not at all been part of the discussion. And so expect that to kind of remain -- should we expect that to kind of remain the case with the pass-through is working fairly effectively and not being really at consideration.\nJohn Plant: Yes. I should as so if I have a call out materials as a massive issue, I feel like maybe I should shoot myself, that maybe that is a bit extreme. But when you are in the 90%, 95% let\u2019s call it, 95% pass-through situation, then in the course of the year, that may be a quarter here in terms of a lag as if metals move massively. But in the normal course of, let\u2019s say, metals corridors and there back-to-back agreements with our customer base, including wheels, so it doesn\u2019t mean any matter whether it is an aerospace product or a commercial aluminum wheel. But whether it is cobalt or whether it is nickel or vanadium or aluminum, those are pretty much [indiscernible].\nKenneth Giacobbe: I would just add to that, Seifman, as John mentioned, 95% plus pass-through. And for the remaining piece, we have hedging agreements in place. So that whole volatility piece from Arconic Inc. days that goes away.\nSeth Seifman: Great. No, that clarifies things. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Also just remind you that we had covered out that back for a lot of what is now Arconic Corp. in terms of aluminum pass-through and spend a lot of time correcting that in 2019 as well. So it was a diminished feature of that business and not a feature of a problem for Howmet.\nOperator: The final question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hi good morning everyone. John, everything I\u2019m hearing from you on this call, I think, translates to this forged real margin, a little bit over 30% being sustainable, is that accurate? And then I wanted to circle back to the incremental margin you mentioned in the piece of the business that had better volume, can you quantify it for us? And then it sounded like you were saying you think of that number as translating to the aerospace business, kind of back half of 2021 or into 2022 as you have better volume, is that literally the case?\nJohn Plant: Well, obviously, when I say it is -- let me use the back end of your question first. It was more of a directional comment. So as volume returns, I\u2019m hopeful that incremental margins are healthy. I\u2019m going to ask Ken just to give you the specific wheels incremental, because I told you it was rather good. And in terms of I think the wheels margin, which I think was 30% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, and it is sustainable at the volumes we are seeing and had. Yes, I do. I mean I have no intentions of that business going backwards it is EBITDA margin. So Ken, can you comment on the incremental?\nKenneth Giacobbe: Yes. Noah, so we have put a slide in the appendix that has the details for wheels in the other businesses as well. But as John mentioned, from an EBITDA perspective, Q4 at 35.5%, right. As we have adjusted the production footprint and leverage some of the low-cost country areas, we have also invested in them as well. So we have got the benefit of the geography, the global footprint. The team has done a terrific job in wheels this year in terms of taking costs out of the business quickly. And then as the volume started to come back was very surgical in terms of how we brought people back in. But the expansions that we have are going to help as we move forward. And the last thing I would mention is just the improved yields in that business as well. The production of the wheels business has improved over the last several years. So a real testament to that team. And I will give you one data point from a quality perspective, PPMs in our wheels business is less than 10. So one zero, right. So very good production process there as well. And the incremental from Q3 to Q4 was off the charts.\nNoah Poponak: Right. Okay. Just one follow-up on the revenue, the sort of sequential walk for the revenue and the 2020 revenue guidance discussion. It would seem like most of the businesses outside of aerospace original equipment have some visibility into improving or already improving. And then within aerospace original equipment, there is just a lot of moving pieces given the unique situation with the MAX, the A320 sorting higher, the 87 is coming down. We are never exactly sure where you are. Can you just tell us in the 2021 revenue guidance you provided today, what are aggregate total aerospace original equipment revenues doing as you move through the year? Are those higher or lower exiting 2021 compared to exiting 2020?\nJohn Plant: Higher. 2021 and 2022, that is pretty straightforward. I would say a lot of moving pieces complicated by inventory adjustments, but basically rising as we exit the year is what I will say, strongly believe.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Great. So the lift on the narrow-body side is more than the incremental step down on the 87?\nJohn Plant: Yes.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the allotted time for the Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, PT, and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter call. Following the same format as last quarter's earnings call. I plan to give an overview of the fourth quarter Howmet performance, Tolga will then speak to segment information, and Ken will provide further financial detail. I will return to talk to the outlook for the 2021 financial year. So please move to Slide number 4. And first, let me provide some qualitative commentary regarding the fourth quarter before moving on to specific numbers. The fourth quarter played out as expected and guided. In fact, the results were above both consensus and the improved outlook that we provided in November. Revenues rose compared to the third quarter due to the lesser impact of commercial aerospace inventory corrections. Performance improved again and the decremental margin year-over-year was 24%, which was an improvement from the decremental margin in the third quarter, which was 37%. The incremental margin on the revenues benefited from the utilization of labor that we held onto in the third quarter in order to meet the expected increase in fourth quarter revenues, which were 9% as approximately forecast. Furthermore, the third quarter included the $8 million write-down of a long-term contracts that we bought out. Moving to specific numbers. Revenues improved over the third quarter by 9% and were 29% lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 due to the reductions in commercial aerospace. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 22.8% and ahead of outlook. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin in 2020 was, in fact, the same as the fourth quarter of 2019, while mitigating the market reductions and commercial aerospace adverse mix. Performance was driven by permanent cost reductions and price increases. And lastly, the fourth quarter earnings per share was 21%, again, ahead of consensus and at the top end of our outlook range. Moving to cash. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was positive at $268 million, which is the third consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow since separation. As you know, we define free cash flow very conservatively as the net cash after everything, i.e., after pension after AR securitization, paydown, et cetera. Q2 through the Q4 free cash flow was $487 million and above the outlook. The $487 million includes an $80 million reduction in accounts receivable securitization. A $70 million of cash flow to pay down in incremental voluntary pension contributions. $47 million of severance costs, and we did receive a $45 million tax refund. Without these onetime items, free cash flow would indeed have been $638 million. Full-year free cash flow as a percentage of net income was 115%, well above our guide of approximately 90%, and would have been approximately 160%, excluding the onetime items mentioned. Year-end cash balance was also ahead of outlook at $1.6 billion after repurchasing $73 million of common stock throughout the year at an average price of $18.98. Now let me turn it over to Tolga to highlight segment performance. Thank you, Ken, and please move to Slide 17 for closing remarks on the fourth quarter and 2020 before we are talking about the 2021 outlook. Revenues is in line with the outlook, while profit and margin exceeded. Our differentiated products and ability to scale resulted in price increases in line with expectations. Permanent cost reductions continued and accelerated throughout the year, which also exceeded our outlook. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin rate of 22.8% exceeded the outlook and was at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2019 despite some 29% less revenue and an unfavorable commercial aerospace mix. Regarding liquidity, adjusted free cash flow and cash balance exceeded our outlook. Full-year accounts receivable securitization was reduced by $100 million and voluntary pension contributions were made of $70 million. While severance costs $51 million were incurred, albeit we had tax refunds of some $78 million. Full-year CapEx was favorable to the outlook at 3% of revenue. The $155 million spent was over $100 million less than the depreciation of $269 million. Adjusted free cash flow was ahead of outlook at $487 million for the second through fourth quarters, and $387 million for the full-year. Net debt was reduced by $370 million since separation. Additionally, the gross pension liability was reduced by some $320 million. Cash increased to $1.6 billion, a $100 million beat to guide after the repurchasing of $73 million of common stock throughout the year at an average price of $18.98. 2020 was another year of heavy lifting, after separation, we refinanced the balance sheet phased into the COVID pandemic and the impact on our operations and sales demand and further improved balance sheet. Now let's move on to Slide 18. First, let me comment on the 2021 outlook qualitatively. Our end markets of defense, aerospace, commercial transportation and industrial gas turbines continue to be healthy and growing. Commercial aerospace has less visibility and reflects our view regarding the global vaccine rollout, its acceptance and potential impact on travel. Airline travel should improve, especially for shortfall routes, which may help dissipate narrow-body inventories, especially for Boeing. We expect to improved clarity on these factors as we move through 2021. Regarding commercial aerospace, we expect increased aircraft build, especially as we move forward into 2022 and beyond. This will help both inventory clearance and shift to an inventory build situation, which will help rebuild the pipeline of aircraft parts. Now let's move to the specific numbers. Revenue for the first quarter is expected to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus $50 million. For EBITDA, we provided you with a baseline figure with a range of minus $5 million to plus $15 million, so between $245 million and $265 million. Our EBITDA margin is ranged from 20.8% to 21.3%. And earnings per share is at $0.16 baseline with a range of $0.15 to $0.19. In Q1 2021, we expect commercial aerospace to be down a little from Q4 due to lingering inventory corrections. Please note that for the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter average was $1.208 million, and the baseline guide is in-line with the average of the last three quarters. For the year, we expect revenues of $5.1 billion at baseline with a range of $5.05 billion to $525 billion, in other words, minus $50 plus $150. EBITDA baseline of $1.1 billion with a range of $1.07 billion to $1.15 billion, again, minus $32 plus $50. EBITDA margin, 21.6% for the year with a range of 21.2% to 21.9%.Earnings per share baseline at $0.80 with a range of $0.75 to $0.89. And free cash flow at $400 million, plus or minus $50 million. Let me provide you with a few assumptions. The cost restructuring carryover into 2021 will be $100 million. Price increases are expected to be above the 2020 increases. Pension/OPEB cash contributions are expected to be about $160 million compared to last year's $236 million. The operational tax rate is in the range 26.5% to 28.5%, similar to the average rate for 2020 at 27.5%. Adjusted free cash flow conversion is expected to be 115%, again above our long-term outlook of 90%. The cash tax rate will increase to about 15%. And CapEx, we have put in the range of $200 million to $220 million. Maybe a couple of further comments to put 2021 into perspective. You can see by the revenue guide of $1.2 billion for the first quarter versus $5.1 billion for the year at baseline, but there is an expectation that quarterly revenue begins to accelerate during the year. Margins are respectable and above 2020 year. And in our baseline versus the normal outlook award we use, we have a smaller, lower bandwidth to the downside and a higher bandwidth of the upside. That concludes my commentary before we move to question and answer. Thank you. Let me have a go at that Gautam. And I mean, I will give you a round number. So last year, our second quarter revenues were 12 50, Q3 11 30, Q4 12 40, give or take, $1 million or so. And that average is at 1208. So what we placed what we call baseline, at 1,200 with a bandwidth around it plus or minus 50. So our view is that Q1 is essentially the same as the average of the last three quarters. With my feeling or I would say, statement is that Q2, we were not seeing much by way of customer inventory reductions, although we had the impact of certain customer plants being closed as we went into April last year. And then significant inventory corrections in the third quarter, in particular, and a lower correction in the first quarter. Right now, it just feels as though things are pretty opaque. And essentially, the rollout of the vaccine, the airline load factors. In fact, if anything, airline load factors have reduced substantially in Europe with the almost closing down of travel in certain countries, particularly into the U.K. and an international air travel has actually become, if anything, a little bit more problematical rather than improving. And so right now, there is little to observe and celebrate. And then you look at the rollout of the vaccine, in particular, and that feels also below that, which we could have or maybe should have expected. And indeed, some of the process to actually get that into people's arms has also been, I will say, underwhelming. And I can talk from personal experience, having got my first chart a couple of weeks ago, and just the whole process even trying to register and get the vaccine, never mind, is it going to be available for the second shot. So that whole rollout has been, let's say, underwhelming. And so when you think about travel at the moment and therefore, what is the impact on build, there is little to the upside and celebrate. And so we just say first quarter is roughly in line with the average of about three quarters. That is best we can see. I mean it is a bandwidth of variability around it. So it could be, as we put what we call baseline rather than outlook, to try to say this is what we think is like that what you can rely upon with a relatively small downside and with a relatively higher upside. So we have given you an asymmetrical picture compared to what we normally do of just giving you a midpoint and a plus or minus around it. And we did that at EBITDA margin in the first quarter. And then for the year, we also gave you an asymmetrical picture, calling one baseline and then a lesser reduction and a higher upside. And it really is - it is the degree of opaqueness regarding the future demand. I mean we have had the courage again to provide not just guidance for the quarter, but guidance for the year. And I just don't want to get ahead of ourselves ahead of our skis at the moment and say, do we really have the absolute foresight to see the full-year. And I think any reasonable person would say, it is difficult when there is so many factors that you don't yet understand. I mean, while commercial transportation feels pretty solid. The defense and industrial markets for us, still pretty solid. The oil and gas market is looking better, with the improvement in oil prices and natural gas is still sort of being the prevalent fossil fuel used in power stations. All of that is to the good. And then there is the commercial aerospace. Commercial aero, while we did see a lower inventory takeout in the fourth quarter, you are still 51% down year-on-year. And at the moment, we don't yet have the courage to say it is going to get significantly better either in the first quarter or in the first half of this year. I mean the bright news on the horizon appears to be that airbus have indicated an increasing build rate for the A320, which is great, and that will map up inventory, we think, in the course of the year and maybe give us a build situation. Whereas on the 737, we haven't had any significant news one way or the other. And on 787, it is a little bit reduced from what we thought. So again, taking in the context of it is a baseline, it is a view. And we are hoping that the view for the incremental revenues. We do see that as we move through the year. And that is why I commented $1.2 billion for the first quarter, let's say, 5.1 with that asymmetrical bundle with around that. Should give us, hopefully, I will say, a higher run rate into the back half of the year. Does that cover it out, Gautam? I probably have good thoughts around the commercial transportation business being slightly up and just find myself cautious around commercial aerospace. With the others, I'm going to call it roughly in-line. I recognize I didn't really talk much to the margin question. You answered, let me cover that out as well. So in my thoughts around the first quarter is - we have guided in that, I think, give or take, 21% or possibly even a higher numbers over 2021. Conceivably, because I feel stronger about the margin than I do, the revenue side, you could be at the full end of that. But why do I think, first of all, it is higher than 2020, so I think that is good to say that we are confident that our first quarter is going to be at a run rate higher than 2020. And I do recognize that at the moment, we are saying that it is probably not quite as good as the fourth quarter. And put that, you can assume that is within the bandwidth of the whole of the uncertainty around the commercial aerospace market at the moment, which we choose to be cautious about. Because we just don't feel as that we know enough and don't feel on solid ground enough at this point in time. While we hope for better, we are just planning to be in the zone where we feel confident at this point. So hopefully that covers out the margin side of it as well for you. At the moment, we have just said to ourselves, there is the potential that we may need, and we hope to bring people back from furlough. There may be some, let's say, required retraining, just to make sure we are on top of our game because we treat both quality promises and our delivery promise is very serious. Despite all that, I will say, pandemic disruption last year that are both our quality indices and every indices were actually improved again. And we do want to maintain that track record. So we have assumed that there may be a little bit of drag from bringing people back earlier than immediately for the demand profile. Just to make sure that the end of full train, fully ready to go. Just the same as in our third quarter, we did hold on to some labor ready for the fourth quarter, and you saw that was good. And so again, it is just a planning assumption. We have not brought anybody back just yet. But we are hopeful that we have that problem to do with because that does lead to better days ahead for us because that is what I call a high quality problem, and it is just a matter of then the efficiency in which we do that process, Carter. Yes. So first of all, for the investment we made in, we have been utilizing that. And we have been increasingly staffing that. And there is still more to come in that regard from where we were in the third and fourth quarters last year. So in terms of utilization of that new plants because we have tend to try to use the move on say, necessarily some of the old because of the efficiency we can gain from it. And therefore, the margin, there is still some to come in the first half of 2021. We also been adjusting our manufacturing footprint, which, again, to the benefits and chosen to invest some more monies into Hungary for our wheels business. And that basically will come on stream during the fourth quarter of 2021, all leading to, I think, healthy towards the run rate as we exit the year, but really leading us to 2022. So my previous commentaries that we have seen, as you know, 2022 to be at similar levels to 2019 and then 2023 above, all of that still holds. And at the moment, you have seen what I think shows a really strong incremental margin in the fourth quarter. So as volume has come back into one of our divisions, then that incremental margin was tremendous. I hesitate to give you the number because it just sounds so good. I mean, you can give it later if it needs to. But basically, I will call, fabulous incremental margin on that, which if everything works out as planned, we hope to replicate that in our commercial aerospace businesses when we begin to see some volume recovery. And while we feel confident we are going to see recovery in the future. It is still a matter of what will it be and when. Thank you. Okay. So when we originally built plan for 2021, we just assumed the 40 A320s flat through the year. We also recognized that we had not been supplying parts at the 40 rate. So we were, let's say, 32 the 35 build sets we guesstimate. It is always difficult, both when you are at the both first year and through second-tier levels in the supply chain. And as you know, through our engine products business, we operate through both GE Aviation and also Pratt & Whitney for the two engine variants for the A320. My expectation is that destocking will - I'm going to take a swag at this now. We think that will have completely dried up by the end of the second quarter. And we are going to have to start building some products ahead, particularly as it goes to the 45% rate in the fourth quarter this year. So that is what I call the - when we all won bright spots, and we have got two commercial transportation in this Airbus lift, and that gives us -- it brings a little bit of a smile to our face. On the other hand, for Boeing at the moment, they have been building at seven per month in the back end of 2020, whereas we know we have been supplying less than half of that rate. So small numbers. And we just expect that to continue certainly through the first half of this year. And then when they raise it to, is it 10 and 20, and then hopefully, into the 30s by the second quarter of 2022, then well before then, we will have start matching the run rate of part shipments to the build rate of aircraft. Now the question is when does that occur? I don't have a lot of information regarding the clearance of the Boeing inventory at this point. I note the RyanAir order. I note that there were 27 deliveries of the 737 out of the 450 aircraft parked up I think, in the fourth quarter, or by, which is great. But we know that given the fact that they built is aircraft in the fourth quarter. That is just a little bit low the build rate, more than the build rate, sorry. So there is still a lot to go. And so once we see that inventory dissipating as the information begins to flow this year, I think we will become increasingly confident in the Boeing stated build rates. Bear in mind to-date, in actual terms, all we have seen is reductions sequentially for the last 18-months. And we obviously note the planned increases. But for us to feel confident, we have got to see that aircraft park dissipated. And those increase in build rates reconfirm to us. So we tend to be a little bit cautious at this point in time. Thank you. The one thing we didn't cover, Ken, was that we don't plan any change in AR. The $100 million is done. We think we will just leave that alone in 2021 at this point of time. No, we haven't assumed anything in our EPS regarding that. In my feelings on the cash balances. The thing I'm focused on more than anything at the moment is our 2022 bond maturities. And let's say, if we wanted to, should we just roll them up on the due date or should we move early, that is a consideration, which we are sort of thinking about. So that is in the, I will call it, in the in basket. In terms of further share repurchases of any note. My thoughts there are is the trigger, I think, for us to be more aggressive in that regard would be seeing solidification of the on call, commercial aerospace build rate. And so the way I think about it is we have done some modest picking off of the shares over the last couple of quarters in terms of, would I want to be bolder than that in any significant way than it would be, once I'm convinced that the aircraft builds skylines, solidify becomes [worst] (Ph) from a fluid state, is it this or is it last? What is the widebody rate really going to be? That is the trigger for me to be more aggressive on that side. So taking cash and deploying into the share buyback of any major notice. The trigger for that is all centered on. If the skylines solidifies to a build, I feel confident in. I see those skylines begin to lift, particularly as we go in the back half into 2022. I see inventory being put into the system because those builds are scheduled rather than just talked about. And the good news is that we are told that we are going to see those Airbus increases, actually scheduled in February. So we haven't seen them in the first two or three days. But we say, by the end of the month, we will see those in production releases. And then when you see that, you get more of a confidence than just a new skyline number. Because, as you know, that skyline, even on the more confident Airbus side move from - maybe it is going from 40 to 47 to, let's see 43 than a 45 before moving maybe to a 40, 18, 22. So I would like to see it in schedule form rather than just News media form, and we need to just see what is widebody doing and then the clearance of the inventory for Boeing. And I think that is the point where I say, yes, we are good. We will have a pretty good view of what our incremental margins will be as we see that demand increase and then it is off to the races, maybe in terms of any cash deployment for share buyback. Thank you. Right now, we have said to ourselves, our space profile is not going to change over the first two quarters of 2021 compared to the last two quarters in 2020 in any regard. So when you think about last year compared to the $400 million normal revenues we have, for example, in our engine business for commercial aerospace, the effective run rate for the last couple of quarters, has been like 75%, 80%, even 85% down, if we look at certain months. So we have just assumed that, that just continues, and we are not seeing anything and not choosing to believe at the moment that there could be an increase just because what is still out there, what could be cannibalized than moved off. We note that a couple of our customers are providing commentary around solidification of that into the back half of the year. And I think we are willing to accept that, albeit at the moment, again, it is difficult to plan for it. I have always thought that we would see some narrow-body build rate increase is necessarily before we would see a large increase in MRO. But when it does come back, then clearly, that is going to be a benefit for us because striding along, let's call it, only 25% of normalized levels or less is pretty tough. And we just assume that is the case for the next two quarters. First of all, it is not a delicate topic. It is pretty straightforward, really. Pratt decided back in 2017 in the year after they had sold their previous business in air oils to make selective reimbursement. They felt the need, first of all, to acquire some business to be able to provide more accurate coring for those castings because previously, they have never been able to achieve, I believe the yields, which are necessary to be cost-effective in that regard and obviously, the quality performance that comes out. The investment is exactly the same as previously stated, $650 million, as we think. It covers both the casting, coring, hole drilling, machining, coatings. So there is a lot of stuff in there. And our view is that the increase in spares demand let's call it in that 2023, 2025, 2027 time frame, the spares demand is slated to grow very significantly. Then all of that capacity could be used for that. What we also note is that we have renewed our LTA with Pratt in this area. And so all is good. Nothing to comment further, really, no information that we have had. Thank you. Yes. Again, maybe in perspective for yourself, F-35 is about 40% about defense sales. So it is less than half. So we do have a lot of significant defense business elsewhere. We supply GE with a lot of military FL applications and other structural casting applications as well as Pratt & Whitney. So I just wanted to baseline that for you. Military budgets, even in the course of the year don't necessarily move all in a similar percentage is often a little bit of a hike towards the end of the year. Money is spent. Budgets are when they are still deplete with money. And so my thought is that maybe the fourth quarter is a little bit higher just because we have seen that in previous years as well. Having said all of that, we believe our defense sales will be solid and increasing in 2021. The F-35 be a more modest part of that in terms of OE bill, maybe slightly more in spares build, but nothing of great note at this point and we just see generally the military budget for 2021, remains healthy. And it wouldn't surprise us, we see the similar cadence through the year of, again, slightly lower in the early part of the year and slightly higher in the second half of the year when any budget moneys are spent. Yes. I should as so if I have a call out materials as a massive issue, I feel like maybe I should shoot myself, that maybe that is a bit extreme. But when you are in the 90%, 95% let's call it, 95% pass-through situation, then in the course of the year, that may be a quarter here in terms of a lag as if metals move massively. But in the normal course of, let's say, metals corridors and there back-to-back agreements with our customer base, including wheels, so it doesn't mean any matter whether it is an aerospace product or a commercial aluminum wheel. But whether it is cobalt or whether it is nickel or vanadium or aluminum, those are pretty much [indiscernible]. Also just remind you that we had covered out that back for a lot of what is now Arconic Corp. in terms of aluminum pass-through and spend a lot of time correcting that in 2019 as well. So it was a diminished feature of that business and not a feature of a problem for Howmet. Well, obviously, when I say it is -- let me use the back end of your question first. It was more of a directional comment. So as volume returns, I'm hopeful that incremental margins are healthy. I'm going to ask Ken just to give you the specific wheels incremental, because I told you it was rather good. And in terms of I think the wheels margin, which I think was 30% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, and it is sustainable at the volumes we are seeing and had. Yes, I do. I mean I have no intentions of that business going backwards it is EBITDA margin. So Ken, can you comment on the incremental? Higher. 2021 and 2022, that is pretty straightforward. I would say a lot of moving pieces complicated by inventory adjustments, but basically rising as we exit the year is what I will say, strongly believe. Yes. Okay. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. So let's move to Slide number5, please. [indiscernible] of our people is a top priority as the COVID continue to increase worldwide in the fourth quarter. Our operations secured continuously and customer demand with no major events. Our segments remain focused on the cost containment and cash preservation targets in the fourth quarter. Structural cost reductions exceeded the outlook. Effective variable costs to the extent and furloughs continued in specific locations to manage the sales fluctuations in different segments. Cash management actions continue with Class B. Strict capital expenditure control, strong accounts receivable collections and effective inventory management with the key customers stranded inventory discussions in the background contributed to Howmet's fourth quarter cash performance. Let's move to slide 6 please. I will start with engine products. Commercial aerospace revenue showed quarterly improvement, with the third quarter seasonal shutdown impacts not repeating and inventory adjustments slowing in line with our expectations. Defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine growth continued in the fourth quarter. Effective variable cost flexing and driving permanent cost-outs ahead of the plan, have contributed to our incremental margins from the engine side in the fourth quarter. We are expecting the strengthen inventory discussion with our key customers to continue. Fastening Systems Industrial business continued to grow, balancing the timing of commercial aerospace distribution business in the fourth quarter. I mentioned in our last earnings release that the Fastening business is the highest number of locations and permanent cost reductions gained traction across these locations in fourth quarter. We continue to bridge the timing of pending reductions with targeted furloughs and successful variable cost flexing, improving our operating margins with relatively flat revenue in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. The Engineered Structures segment revenue showed a small increase in fourth quarter versus third quarter, while we continue level loading our operations for an optimized operating model for long lead time orders. We are ahead of our Costa plants as we implemented additional headcount reductions to get ready for the latest announcements in the 787 build rates. Costa plants are running ahead of plan and contributed to incremental margins also on the Structural segment. Commercial vehicle market recovery in the fourth quarter led to a record quarterly profit margin for the build segment. While the build markets continue to recover, increasing our low-cost country content, keeping permanent costs compressed and increasing the share of our revolutionary 39 pounds wheels, led to very healthy incremental margins in the fourth quarter. Let me now turn it over to Ken to provide more details on the financials."

            "name": "Kenneth Giacobbe",
            "content": "Thank you, Tolga. Now let's move to Slide 7. For additional details on the fourth quarter, let's start with revenue. As expected, revenue was down 29% year-over-year, driven by a 51% reduction in commercial aerospace and a 10% reduction in commercial transportation. These markets were partially offset by continued growth in defense, aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets. On a sequential basis, although commercial aerospace grew 5%, we do not expect a meaningful recovery in commercial aerospace in the first quarter of 2021 due to lingering customer inventory corrections. Regarding the defense aerospace, commercial transportation and IGT markets, they all had double-digit sequential growth. Operating income, excluding special items was down 28% year-over-year, with commercial aerospace representing 40% of total revenue compared to 60% in 2019. Permanent cost reductions and price increases continued in the quarter. Permanent cost reductions were $60 million in the quarter and $197 million for the year, which were ahead of our outlook. Price increases were $11 million for the quarter and $39 million for the year, which were in-line with our expectations. Decremental and margins improved to 24% in the fourth quarter compared to 37% in the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.21, which was ahead of consensus and at the top end of the outlook range. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. John covered the full-year and post separation numbers, which were ahead of the outlook. I would add that in the fourth quarter, we finished the year with $1.6 billion of cash after repurchasing an additional $22 million of common stock in the quarter at an average price of $23.99. The remaining common stock repurchase authority from the Board of Directors is $277 million. Lastly, net debt-to-EBITDA was 3.2 times and our revolving credit facility of $1 billion remains undrawn. Please move to Slide 8. Slide 8 is a summary of EBITDA margin performance. The fourth quarter EBITDA margin of 22.8% was ahead of the outlook and at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2019 despite a 29% revenue decline in an unfavorable commercial aerospace mix. The improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by price increases, variable cost selection and permanent cost reductions. Now let's move to Slide 9. Before moving into the revenue and segment profitability, I would point out that the fourth quarter revenue was in-line with the outlook at 1.238 billion, while profit was more than 10% or $27 million better than the outlook. Now for more detail on fourth quarter year-over-year revenue performance. Revenue was down 29%, driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. As previously mentioned, commercial aerospace was down 51% year-over-year, which showed a 5% sequential increase. Our second largest market, defense aerospace continued to show growth and was up 24% in the quarter and 10% sequentially driven by demand for the joint strike fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. Our next largest market, commercial transportation, which impacts both the forged wheels and the Fastening Systems segments, was down 10% year-over-year. We continue to see favorable trends for increased demand in this market improved 15% sequentially. Finally, industrial and other markets, which is comprised of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was flat, but up 12% sequentially. IGT, which makes up 45% of this market continues to be strong, and was up 38% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Moving to Slide 10. We will quickly cover full-year revenue performance. For the full-year, revenue was down 29%, driven by commercial aerospace, which was down 38%. Commercial aerospace represented approximately 50% of revenue, which was down from approximately 60% in 2019. Defense aerospace was strong throughout the year and was up 14%. Defense aerospace represents almost 20% of the total revenue. Commercial transportation was down 31% for the year, but showed a strong recovery trend in the third and fourth quarters. Finally, the industrial and other markets was up 1%, with IGT up 28% as the IGT market rebounds from a weak level in 2019. Now let's move to Slide 11 for the segment results. As expected, engine products year-over-year revenue was down 33% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 58%, driven by customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 30% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and a 38% increase in IGT, as IGT benefits from continued favorable natural gas prices. Decremental margins for engines improved to 18% for the quarter compared to 34% in the third quarter. In the appendix of the presentation, we provided a schedule that shows how all of the segment's decremental margins improved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Now let's move to Fastening Systems on Slide 12. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was down 30% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 38%, and commercial transportation was down 21%. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in the commercial aerospace market. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems improved to 45% for the quarter compared to 58% in the third quarter. Now let's move to Engineered Structures on Slide 13. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was down 30% in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace in the segment was down 52%, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for both the 787 and 737 MAX platforms. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 40% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Decremental margins for engineered structures improved 24% for the quarter compared to 27% in the third quarter. Lastly, let's please move to Slide 14 for Forged Wheels. Forged Wheels revenue was down 6% year-over-year, but increased 18% sequentially as expected. Despite the lower revenues, the wheel segment's operating profit was higher than last year, and operating profit margin was at a record high of 30%. The improved margin was driven by continued cost reductions. Moreover, with the reduced volumes, we are able to shift production temporarily to low-cost countries, including Hungary and Mexico, which improved our margins. Lastly, we have been increasing market share with a new innovative 39-pound wheel. Now let's move to Slide 15 for special items. Special items for the quarter were a benefit of approximately $14 million after tax, primarily due to insurance proceeds received for fires at 2 of our plants. Additionally, a favorable outcome of a Spanish tax assessment primarily offset our severance cost. I would like to comment and provide further perspective on how much post separation special items. For the past two years, we have undertook a major restructuring and performance improvement program, including the separation of Arconic Corporation. Post separation, the after-tax charges of the 2020 were approximately $100 million driven by two items: first, a voluntary U.K. pension settlement charge of $55 million in the second quarter, which reduced our gross pension liability by $320 million. And then second, in April, we paid down and refinanced our debt and an after-tax cost of $50 million. The refinancing added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet and refinanced a portion of the 2021 and 2022 bonds to a maturity in May of 2025. Regarding the balance, the other special items, they have pretty much all netted out. So now let's move to the capital structure and liquidity on Slide 16. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. All debt is unsecured, and our next significant maturity is October 2024. Gross debt at the end of 2020 was $1.5 billion and net debt was $3.5 billion. Strong cash generation in the year has reduced our net debt by approximately $370 million since separation. Moreover, as we previously mentioned, we decreased our U.K. gross pension liability by $320 million. A few additional items of note. First, our $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Second, we have reduced our AR securitization by $100 million in 2020. This reduction in AR sold was effectively a repayment of debt, which increases working capital and reduced our 2020 adjusted free cash flow, as John mentioned. Lastly, on January 15, 2021, we used cash on hand to complete the redemption at par of our 2021 bonds that were due in April. By paying down the bonds three months early, had no additional cost. We saved $5 million of interest costs. On an annual basis, interest costs are reduced by approximately $19 million. Now let me turn it back over to John. Yes so a couple of things on the free cash flow that we have provided. We have got a nice improvement there on the pension cash contributions and OPEB contributions on a year-over-year basis. As you know, as we exited 2020 as the discount rate didn't work favorably for us. It was about 80 bps unfavorable, that cost us around $200 million on the liability side. Asset returns were very strong for the business, over 14%. So that kind of netted out. But when you look at the work that we have done on the pension and OPEB program, especially over the last 12-months, we are going to see a favorability there. The other things I would look at the tax rate pretty much the same as what we have had before. You can see interest expense though that is most likely going to be as you do the walk around $290 million for the year. And the big question, David, and I know you are focused on it like we are, is the working capital, right. As we look at 2020, working capital was not a source or use of cash in 2020, right. We took down the AR securitization program, which was a $100 million burn in that number. So that is all embedded there. So it wasn't a source or use even when we consider the bring down to the AR securitization program. So as we move into 2021, we think working capital, and this is all going to depend on, as John talked about the revenue ramp as we go to the second half of the year as well as some of the stranded inventory as we clear that out of the channel. I expect working capital to be a modest source of cash embedded in that $400 million guide that we gave you. Yes, right. Sorry, John, I missed that. $250 million there, can be no change. I would just add to that, Seifman, as John mentioned, 95% plus pass-through. And for the remaining piece, we have hedging agreements in place. So that whole volatility piece from Arconic Inc. days that goes away. Yes. Noah, so we have put a slide in the appendix that has the details for wheels in the other businesses as well. But as John mentioned, from an EBITDA perspective, Q4 at 35.5%, right. As we have adjusted the production footprint and leverage some of the low-cost country areas, we have also invested in them as well. So we have got the benefit of the geography, the global footprint. The team has done a terrific job in wheels this year in terms of taking costs out of the business quickly. And then as the volume started to come back was very surgical in terms of how we brought people back in. But the expansions that we have are going to help as we move forward. And the last thing I would mention is just the improved yields in that business as well. The production of the wheels business has improved over the last several years. So a real testament to that team. And I will give you one data point from a quality perspective, PPMs in our wheels business is less than 10. So one zero, right. So very good production process there as well. And the incremental from Q3 to Q4 was off the charts."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Fiya. Good morning and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace third quarter 2020 results conference call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Tolga Oal, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John, Tolga and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we've included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, PT, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's call. I plan to give an overview of Howmet's third quarter performance. Tolga will speak to segment information, and then Ken will provide further financial detail. Lastly, I will return to talk to the outlook for the fourth quarter and 2020 financial year. Please move to Slide #4. The third quarter performance was good and in line with expectations, including strong cash generation. Revenue in the quarter was $1.1 billion, down 37% year-over-year, and was impacted by commercial aerospace being down 56% driven by customer inventory corrections. We continue to expect that this is the low point for Howmet revenues while anticipating there could be some lingering inventory corrections that could carry over into the fourth quarter and possibly the first half of 2021. Commercial transportation was down year-over-year, but we had healthy sequential growth to 42%, which flavored the impacts the forged wheels and commercial transportation fastening segment. Moreover, we had growth in defense aerospace and in the industrial gas turbine business year-over-year. The mix of our portfolio has changed with approximately 40% of Q3 revenue being tied to commercial aerospace. Operating income excluding Special items was $100 million and this includes the buyout of an unfavorable long-term contract, which costs $8 million. This hopefully should be the last of the cleanup items over the last year. Segment decremental margins including the contract termination were 37% year-over-year. I had indicated on the Q2 call that the third quarter was likely to be more decremented than the second quarter and reflects that we chose not to take out costs for one quarter and risk not having the people assets in place meet what we expect to be an uptick in future demand. For example, early in the third quarter, we completed all of the people reductions in our wheel segment and I've since pull people back on furlough, I have begun recruitment in certain countries as you bring production assets back online, both of our forgings and machining lines. Structural cost reductions will continue within each of the aerospace segments to the end of 2020 and in the first quarter in Europe. Third quarter reflects further structural cost takeout of $56 million making year-to-date cost takeout of $137 million, which is ahead of target. This structural cost takeout is in addition to the flexing of variable costs, which we expect by the end of first quarter 2021 should be at a perfect flex. Further to this price increases of $14 million were achieved in the third quarter compared to $9 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date price increases are $28 million. I am pleased that all of the 2020 long-term contract negotiations are now completed and price negotiations are well underway for the 2021 long-term agreements. Now let's move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was very good at $188 million before further reductions in the accounts receivable securitization program and cash flow was $143 million after the reduction in the AR program. The $45 million of the accounts securitization reduction was effectively repayment of debt. Cash severance payments in the quarter were $14 million. The third quarter cash balance increased to $1.4 billion after the $51 million of common stock share repurchases, which were at an average price of $17.36. Our peak operational cash requirements are approximately $300 million, which results in excess cash in hand of well over $1 billion. Net debt to EBITDA is approximately 3.2 times and our revolver of $1 billion continues to be undrawn. So let us move to Slide 5. All plants are running with employee and partner safety being a top priority. We're actively monitoring employee health risks and all programs meet or exceed local standards. To best serve our customers we're effectively managing daily adjustments or customer inventory corrections and shutdowns. Regarding cost out, most of the North American permanent personnel reductions have been completed and are ahead of targets. Therefore, we will be raising our 2020 permanent cost outlook. We also continue to flex variable spend and labor effectively with revenue. Our strict and disciplined capital expenditure process has been effective. And we will once again be reducing our annual capital expenditure outlook. Lastly, we're focused on working capital, but expect it to be use of cash in 2020, as we have reduced our AR securitization program by approximately $95 million year-to-date. Moreover, we have stranded inventory, which we expect to be a source of cash in 2021. Now, let me turn it over to Tolga.\nTolga Oal: Thank you, John. Please move to Slide 6. We summarized on Slide 6 the status of our segments. Aerospace segments continue with revenue adjustments that follow slightly different trends. Let me start with the Engine Products. All those strong defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine growth continued in third quarter, commercial aerospace had expected customer inventory corrections and seasonal shutdowns. We continue to expect that third quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter of 2020 and we are ahead of our permanent cost reduction plans. Additionally, we are flexing variable labor and indirect costs with revenue. Regarding our long-term agreements, 2020 negotiations are now complete and we are actively working on 2021 contracts. Our philosophy on price has not changed. The Engine Product segment's biggest challenge continues to be managing the stranded inventory, which had a modest reduction quarter-over-quarter. Moving to Fastening Systems, the Fastening Systems segment follows the lagging, reducing revenue trends mainly due to the timing of commercial aerospace distribution business. The decline in commercial aerospace is partially offsets by growth in fasteners industrial business. Regarding permanent cost reduction, that's the largest number of European locations within our business, which impacts the timing of cost reduction actions, but follows directionally the revenue reduction threat. We are bridging this timing with heavy furloughs and effective, variable cost flexing. Maintaining our critical talent and skill sets is our priority during this period. The Engineered Structures segment has long lead time orders requiring close discussions with our customers to level of their demands for an efficient operating model for the next six to nine months. Permanent cost reduction actions are ahead of plan. Long-term agreement pricing negotiations are complete for 2020, including weeding out unprofitable products.  In the Forged Wheels segment, third quarter 2020 revenue started recovering from second quarter 2020. As John mentioned, third quarter sequential revenue was up 42% as top U.S. shipping ports are near or above record levels of volume, which drives tracking demand. We expect continued growth in fourth quarter and have called employees back from furloughs and restarted operations. We have compressed permanent costs and having effective influx in production to meet customer demand. Lastly, we renewed one of our largest customer\u2019s long-term agreement while increasing share with our innovative, lightweight, 39-pound wheel. I will now hand it over to Ken to give more details on the financials.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, Tolga. Now let's move to Slide 7. So before moving into the revenue and segment profitability, I wanted to note that the third quarter revenue and profit was in line with expectations and better than the implied outlook that we provided on the second quarter earnings call. The improved performance will be reflected in the updated outlook for the remainder of the year. Now to the third quarter. Total revenue was down 37% year-over-year driven by commercial aerospace, which now represents approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, commercial aerospace was down 56% year-over-year. Consistent with our previous outlook, we expect the third quarter to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year as customers adjust inventory levels. Regarding the remaining 60% of the portfolio, I would point out that our second largest market, defense aerospace, continues to show year-over-year growth and was up 15% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new engine builds and engine spares. Our next largest market commercial transportation, which impacts both the forged wheels and the fastening system segment, was down 31% year-over-year. However, as Tolga has mentioned, we are seeing favorable trends for increased demand and this market improved 42% sequentially. Lastly, the industrial and other markets, which is comprised of industrial gas turbines, oil and gas, and general, industrial was down 4%. I would point out that IGT, which makes up approximately 40% of this market continues to be strong and was up 23%. Now let's move to Slide 8. On this slide, we are providing historical information for the combined segments with an estimated operational view of corporate. Compared to the prior year, third quarter revenue declined approximately $660 million with a corresponding segment operating profit decline of $246 million. Despite the 37% year-over-year revenue decline, we remained profitable and generated strong, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. Included in the third quarter results are continued price increases of $14 million and continued permanent cost reductions of $56 million for a combined benefit of $70 million in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, price increases were $28 million and cost reductions were $137 million for our combined benefit of $165 million. One last comment on cost reductions of the $137 million realized year-to-date, this includes carry over benefits from our 2019 cost reduction program. This program generated $54 million of benefit year-to-date for 2020 and finished ahead of target. The program is now substantially complete. In the appendix we have provided additional information, including historical financials for each of the segments. Now let's move to Slide 9 to go into more detail on the segments. Engine Products year-over-year, revenue was down 43% in the quarter. In the segment, commercial aerospace was down 65% driven by COVID-19, 737 MAX production declines and customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by 18% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and at 23% increase in IGT. Third quarter results were impacted by an $8 million charge to exit an unprofitable long-term contract. Cost reductions and price increases continued in the segment and the team continued to flex variable spending to mitigate the impact in the quarter of the significant decline in commercial aerospace revenue. Now let's move to the fastening systems segment on Slide 10. Also as expected, we experienced this deeper revenue decline in fasters as the third quarter year-over-year, revenue was down 31% driven by commercial aerospace and commercial transportation, both being down over 35%. Continued cost reductions, combined with third quarter price increases, helped mitigate the decrease in revenue. However, a weaker product mix, with less commercial aerospace and the expected delay in European cost reductions unfavorably impacted results. In the near term, we are furloughing employees to offset the delay in European cost reductions.  Now let's move to Slide 11 to review engineered structures. For the engineered structures segment, third quarter revenue was down 35%. Commercial aerospace was down 54%, driven by COVID-19 production declines on both the 787, and 737 MAX, as well as customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by a 26% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Cost reductions and price increases helped to mitigate the decrease in revenue, but structures experienced a weaker product mix with less commercial aerospace. Lastly, let's move to Slide 12 for forged wheels. In the third quarter, revenue for the forged wheel segment was down 29% year-over-year, but increased 52% sequentially as expected. Employees are returning from furloughs and we continue to quickly flex staffing at variable cost to meet changing market demand. Despite revenue being down 29%, the impact of cost reductions resulted in a healthy EBITDA margin for the quarter of 26%. Now let's move to Slide 13 for special items. Special items for the quarter was a net benefit of approximately $23 million after tax and included two items: first, a $36 million after tax benefit related to a U.S. tax law change; second, a $12 million after tax charge related to severance programs. These severance programs are tied to the permanent cost reduction actions. Now let's move to Slide 14. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. All debt is unsecured and our net significant maturity is in 2024. Our cash position remains strong and increased to $1.4 billion in the quarter and is expected to increase again in the fourth quarter. As we look into next year, we will use cash on hand to pay down the 2021 outstanding notes in the first quarter of 2021. A couple of additional items of note, first, our $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Second, we have reduced our AR securitization program. Prior to the separation earlier this year we historically sold $350 million worth of AR each quarter. Beginning in the first quarter of this year, the amount of AR sold through the securitization program was decreased each quarter approximately $20 million decrease in the first quarter, a $30 million decrease in the second quarter and a $45 million increase in the third quarter. The total decrease has been approximately $95 million year-to-date from $350 million of AR sold at the end of 2019 to approximately $255 million of AR sold at the end of the third quarter. The $95 million reduction in AR sold; it\u2019s effectively a repayment of debt, unfavorably impact year-to-date adjusted free cash flow. Before turning it back to John to cover the 2020 outlook, let me review some assumptions on Slide 15. Depreciation and amortization is expected to improve to approximately $270 million for the year. The annual operational tax rate is also expected to improve and be in the range of 27% to 29% for the full year. Regarding CapEx, we\u2019re once again reducing our annual CapEx spend outlook to approximately $160 million for the year, which is a historical low at 3% of revenue. Lastly, as a result of the common stock share repurchases in the third quarter, we\u2019re allowing the expected fourth quarter diluted share count to approximately 437 million shares and the full year average diluted share count to approximately 439 million shares. Now let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken. Now let me discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2020. We are improving the outlook and narrowing the ranges, the improvement strengthened the sales, increases EBITDA, increases EBITDA margins and less the earnings per share compared to the prior outlook. Revenues in the fourth quarter are expected to be $1.23 billion plus or minus $30 million and price increases are expected to continue. EBITDA are in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $255 million plus or minus $15 million. We are once again increasing our annual permanent cost at target to $185 million from $150 million. These are savings realized in the year. Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin is now increased to 20% to 21% from the prior midpoint of 20%. I think this may be the most significant item of our call this morning beyond the good cash generation. Annual earnings per share improves to a range of $0.68 to $0.76. Cash generation in the quarters from separation Q2 to Q4 is strong and unchanged at $450 million plus or minus $50 million despite the third quarter incremental reduction in AR securitization of $45 million. Year-end cash is expected to increase once again to approximately $1.5 billion. The event cash balance includes $95 million of annual reduction in AR securitization and $51 million of common stock repurchases at the average price of $17.36. Approximately $300 million of share purchase authority remains under prior announced Board authorization. Fourth quarter net debt of approximately $3.6 billion, which is an improvement post-separation, which was started out at $3.8 billion. As we move into 2021, you plan to use cash on hand to repay the outstanding 2021 bond maturities. During these uncertain times, we focused on the areas, which we control, including price, variable cost flexing, structural cost reductions, CapEx reductions, and free cash flow. While being prudent with our cash to opportunistically, we pay down debt and we purchased shares. Moreover, a diverse portfolio less than 50% of revenue tied to commercial aerospace is delivering strong results while we wait for commercial aerospace to recover. Let\u2019s move to Slide 17. To summarize, our third quarter was delivered in line or better than the implied outlook. Cost and price leverage has been deployed. We have healthy and improving liquidity with positive cash flows in this COVID environment. The fourth quarter outlook improved regarding revenues, margins and profitability with earnings per share guidance raised. Now let me turn it over to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning.\nJohn Plant: Good morning, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: John, I\u2019ll have to make my one question about this news we saw recently about Pratt & Whitney planning to start building airfoils in North Carolina. And basically, how you view that, what it might reflect about customer behavior and what implications you may have for Howmet and for your own strategy.\nJohn Plant: Okay. First of all, we\u2019ve discussed this with Pratt, but when you reflect on the situation in the industry, we work with companies already that have their own casting capabilities. So for example, GE, Roll-Royce, Safran, all have casting foundries. And so that in itself is nothing new to us. And when we look at Pratt & Whitney, in fact, they had their own casting capability until they exited in 2016. So we have a pattern and a history of working with our customers in this environment. So it\u2019s \u2013 I would say it\u2019s nothing new for us. We do feel confident in our position as a innovation and technology leader, especially in the hot section of the engine. And indeed, we produce some very specialized plates, which quite extraordinary capabilities for the JSF, which is a fighter jet engine. And if I comment a little bit further, so that you can understand some of the \u2013 I\u2019ll say depths in our capabilities. We do go to the extent of building our own furnaces. We have proprietary \u2013 core preparation, waxing, and casting processes and measuring and controlling the temperature gradient starting off with an average of 300 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the casting temperatures or maximum casting temperatures of our competitors. So well, one of the things we do is by keeping all of that production equipment in-house and really not \u2013 really speaking about how and why we do it in any technical detail, enables us to keep, I think the technology edge, and in particular, the scale that we had with it and the know-how capability. And I think as you know, we\u2019ve been in this business now in the 50 or 60 years. So I think we have all three levels of casting capabilities and all of the sub-processes, and to replicate that \u2013 which Howmet has. We probably take in the region of towards $10 billion of capital plus or minus. So I always absolutely expect everything that our customers do. And probably more importantly, we have a competitive environment already with other competitors. Currently, we are the market leader by probably 1.5 times, but I think it comes down to those very unique capabilities that we have and the experience of working very collaboratively with our customers to do the most extraordinary applications, where they already have in-house capabilities. And so this would mark Pratt & Whitney returning to being a having in-house capability alongside GE Aviation, Rolls-Royce and Safran. So hopefully, that covers it up for you.\nSeth Seifman: Okay, very good. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn: Good morning. John, two things. First, a clarification on what you just said, and then a question. Just specifically on Pratt, how protected is that position with contracts and LTAs, if you think about your overall revenue there. And then just given your visibility on commercial aero, which I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s any better than anybody else\u2019s, but you seem to have the confidence. Want to guide up today to buy back stock. Can you talk about trends from here on that 56% decline in Q3 in commercial aero revenue? How you\u2019re thinking about that percentage number as we go forward the next few quarters. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Okay. I don\u2019t think it was much to add to the Pratt & Whitney conversation. We do have a long-term agreement covering menus in place. So I think that\u2019s the good in all of this. So unless anything else, I\u2019ll move on to how we see the balance of year and into 2021 for us. We did call out the third quarter in a previous earnings call in early August that we felt that it would be the low. We felt that it would be the most severely impacted by inventory reduction to that customers. And as you know, we operate both the first tier place directly with Boeing and Airbus. And also a second tier place, in terms of some of the engine parts that we supply to the engine manufacturers. And so you get an increased inventory effect as you go through another tier in the supply chain. And that\u2019s what we felt back in August and try to indicate before also calling out back then that we felt as though the majority of the severity of the inventory reduction. We would try to accommodate and work with our customers to accommodate you sooner rather than later, rather than have it drag out in a long tail. And we are clear that \u2013 we\u2019re not completely through this, it\u2019s going to continue and we\u2019ll have an impact into the fourth quarter and in some areas into the early part of 2021. And that\u2019s taking to accounts, the plan increase in Airbus narrow-body sales. We are not taking that into account at this point. But we do feel that revenues will improve in the fourth quarter. And that gives us the platform that we always sought to really get 2021 framed as best as we could. And maybe talk at amplify that point, we set out back in the depths of the as quick tug of war back in the second quarter, where we didn\u2019t know very much. But our target was to move quickly and to address the problems that we saw coming from the commercial aerospace markets. And target that we would ambitiously try to achieve the exit rate EBITDA margin in that 20% area. We indicated that, clearly, feel confident enough now that we increased the midpoint of that fourth quarter guidance a little bit, and feel solid around that. And that was really to try to give the best view we could as the exit rate, which obviously helps when we view 2021 profitability. Albeit, today we\u2019re not guiding at all, either for revenues or margins for 2021, that really is fourth quarter call at the end of January, early February. So we are confident that the third quarter, it was low. We do see revenues in the fourth quarter, increasing \u2013 and increasing not just in commercial transportation, which is self-evident, but also in commercial aerospace for us, part of it is the \u2013 just the natural rebound from the in-vitro takeout in Q4. I mean, where we go from here? And there\u2019s so many things that we need to think about for 2021. And you look out a year from now, clearly, you\u2019ll know a lot more three months from now, whether it\u2019s this morning\u2019s vaccine news or whether it\u2019s our narrow bodies, as strong as we see has max been completely recertified around the world and what\u2019s the build rate and build rate going into 2022. And it was the inventory bill to accommodate all of that. So there are so many factors, but I say, maybe I\u2019ve spoken too long enough, but it\u2019s really is comprehensive. The third quarter is still low. And we are going to see that defense strength continue in IGT strength into the fourth quarter rebound in commercial aerospace sales, and commercial transportation currently with the wind behind its back in terms of volumes from our customers for commercial trucking and trade manufacturer.\nRobert Spingarn: Do you see commercial aero trending up sequentially quarter by quarter from here, at least from the down 56% in Q3?\nJohn Plant: I\u2019m not going to go beyond the fourth quarter at this point. I don\u2019t feel as though, I know enough to really give clarity publicly about the quarter sequential production through next year. I think we need a little bit more knowledge. I\u2019m hoping that the production of Boeing begins to increase next year for the narrow-body, not expecting anything from wide-body. And we await confirmation as the Airbus situation in terms of solidification of that in production schedules, which Airbus did announce their increased up almost 20% in narrow-body production in the halfway through next year. So I feel good that we see an improvement in the fourth quarter mapping out 2021 and what happened in each quarter is just a bridge too far for us at this point.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nJohn Plant: Hi, David.\nDavid Strauss: John or Ken, I wanted to go back on your comments on working capital, I think prior you\u2019ve been calling for working capital, but to be a tailwind this year, but it sounded like, now you\u2019re talking about maybe it being a headwind for the full year, but then some inventory release in 2021. So if you could clarify that, and then, I guess, any sort of early indication or early look in terms of how you\u2019re thinking pension next year. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: So maybe, if I start at a top level to say, why we see working capital recorded differently is to be used this year. And then I'm going to hand across to Tolga to talk a little bit about dropped inventory, what we have this year and then into next year. So let's do in that sequence. And let's say I cover the two points, which is, why used this year and then the pension side. And pass-across to Tolga. So, the use essentially is that AR securitization paid out. It goes through \u2013 its fixed working capital and it goes through that line on the cash flow statements. If you exempted the AR of 95 million, then there would be a working capital inflow for the year. So it's a function of the accounting around the securitization. One thing David that I've always felt a little bit uncomfortable about this, we had this off-balance sheet financing which was a carryover from Alcoa. The 2016 separation, a carryover from the Arconic separation, carried that securitization into \u2013 which is always been the main curve and wanted to gradually work that down, which is effectively just working down of our net debt of the company and feel that's a good thing to do. And it also improves the interest carrying cost of the company, so that's the principle reason around it. And if you were to do that, you'll see AR improving AP under good control and our inventory is being reduced. So the normal definition of working capital would be in good shape, and it's just a function of this AR securitization paid out, which goes to the working capital line. I will comment on pension and pass across to Tolga. So pension, at the moment, we do see that \u2013 the thought basically is that 2021 will be lower. And then 2020 in terms of pension contributions, we'll give you a more exact number on that at the time we announce our fourth quarter results, say early Feb. Tolga, if I could ask you to comment on dropped inventory, both through our Engine and Fastener segments and also the move into 2021.\nTolga Oal: Sure, John. It's important to highlight that we are reducing our inventory and we are supporting the cash generation. However we feel looking at the scale of the reduction set this stranded inventory in-hand, did they saw in-hand translation, yes naturally under pressure. So the two segments that had the highest pressure on the stranded inventory are our Engines and Structures businesses. So I mentioned that we are working very closely with our customers to level load the demand and the production levels, especially on the Structure side, especially on the long peak time orders. And therefore we project that this stranded inventory will continue into 2021, and we should be balancing curtails on hand within 2021. We are managing also the stranded inventory on the Engine side. And we have some more adjustments if we are working with our customers, but we expect that impact to be much smaller. And we got minimal impacts for the segments like Fasteners on the stranded inventory side that we are actively managing today.\nDavid Strauss: Great, thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen, please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: John, if you wouldn't mind opining on kind of the pricing opportunity in 2021, 2022 and 2023. At the Investor Day, you gave kind of a longer term outlook, and I wonder how that's changed maybe relative to 2020\u2019s actual price realization, if you can give us any flavor for that. That'd be helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Okay. Thank you. Well, first of all, let me comment on 2020, it's not complete. And you saw the third quarter comparative to the second quarter, the solidification and completion of those \u2013 there was a grievance for 2020, so all done. Regarding 2021, the several LTA is involved as always as you know they are different customers, different years, different products, as they all separate. The dialogue as you know covers price, share, share of unique technology programs and, also terms and conditions. I'm pleased with progress so far on 2021. There are a couple of major ones within 2021. And basically I'm going to say to you that everything that we are seeing is going to be consistent with what I've said before, that 2021 will be on the same volume basis a bigger year for us than 2020. This of course plays well into \u2013 as you go into 2022 and 2023 when hopefully commercial aerospace volumes get to show increases and hopefully significant increases. And so those increases \u2013 price increase do get applied to the higher volume sales. If I look at the current status for 2021, we're currently about 60% complete. So we're probably a little bit earlier than normal in engaging this item through. I expect that will continue to fill-in over the next few months. But the important thing is 60% of what 2021 is now not complete upside. And in 2023 \u2013 2022, I don't believe that will be as bigger year as 2021, but there's not much color I'm able to give you yet on 2022 and 2023 apart from we still see ourselves in the positive side.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nCarter Copeland: Hey, good morning gentlemen.\nJohn Plant: Hey Carter.\nCarter Copeland: John, I wondered if you could maybe just clarify the share comment you made earlier, the 1.5 times does that imply a 60-40 split and if that's not right if you could correct that for me. And then I just wondered if you might kind of give us a sense of hot section versus cold section, you went to great length talking about the capabilities on the hot section air foils. And I just wondered if you could around that share disclosure, give us a sense where in the engine that might be higher or lower than the aggregate. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Okay. When we exited 2019, our share was \u2013 the airfoil market was around about 49% plus or minus 0.5% or 1%. Next largest competitor was, it went around 32%, 33%, so it was about 50% greater than next largest competitor. So at an RMS basis, that\u2019s on market share basis, we\u2019re 1.5 times. If you break it down, then our market shares would be higher at the first few blades in the turbine. So we'd be at the hot or super hot end of the \u2013 at the turbine where our market shares would be excited. So the purpose of this call in excess of 60% in that area and more. And depending upon the application could be as much as a 100%. So, that gives you some idea of the market share \u2013 relative market share and topology within the engine.\nCarter Copeland: Great. Thank you for the color.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: I was wondering in your raise for the year, was that mostly due to how much wheels has recovered and aerospace was comparable to what you saw last quarter, or if you could provide some color on that? And then also the incremental margin on a sequential basis in wheels was like 49%. I mean, what's kind of a sustainable incremental margin for that business. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Okay. First of all, clearly, wheels is a benefit to us as we move Q3 into Q4. That is not the sole reason for the improvement in the EBITDA margin guide. We're also seeing a benefit in saying that commercial aerospace business. So it's really in all aspects of the business. There's nothing which is currently lagging in our plans or any of the implementation as the cost flexing, no structural cost takeout. So it's across the board. But clearly within that, when I look at and the strengths of the wheels businesses is coming through. And I'm hopeful that our EBITDA as we go \u2013 we start up in 2021. We'll be getting close, or if not as good as the 2019 margin rate, even though we know we will not see some revenues in 2021 as good as 2019. In the last earnings call, I did state that we saw revenues in that business, getting back to the 2019 levels in 2022. But I think we are looking forward to margins getting there back to the year earlier than that, given the structural cost takeouts and cost flexing. And basically improved in cost base that we have. \nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. Thank you very much. \nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Josh Sullivan with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning, John and Ken. Just the question on fasteners, you mentioned some weeding out of unprofitable products. How much volume did that include? Have you outright exited at any aerospace products in particularly just some color there would be great?\nJohn Plant: First of all, let me backup and give Tolga bit of thinking time on the Fastener side where \u2013 but the exit of the \u2013 what we talked about the unprofitable contract, we haven't called out the segment of particular interest. It wasn't fasteners. We're in, I think largely good shape. There's always things you can do to try to look at certain things which are below the performance. But basically this was the agent of something which was loss making and needed to be dealt with to, I didn't want to carry that problem going forward. But maybe as a broader comment on fasteners probably if you'd like to see \u2013 where we see basically apart from one or two areas we are fairly good shape.\nKen Giacobbe: Yes. I just would like to clarify that. My comment about beating out was on the structure side if your contract is we are in renegotiating our pricing. And in general, it has been very positive for structures and certain part numbers they were historically not good. So it'd be continuously shows the option not to renew those parts. It's in the big picture and that's significant for us and beneficial for the business. And specifically talking about the fasteners, our contract negotiations are going very positive and the renewables have been very good. And we do not really have any specific action to specifically looking to big numbers of contracts that are given us margin issues. But again, overall it has been a very positive contract renewable for all of our segments, including structures, fasteners, and engines.\nJohn Plant: Is it covered that Josh?\nJosh Sullivan: Yes. Thank you. \nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question will come from Paretosh Misra with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nParetosh Misra: Thank you. And thanks, John and Ken for all the color. Actually I had a question for Tolga, if I may. Tolga, you've been with the firm now a bit hunger. So just curious, any initial impression as to what you have seen and what are some of the opportunities for the firm that you see ahead? Anything that surprised you? Obviously, very unusual time to start a new role, but would appreciate any thoughts that you could share with us?\nTolga Oal: Sure. I think, I'd like to start with the comment that continuation of leadership at Howmet Aerospace is key for a success. So, I here being immersed and involved deeply in our businesses since my announcement at the Investor Day, just with the separation of scores and then the COVID-19 crisis. I have been leading to cost containment, cash preservation activities, driving key supplier and customer negotiations. And most importantly, I'd like to emphasize that I have been strengthening the fundamentals of the operating playbook that John is introduced to Howmet last year. And John and I have been working on this operating playbook for a long time. And we have a plan with John that we're rolling out step by step, and we are definitely seeing the results and the benefits of having our disciplines, training playbook in place that we continue rolling busier and real continual, so as our regular process going into next year as well. Does that answer the question?\nParetosh Misra: Yes. I appreciate that. Thanks. \nTolga Oal: Thank you, Paretosh.\nJohn Plant: Thanks Paretosh.\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up question from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes, John. I just wanted to pursue a little bit more of my questions. So is aerospace better in the fourth quarter than you thought it was going to be in the third quarter? And if so, in what way? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: I suspect the benefit, I mean slightly better volumes than we'd anticipated. So we \u2013 so the revenue increase. So that it's not just the wheel. So it's a little bit better there. But that could also be done to conservative assumptions that we tend to do to roll with. I think the cost takeout that you\u2019ve see both on the structural side about cost takeout, do you see that improve that'd be better. And then, probably even more important to create a bigger number than the structural cost takeout is our variable cost takeout, which we've never called out the absolute dollars, because I think reached the relevance about is the percentage and are you getting close to what we call the perfect flex. And we see ourselves flexing our cost base a little bit better, well, across all the areas, but in particular where the [indiscernible] commercial aerospace business. That flexing of the cost base has been at higher order than with \u2013 again plan for \u2013 again, partly because we tend to plan conservatively and then see if we can exceed it. So that's where it's at. I'm not saying that there is any increase in aircraft build or anything like that, that's not the case, but it could be in the fourth quarter more of the assumptions that we made. But at this point, we feel confident about the revenue lift that we've talked about and the cost takeout, and therefore, the improvement in the EBITDA margins that we've called out, because for us that's all about the platform we enter 2021 with.\nGeorge Shapiro: Thanks very much for the follow-up.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is a follow-up from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks for the additional question. John, I was wondering if you could maybe frame for us or level set us on why the company is able to get pricing in what looks like a particularly stressed time for your customers. And is it a \u2013 is it sort of a rolling one-time mark to market on some of the contracts that Howmet inherited from the legacy companies maybe that were off commercial terms relative to your competitors, and therefore you just kind of reset the market maybe FX, energy, pass-throughs on metal, things like that weren't \u2013 you were taking too much risk on the legacy contracts relative to your competitors? Or is it in fact the customers wanting \u2013 recognizing the value you guys provide and just you're seeing price inflation in the end market? Because again, I'm just trying to square with what you guys said before your time as CEO. Arconic used to talk about price deflation as a reality in aerospace and used to have floating bar charts that showed it on your slides, and now we're talking about the opposite trend over an extended period in a downturn. So just if you could help square why that is still true? Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean I'm not able to comment on predecessor management stance toward it. I originate from an industry which is called the, you know what I mean, which is probably more used to price deflation and the attempted commoditization of the input products for vehicle assembly. But even in there, when I always looked at it very closely, getting immersed in the technical capabilities and performance differentiation of the products, so, even there, for example, I don't believe the steering wheel on a vehicle is all steering wheels are equal. They're very different in terms of capabilities, cosmetics and quality delivered. So it really is trying to really understand the performance differentiation of the product. I'd like to believe that Howmet provides that not only in product quality and technology, but also in delivery performance and consistency with our customers. And I've always tried to work collaboratively with our customers to maximize the value for both of us. And so inherently, I've not thought of the aerospace parts marketing quite the same way as the vehicle parts market. I don't believe inherently that it is in a consistent price deflation or anything like that. I think there is product capabilities that most of the parts that are produced in aerospace are technological wonders in their own rights and achieve a level of safety and performance for the traveling public, which is quite extraordinary. And so, my hats off to everybody in the industry, but the second tier level and first tier level are obviously the plane manufacture themselves. But within that, I do think \u2013 I don't believe this is just any correction of the past. If there is a correction, it's just \u2013 we have cleaned up one or two contracts, which were, let's say, inappropriate item that's \u2013 and I tried to indicate that on an earlier comment on the call that I think we're now beyond that in dealing with such things, and that's why I called out the $8 million in the quarter in the normal operating results not as a special item. And then I just think it\u2019s consistent application of those technical characteristics. So we're never resting, if you look at the some of the developments that we're making within our portfolio, both in terms of parts for radar or parts for engines, we are trying to advance them all the time, and I did try to call out in the descriptors of those things, which we truly tried to protect even to the extent of not buying a lot of the machine tools outside. So, that knowledge can't leak out into the wider market place. And so, when you go to that level of assets of making your own equipment, because it gives you that technical, I'd say, capabilities which we think is extraordinary, I think that does give you the ability to look at price and also the \u2013 I'd say the value produced at the scale with which we do that and I often think people underestimate scale within such things about the economics of production and also the methodology, which you can create the scale. So it's a long way of saying, I think the attitudinal stance is different. At the same time, I do recognize that there are parts that we are able to improve the economics on the parts that we do concede price to our customers. So, it's always a range and a good negotiation is always important that we had in place of equanimity where everybody is feeling good and the shares are settled and the prices are settled and then we move on for several years. And in the ground, we've just been implementing we're at further five years on the majority of our parts going forward. So that's again a good condition to be in. I've not commented about the adjustment for any percentage increases, I think that's not appropriate, neither I commented on shares [indiscernible] apart from, we are in the right zone that we thought we'd be in and I think \u2013 and everybody from ourselves and our customers were at a place of \u2013 in a good zone.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Gautam.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nJohn Plant: Thank you.",

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, PT, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to this morning's call. I plan to give an overview of Howmet's third quarter performance. Tolga will speak to segment information, and then Ken will provide further financial detail. Lastly, I will return to talk to the outlook for the fourth quarter and 2020 financial year. Please move to Slide #4. The third quarter performance was good and in line with expectations, including strong cash generation. Revenue in the quarter was $1.1 billion, down 37% year-over-year, and was impacted by commercial aerospace being down 56% driven by customer inventory corrections. We continue to expect that this is the low point for Howmet revenues while anticipating there could be some lingering inventory corrections that could carry over into the fourth quarter and possibly the first half of 2021. Commercial transportation was down year-over-year, but we had healthy sequential growth to 42%, which flavored the impacts the forged wheels and commercial transportation fastening segment. Moreover, we had growth in defense aerospace and in the industrial gas turbine business year-over-year. The mix of our portfolio has changed with approximately 40% of Q3 revenue being tied to commercial aerospace. Operating income excluding Special items was $100 million and this includes the buyout of an unfavorable long-term contract, which costs $8 million. This hopefully should be the last of the cleanup items over the last year. Segment decremental margins including the contract termination were 37% year-over-year. I had indicated on the Q2 call that the third quarter was likely to be more decremented than the second quarter and reflects that we chose not to take out costs for one quarter and risk not having the people assets in place meet what we expect to be an uptick in future demand. For example, early in the third quarter, we completed all of the people reductions in our wheel segment and I've since pull people back on furlough, I have begun recruitment in certain countries as you bring production assets back online, both of our forgings and machining lines. Structural cost reductions will continue within each of the aerospace segments to the end of 2020 and in the first quarter in Europe. Third quarter reflects further structural cost takeout of $56 million making year-to-date cost takeout of $137 million, which is ahead of target. This structural cost takeout is in addition to the flexing of variable costs, which we expect by the end of first quarter 2021 should be at a perfect flex. Further to this price increases of $14 million were achieved in the third quarter compared to $9 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date price increases are $28 million. I am pleased that all of the 2020 long-term contract negotiations are now completed and price negotiations are well underway for the 2021 long-term agreements. Now let's move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in the third quarter was very good at $188 million before further reductions in the accounts receivable securitization program and cash flow was $143 million after the reduction in the AR program. The $45 million of the accounts securitization reduction was effectively repayment of debt. Cash severance payments in the quarter were $14 million. The third quarter cash balance increased to $1.4 billion after the $51 million of common stock share repurchases, which were at an average price of $17.36. Our peak operational cash requirements are approximately $300 million, which results in excess cash in hand of well over $1 billion. Net debt to EBITDA is approximately 3.2 times and our revolver of $1 billion continues to be undrawn. So let us move to Slide 5. All plants are running with employee and partner safety being a top priority. We're actively monitoring employee health risks and all programs meet or exceed local standards. To best serve our customers we're effectively managing daily adjustments or customer inventory corrections and shutdowns. Regarding cost out, most of the North American permanent personnel reductions have been completed and are ahead of targets. Therefore, we will be raising our 2020 permanent cost outlook. We also continue to flex variable spend and labor effectively with revenue. Our strict and disciplined capital expenditure process has been effective. And we will once again be reducing our annual capital expenditure outlook. Lastly, we're focused on working capital, but expect it to be use of cash in 2020, as we have reduced our AR securitization program by approximately $95 million year-to-date. Moreover, we have stranded inventory, which we expect to be a source of cash in 2021. Now, let me turn it over to Tolga. Thanks, Ken. Now let me discuss the outlook for the remainder of 2020. We are improving the outlook and narrowing the ranges, the improvement strengthened the sales, increases EBITDA, increases EBITDA margins and less the earnings per share compared to the prior outlook. Revenues in the fourth quarter are expected to be $1.23 billion plus or minus $30 million and price increases are expected to continue. EBITDA are in the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately $255 million plus or minus $15 million. We are once again increasing our annual permanent cost at target to $185 million from $150 million. These are savings realized in the year. Our fourth quarter EBITDA margin is now increased to 20% to 21% from the prior midpoint of 20%. I think this may be the most significant item of our call this morning beyond the good cash generation. Annual earnings per share improves to a range of $0.68 to $0.76. Cash generation in the quarters from separation Q2 to Q4 is strong and unchanged at $450 million plus or minus $50 million despite the third quarter incremental reduction in AR securitization of $45 million. Year-end cash is expected to increase once again to approximately $1.5 billion. The event cash balance includes $95 million of annual reduction in AR securitization and $51 million of common stock repurchases at the average price of $17.36. Approximately $300 million of share purchase authority remains under prior announced Board authorization. Fourth quarter net debt of approximately $3.6 billion, which is an improvement post-separation, which was started out at $3.8 billion. As we move into 2021, you plan to use cash on hand to repay the outstanding 2021 bond maturities. During these uncertain times, we focused on the areas, which we control, including price, variable cost flexing, structural cost reductions, CapEx reductions, and free cash flow. While being prudent with our cash to opportunistically, we pay down debt and we purchased shares. Moreover, a diverse portfolio less than 50% of revenue tied to commercial aerospace is delivering strong results while we wait for commercial aerospace to recover. Let's move to Slide 17. To summarize, our third quarter was delivered in line or better than the implied outlook. Cost and price leverage has been deployed. We have healthy and improving liquidity with positive cash flows in this COVID environment. The fourth quarter outlook improved regarding revenues, margins and profitability with earnings per share guidance raised. Now let me turn it over to take your questions. Good morning, Seth. Okay. First of all, we've discussed this with Pratt, but when you reflect on the situation in the industry, we work with companies already that have their own casting capabilities. So for example, GE, Roll-Royce, Safran, all have casting foundries. And so that in itself is nothing new to us. And when we look at Pratt & Whitney, in fact, they had their own casting capability until they exited in 2016. So we have a pattern and a history of working with our customers in this environment. So it's \u2013 I would say it's nothing new for us. We do feel confident in our position as a innovation and technology leader, especially in the hot section of the engine. And indeed, we produce some very specialized plates, which quite extraordinary capabilities for the JSF, which is a fighter jet engine. And if I comment a little bit further, so that you can understand some of the \u2013 I'll say depths in our capabilities. We do go to the extent of building our own furnaces. We have proprietary \u2013 core preparation, waxing, and casting processes and measuring and controlling the temperature gradient starting off with an average of 300 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the casting temperatures or maximum casting temperatures of our competitors. So well, one of the things we do is by keeping all of that production equipment in-house and really not \u2013 really speaking about how and why we do it in any technical detail, enables us to keep, I think the technology edge, and in particular, the scale that we had with it and the know-how capability. And I think as you know, we've been in this business now in the 50 or 60 years. So I think we have all three levels of casting capabilities and all of the sub-processes, and to replicate that \u2013 which Howmet has. We probably take in the region of towards $10 billion of capital plus or minus. So I always absolutely expect everything that our customers do. And probably more importantly, we have a competitive environment already with other competitors. Currently, we are the market leader by probably 1.5 times, but I think it comes down to those very unique capabilities that we have and the experience of working very collaboratively with our customers to do the most extraordinary applications, where they already have in-house capabilities. And so this would mark Pratt & Whitney returning to being a having in-house capability alongside GE Aviation, Rolls-Royce and Safran. So hopefully, that covers it up for you. Thank you. Okay. I don't think it was much to add to the Pratt & Whitney conversation. We do have a long-term agreement covering menus in place. So I think that's the good in all of this. So unless anything else, I'll move on to how we see the balance of year and into 2021 for us. We did call out the third quarter in a previous earnings call in early August that we felt that it would be the low. We felt that it would be the most severely impacted by inventory reduction to that customers. And as you know, we operate both the first tier place directly with Boeing and Airbus. And also a second tier place, in terms of some of the engine parts that we supply to the engine manufacturers. And so you get an increased inventory effect as you go through another tier in the supply chain. And that's what we felt back in August and try to indicate before also calling out back then that we felt as though the majority of the severity of the inventory reduction. We would try to accommodate and work with our customers to accommodate you sooner rather than later, rather than have it drag out in a long tail. And we are clear that \u2013 we're not completely through this, it's going to continue and we'll have an impact into the fourth quarter and in some areas into the early part of 2021. And that's taking to accounts, the plan increase in Airbus narrow-body sales. We are not taking that into account at this point. But we do feel that revenues will improve in the fourth quarter. And that gives us the platform that we always sought to really get 2021 framed as best as we could. And maybe talk at amplify that point, we set out back in the depths of the as quick tug of war back in the second quarter, where we didn't know very much. But our target was to move quickly and to address the problems that we saw coming from the commercial aerospace markets. And target that we would ambitiously try to achieve the exit rate EBITDA margin in that 20% area. We indicated that, clearly, feel confident enough now that we increased the midpoint of that fourth quarter guidance a little bit, and feel solid around that. And that was really to try to give the best view we could as the exit rate, which obviously helps when we view 2021 profitability. Albeit, today we're not guiding at all, either for revenues or margins for 2021, that really is fourth quarter call at the end of January, early February. So we are confident that the third quarter, it was low. We do see revenues in the fourth quarter, increasing \u2013 and increasing not just in commercial transportation, which is self-evident, but also in commercial aerospace for us, part of it is the \u2013 just the natural rebound from the in-vitro takeout in Q4. I mean, where we go from here? And there's so many things that we need to think about for 2021. And you look out a year from now, clearly, you'll know a lot more three months from now, whether it's this morning's vaccine news or whether it's our narrow bodies, as strong as we see has max been completely recertified around the world and what's the build rate and build rate going into 2022. And it was the inventory bill to accommodate all of that. So there are so many factors, but I say, maybe I've spoken too long enough, but it's really is comprehensive. The third quarter is still low. And we are going to see that defense strength continue in IGT strength into the fourth quarter rebound in commercial aerospace sales, and commercial transportation currently with the wind behind its back in terms of volumes from our customers for commercial trucking and trade manufacturer. I'm not going to go beyond the fourth quarter at this point. I don't feel as though, I know enough to really give clarity publicly about the quarter sequential production through next year. I think we need a little bit more knowledge. I'm hoping that the production of Boeing begins to increase next year for the narrow-body, not expecting anything from wide-body. And we await confirmation as the Airbus situation in terms of solidification of that in production schedules, which Airbus did announce their increased up almost 20% in narrow-body production in the halfway through next year. So I feel good that we see an improvement in the fourth quarter mapping out 2021 and what happened in each quarter is just a bridge too far for us at this point. Hi, David. So maybe, if I start at a top level to say, why we see working capital recorded differently is to be used this year. And then I'm going to hand across to Tolga to talk a little bit about dropped inventory, what we have this year and then into next year. So let's do in that sequence. And let's say I cover the two points, which is, why used this year and then the pension side. And pass-across to Tolga. So, the use essentially is that AR securitization paid out. It goes through \u2013 its fixed working capital and it goes through that line on the cash flow statements. If you exempted the AR of 95 million, then there would be a working capital inflow for the year. So it's a function of the accounting around the securitization. One thing David that I've always felt a little bit uncomfortable about this, we had this off-balance sheet financing which was a carryover from Alcoa. The 2016 separation, a carryover from the Arconic separation, carried that securitization into \u2013 which is always been the main curve and wanted to gradually work that down, which is effectively just working down of our net debt of the company and feel that's a good thing to do. And it also improves the interest carrying cost of the company, so that's the principle reason around it. And if you were to do that, you'll see AR improving AP under good control and our inventory is being reduced. So the normal definition of working capital would be in good shape, and it's just a function of this AR securitization paid out, which goes to the working capital line. I will comment on pension and pass across to Tolga. So pension, at the moment, we do see that \u2013 the thought basically is that 2021 will be lower. And then 2020 in terms of pension contributions, we'll give you a more exact number on that at the time we announce our fourth quarter results, say early Feb. Tolga, if I could ask you to comment on dropped inventory, both through our Engine and Fastener segments and also the move into 2021. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Well, first of all, let me comment on 2020, it's not complete. And you saw the third quarter comparative to the second quarter, the solidification and completion of those \u2013 there was a grievance for 2020, so all done. Regarding 2021, the several LTA is involved as always as you know they are different customers, different years, different products, as they all separate. The dialogue as you know covers price, share, share of unique technology programs and, also terms and conditions. I'm pleased with progress so far on 2021. There are a couple of major ones within 2021. And basically I'm going to say to you that everything that we are seeing is going to be consistent with what I've said before, that 2021 will be on the same volume basis a bigger year for us than 2020. This of course plays well into \u2013 as you go into 2022 and 2023 when hopefully commercial aerospace volumes get to show increases and hopefully significant increases. And so those increases \u2013 price increase do get applied to the higher volume sales. If I look at the current status for 2021, we're currently about 60% complete. So we're probably a little bit earlier than normal in engaging this item through. I expect that will continue to fill-in over the next few months. But the important thing is 60% of what 2021 is now not complete upside. And in 2023 \u2013 2022, I don't believe that will be as bigger year as 2021, but there's not much color I'm able to give you yet on 2022 and 2023 apart from we still see ourselves in the positive side. Thank you. Hey Carter. Okay. When we exited 2019, our share was \u2013 the airfoil market was around about 49% plus or minus 0.5% or 1%. Next largest competitor was, it went around 32%, 33%, so it was about 50% greater than next largest competitor. So at an RMS basis, that's on market share basis, we're 1.5 times. If you break it down, then our market shares would be higher at the first few blades in the turbine. So we'd be at the hot or super hot end of the \u2013 at the turbine where our market shares would be excited. So the purpose of this call in excess of 60% in that area and more. And depending upon the application could be as much as a 100%. So, that gives you some idea of the market share \u2013 relative market share and topology within the engine. Thank you. Okay. First of all, clearly, wheels is a benefit to us as we move Q3 into Q4. That is not the sole reason for the improvement in the EBITDA margin guide. We're also seeing a benefit in saying that commercial aerospace business. So it's really in all aspects of the business. There's nothing which is currently lagging in our plans or any of the implementation as the cost flexing, no structural cost takeout. So it's across the board. But clearly within that, when I look at and the strengths of the wheels businesses is coming through. And I'm hopeful that our EBITDA as we go \u2013 we start up in 2021. We'll be getting close, or if not as good as the 2019 margin rate, even though we know we will not see some revenues in 2021 as good as 2019. In the last earnings call, I did state that we saw revenues in that business, getting back to the 2019 levels in 2022. But I think we are looking forward to margins getting there back to the year earlier than that, given the structural cost takeouts and cost flexing. And basically improved in cost base that we have. Thank you. First of all, let me backup and give Tolga bit of thinking time on the Fastener side where \u2013 but the exit of the \u2013 what we talked about the unprofitable contract, we haven't called out the segment of particular interest. It wasn't fasteners. We're in, I think largely good shape. There's always things you can do to try to look at certain things which are below the performance. But basically this was the agent of something which was loss making and needed to be dealt with to, I didn't want to carry that problem going forward. But maybe as a broader comment on fasteners probably if you'd like to see \u2013 where we see basically apart from one or two areas we are fairly good shape. Is it covered that Josh? Thank you. Thanks Paretosh. I suspect the benefit, I mean slightly better volumes than we'd anticipated. So we \u2013 so the revenue increase. So that it's not just the wheel. So it's a little bit better there. But that could also be done to conservative assumptions that we tend to do to roll with. I think the cost takeout that you've see both on the structural side about cost takeout, do you see that improve that'd be better. And then, probably even more important to create a bigger number than the structural cost takeout is our variable cost takeout, which we've never called out the absolute dollars, because I think reached the relevance about is the percentage and are you getting close to what we call the perfect flex. And we see ourselves flexing our cost base a little bit better, well, across all the areas, but in particular where the [indiscernible] commercial aerospace business. That flexing of the cost base has been at higher order than with \u2013 again plan for \u2013 again, partly because we tend to plan conservatively and then see if we can exceed it. So that's where it's at. I'm not saying that there is any increase in aircraft build or anything like that, that's not the case, but it could be in the fourth quarter more of the assumptions that we made. But at this point, we feel confident about the revenue lift that we've talked about and the cost takeout, and therefore, the improvement in the EBITDA margins that we've called out, because for us that's all about the platform we enter 2021 with. Thank you. Yes. I mean I'm not able to comment on predecessor management stance toward it. I originate from an industry which is called the, you know what I mean, which is probably more used to price deflation and the attempted commoditization of the input products for vehicle assembly.

So we're never resting, if you look at the some of the developments that we're making within our portfolio, both in terms of parts for radar or parts for engines, we are trying to advance them all the time, and I did try to call out in the descriptors of those things, which we truly tried to protect even to the extent of not buying a lot of the machine tools outside.

I've not commented about the adjustment for any percentage increases, I think that's not appropriate, neither I commented on shares [indiscernible] apart from, we are in the right zone that we thought we'd be in and I think \u2013 and everybody from ourselves and our customers were at a place of \u2013 in a good zone.

So before moving into the revenue and segment profitability, I wanted to note that the third quarter revenue and profit was in line with expectations and better than the implied outlook that we provided on the second quarter earnings call. The improved performance will be reflected in the updated outlook for the remainder of the year. Now to the third quarter. Total revenue was down 37% year-over-year driven by commercial aerospace, which now represents approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, commercial aerospace was down 56% year-over-year. Consistent with our previous outlook, we expect the third quarter to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year as customers adjust inventory levels. Regarding the remaining 60% of the portfolio, I would point out that our second largest market, defense aerospace, continues to show year-over-year growth and was up 15% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new engine builds and engine spares. Our next largest market commercial transportation, which impacts both the forged wheels and the fastening system segment, was down 31% year-over-year. However, as Tolga has mentioned, we are seeing favorable trends for increased demand and this market improved 42% sequentially. Lastly, the industrial and other markets, which is comprised of industrial gas turbines, oil and gas, and general, industrial was down 4%. I would point out that IGT, which makes up approximately 40% of this market continues to be strong and was up 23%. Now let's move to Slide 8. On this slide, we are providing historical information for the combined segments with an estimated operational view of corporate. Compared to the prior year, third quarter revenue declined approximately $660 million with a corresponding segment operating profit decline of $246 million. Despite the 37% year-over-year revenue decline, we remained profitable and generated strong, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter. Included in the third quarter results are continued price increases of $14 million and continued permanent cost reductions of $56 million for a combined benefit of $70 million in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, price increases were $28 million and cost reductions were $137 million for our combined benefit of $165 million. One last comment on cost reductions of the $137 million realized year-to-date, this includes carry over benefits from our 2019 cost reduction program. This program generated $54 million of benefit year-to-date for 2020 and finished ahead of target. The program is now substantially complete. In the appendix we have provided additional information, including historical financials for each of the segments. Now let's move to Slide 9 to go into more detail on the segments. Engine Products year-over-year, revenue was down 43% in the quarter. In the segment, commercial aerospace was down 65% driven by COVID-19, 737 MAX production declines and customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by 18% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace and at 23% increase in IGT. Third quarter results were impacted by an $8 million charge to exit an unprofitable long-term contract. Cost reductions and price increases continued in the segment and the team continued to flex variable spending to mitigate the impact in the quarter of the significant decline in commercial aerospace revenue. Now let's move to the fastening systems segment on Slide 10. Also as expected, we experienced this deeper revenue decline in fasters as the third quarter year-over-year, revenue was down 31% driven by commercial aerospace and commercial transportation, both being down over 35%. Continued cost reductions, combined with third quarter price increases, helped mitigate the decrease in revenue. However, a weaker product mix, with less commercial aerospace and the expected delay in European cost reductions unfavorably impacted results. In the near term, we are furloughing employees to offset the delay in European cost reductions.  Now let's move to Slide 11 to review engineered structures. For the engineered structures segment, third quarter revenue was down 35%. Commercial aerospace was down 54%, driven by COVID-19 production declines on both the 787, and 737 MAX, as well as customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by a 26% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Cost reductions and price increases helped to mitigate the decrease in revenue, but structures experienced a weaker product mix with less commercial aerospace. Lastly, let's move to Slide 12 for forged wheels. In the third quarter, revenue for the forged wheel segment was down 29% year-over-year, but increased 52% sequentially as expected. Employees are returning from furloughs and we continue to quickly flex staffing at variable cost to meet changing market demand. Despite revenue being down 29%, the impact of cost reductions resulted in a healthy EBITDA margin for the quarter of 26%. Now let's move to Slide 13 for special items. Special items for the quarter was a net benefit of approximately $23 million after tax and included two items: first, a $36 million after tax benefit related to a U.S. tax law change; second, a $12 million after tax charge related to severance programs. These severance programs are tied to the permanent cost reduction actions. Now let's move to Slide 14. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. All debt is unsecured and our net significant maturity is in 2024. Our cash position remains strong and increased to $1.4 billion in the quarter and is expected to increase again in the fourth quarter. As we look into next year, we will use cash on hand to pay down the 2021 outstanding notes in the first quarter of 2021. A couple of additional items of note, first, our $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Second, we have reduced our AR securitization program. Prior to the separation earlier this year we historically sold $350 million worth of AR each quarter. Beginning in the first quarter of this year, the amount of AR sold through the securitization program was decreased each quarter approximately $20 million decrease in the first quarter, a $30 million decrease in the second quarter and a $45 million increase in the third quarter. The total decrease has been approximately $95 million year-to-date from $350 million of AR sold at the end of 2019 to approximately $255 million of AR sold at the end of the third quarter. The $95 million reduction in AR sold; it's effectively a repayment of debt, unfavorably impact year-to-date adjusted free cash flow. Before turning it back to John to cover the 2020 outlook, let me review some assumptions on Slide 15. Depreciation and amortization is expected to improve to approximately $270 million for the year. The annual operational tax rate is also expected to improve and be in the range of 27% to 29% for the full year. Regarding CapEx, we're once again reducing our annual CapEx spend outlook to approximately $160 million for the year, which is a historical low at 3% of revenue. Lastly, as a result of the common stock share repurchases in the third quarter, we're allowing the expected fourth quarter diluted share count to approximately 437 million shares and the full year average diluted share count to approximately 439 million shares. Now let me turn it back over to John. Yes. I just would like to clarify that. My comment about beating out was on the structure side if your contract is we are in renegotiating our pricing. And in general, it has been very positive for structures and certain part numbers they were historically not good. So it'd be continuously shows the option not to renew those parts. It's in the big picture and that's significant for us and beneficial for the business. And specifically talking about the fasteners, our contract negotiations are going very positive and the renewables have been very good. And we do not really have any specific action to specifically looking to big numbers of contracts that are given us margin issues. But again, overall it has been a very positive contract renewable for all of our segments, including structures, fasteners, and engines."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Please move to Slide 6. We summarized on Slide 6 the status of our segments. Aerospace segments continue with revenue adjustments that follow slightly different trends. Let me start with the Engine Products. All those strong defense aerospace and industrial gas turbine growth continued in third quarter, commercial aerospace had expected customer inventory corrections and seasonal shutdowns. We continue to expect that third quarter will be the lowest revenue quarter of 2020 and we are ahead of our permanent cost reduction plans. Additionally, we are flexing variable labor and indirect costs with revenue. Regarding our long-term agreements, 2020 negotiations are now complete and we are actively working on 2021 contracts. Our philosophy on price has not changed. The Engine Product segment's biggest challenge continues to be managing the stranded inventory, which had a modest reduction quarter-over-quarter. Moving to Fastening Systems, the Fastening Systems segment follows the lagging, reducing revenue trends mainly due to the timing of commercial aerospace distribution business. The decline in commercial aerospace is partially offsets by growth in fasteners industrial business. Regarding permanent cost reduction, that's the largest number of European locations within our business, which impacts the timing of cost reduction actions, but follows directionally the revenue reduction threat. We are bridging this timing with heavy furloughs and effective, variable cost flexing. Maintaining our critical talent and skill sets is our priority during this period. The Engineered Structures segment has long lead time orders requiring close discussions with our customers to level of their demands for an efficient operating model for the next six to nine months. Permanent cost reduction actions are ahead of plan. Long-term agreement pricing negotiations are complete for 2020, including weeding out unprofitable products.  In the Forged Wheels segment, third quarter 2020 revenue started recovering from second quarter 2020. As John mentioned, third quarter sequential revenue was up 42% as top U.S. shipping ports are near or above record levels of volume, which drives tracking demand. We expect continued growth in fourth quarter and have called employees back from furloughs and restarted operations. We have compressed permanent costs and having effective influx in production to meet customer demand. Lastly, we renewed one of our largest customer's long-term agreement while increasing share with our innovative, lightweight, 39-pound wheel. I will now hand it over to Ken to give more details on the financials. Sure, John. It's important to highlight that we are reducing our inventory and we are supporting the cash generation. However we feel looking at the scale of the reduction set this stranded inventory in-hand, did they saw in-hand translation, yes naturally under pressure. So the two segments that had the highest pressure on the stranded inventory are our Engines and Structures businesses. So I mentioned that we are working very closely with our customers to level load the demand and the production levels, especially on the Structure side, especially on the long peak time orders. And therefore we project that this stranded inventory will continue into 2021, and we should be balancing curtails on hand within 2021. We are managing also the stranded inventory on the Engine side. And we have some more adjustments if we are working with our customers, but we expect that impact to be much smaller. And we got minimal impacts for the segments like Fasteners on the stranded inventory side that we are actively managing today. Sure. I think, I'd like to start with the comment that continuation of leadership at Howmet Aerospace is key for a success. So, I here being immersed and involved deeply in our businesses since my announcement at the Investor Day, just with the separation of scores and then the COVID-19 crisis. I have been leading to cost containment, cash preservation activities, driving key supplier and customer negotiations. And most importantly, I'd like to emphasize that I have been strengthening the fundamentals of the operating playbook that John is introduced to Howmet last year. And John and I have been working on this operating playbook for a long time. And we have a plan with John that we're rolling out step by step, and we are definitely seeing the results and the benefits of having our disciplines, training playbook in place that we continue rolling busier and real continual, so as our regular process going into next year as well. Does that answer the question? Thank you, Paretosh."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. My name is Beverlyn, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Beverlyn. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace second quarter 2020 results conference call. I\u2019m joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today\u2019s presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we\u2019ve included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the appendix in today\u2019s presentation. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Good morning and thank you for joining the call. Today, with Ken, I also have Tolga Oal who is on the call. Tolga is our Co-CEO. Tolga has been immersed in the business since his announcement of CO-CEO back at time of Investor Day in February. Now, let\u2019s move to slide 4 to cover second quarter results. First, let me paint a picture of the quarter. As you\u2019ll recall, we saw the first significant disruptions related to COVID-19 in the last three weeks of March. The initial effects were quarantine related disruptions within Howmet plants and certain customers that ceased production, for example, Boeing, Airbus, Safran, et cetera. The full impact was felt in Q2 with customers\u2019 shutdowns, schedule cancellations, and Howmet plant disruptions. The results reflecting this impact show sales reduced year-over-year by some 31% and operating income, excluding special items by 42%. Nevertheless, we were pleased with the absolute numbers of 14.4% operating income margin and a 19.7% EBITDA margin. This reflects the swift cost containment actions undertaken, starting at the end of the first week of April. And you may recall that we took our initial restructuring charge in the first quarter results. These cost reductions continued to take effect each month in the second quarter and will continue into Q3 and Q4. Later in my remarks, I\u2019ll begin to focus more on our exit rate trajectory for 2020 as we move into 2021. Relative to second quarter EBITDA margin at 19.7%, Howmet also generated earnings per share of $0.12. Now, let\u2019s move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in Q2 was $76 million, excluding $11 million of separation costs. I\u2019d also point out that the $76 million of cash generation included the effect of three items. Firstly, we reduced our AR securitization for the second time in 2020 and a customer supply financing program by some $30 million. Second, we made $12 million of cash restructuring payments. And third, we made additional voluntary cash contributions to our UK pension plan of approximately $45 million to make a large reduction in the gross pension liability. For the absence of that, our free cash flow is after everything. And if we had not paid down the accounts receivable securitization, the UK pension under restructuring, the cash flow of $76 million would have been higher by some $87 million at over $163 million in the quarter. The cash balance for Q2 improved. After the separation of Arconic Corp. on April 1st, the opening cash balance of Howmet was approximately $800 million. At the end of the second quarter, the cash balance was $1.3 billion. The increase was due to approximately $65 million of cash generation after separation costs, and the net addition $420 million as a result of refinancing bonds from 2021 and 2022 to 2025. Net debt to EBITDA was 2.73 times. Revolver capacity of $1 billion is undrawn. Now, let\u2019s move on to slide five. We made rapid response to COVID-19 in the market declines. First, with regard to our employees and customers. Employee safety is a top priority. And we\u2019re actively managing employee health risks; programs meet or exceed local standards. All of our sites are now up and running. We are reliable partners to our customers who are critical to the national defense, to commercial aviation and to the global economy. Regarding profit and liquidity, management has undertaken the following actions: Furloughing some of the hourly workforce and reducing overtime; permanently reducing all types of labor, both hourly and salaried; the elimination of temporary workers; flexing of materials and services; reducing capital expenditures; and reducing our working capital. Lastly as I mentioned, we refinanced our 2021 and 2022 bonds into 2025 and added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet. And the revolver is undrawn. Now, let me turn it over to Ken to give more details on our second quarter performance. And then, I\u2019ll begin to speak to the outlook for the second half of the year.\nKen Giacobbe: Great. Thank you, John. Before getting started, I wanted to make a few comments on our basis of presentation. As a result of the separation on April 1, 2020, Howmet Aerospace has reported results of the separated entity, Arconic Corporation as discontinued operations for 1Q 2020 and prior periods. Per GAAP, it\u2019s important to note that corporate costs for the pre-separation periods were only allocated to Arconic Corporation if the costs were specifically attributable to the entity. Therefore, for pre-separation periods, Howmet retained 100% of all shared corporate costs. For 2019, Howmet statements will show approximately $190 million of corporate costs excluding special items, since the shared costs were not allocated to our Arconic Corporation. For clarity, we\u2019ve provided a schedule on slide 20 in the appendix, which is consistent with Howmet\u2019s 2020 Investor Day and shows an estimate of historical operational corporate costs. For 2019, the comparable annual operational corporate costs were estimated to be $100 million, rather than $190 million. Looking forward into 2020, operational corporate costs are expected to be approximately $75 million. So, let\u2019s move to slide 6. In the second quarter, commercial aerospace was 54% of total revenue, defense aerospace was 18%, commercial transportation was 12% and industrial combined with our other end markets was 16%. COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines most severely impacted the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, which were down 36% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. We continue to expect defense aerospace to grow year-over-year, due to the strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. In the second quarter, defense aerospace was up 3% year-over-year; and within the industrial and other markets, IGT was up 25% year-over-year. Now, let\u2019s move to slide 7. On this slide, we\u2019ve provided historical information for the combined segments with an estimated operational view of corporate. Howmet Aerospace will present financial information for four segments, Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Products and Forged Wheels. Compared to the prior year, 2Q revenue declined approximately $570 million with a corresponding segment operating profit decline of $160 million. The associated segment decremental margin for 2Q 2020 was approximately 28% year-over-year. Included in the results are price increases of $9 million, which are expected to continue in the second half. Additionally, cost reductions were $55 million in the quarter as we\u2019ve benefited from actions taken in early April as well as last year. Without the price increases,, the cost reductions, and a flex of variable cost in line with a significant and sudden revenue decline, segment operating profit decrement would have been more in the 37% range rather than the 28% range reported. In the appendix, we\u2019ve provided historical information for each of the segments. Now, let\u2019s move to slide eight. For each of the segments we\u2019ve provided historical revenue, segment operating profit and segment operating profit margin. We have also provided the revenue by market, split for the current quarter, as well as commentary on performance. First, we\u2019ll start with the largest segment, engines. For the second quarter, year-over-year revenue was down 30%. Commercial aerospace was down 44%, driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by a 7% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace, and a 25% increase in IGT as that market rebounds from a weak level in 2019. Price increases continued in the segment. Moreover, the team was able to quickly flex variable spending to mitigate the impact in the quarter of the significant decline in commercial aerospace revenue. The decremental margin for 2Q was 23% year-over-year. Now, let\u2019s move to fasteners on slide nine. For the fastener segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 18%. Commercial aerospace was down 15%, driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Fastener shipped overdues in the second quarter, and we expect a steeper revenue decline in 3Q as inventory levels are being adjusted at our customers, and we expect seasonal revenue declines driven by European operations. The fasteners commercial transportation business was down 43%. Cost reductions across the segment helped to mitigate a decrease in revenue but higher absenteeism and the delay in European cost reductions result in the 40% year-over-year decremental margin. Now, let\u2019s move to slide 10 to review structures. For the structures segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 31%. Commercial aerospace was down 40%, driven by COVID-19 and the 787 production declines. Decremental margins were 6% year-over-year. Price increases, cost reductions and exiting unprofitable businesses in 2019 allowed structures to increase operating margin by 70 basis points year-over-year, despite the 31% decline in revenue. Lastly, let\u2019s move to slide 11 for wheels. In the second quarter, the wheels segment was the hardest hit, with a 56% reduction in revenue year-over-year. Decremental margins were 47%. For the month of April, almost all of our OEM customers were shut down with a gradual recovery in May and June. Despite the significant and rapid revenue decline, the segment was profitable due to the rapid cost reductions as well as their ability to quickly flex variable spending. Now let\u2019s move to slide 12 for special items. Special items totaled $171 million on a pre-tax basis, which included three main items: First, a $64 million charge for pension plan settlements, primarily due to a voluntary action in the UK to reduce our gross pension liabilities by approximately $320 million; second, a $65 million charge related to the early redemption of 2020, 2021 and 2022 notes in the second quarter; and the third item was a $46 million charge related to severance programs that are tied to the 2020 cost reduction actions as we continue to navigate through a period of demand uncertainty. So, let\u2019s now move to Slide 13. In the second quarter, we\u2019ve completed a good deal of work to improve our capital structure and liquidity. We completed the following actions. We redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. We redeemed $889 million of our 2021 bonds, leaving $361 million, which will make mature in April of 2021. We redeemed $151 million of our 2022 bonds, leaving $476 million that will mature in February 2022. Lastly, we completed a new bond issue for $1.2 billion, which is due in May of 2025. Our next significant debt maturity is in October of 2024. We also amended our revolving credit facility in the second quarter. As a result of these actions, we were able to increase our cash position by approximately $420 million. We also took pressure off the balance sheet by reducing the near-term maturities and increased our available liquidity. Before turning it back over to John to discuss the 2020 outlook, let me cover some assumptions on slide 14. Corporate overhead is expected to improve to $75 million for the year, based on further cost reductions. Annual operational tax rate remains in the 28% to 30% range for the year, but we could have volatility in the quarters based on the current environment. Lastly, pension and OPEB cash contributions remain at $210 million for the year and include the discretionary 2Q payment of $45 million, which reduced the UK gross pension liability by $320 million. So, now, let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken. Let\u2019s move to slide 15. We are providing you an outlook, and that really is to give the best possible visibility to the Company. Of course, we have been monitoring air traffic around the world, and the best estimates of aircraft builds. And this leads us to provide this view to you for the balance of the year, given that we\u2019re well into the second half. However, we do recognize that there remains significant uncertainties regarding the external environment, for example, spikes regarding COVID-19, visibility of customer inventory corrections and aircraft build rate changes in the face of any further COVID spiking. Here are the salient points. Full year revenue is expected to be $5.2 billion for the year, plus or minus $100 million; commercial aerospace is expected to be down 35%, consistent with our previous view; commercial transportation is expected to be down 45%, which is a modest improvement from our prior view; defense aerospace and industrial are expected to be up, with defense aerospace up 10% and industrial up 5%. The consolidated annual revenue for all of our markets is expected to be down approximately 25% to 28% year-over-year. EBITDA is expected to be $1.03 billion for the year, plus or minus $$35 million, but it is made up of very different quarters. For example, in Q1, we had I think, a good level of revenues, nevertheless, offset by disruption in the last -- latter part of March, and then of course, the transition quarters, as I call them, the second and third quarters, then to the fourth quarter to new operating cost levels. Naturally, the outlook remains our best estimate at this stage, given the volume variability due to the complete airline and aircraft build environments as previously mentioned. Q3 revenue is expected to be the low point for the year based upon the current view on these approximately $1.1 billion plus or minus $50 million, as we expect significant commercial aerospace customer inventory corrections in the quarter and the normal seasonal slowdown in Europe. Cost reductions continue throughout the third and fourth quarters as we approach run rate. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to recover somewhat and EBITDA margins are expected to return to similar levels as the second quarter. This trajectory is important to note, especially since the operations methodology has been cost elimination and not cost deferral. Q2 to Q4 adjusted free cash flow is expected to be $400 million plus or minus $50 million. For the year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $300 million range, including a modest working capital benefit of less than $50 million. And of course, these cash flows I just mentioned after the reduction and pay down of approximately $50 million of our accounts receivable securitization program and a customer supply financing program, plus over $60 million of cash severance payments. Moreover, the cash flow includes a voluntary UK pension payment made in the second quarter of approximately $45 million to reflect the $320 million of reduction in gross pension liabilities that Ken already mentioned. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.72 per share. Now, I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary for the year and the second half. We are increasing our in-year cost reduction program to $100 million. Moreover, we expected additional $50 million of structure cost savings in 2020 from the 2019 actions. These cost reductions are permanent and will help accelerate margin expansion when markets eventually recover. We\u2019re continuing to flex variable cost in addition to this with revenue decline. We are reducing CapEx further. Annual capital expenditure is now expected to be $175 million or approximately 3% of revenue. Our previous target mentioned on the first quarter call was $200 million. We do expect pricing to remain favorable for the year. Q3 is expected to be weaker than the second quarter due to significant custom inventory adjustments and the seasonality already mentioned. However, in the fourth quarter, we do expect some modest recovery of volumes with adjusted EBITDA margins similar to the second quarter. And now, let\u2019s move to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Melius Research.\nCarter Copeland: Hey. John, can you just give us a sense of the reduction in the run rate, kind of build rates on the OEM side? What we should be thinking you\u2019ve kind of laid out here for the next, I don\u2019t know, 18, 24 months as that\u2019s level loaded at down 35% or 40% or 50%? Any color you can help us on how you thought about that build plan and how that fits in with your cost plan?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean, the most visibility that we have currently is, I think for Airbus where they\u2019re given clear indications of build rates, which are well-publicized through -- certainly for narrow-body through I think April of next year at a rate of 40, with wide-body being down, I think rejections are like the A350 down to 5 per month. On Boeing, I\u2019m going to say, we\u2019ve -- I think everybody knows, we\u2019ve had several demand forecasts over the last few months. And currently, the build rate there is predicted to be very low at 7. So, it\u2019s difficult to discern that at the moment in terms of where we are relative to inventory take et cetera, et cetera. And also, we recognize or we have to recognize that the amount of, I\u2019ll say, for us in our engine business, what then flows through by way of engine demand and then entry levels in, for example in GE et cetera, et cetera. So, essentially, the way we think about it is we\u2019ve taken at which Boeing and Airbus have published, run that out through as best as we can into 2021. And then, just notes to ourselves is that while we have no visibility into like when we would expect recovery to occur. But I guess, the flip side that we have where we\u2019re taking, I think inventory reductions as part of our also top-line sort of degradation at the moment, then, as builds we mentioned begin to recover, then we will see some inventory build in advance of that to prepare the pipelines for that demand recovery. So, we\u2019re choosing not to call out when this demand will return. The one thing we\u2019ve done is to recognize that it\u2019s a difficult environment. The mantra has been cost elimination, not cost deferral, such that as and when we do begin to see a demand pull, then given, say, the EBITDA margins that we achieved in the quarter and where we think will be for the year and at the end of the year, then we\u2019re well-positioned to take advantage of any demand recovery, as and when it occurs. The other thing we\u2019re consciously doing is that if we see a particularly low point, and we have called out Q3, and I don\u2019t plan to chase cost reduction for a quarter, but I also want to make sure that we are well positioned to be able to meet recovery as and when it occurs and trying to define what that sort of loading is. And then, should the future not turn out to be as we currently believe it to be, then obviously, we\u2019ll further adjust that cost base as necessary. So, I don\u2019t know if that gives you a pretty good picture, Carter, of how we\u2019re thinking about it and what we know and compared to what we don\u2019t know at the moment.\nCarter Copeland: Yes, certainly does. And with respect to the inventory reduction in the channel that you\u2019re hinting at, and -- or that you see coming in Q3, any color you can give us on -- is that in one area more than another, whether that\u2019s engine versus fasteners or whatnot? Any color there would be helpful.\nJohn Plant: It\u2019s both. It\u2019s one of the most difficult things that we have to try to get out in terms of visibility, because obviously we\u2019re not proving to exactly, for example, how many engines are there, how many spares are being held, and indeed what the inventory levels exactly were. We did note -- we did have significant arrears as we went out of 2019. But, as I think as I said on the earlier call, I mean those arrears can evaporate when the builds are no longer required. So, we just believe that we are seeing -- and we are in this period of inventory reduction, we can\u2019t be certain as to how much will be cleared. In the third quarter, maybe still be some lingering over into the fourth quarter and even beyond depending on what the outlook looks like. At the same time, what we recognized in our own cash flows is that this year our own working capital will not be as good as it could be, particularly regarding inventory itself, because we will have even the end of the fourth quarter some trapped inventory by -- given what we previously understood demand to be, we had scheduled materials and some of those we\u2019ll have to take and some of the things we have in our plants today, we will not be able to deliver. Even though we are holding our customers to account if -- there will be some significant turning of few tens of millions of trucked inventory throughout the year, which will take again some time to burn off in the following year. So, again, to summarize, inventory is the most difficult thing to get visibility around. And all we can do is look at these current schedules and we just see that definitely a quarter will be impacted further as our customers reassess their requirements.\nCarter Copeland: Great. Thank you for the color, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss of Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nJohn Plant: Hey, David.\nKen Giacobbe: Good morning.\nDavid Strauss: So, John, I guess, I want to follow up on Carter\u2019s questions around destocking. The decline that you saw in commercial aero in the quarter, 36% I know is different across different businesses, But overall, it was much better than pretty much all your peers, your supplier peers that saw a bigger decline and are calling for destocking to go on now for several quarters. It sounds like you\u2019re calling for a Q3 destock and then, we\u2019re back kind of in line with production rates. I guess, what kind of visibility you have, or what are you seeing that could be different than what everyone else seems to be indicating?\nJohn Plant: I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ll have everything cleared in the third quarter, for sure, because we just don\u2019t have that level of certainty or visibility that we\u2019d like to have. So, we\u2019re making some allowance for that that will continue throughout the year. But, I think, it will be bit more intent in the third quarter. The other thing which we are noting, and I\u2019m going to say it again, because I think I surprised you a little bit, the first quarter call when I think, I said something to the effect that I saw commercial transportation recovering a little bit more quickly than commercial aerospace. And indeed, we are seeing that. It\u2019s that while second quarter was quite dramatic as most commercial truck plants were closed, I mean completely closed during April and part of May, but we are seeing improved demand mostly in North America and in Europe. And we think that that will strengthen as we go into the fourth quarter. So, the way we\u2019re trying to map out our year is that we -- CT is still fairly low in Q3, but we believe to be getting better from what visibility we have from of our customers. And we see a further inventory introduction in commercial aerospace in Q3, making some allowance for that to continue into Q4 and it\u2019s like a bandwidth we try to give you in terms of guidance to where we believe we\u2019ll end the year. So, I wish it was more certain. And I think the one thing that\u2019s I think should be recognized and we have done our best to give you guidance, we just do recognize that it isn\u2019t perfect for sure.\nDavid Strauss: And then, moving over to the margin side of things. So, you talked about the cost savings being permanent and further pricing opportunities as we go forward here. Where would you kind of peg incremental margin -- once volume starts to come back or stabilize here, where do you think incremental margins can shake out and when do you think you can get segment margins back to that kind of 20% range, above 20% range that we were at in Q1 before pre-COVID? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean, that\u2019s a sort of a sad news, so I don\u2019t really want to put my head in, in terms of calling out margin guidance for the future. What our approach is, is to say, we\u2019ve chosen not to defer things. So - because, I\u2019m always concerned about cost deferral being something that as and when you do see improvement, costs flood back into your business. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way to go forward. So, I think it\u2019s a pure cost elimination. And I think the very best periods of time indeed, I think many industries you saw, to some degree, the companies in after 2008-2009. When you\u2019ve made these very serious attempts to reduce structural costs, then some of those -- most of those, maybe all of those will go back into the business. And so, then you really are just taking variable cost back on to making future revenue. So, margin rates do begin to improve at that time. I mean, so question really is, when does volume and inventory build I talked about earlier, when does it occur? And that\u2019s -- none of us know. And I\u2019m just trying to make sure that we position Howmet as best as we can, such that as and when volume does come back, then if we kind of print those sort of EBITDA margins that are talked about for Q2 and for Q4, when things are tough, then hopefully, that leads you to the belief that we can do that when volumes improve. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s like preparing Howmet for the upswing which will come. But, I think, none of us know when it is. But, I think our job is to make sure that we position it as best as we can, as quickly as we can, such that we can generate cash throughout. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing.\nKen Giacobbe: Yes, David, what I would add to that too is, you saw that we increased our structural cost out target in year to a $150 million in year. And when you\u2019re looking at where we are year-to-date, we had $26 million in the first quarter, that was really related to the 2019 action that came into this year; in the second quarter, we had $55 million. So, year-to-date, that puts us at about $81 million. So, good track record, if we have 81 already in the bank, and we\u2019re targeting 150 for the full year. On top of that, if you look at back to the first quarter, we took a severance charge at the beginning of COVID-19 of about $20 million, and then you see another severance charge in the second quarter of about $46 million. So, there\u2019s good trajectory on the cost out, the prices continuing. And also, we\u2019ve exited some unprofitable businesses last year as well. So, that should help us.\nDavid Strauss: All right. That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hi, Robert.\nRobert Spingarn: First, I\u2019d like to thank you for the level of detail here and frankly, for the willingness to guide, because not many have. I wanted to -- on that, I wanted to ask you about -- you\u2019ve talked about visibility, and I just wanted to get a sense especially on the MAX, how well you can see what your customers have in terms of inventory? Are you building MAX engines now at a rate of 7 per month or 14 for the engine 7 for the shipset? And can you tell what kind of inventory the engine manufacturers have on hand?\nJohn Plant: Our schedules for any LEAP-1B engine currently are at a very low level, not surprisingly, given the engine inventory, which is there, which we don\u2019t have exact numbers because it\u2019s a project to GE Aviation. And obviously, they had a level of part flow that was assuming much different build levels compared to where we find ourselves at the moment. So, we are at a very low point of build [ph] for the LEAP engines and LEAP-1B in particular for -- with Boeing. And so, I think that will continue at a very low level throughout 2020. And then, assuming that the recertification goes ahead, which we have no reason to believe that it won\u2019t, and that be good news and then Boeing plan to resume deliveries and then increase build rates as we go into 2021. And that\u2019s a bit -- that\u2019s the time that we\u2019re looking forward to, because we have been without a MAX build for a long period of time now. And so, I think, the whole industry is looking forward to that time. Because we do think that narrow-body is where the demand will be in the future.\nRobert Spingarn: Is there any way you can give us some sense of your content on that program, on a per aircraft basis, or anything you can say?\nJohn Plant: We\u2019ve never given or not in recent times given shipset values by aircraft. I don\u2019t really want to do that on today\u2019s call. But clearly, if you look at the impact that we had in our first quarter, where we did call out MAX more specifically, and then you can see obviously, it\u2019s essentially not present at all in our second quarter. You can see that the combined effect of that MAX and the COVID related impacts of aircraft assembly plants being down, because of employee quarantine, and also just the whole demand from airlines, I mean, it\u2019s a very, very difficult picture for the commercial aerospace aspect of that business. But I don\u2019t really want to call out the shipset value at the moment.\nRobert Spingarn: And just a clarification, I don\u2019t think you said this before. But, in terms of the commercial aerospace revenue decline in the quarter, I think 36%. Can you specify how much that was down for OE versus aftermarket? And I\u2019m not just thinking about airfoils and aftermarket, but all of your commercial aero aftermarket. And then, what\u2019s contemplated in the second half guide for those two buckets?\nJohn Plant: So, last quarter, we gave a bit more granularity regarding spare sales and for the most intense purposes, it\u2019s around $800 million, $850 million level for the whole company. So, let\u2019s use the round some $800 million. And in 2019 it was approximately 400 for defense aero and for industrial and therefore 400 for commercial aerospace. I\u2019m thinking that this year that the 400 for defense aerospace and industrial business a little bit higher. So, given the build, the OE build and the spare packages which you need to go with those. So, think about a 10% plus increase in that, call it out of 450 could be a bit more -- we don\u2019t know yet. And then for the balance, I see a very severe contraction in the commercial aerospace from that $400 million, probably down to the $150 million plus or minus from that $400 million. That\u2019s on a year. Therefore, obviously massive reductions in the like Q2, Q3 for the aftermarket. So, it all balances out probably in that region, maybe just shy of the $600 million range for total spares for Howmet in 2020, but with very different quarters, as you can imagine, given the lack of requirements for say repair and overhaul at the moment.\nRobert Spingarn: I see. Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna of Cowen. Your line is open.\nGautam Khanna: Hi. Can you hear me?\nJohn Plant: Hi, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. Perfect. Good morning. I was -- forgive the question. I have to\u2026\nJohn Plant: You want to have solution?\nGautam Khanna: Exactly. So, here we go. Earlier, I think you said, maybe last quarter that pricing would -- or you implied, pricing would be better than $20 million this year. I wanted an update on that. I wanted an update on your \u201821 view on pricing. And I\u2019m trying to answer the question, do you think earnings per share will be up next year over this year? So, maybe you can also address the carry forward structural cost out next year, pricing and obviously, understanding revenue was -- price is a function of volume shipments. So, I get that\u2019s maybe just directional for next year. But, if you can opine on whether you think earnings per share will be up next year, given the tough Q1 compare and all the other moving parts? And then, I have a follow-up.\nJohn Plant: Well, I am not into giving 2021 reference or guidance at this point in time. I feel that\u2019s way too early to be talking about that. And we tried really hard to try to give you the visibility that we have done today. And I think someone early recognized, we either have the courage to give that in the second half, we don\u2019t understand one of those two. So, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to talk to 2021 at the moment. I mean, I have a view, but we try to think about that very clearly for ourselves in terms of what is our run rate in terms of revenues, what are our run rates in terms of margin, how does it pan out? And so, we certainly have that uppermost in our mind about the trajectory into \u201821 and also into \u201822. So, we\u2019re trying to think a lot about that. But, I don\u2019t really want to give guidance at this point. So, I think, the most important thing was to try to give you a feel for exit rate trajectory, which you got, and trying to give you some view of how we are seeing some inventory issues that have to be worked through. And hopefully those are largely done by next year, but there\u2019s no guarantee. I\u2019ve tried to give you a view about maybe there is some recovery in commercial transportation and as we move towards the latter part of the year. And then, in terms of pricing, clearly, absolute dollars are going to be a function of revenue. We know that revenue is not going to be what we had in 2019. And we also recognize that the environment and our customers, we\u2019re all suffering at the moment, we\u2019re all in a world of hurt. But,, we also believe that the trajectory in terms of the price we\u2019ve talked about is largely impact will be -- can\u2019t be exactly the same given the current pressures of the industry. And we\u2019ve tried to call out again in Q2 and give some steer for, in our words, for the balance of here. So, at the moment, as best as you can be, I think,, we\u2019re largely on track for doing what we said we\u2019d do and positioning the Company as best we can in terms of cost structure. And trying to give you the flow -- ebbs and flows regarding inventory, albeit we called out the imperfect nature of the visibility that we have. At the same time, really try to give ourselves the absolute best positioning that we can such that as and when revenues do begin to pull, as they always do, and they will and in advance of that I guess, we should see a decline is Howmet is really well-positioned to build and manufacturer those parts and also get the right levels of profitability, given what we\u2019ve done the way we proved our cost planning for 2020.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. I appreciate that. I guess, there are a couple of notable things, the structural cost out next year versus this. How does 150 this year compared to what you anticipate for next. And maybe just directionally, if pricing will be better and pricing realization will be better in \u201821 versus \u201820, because that was the plan at the Investor Day. I wondered if at least directionally still the plan?\nJohn Plant: If I was going to walk away from the direction out of it and I didn\u2019t. So, I -- and the second point is, clearly, there\u2019s going to be a positive effect carryover into \u201821 of the cost reductions that we are carrying through at the moment, given the fact that essentially they commence in April in the face of the demand that we see. So, I think the thing that you should think about is the words that we\u2019ve chosen that we would eliminate cost, not defer it. And so, I think those companies which defer, I mean, you see across the whole industrial space, there is phenomenon of deferral. And I don\u2019t want cost to flood back in when programs are reinstated. So, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve approach it.\nGautam Khanna: And my follow-up is inventory plans through the first half of next year or beyond, you mentioned there\u2019s going to be some trapped inventory at year-end. Do you think inventory will be a source of cash maybe for the next year, or can you give us a timeframe as to when that might abate? Because, it obviously is in the second half. How long\u2026\nJohn Plant: Obviously, it all depends upon the angle of the demand line. Let\u2019s assume that if all things were flat, then the fact we have trapped inventory at the end of this year would mean that would be a source of cash in 2021. Obviously, if 2021 were to show some form of demand increase, then all things being equal, normally, you have some working capital that will begin for us. But, obviously, it will be muted by whatever inventory we carry out of 2020 into 2021. And all I\u2019ve said so far, without getting into specific numbers, some tens of millions that we\u2019ll be having in excess at the end of this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. I was wondering -- I appreciate the fact that recovery in commercial aerospace, we\u2019re all kind of groping around in the dark. But, I wanted to ask about commercial transportation since I don\u2019t really know anything about that end market. When we think about when it\u2019s realistic to think about getting back to the 2019 level, in that end market, is there a little bit more visibility there or forecasting ability?\nJohn Plant: We\u2019ve got a view at the moment. I\u2019m not claiming, given everything that\u2019s going on that it\u2019s a well informed view. But, I am thinking that in 2022, we\u2019re going to be pretty close in terms of volume, wheels produced against 2019. Now, I\u2019m not -- what do I mean by pretty close, but I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to be above, getting close too. So I\u2019m feeling a little bit more confident there. And then, commensurate with the fact that I think as we\u2019ve told and informed the market that each year we do take a little bit of share from the steel wheels. We have introduced as you know that new 39 pound wheel and therefore the market leading forefront. And that\u2019s also witnessed by our market shares across the world in wheels. I\u2019m thinking that actually as we go into 2023, we\u2019re going to see above 2019 volumes. Now, this is what I said, this is what we think, doesn\u2019t mean so that\u2019s where it will be. But this is how we\u2019re thinking about the business. And believe more importantly what we\u2019re doing at the moment, we\u2019re repositioning our capacity in that business, such that when volume pull does occur, is that we\u2019re able to manufacture it an even more efficient way than we\u2019ve previously done. But that\u2019s going to require that volume positively there to fit the scene in terms of our results. So, I think this is -- things that we could not have done, if we have had the demand levels of \u201819, just going to \u201820 and \u201821, we\u2019re going to take the opportunity to try to re-profile some of our production to enable future, also improve cost levels to occur. So, \u201822 for the volume and \u201823 for above 2019 is how we see it.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: It\u2019s a long way answer when you\u2019re battling in individual weeks and quarters at the moment.\nSeth Seifman: Yes. No, I fully appreciate that. And then, I guess maybe speaking of 2023, when -- at the Investor Day earlier this year, you talked about a plan to sort of remain for three years. Obviously, nobody knew what was coming. And so, just to kind of confirm or ask you if any change in your thinking as a result of everything that\u2019s happened over the past five months or so?\nJohn Plant: I think, you\u2019re just asking me, am I old and worn out now by the current travails that we\u2019re going through? The answer\u2019s no. I mean, Tolga is giving huge assist, and the business getting into it across the base. And the plan is exactly as I stated. I made a commitment. I always see commitment through. And no diminution in that regard at all. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re working through some issues of business, which we hadn\u2019t really expected. But, it\u2019s just business. It\u2019s just the normal thing you go through and accept that life is not totally smooth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan of The Benchmark Company.\nJosh Sullivan: Curious on the financial conditions of your smaller suppliers, as well as maybe some other adjacencies to yourself. Is there any conversation of increased consolidation? Just given a very challenged financial conditions for everybody, but particularly the smaller suppliers. Are your customers coming to you saying that -- suggesting any tie-ups at this point?\nJohn Plant: No. I -- my take -- in fact I got this question by one of our management teams in recent quarterly business reviews. And my take on it is that right now there\u2019s no companies which are in -- we have enough clarity and confidence to be able to take aggressive steps given that none of us know the shape of future aircraft demand -- what airline loading factors are. Of course, as always, as time goes by, things change. I mean, today, if any proposals were made to any companies, my view is that no Board could possibly ever evaluate anything at this point. Because on what basis would an evaluation be made, because the visibility is so low. On the other hand, give it, to 2021 sometime, could be 2020, but I think that there will be increased clarity. And I think that it\u2019s going to be during that time period, when if there is M&A activity across the, let\u2019s say, the wider industrial space and then aerospace, the sub sector of that is that I\u2019d expect those sort of moves to occur during that period of time when there will be more disability, so that any time that companies want to make acquisitive step or when any acquisitive steps are received, it just depends upon then your Board\u2019s evaluation. So, that\u2019s my guess. But, no, we\u2019ve not been approached by any of our customers to consider acquiring anybody or anything like that.\nJosh Sullivan: And then just relatively, I mean, given the lack of clarity, I mean, are there any areas that you\u2019re concerned about suppliers and their financial condition, their ability to supply you?\nJohn Plant: We scanned our supply base. And out of all of our suppliers, there\u2019s just been one, which we saw attuning, we need to keep a good eye on just to make sure that they are in a position to supply. And by and large, we\u2019ve tried to put the supply base into condition where we\u2019re not totally dependent upon any single supplier of part. Because that\u2019s not a good place to be. But, let\u2019s say -- obviously I\u2019m not going to call out which are the ones which may cause a problem, but so far so good. And I\u2019m not seeing any problems that are going to cause us a problem.\nJosh Sullivan: Thank you for the time.\nJohn Plant: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for questions. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining the call. Today, with Ken, I also have Tolga Oal who is on the call. Tolga is our Co-CEO. Tolga has been immersed in the business since his announcement of CO-CEO back at time of Investor Day in February. Now, let's move to slide 4 to cover second quarter results. First, let me paint a picture of the quarter. As you'll recall, we saw the first significant disruptions related to COVID-19 in the last three weeks of March. The initial effects were quarantine related disruptions within Howmet plants and certain customers that ceased production, for example, Boeing, Airbus, Safran, et cetera. The full impact was felt in Q2 with customers' shutdowns, schedule cancellations, and Howmet plant disruptions. The results reflecting this impact show sales reduced year-over-year by some 31% and operating income, excluding special items by 42%. Nevertheless, we were pleased with the absolute numbers of 14.4% operating income margin and a 19.7% EBITDA margin. This reflects the swift cost containment actions undertaken, starting at the end of the first week of April. And you may recall that we took our initial restructuring charge in the first quarter results. These cost reductions continued to take effect each month in the second quarter and will continue into Q3 and Q4. Later in my remarks, I'll begin to focus more on our exit rate trajectory for 2020 as we move into 2021. Relative to second quarter EBITDA margin at 19.7%, Howmet also generated earnings per share of $0.12. Now, let's move to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow in Q2 was $76 million, excluding $11 million of separation costs. I'd also point out that the $76 million of cash generation included the effect of three items. Firstly, we reduced our AR securitization for the second time in 2020 and a customer supply financing program by some $30 million. Second, we made $12 million of cash restructuring payments. And third, we made additional voluntary cash contributions to our UK pension plan of approximately $45 million to make a large reduction in the gross pension liability. For the absence of that, our free cash flow is after everything. And if we had not paid down the accounts receivable securitization, the UK pension under restructuring, the cash flow of $76 million would have been higher by some $87 million at over $163 million in the quarter. The cash balance for Q2 improved. After the separation of Arconic Corp. on April 1st, the opening cash balance of Howmet was approximately $800 million. At the end of the second quarter, the cash balance was $1.3 billion. The increase was due to approximately $65 million of cash generation after separation costs, and the net addition $420 million as a result of refinancing bonds from 2021 and 2022 to 2025. Net debt to EBITDA was 2.73 times. Revolver capacity of $1 billion is undrawn. Now, let's move on to slide five. We made rapid response to COVID-19 in the market declines. First, with regard to our employees and customers. Employee safety is a top priority. And we're actively managing employee health risks; programs meet or exceed local standards. All of our sites are now up and running. We are reliable partners to our customers who are critical to the national defense, to commercial aviation and to the global economy. Regarding profit and liquidity, management has undertaken the following actions: Furloughing some of the hourly workforce and reducing overtime; permanently reducing all types of labor, both hourly and salaried; the elimination of temporary workers; flexing of materials and services; reducing capital expenditures; and reducing our working capital. Lastly as I mentioned, we refinanced our 2021 and 2022 bonds into 2025 and added $420 million of cash to the balance sheet. And the revolver is undrawn. Now, let me turn it over to Ken to give more details on our second quarter performance. And then, I'll begin to speak to the outlook for the second half of the year. Thanks, Ken. Let's move to slide 15. We are providing you an outlook, and that really is to give the best possible visibility to the Company. Of course, we have been monitoring air traffic around the world, and the best estimates of aircraft builds. And this leads us to provide this view to you for the balance of the year, given that we're well into the second half. However, we do recognize that there remains significant uncertainties regarding the external environment, for example, spikes regarding COVID-19, visibility of customer inventory corrections and aircraft build rate changes in the face of any further COVID spiking. Here are the salient points. Full year revenue is expected to be $5.2 billion for the year, plus or minus $100 million; commercial aerospace is expected to be down 35%, consistent with our previous view; commercial transportation is expected to be down 45%, which is a modest improvement from our prior view; defense aerospace and industrial are expected to be up, with defense aerospace up 10% and industrial up 5%. The consolidated annual revenue for all of our markets is expected to be down approximately 25% to 28% year-over-year. EBITDA is expected to be $1.03 billion for the year, plus or minus $$35 million, but it is made up of very different quarters. For example, in Q1, we had I think, a good level of revenues, nevertheless, offset by disruption in the last -- latter part of March, and then of course, the transition quarters, as I call them, the second and third quarters, then to the fourth quarter to new operating cost levels. Naturally, the outlook remains our best estimate at this stage, given the volume variability due to the complete airline and aircraft build environments as previously mentioned. Q3 revenue is expected to be the low point for the year based upon the current view on these approximately $1.1 billion plus or minus $50 million, as we expect significant commercial aerospace customer inventory corrections in the quarter and the normal seasonal slowdown in Europe. Cost reductions continue throughout the third and fourth quarters as we approach run rate. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to recover somewhat and EBITDA margins are expected to return to similar levels as the second quarter. This trajectory is important to note, especially since the operations methodology has been cost elimination and not cost deferral. Q2 to Q4 adjusted free cash flow is expected to be $400 million plus or minus $50 million. For the year, we expect free cash flow to be in the $300 million range, including a modest working capital benefit of less than $50 million. And of course, these cash flows I just mentioned after the reduction and pay down of approximately $50 million of our accounts receivable securitization program and a customer supply financing program, plus over $60 million of cash severance payments. Moreover, the cash flow includes a voluntary UK pension payment made in the second quarter of approximately $45 million to reflect the $320 million of reduction in gross pension liabilities that Ken already mentioned. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.72 per share. Now, I'll provide some additional commentary for the year and the second half. We are increasing our in-year cost reduction program to $100 million. Moreover, we expected additional $50 million of structure cost savings in 2020 from the 2019 actions. These cost reductions are permanent and will help accelerate margin expansion when markets eventually recover. We're continuing to flex variable cost in addition to this with revenue decline. We are reducing CapEx further. Annual capital expenditure is now expected to be $175 million or approximately 3% of revenue. Our previous target mentioned on the first quarter call was $200 million. We do expect pricing to remain favorable for the year. Q3 is expected to be weaker than the second quarter due to significant custom inventory adjustments and the seasonality already mentioned. However, in the fourth quarter, we do expect some modest recovery of volumes with adjusted EBITDA margins similar to the second quarter. And now, let's move to Q&A. Yes. I mean, the most visibility that we have currently is, I think for Airbus where they're given clear indications of build rates, which are well-publicized through -- certainly for narrow-body through I think April of next year at a rate of 40, with wide-body being down, I think rejections are like the A350 down to 5 per month. On Boeing, I'm going to say, we've -- I think everybody knows, we've had several demand forecasts over the last few months. And currently, the build rate there is predicted to be very low at 7. So, it's difficult to discern that at the moment in terms of where we are relative to inventory take et cetera, et cetera. And also, we recognize or we have to recognize that the amount of, I'll say, for us in our engine business, what then flows through by way of engine demand and then entry levels in, for example in GE et cetera, et cetera. So, essentially, the way we think about it is we've taken at which Boeing and Airbus have published, run that out through as best as we can into 2021. And then, just notes to ourselves is that while we have no visibility into like when we would expect recovery to occur. But I guess, the flip side that we have where we're taking, I think inventory reductions as part of our also top-line sort of degradation at the moment, then, as builds we mentioned begin to recover, then we will see some inventory build in advance of that to prepare the pipelines for that demand recovery. So, we're choosing not to call out when this demand will return. The one thing we've done is to recognize that it's a difficult environment. The mantra has been cost elimination, not cost deferral, such that as and when we do begin to see a demand pull, then given, say, the EBITDA margins that we achieved in the quarter and where we think will be for the year and at the end of the year, then we're well-positioned to take advantage of any demand recovery, as and when it occurs. The other thing we're consciously doing is that if we see a particularly low point, and we have called out Q3, and I don't plan to chase cost reduction for a quarter, but I also want to make sure that we are well positioned to be able to meet recovery as and when it occurs and trying to define what that sort of loading is. And then, should the future not turn out to be as we currently believe it to be, then obviously, we'll further adjust that cost base as necessary. So, I don't know if that gives you a pretty good picture, Carter, of how we're thinking about it and what we know and compared to what we don't know at the moment. It's both. It's one of the most difficult things that we have to try to get out in terms of visibility, because obviously we're not proving to exactly, for example, how many engines are there, how many spares are being held, and indeed what the inventory levels exactly were. We did note -- we did have significant arrears as we went out of 2019. But, as I think as I said on the earlier call, I mean those arrears can evaporate when the builds are no longer required. So, we just believe that we are seeing -- and we are in this period of inventory reduction, we can't be certain as to how much will be cleared. In the third quarter, maybe still be some lingering over into the fourth quarter and even beyond depending on what the outlook looks like. At the same time, what we recognized in our own cash flows is that this year our own working capital will not be as good as it could be, particularly regarding inventory itself, because we will have even the end of the fourth quarter some trapped inventory by -- given what we previously understood demand to be, we had scheduled materials and some of those we'll have to take and some of the things we have in our plants today, we will not be able to deliver. Even though we are holding our customers to account if -- there will be some significant turning of few tens of millions of trucked inventory throughout the year, which will take again some time to burn off in the following year. So, again, to summarize, inventory is the most difficult thing to get visibility around. And all we can do is look at these current schedules and we just see that definitely a quarter will be impacted further as our customers reassess their requirements. Thank you. Hey, David. I'm not saying we'll have everything cleared in the third quarter, for sure, because we just don't have that level of certainty or visibility that we'd like to have. So, we're making some allowance for that that will continue throughout the year. But, I think, it will be bit more intent in the third quarter. The other thing which we are noting, and I'm going to say it again, because I think I surprised you a little bit, the first quarter call when I think, I said something to the effect that I saw commercial transportation recovering a little bit more quickly than commercial aerospace. And indeed, we are seeing that. It's that while second quarter was quite dramatic as most commercial truck plants were closed, I mean completely closed during April and part of May, but we are seeing improved demand mostly in North America and in Europe. And we think that that will strengthen as we go into the fourth quarter. So, the way we're trying to map out our year is that we -- CT is still fairly low in Q3, but we believe to be getting better from what visibility we have from of our customers. And we see a further inventory introduction in commercial aerospace in Q3, making some allowance for that to continue into Q4 and it's like a bandwidth we try to give you in terms of guidance to where we believe we'll end the year. So, I wish it was more certain. And I think the one thing that's I think should be recognized and we have done our best to give you guidance, we just do recognize that it isn't perfect for sure. Yes. I mean, that's a sort of a sad news, so I don't really want to put my head in, in terms of calling out margin guidance for the future. What our approach is, is to say, we've chosen not to defer things. So - because, I'm always concerned about cost deferral being something that as and when you do see improvement, costs flood back into your business. And I don't think that's the way to go forward. So, I think it's a pure cost elimination. And I think the very best periods of time indeed, I think many industries you saw, to some degree, the companies in after 2008-2009. When you've made these very serious attempts to reduce structural costs, then some of those -- most of those, maybe all of those will go back into the business. And so, then you really are just taking variable cost back on to making future revenue. So, margin rates do begin to improve at that time. I mean, so question really is, when does volume and inventory build I talked about earlier, when does it occur? And that's -- none of us know. And I'm just trying to make sure that we position Howmet as best as we can, such that as and when volume does come back, then if we kind of print those sort of EBITDA margins that are talked about for Q2 and for Q4, when things are tough, then hopefully, that leads you to the belief that we can do that when volumes improve. And that's what it's all about. It's like preparing Howmet for the upswing which will come. But, I think, none of us know when it is. But, I think our job is to make sure that we position it as best as we can, as quickly as we can, such that we can generate cash throughout. And that's what you're seeing. Hi, Robert. Our schedules for any LEAP-1B engine currently are at a very low level, not surprisingly, given the engine inventory, which is there, which we don't have exact numbers because it's a project to GE Aviation. And obviously, they had a level of part flow that was assuming much different build levels compared to where we find ourselves at the moment. So, we are at a very low point of build [ph] for the LEAP engines and LEAP-1B in particular for -- with Boeing. And so, I think that will continue at a very low level throughout 2020. And then, assuming that the recertification goes ahead, which we have no reason to believe that it won't, and that be good news and then Boeing plan to resume deliveries and then increase build rates as we go into 2021. And that's a bit -- that's the time that we're looking forward to, because we have been without a MAX build for a long period of time now. And so, I think, the whole industry is looking forward to that time. Because we do think that narrow-body is where the demand will be in the future. We've never given or not in recent times given shipset values by aircraft. I don't really want to do that on today's call. But clearly, if you look at the impact that we had in our first quarter, where we did call out MAX more specifically, and then you can see obviously, it's essentially not present at all in our second quarter. You can see that the combined effect of that MAX and the COVID related impacts of aircraft assembly plants being down, because of employee quarantine, and also just the whole demand from airlines, I mean, it's a very, very difficult picture for the commercial aerospace aspect of that business. But I don't really want to call out the shipset value at the moment. So, last quarter, we gave a bit more granularity regarding spare sales and for the most intense purposes, it's around $800 million, $850 million level for the whole company. So, let's use the round some $800 million. And in 2019 it was approximately 400 for defense aero and for industrial and therefore 400 for commercial aerospace. I'm thinking that this year that the 400 for defense aerospace and industrial business a little bit higher. So, given the build, the OE build and the spare packages which you need to go with those. So, think about a 10% plus increase in that, call it out of 450 could be a bit more -- we don't know yet. And then for the balance, I see a very severe contraction in the commercial aerospace from that $400 million, probably down to the $150 million plus or minus from that $400 million. That's on a year. Therefore, obviously massive reductions in the like Q2, Q3 for the aftermarket. So, it all balances out probably in that region, maybe just shy of the $600 million range for total spares for Howmet in 2020, but with very different quarters, as you can imagine, given the lack of requirements for say repair and overhaul at the moment. Thank you. Hi, Gautam. You want to have solution? Well, I am not into giving 2021 reference or guidance at this point in time. I feel that's way too early to be talking about that. And we tried really hard to try to give you the visibility that we have done today. And I think someone early recognized, we either have the courage to give that in the second half, we don't understand one of those two. So, I don't think I'm going to talk to 2021 at the moment. I mean, I have a view, but we try to think about that very clearly for ourselves in terms of what is our run rate in terms of revenues, what are our run rates in terms of margin, how does it pan out? And so, we certainly have that uppermost in our mind about the trajectory into \u201821 and also into \u201822. So, we're trying to think a lot about that. But, I don't really want to give guidance at this point. So, I think, the most important thing was to try to give you a feel for exit rate trajectory, which you got, and trying to give you some view of how we are seeing some inventory issues that have to be worked through. And hopefully those are largely done by next year, but there's no guarantee. I've tried to give you a view about maybe there is some recovery in commercial transportation and as we move towards the latter part of the year. And then, in terms of pricing, clearly, absolute dollars are going to be a function of revenue. We know that revenue is not going to be what we had in 2019. And we also recognize that the environment and our customers, we're all suffering at the moment, we're all in a world of hurt. But,, we also believe that the trajectory in terms of the price we've talked about is largely impact will be -- can't be exactly the same given the current pressures of the industry. And we've tried to call out again in Q2 and give some steer for, in our words, for the balance of here. So, at the moment, as best as you can be, I think,, we're largely on track for doing what we said we'd do and positioning the Company as best we can in terms of cost structure. And trying to give you the flow -- ebbs and flows regarding inventory, albeit we called out the imperfect nature of the visibility that we have. At the same time, really try to give ourselves the absolute best positioning that we can such that as and when revenues do begin to pull, as they always do, and they will and in advance of that I guess, we should see a decline is Howmet is really well-positioned to build and manufacturer those parts and also get the right levels of profitability, given what we've done the way we proved our cost planning for 2020. If I was going to walk away from the direction out of it and I didn't. So, I -- and the second point is, clearly, there's going to be a positive effect carryover into \u201821 of the cost reductions that we are carrying through at the moment, given the fact that essentially they commence in April in the face of the demand that we see. So, I think the thing that you should think about is the words that we've chosen that we would eliminate cost, not defer it. And so, I think those companies which defer, I mean, you see across the whole industrial space, there is phenomenon of deferral. And I don't want cost to flood back in when programs are reinstated. So, that's the way we've approach it. Obviously, it all depends upon the angle of the demand line. Let's assume that if all things were flat, then the fact we have trapped inventory at the end of this year would mean that would be a source of cash in 2021. Obviously, if 2021 were to show some form of demand increase, then all things being equal, normally, you have some working capital that will begin for us. But, obviously, it will be muted by whatever inventory we carry out of 2020 into 2021. And all I've said so far, without getting into specific numbers, some tens of millions that we'll be having in excess at the end of this year. We've got a view at the moment. I'm not claiming, given everything that's going on that it's a well informed view. But, I am thinking that in 2022, we're going to be pretty close in terms of volume, wheels produced against 2019. Now, I'm not -- what do I mean by pretty close, but I'm not saying it's going to be above, getting close too. So I'm feeling a little bit more confident there. And then, commensurate with the fact that I think as we've told and informed the market that each year we do take a little bit of share from the steel wheels. We have introduced as you know that new 39 pound wheel and therefore the market leading forefront. And that's also witnessed by our market shares across the world in wheels. I'm thinking that actually as we go into 2023, we're going to see above 2019 volumes. Now, this is what I said, this is what we think, doesn't mean so that's where it will be. But this is how we're thinking about the business. And believe more importantly what we're doing at the moment, we're repositioning our capacity in that business, such that when volume pull does occur, is that we're able to manufacture it an even more efficient way than we've previously done. But that's going to require that volume positively there to fit the scene in terms of our results. So, I think this is -- things that we could not have done, if we have had the demand levels of \u201819, just going to \u201820 and \u201821, we're going to take the opportunity to try to re-profile some of our production to enable future, also improve cost levels to occur. So, \u201822 for the volume and \u201823 for above 2019 is how we see it. It's a long way answer when you're battling in individual weeks and quarters at the moment. I think, you're just asking me, am I old and worn out now by the current travails that we're going through? The answer's no. I mean, Tolga is giving huge assist, and the business getting into it across the base. And the plan is exactly as I stated. I made a commitment. I always see commitment through. And no diminution in that regard at all. It's just that we're working through some issues of business, which we hadn't really expected. But, it's just business. It's just the normal thing you go through and accept that life is not totally smooth. No. I -- my take -- in fact I got this question by one of our management teams in recent quarterly business reviews. And my take on it is that right now there's no companies which are in -- we have enough clarity and confidence to be able to take aggressive steps given that none of us know the shape of future aircraft demand -- what airline loading factors are. Of course, as always, as time goes by, things change. I mean, today, if any proposals were made to any companies, my view is that no Board could possibly ever evaluate anything at this point. Because on what basis would an evaluation be made, because the visibility is so low. On the other hand, give it, to 2021 sometime, could be 2020, but I think that there will be increased clarity. And I think that it's going to be during that time period, when if there is M&A activity across the, let's say, the wider industrial space and then aerospace, the sub sector of that is that I'd expect those sort of moves to occur during that period of time when there will be more disability, so that any time that companies want to make acquisitive step or when any acquisitive steps are received, it just depends upon then your Board's evaluation. So, that's my guess. But, no, we've not been approached by any of our customers to consider acquiring anybody or anything like that. We scanned our supply base. And out of all of our suppliers, there's just been one, which we saw attuning, we need to keep a good eye on just to make sure that they are in a position to supply. And by and large, we've tried to put the supply base into condition where we're not totally dependent upon any single supplier of part. Because that's not a good place to be. But, let's say -- obviously I'm not going to call out which are the ones which may cause a problem, but so far so good. And I'm not seeing any problems that are going to cause us a problem. Okay. Thank you. Thank you."

            "name": "Ken Giacobbe",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, John. Before getting started, I wanted to make a few comments on our basis of presentation. As a result of the separation on April 1, 2020, Howmet Aerospace has reported results of the separated entity, Arconic Corporation as discontinued operations for 1Q 2020 and prior periods. Per GAAP, it's important to note that corporate costs for the pre-separation periods were only allocated to Arconic Corporation if the costs were specifically attributable to the entity. Therefore, for pre-separation periods, Howmet retained 100% of all shared corporate costs. For 2019, Howmet statements will show approximately $190 million of corporate costs excluding special items, since the shared costs were not allocated to our Arconic Corporation. For clarity, we've provided a schedule on slide 20 in the appendix, which is consistent with Howmet's 2020 Investor Day and shows an estimate of historical operational corporate costs. For 2019, the comparable annual operational corporate costs were estimated to be $100 million, rather than $190 million. Looking forward into 2020, operational corporate costs are expected to be approximately $75 million. So, let's move to slide 6. In the second quarter, commercial aerospace was 54% of total revenue, defense aerospace was 18%, commercial transportation was 12% and industrial combined with our other end markets was 16%. COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines most severely impacted the commercial aerospace and commercial transportation markets, which were down 36% and 54% year-over-year, respectively. We continue to expect defense aerospace to grow year-over-year, due to the strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new airplane builds and engine spares. In the second quarter, defense aerospace was up 3% year-over-year; and within the industrial and other markets, IGT was up 25% year-over-year. Now, let's move to slide 7. On this slide, we've provided historical information for the combined segments with an estimated operational view of corporate. Howmet Aerospace will present financial information for four segments, Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Products and Forged Wheels. Compared to the prior year, 2Q revenue declined approximately $570 million with a corresponding segment operating profit decline of $160 million. The associated segment decremental margin for 2Q 2020 was approximately 28% year-over-year. Included in the results are price increases of $9 million, which are expected to continue in the second half. Additionally, cost reductions were $55 million in the quarter as we've benefited from actions taken in early April as well as last year. Without the price increases,, the cost reductions, and a flex of variable cost in line with a significant and sudden revenue decline, segment operating profit decrement would have been more in the 37% range rather than the 28% range reported. In the appendix, we've provided historical information for each of the segments. Now, let's move to slide eight. For each of the segments we've provided historical revenue, segment operating profit and segment operating profit margin. We have also provided the revenue by market, split for the current quarter, as well as commentary on performance. First, we'll start with the largest segment, engines. For the second quarter, year-over-year revenue was down 30%. Commercial aerospace was down 44%, driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Commercial aerospace was somewhat offset by a 7% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace, and a 25% increase in IGT as that market rebounds from a weak level in 2019. Price increases continued in the segment. Moreover, the team was able to quickly flex variable spending to mitigate the impact in the quarter of the significant decline in commercial aerospace revenue. The decremental margin for 2Q was 23% year-over-year. Now, let's move to fasteners on slide nine. For the fastener segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 18%. Commercial aerospace was down 15%, driven by COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines. Fastener shipped overdues in the second quarter, and we expect a steeper revenue decline in 3Q as inventory levels are being adjusted at our customers, and we expect seasonal revenue declines driven by European operations. The fasteners commercial transportation business was down 43%. Cost reductions across the segment helped to mitigate a decrease in revenue but higher absenteeism and the delay in European cost reductions result in the 40% year-over-year decremental margin. Now, let's move to slide 10 to review structures. For the structures segment, second quarter year-over-year revenue was down 31%. Commercial aerospace was down 40%, driven by COVID-19 and the 787 production declines. Decremental margins were 6% year-over-year. Price increases, cost reductions and exiting unprofitable businesses in 2019 allowed structures to increase operating margin by 70 basis points year-over-year, despite the 31% decline in revenue. Lastly, let's move to slide 11 for wheels. In the second quarter, the wheels segment was the hardest hit, with a 56% reduction in revenue year-over-year. Decremental margins were 47%. For the month of April, almost all of our OEM customers were shut down with a gradual recovery in May and June. Despite the significant and rapid revenue decline, the segment was profitable due to the rapid cost reductions as well as their ability to quickly flex variable spending. Now let's move to slide 12 for special items. Special items totaled $171 million on a pre-tax basis, which included three main items: First, a $64 million charge for pension plan settlements, primarily due to a voluntary action in the UK to reduce our gross pension liabilities by approximately $320 million; second, a $65 million charge related to the early redemption of 2020, 2021 and 2022 notes in the second quarter; and the third item was a $46 million charge related to severance programs that are tied to the 2020 cost reduction actions as we continue to navigate through a period of demand uncertainty. So, let's now move to Slide 13. In the second quarter, we've completed a good deal of work to improve our capital structure and liquidity. We completed the following actions. We redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. We redeemed $889 million of our 2021 bonds, leaving $361 million, which will make mature in April of 2021. We redeemed $151 million of our 2022 bonds, leaving $476 million that will mature in February 2022. Lastly, we completed a new bond issue for $1.2 billion, which is due in May of 2025. Our next significant debt maturity is in October of 2024. We also amended our revolving credit facility in the second quarter. As a result of these actions, we were able to increase our cash position by approximately $420 million. We also took pressure off the balance sheet by reducing the near-term maturities and increased our available liquidity. Before turning it back over to John to discuss the 2020 outlook, let me cover some assumptions on slide 14. Corporate overhead is expected to improve to $75 million for the year, based on further cost reductions. Annual operational tax rate remains in the 28% to 30% range for the year, but we could have volatility in the quarters based on the current environment. Lastly, pension and OPEB cash contributions remain at $210 million for the year and include the discretionary 2Q payment of $45 million, which reduced the UK gross pension liability by $320 million. So, now, let me turn it back over to John. Good morning. Yes, David, what I would add to that too is, you saw that we increased our structural cost out target in year to a $150 million in year. And when you're looking at where we are year-to-date, we had $26 million in the first quarter, that was really related to the 2019 action that came into this year; in the second quarter, we had $55 million. So, year-to-date, that puts us at about $81 million. So, good track record, if we have 81 already in the bank, and we're targeting 150 for the full year. On top of that, if you look at back to the first quarter, we took a severance charge at the beginning of COVID-19 of about $20 million, and then you see another severance charge in the second quarter of about $46 million. So, there's good trajectory on the cost out, the prices continuing. And also, we've exited some unprofitable businesses last year as well. So, that should help us."

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Shelby. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace first quarter 2020 results conference call. I\u2019m joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today\u2019s presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we\u2019ve included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the appendix in today\u2019s presentation. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. Given the prerelease of earnings, we\u2019ll move swiftly through the slides and then get to your questions. Revenue and profit for the first quarter were in line with the prerelease on April 14. Moreover, earnings per share is at that the favorable end of the expected range. If you move to Slide 4 please. Then as we discussed on the last call on the 1st of April, we separated Arconic Inc., reported entity into two companies. Howmet Aerospace, which is Remain Co, which is primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains the four business units within the Engineered Products and Forging segment. Arconic Corporation, SpinCo, which is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products, contains the three business units within the Global Rolled Products segment. The targeted guidance for onetime operational and CapEx costs related to the separation were $175 million. The final costs for the separation will actually be approximately $130 million, excluding tax leakage and debt breakage. Onetime separation costs were funded by divestiture proceeds of approximately $190 million. The highlight slide for the combined company of Arconic Inc., which includes the EP&F segment, the GRP segment and Corporate. Performance in the quarter was strong despite the impact of COVID-19, which surfaced during the last three weeks of March. Additionally, we were impacted by lower year-over-year 737 [ph] MAX production rate reduction. Q1 revenues were $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through of lower aluminum prices, currency changes and the divestiture of businesses. Operating income, including special \u2013 excluding special items, was up 19%, with a 350 basis points improvement. Moreover, EP&F improved 300 basis points and GRP improved 310 basis points. We have now had five consecutive quarters of year-over-year margin expansion. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.62, a record and up 44% year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $19 million year-over-year, and the cash balance at the end of the quarter was $2.64 billion. We\u2019ve taken several actions to delever and improve our debt maturity profile, which I will discuss later in the presentation. Lastly, return on net assets was up 410 basis points to a record 14.8% return after tax. Now let me turn it over to Ken for a more detailed view of the financials.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s move to Slide 6. So for Q1, revenues were $3.2 billion, down 6% organically year-over-year. Market declines were driven by disruptions from COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines, which impacted both segments. Revenues for EP&F were down 4% organically, driven by reductions in commercial aerospace of 7% and commercial transportation of 21%. We did have favorability in defense aero, which was up 17% driven by the continued demand for the Joint Strike Fighter. Also, our industrial and other markets were up 13% driven by increased demand for industrial gas turbines as natural gas prices are at 25-year lows. GRP revenues were down 7% organically driven by all in markets with the exception of industrial, which was up 14% year-on-year as expected. Please move to Slide 7. On this slide, we\u2019ve provided more visibility to the Howmet Aerospace end markets. The left-hand side of the slide breaks down Q1 revenue by market. So commercial aerospace, is 58% of total revenue. Defense aero is 15%, commercial transportation is also 15%. And industrial, combined with our other end markets are 12%. We expect defense aerospace to continue to grow year-over-year due to strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new builds and engine spares. Within the industrial and other markets slices of the pie, the highest growth section is IGT, our industrial gas turbines business. The IGT market was at a low level last year, and we expect to see growth in 2020 it\u2019s driven by increased demand for both new builds and spares. Regarding spares, we\u2019ve previously communicated that airfoil spares represent approximately $800 million of annual revenue. Of the $800 million, approximately 50% relates to commercial aerospace engine spares and the other half for defense aero and IGT spares. Going forward, we expect reductions in commercial aero spares, but an increase in defense aero in IGT spares. Hopefully, this slide gives greater transparency into Howmet Aerospace\u2019s end markets. We have created the same slide for GRP, which is listed a Slide 21 in the appendix. Now, let\u2019s move to Slide 8. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased $75 million or 19% year-over-year, resulted in a record margin of 14.5% despite COVID-19 and 737 MAX impacts. Margin expansion was 350 basis points, up year-over-year, combined for total Arconic Inc. If we peel that back, EP&F had margin expansion of 300 basis points and GRP had margin expansion of 310 basis points. Corporate expenses, excluding special items, improved 29% year-over-year to $36 million, which is on track with our 2020 annual target. If we estimate a Q1 split of Arconic Inc.\u2019s corporate expenses into the new Howmet Aerospace and new Arconic Corp. company is approximately $20 million of those corporate expenses go to Howmet and $16 million to Arconic Corp. Moving to EP&F. Our productivity continues to improve. For the first quarter, EP&F realized $26 million of year-over-year net cost reductions from actions that we took in 2019. The annual target for Howmet Aerospace was $50 million, and therefore, we\u2019re ahead of target for the first quarter. Additionally, we\u2019ve announced another $100 million of incremental run rate net cost reductions and have taken a $16 million after-tax restructuring charge in the first quarter. Turning to price. We had $5 million of price increases in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Moving forward, we expect greater price increases in quarters two through four despite the market conditions. GRP also had good net cost reductions in the quarter. GRP extrusions returned to profitability in Q1 and the Tennessee plant improved profitability by approximately $11 million year-over-year. Lastly, North American scrap utilization approached 60% to a record level. GRP price was approximately flat to the prior year quarter. So let\u2019s move to Slide 9. In Q1, we continued year-over-year segment margin expansion for both segments despite COVID-19 and the 737 impacts. To give you even greater visibility, let\u2019s quickly move to Slide 10. Since Q1 of 2018, EP&F segment operating profit has increased 520 basis points, and GRP\u2019s segment operating profit has increased 540 basis points. If we converted the EP&F segment operating profit to a pro forma Howmet Aerospace adjusted EBITDA, you get a percent of approximately 23.7%, which is in the top quartile of the peer group. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 11, where we have adjusted free cash flow and earnings per share. The charts show the consolidated company of Arconic Inc., and we\u2019ve also tried to give you a view of what the estimate would be for Howmet Aerospace. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was negative $246 million. That was in line with our expectations due to our Q1 seasonal capital \u2013 seasonal working capital build and an expected incremental $70 million of variable compensation payments tied to 2019 performance. Free cash flow for Q1 was $19 million better than the prior year and is the best performance since our first separation in 2016. Howmet Aerospace\u2019s free cash flow is approximately 40% of the total at negative $100 million. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was a record of $0.62, up 44% from Q1 of 2019. As expected, earnings per share increased primarily due to operational improvements from segment and corporate productivity. Approximately 65% of the earnings per share relate to Howmet Aerospace or $0.40 per share. Special items totaled approximately $60 million after tax, and they were primarily driven by separation costs of $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. Most of the severance costs are tied to the new incremental $100 million cost reduction initiative to realign our cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. With that, let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken, and let\u2019s move on to Slide 12. The health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and we\u2019ve added the following precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We\u2019ve restricted air travel, and in fact all travel, and are encouraging employees to work from home where appropriate. We have implemented social distancing standards throughout the manufacturing and office workspaces. And we are ensuring that updated protocols are followed. Lastly, we\u2019re continuing to deep clean and sanitize workspaces, which have potential exposure. We continue to be a reliable partner to our customers who are critical to national defense, commercial aviation, and the global economy. Let\u2019s move to Slide 13. I\u2019ll now turn to the outlook for which I\u2019ll confine my comments to Howmet Aerospace. As discussed on the April 14 preliminary earnings call, we have an incomplete picture of the future demand pattern since many of our customers\u2019 production has been significantly impacted. Information flow is currently limited, albeit improving. Hence, we\u2019re reducing costs, reducing capital expenditure, temporary suspending the common stock dividend and improving our debt maturity profile to preserve cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance at this time. Turning now to COVID-19. We felt the impacts from certain customer shutdowns and suspensions and disruptions within certain shifts within our plants during the last three weeks of the quarter. Today, we have only three smaller plants, which are currently closed and they\u2019re in Europe. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we have commenced plans to reduce costs by a further $100 million on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the $50 million of carrier reactions we are making from 2019 and the actions we took them. Cost reductions are primarily driven by incremental overhead and some manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we will reduce our annual capital expenditures by approximately $100 million from the initial target provided at our February 25 Investor Day. The full year capital expenditure estimate of $200 million is driven by lower volumes and us cutting those costs. Lastly, we have temporarily suspended common stock dividend to preserve cash and provide additional flexibility. Despite the low volumes in 2020, we expect to be free cash flow positive for the year based upon these actions and this free cash flow is after pension after interest and, in fact, all items of cash flow. To give greater visibility to free cash flow, let\u2019s move to Slide 14 and its key components. We are providing Q1 results and annual estimates on an annual basis consistent with previous guidance, corporate overhead, depreciation and amortization and cash taxes are unchanged. Pension and OPEB payments have been updated to $210 million based upon final separation calculations. Interest payments have been updated for the new debt issuance and CapEx has been reduced by the $100 million previously mentioned. Common stock dividends have been temporarily suspended. Working capital will be a net source of cash for the year as AR inventory and accounts payable are reduced. Let\u2019s move to Slide 15 and talk about debt maturities. We\u2019ve taken three actions in April. The first action on April 6, that we redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. Additionally, we redeemed $300 million of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, on April 24, we completed a bond issuance for $1.2 billion, which is due in 2025. Thirdly, we initiated two tender offers, one for $760 million for the portion of the remaining 2021 bonds, and the second tender offer for approximately $200 million for a portion of the 2022 bonds. These actions will result in the following three benefits. Firstly, we paid off all of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, we will take pressure off the balance sheet by reducing near-term maturities and turning them out a further five years. Thirdly, we\u2019ll be able to add approximately $119 million of cash to the balance sheet, which will add to our very healthy cash balance that we have currently. A pro forma cash balance as of April 24 would be approximately $1 billion. The pro forma cash balance would be after the Q1 seasonal working capital build. Moreover, we had reduced the operational cash requirements from $400 million to operate our business to $300 million based upon the updated seasonal working capital needs pertaining to Howmet. Finally, let\u2019s move to Slide 16. We have prepared a pro forma capital structure slides as of April 24. Pro forma cash would be approximately $1.30 [ph] billion and net debt would be approximately 2.4 times. Additionally, we have an undrawn revolver of some $1.5 billion. And with that let\u2019s move to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen.\nDaniel Flick: Hey guys, this is Dan on Gautam. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Good morning, Dan.\nDaniel Flick: Hey. So, we were curious, how does the kind of the combination of COVID and the lower aero OE production rates impact your ability to get the pricing benefits that have been laid out previously in 2020 and 2021?\nJohn Plant: Well, I think in terms of the total dollar amount, we should expect something rather lower, given the expectation of lower revenues, but the principle of an increase of an increase we believe to continue to be valid as it was then. And of course, what we think is, the any LTA renewals really need to look at the three to five year period and not a specific one or three year timeframe and the necessary capacities need to be put in place for when the full run rates are reachieved. So for example, in the case of Airbus, we expect that a couple of years and now that they quickly back up at 60 build rate per month or more. And the 737 MAX will be also going very well as the as the planes on the ground are cleared from what we\u2019ve read from Boeing.\nDaniel Flick: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just real quick, have you began to see destocking pressures at all from the aero OE production cuts? And do you guys have like a good idea of inventory already in the channel or is that something that lacks visibility for you?\nJohn Plant: It\u2019s still tough to have total visibility, given the fact that we\u2019ve only recently had a return to work for those airplane makers. And they are, as you know, have been reassessing their own production plans and now that resetting their own inventories. My basic thought is that when we exited 2019, in fact, our arrears were at a higher level than we\u2019d entered the year. And so given the arrears were so high, it would indicate that it wasn\u2019t an even sort of vast amount of inventory in the pipeline. But I guess it will be part specific and aircraft specific. So it\u2019s hard to give a very precise answer. But as a basic theme, if your arrears were even higher despite the massive increase in production that we did achieve and the part of the results we achieved last year, and we certainly didn\u2019t have a big burn down of inventory and arrears in the first quarter. So I don\u2019t know it\u2019s going to be a massive impact. At the same time, we don\u2019t have visibility into exactly what our customers are carrying.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse.\nRobert Spingarn: Good morning, John, If I could ask a technical question about the life cycle of your \u2013 of an engine, and your participation. When in an aircraft\u2019s life cycle, will you see your greatest aftermarket events? I\u2019m assuming this is tied to shop visits. And what do events represent as a percentage of the original dollar content? So, if you have x on the original airplane and you get the shop visit one, what does that represent in terms of x as a percentage?\nJohn Plant: I think the best example I can give you is for the CFM engine, which has recently been replaced, as you know, by the engine ranges. And our view is that the peak demand for aftermarket is yet to come. And so that\u2019s assumed that peak demand per our estimate is around 2025. And so that would be, let\u2019s say approximately seven years after the engine replaced. So, while we have spares demand during across the life of any engine, its peak is normally after the installed base is at its highest, and therefore, I\u2019d say approximately a seven-year lag, and therefore, we have that CFM spares, I say, yet to peak. So that gives you a general direction for it. But it\u2019s also influenced by the duty cycle of those airfoils on the engine. And I think you\u2019re probably aware that to achieve the fuel efficiencies that are required for the newer engines in the thrust for lower emissions and a lower carbon footprint, those engines are running at higher pressures and temperatures. And so we do our very best to work with the engine manufacturer to achieve similar life cycle of the blades. But certainly, the impact of those pressure and temperatures is higher. So early on in an engine life, we probably have a slightly reduced duty cycle. But then it evens out over time. So that gives you the best answer I can give you to it. I wasn\u2019t able to answer your final point about what exactly what percentage is that \u2013 I\u2019d have to go and get that.\nRobert Spingarn: Well, we can do that off-line, but I was trying to think about it on an individual aircraft basis as opposed to the fleet as we look at what happens here. But maybe I could try one other thing related. When I go back to your Investor Day slides, which I wouldn\u2019t imagine you have close by, but there\u2019s a slide, Slide 29, that talks about your legacy engine platforms and your next-generation platforms. And you\u2019re on all the new stuff. You\u2019re on most of the old stuff. When we think about those two populations of airplanes and your $400 million in airfoil aftermarket, if I got that number right, how does that $400 million divide between the two groups?\nJohn Plant: That\u2019s going to be mainly CFM at this point in time, but there will be the offset on the \u2013 as an example, I mean I\u2019ve just given you one engine range. Obviously, there will be the larger engines as well. And therefore, you have to build the, let\u2019s say, the 777 fleet into those numbers or the A330s in there. So there\u2019s a lot of things you\u2019ve put in there. But basically, if you \u2013 the way I think about it is that of the \u2013 if you just took the narrow-body engines, come back to the vast majority of the aftermarket, would pertain to the previous sort of rather the current engine, albeit we will see those \u2013 that spares demand grow over time for the current engines as well for the LEAP-1A and 1B.\nRobert Spingarn: Of course. But so what you\u2019re saying is there\u2019s a lot of NG and a lot of CO in that group?\nJohn Plant: Yes, absolutely.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: And the reason why we partitioned today, the spares, to give you a little bit more detail rather than everybody assumed that the $800 million will pertain to the commercial aerospace business. We also want to draw your attention to, obviously, supply spares to defense and industrial as well.\nRobert Spingarn: Right, of course. But obviously, I\u2019m focusing on the piece, that\u2019s likely to move the most, just during this period of time.\nJohn Plant: Yes.\nRobert Spingarn: Yes. Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.\nJohn Plant: Good morning, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: I\u2019m just curious with regard to the different product areas that you guys talked about on Investor Day, the engines, fastening systems, et cetera. I know we don\u2019t have guidance for the year at this point. But when we think about the relative impact of what\u2019s happening across aerospace and transportation, and we think about how those might stack up in terms of the relative impact on sales and profits in those product segments, is there any color you can offer just on the relative impact there? And do you plan to report out on this basis going forward?\nJohn Plant: Okay. I think the \u2013 first of all, the planned report out is that we\u2019ve been thinking it\u2019s more likely that we give the segment information than anything else, albeit we\u2019ve always given growth rates by end markets. And I understand why maybe the absolute percentages for end markets is also highly relevant. So, we\u2019ll assess that and see whether we put that out there. The way I think about it at the moment is, let\u2019s say, approximately 58%, just under 50% of our business pertains to commercial aerospace. And I\u2019d say a very coarse level of analysis, so I think it\u2019s just \u2013 we\u2019re just worth \u2013 it\u2019s only a quarter\u2019s analysis at this stage. If you take the changes currently anticipated by Airbus, for example, narrow-body, the A320, more like about a 35% reduction and wide-bodies at about a 40%. And I\u2019d say Boeing wide-body probably about the same, but it\u2019s a bit more cloudy because of the specific build quantities around the 737. So it\u2019s really difficult to give a generalized picture for the 737 at the moment. I mean, in fact, it\u2019s not recertified. But I\u2019d take a broad sweep through it and say, down 35%, give or take, as a guesstimate at this point in time. Albeit we do need a little bit more time to be able to give a more accurate and be clear with a clearly thought through picture. On commercial transportation, I\u2019m going to be rather more pessimistic and say about 15% of our end markets. We could see given the fact that if you take April, there was virtually no truck production. And therefore, I could see us being down close to 50% in that business ultimately. Given the current dramatic change in the order intake for Class A trucks, as an example, both in Europe and in the U.S. On defense, that 15%, you see double digits. I mean maybe it will be as big as the 17%, but that\u2019s on 15% growth. And then industrial, I\u2019m going to say trucks, 10%, would be up, would be a guesstimate at this point for those sales or so. So when you \u2013 and that\u2019s the way I sort of test as we try to reforecast each quarter and trying to reforecast the year as we go through this. I test that against the course modeling that I just gave to you. And it triangulates reasonably well at this point, albeit we do need another quarter to go by, I think, in terms of getting enough information to have confidence in providing guidance, because I mean giving guidance, it\u2019s pretty serious. We try to get it to be something, which we believe is going to be done rather than just say, it\u2019s not a wish.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Josh Sullivan of The Benchmark.\nJosh Sullivan: Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Sullivan: Just a question on free cash. You\u2019re going to be positive here for the year in 2020 with working capital as a source of cash. But if we look at 2021 and what the OEMs have communicated on production rates, just as they stand now, would you be cash flow positive in 2021 or would working capital go the other way?\nJohn Plant: The way I believe that we should operate, that we should be exactly the same as what I went through in the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis, albeit in a different industry. I mean it should be much slimmer margin than aerospace that was in all over the company. Back then, we were cash flow positive when the capital is coming in and cash flow positive when capital is going out. And so that\u2019s where I start, because I think that\u2019s really important. And my expectation at this point, bear in mind, I\u2019d say, we haven\u2019t given guidance, so there haven\u2019t been a newer number. But we expect to be cash flow positive in 2020 when we\u2019ll see an inflow, and we\u2019ll be cash positive in 2020 when we\u2019ll see an outflow. So at this point in time, that\u2019s what I believe to be the case. And I wouldn\u2019t be saying it if I didn\u2019t really believe it.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from David Strauss of Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Good morning. Apologies if I missed this. Was late joining in the call. But John, have you offered any color, any range of what you would think would be the right level for decremental margins as we go down here over the next couple of quarters?\nJohn Plant: We haven\u2019t given decremental margins. When I talked to \u2013 I talked to you quite a bit when we\u2019re doing that virtual \u2013 by virtue of the debt raise. Of course, we consider that 80% of our cost structure is variable. Now it doesn\u2019t all flex instantaneously as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware. There are things which move instantaneously, which is, for example, if you don\u2019t make the part, you don\u2019t buy the material. So you can expect material costs, by and large, to flex according to usage. And then we go through, as I said, the more extreme would be some of the staff costs, particularly in Europe, where any adjustments would need to be made after consultation with the European Works Councils and those sort of things. And so when we think about that, that it takes a longer time to flex it in accordance with the future demand outlook that we believe we\u2019ll see. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. So there\u2019s a guide in terms of what\u2019s truly fixed versus variable, and the variables is in accordance with time, because the basic philosophy being there\u2019s very little that should be considered to be permanent or fixed. It\u2019s all to do with the passage of time.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. And a quick follow-up, your comment on working capital being a net source this year. What \u2013 did that happen in Q4? Or did it happen before that? I mean, I think you typically use working capital through at least the first half of the year.\nJohn Plant: Typically, we\u2019ve been a working capital user. One of the things we\u2019ve tried very hard last year for Arconic Inc. was to \u2013 rather than as we \u2013 all of the cash flow for the company in previous years had really been achieved in the fourth quarter. We advanced that significantly last year. So, we were generative in the third and fourth quarters. And we were clearly driving on that to really only have our first quarter being a quarter of cash outflow. And it\u2019s a bit too early to say whether that will be achieved given the uncertainty that we have and we\u2019re dealing with at the moment. But that\u2019s basically directionally where we believe to be. Now, what I expect to happen is for working capital, I think receivables and payables flex, I think, for the most part. The latest code of the day is that we have in the activity levels, the most difficult one will be inventory management. And my expectation is there, that in the earlier part of the remaining three quarters of the year, we will have a degradation of days of inventory. Part of it is just to do with the \u2013 able to respond and flex on input materials in real-time when you would have uncertain, I\u2019d say, customer schedules. I mean plants have been \u2013 some are already closed with receiving docks closed. And therefore, if you can\u2019t deliver product, it\u2019s not surprising, your inventory will increase a bit. But then there\u2019s also the effect of an irreducible amount of inventory between machine stations and extrusion stations in the forging presses in the business. And so my expectation is that we will see both for Q2 and for the year, but to a lesser extent as we go through the year as we work this down. So, days will \u2013 I expect by the end of the year, days will be better than they are in Q2, but not as good as previously just because of the scale of, I\u2019ll say, demand contraction that is there potentially. And albeit we\u2019ll be grappling with it and driving inventory down in absolute dollars as we go through the year. So it\u2019s just \u2013 again, it\u2019s one of time. And so while we\u2019ll seem to be a little bit more inefficient in the second quarter, improving efficiency there afterwards. But in terms of inventory dollars, I struggle to believe that given the scale of diminution of \u2013 on the commercial aerospace business that we\u2019ll be as efficient as we were in these terms as 2019.\nDavid Strauss: Great. Thanks for all the details.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Carter Copeland of Melius Research.\nCarter Copeland: Hey, thanks a lot for the time. Sorry, I was off for a second, John, if you addressed this, but I just wondered if you could speak to just given your military exposure and some of the capital that\u2019s been flowing in even on the commercial side in terms of payments from your customers and that impact on the working capital situation, if you\u2019re seeing any changes there? It seems like money is increasingly flowing. If it wasn\u2019t, just any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Okay. No, we\u2019ve seen no change in our receipts from customers at all. So everybody\u2019s paid and been paying to terms. We always have a \u2013 at the end of any month, there\u2019s always a tiny delinquency in terms of being exactly on time. We terms of being exactly on time. We\u2019ve never achieved 100% 30 days or 45 days, whatever the number is, in terms of receipts. But we\u2019re up at a very high level of collection percentage, and we\u2019ve looked at that very carefully \u2013 and all receipts very carefully and there\u2019s no change.\nCarter Copeland: Okay, okay. Great. And then with respect to the areas of the business where you\u2019ve got a substantial portion of the sales volume that may go through distribution, and I\u2019m thinking about fasteners here. How do you get comfortable that you\u2019ve got the risk appropriately sized there given the sort of ongoing uncertainty around rates and what not? How are you thinking about those portions of the business relative to the aggregate whole? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: We\u2019ve looked both at the OE bill and projected rates and that which goes through distribution where, of course, it\u2019s always \u2013 we have less visibility. Of course, our distribution sales are not really very high, neither in the context of fasteners nor in sort of in the context of total Howmet. And therefore, while we are, I think, appropriately cautious, currently, I think we believe we\u2019ve got a handle on where that is. Albeit if we were surprised to the upside, that would be great. If we were surprised on the downside, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that significant to us overall.\nCarter Copeland: Okay. Thanks, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question is a follow-up question from Josh Sullivan of The Benchmark.\nJosh Sullivan: Yes. It\u2019s just a follow-up on\u2026\nJohn Plant: You\u2019ve come back and squeezed one more in\u2026\nJosh Sullivan: That was kind, just a follow-up on the defense side of the business. Can you talk about the F-35 exposure? How much of that is OEM versus aftermarket at this point as that program matures? And then are defense customers talking about taking advantage of any of the available commercial capacity to maybe build inventories, either as buffer stock or spares inventory?\nJohn Plant: So, F-35 was \u2013 and I\u2019m supposed to be giving you the answer I could get before I sort of give you more granular commentary. It\u2019s essentially all OE at this point in time, very little spares. That\u2019s not to say the spares aren\u2019t required because they are, because the duty cycle of that engine, given it\u2019s the military duty cycle, is far less than the average commercial engine. But then as you\u2019ve, I think, seen from our previous decks, I mean that engine is operating to 1,000 degrees higher temperature. And that is in particular when the aircraft has less air flow through it as it hovers in the air and has those capabilities for certain versions of that jet. So, even with its reduced duty cycle compared to a commercial, given it\u2019s still fairly new in the market, the spares parts of the business has been, I\u2019ll say, fairly limited, albeit it\u2019s still there. When I think about F-35, we were \u2013 the critical turbine blades in it were all critical, yes, but the ones which are the most exacting to manufacture, which are the ones which have, I\u2019m going to say, the extraordinary levels of coring to achieve the multi sort of level of chambers that they have within them too and then how the air comes out of the trailing edge, then the more difficult ones were really tough for us to make. And so we were under pressure all the way through 2019 to produce more blades and I recognize that it is possible, we were \u2013 I don\u2019t think we were the limiting factor on the engine, but we were close to it and sought to increase that capacity with additional dies and improved yields as we went through the year. We believe that the combination of that plus the additional capacity that we brought online and pertain to our Whitehall engine facility has been helpful to that situation, and we\u2019ve seen signs of improvement. But we\u2019re also clear at the moment, we could sell everything that we could make, given the, I\u2019ll say, unfulfilled with the basic demand that we have. So, we\u2019re trying to build to a higher rate, a rate build for 2020, which is higher than the rate build in 2019. And then we\u2019re trying to prepare for additional rate increases also in 2021 and 2022. So, the \u2013 I mean the alleviation of capacity from, let\u2019s say, the commercial side has been helpful to it. But that wasn\u2019t the singular issue in terms of us meeting the rate increases relative to tooling as well. So right now, the way I think about it is that we found them a way of improving rates. We do know that there is a large spares demand that\u2019s there for us to fulfill as well on top of the increase in builds that\u2019s there. And so I look at it as a very positive thing for us in going through into 2021 and 2022 and beyond, because then, we have additional rate increases to provide for plus the fact that the spares packages that are required to be fulfilled is going to be, also, a good thing in the future for Howmet.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you very much. And I think that was the last question. So if we could close the call, please.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. Given the prerelease of earnings, we'll move swiftly through the slides and then get to your questions. Revenue and profit for the first quarter were in line with the prerelease on April 14. Moreover, earnings per share is at that the favorable end of the expected range. If you move to Slide 4 please. Then as we discussed on the last call on the 1st of April, we separated Arconic Inc., reported entity into two companies. Howmet Aerospace, which is Remain Co, which is primarily focused on the aerospace sector and contains the four business units within the Engineered Products and Forging segment. Arconic Corporation, SpinCo, which is primarily focused on rolled and extruded aluminum products, contains the three business units within the Global Rolled Products segment. The targeted guidance for onetime operational and CapEx costs related to the separation were $175 million. The final costs for the separation will actually be approximately $130 million, excluding tax leakage and debt breakage. Onetime separation costs were funded by divestiture proceeds of approximately $190 million. The highlight slide for the combined company of Arconic Inc., which includes the EP&F segment, the GRP segment and Corporate. Performance in the quarter was strong despite the impact of COVID-19, which surfaced during the last three weeks of March. Additionally, we were impacted by lower year-over-year 737 [ph] MAX production rate reduction. Q1 revenues were $3.2 billion, down 9% versus 2019 and down 6% organically, adjusting for the pass-through of lower aluminum prices, currency changes and the divestiture of businesses. Operating income, including special \u2013 excluding special items, was up 19%, with a 350 basis points improvement. Moreover, EP&F improved 300 basis points and GRP improved 310 basis points. We have now had five consecutive quarters of year-over-year margin expansion. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.62, a record and up 44% year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow, excluding separation costs, improved $19 million year-over-year, and the cash balance at the end of the quarter was $2.64 billion. We've taken several actions to delever and improve our debt maturity profile, which I will discuss later in the presentation. Lastly, return on net assets was up 410 basis points to a record 14.8% return after tax. Now let me turn it over to Ken for a more detailed view of the financials. Thanks, Ken, and let's move on to Slide 12. The health and safety of our employees is our top priority, and we've added the following precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We've restricted air travel, and in fact all travel, and are encouraging employees to work from home where appropriate. We have implemented social distancing standards throughout the manufacturing and office workspaces. And we are ensuring that updated protocols are followed. Lastly, we're continuing to deep clean and sanitize workspaces, which have potential exposure. We continue to be a reliable partner to our customers who are critical to national defense, commercial aviation, and the global economy. Let's move to Slide 13. I'll now turn to the outlook for which I'll confine my comments to Howmet Aerospace. As discussed on the April 14 preliminary earnings call, we have an incomplete picture of the future demand pattern since many of our customers' production has been significantly impacted. Information flow is currently limited, albeit improving. Hence, we're reducing costs, reducing capital expenditure, temporary suspending the common stock dividend and improving our debt maturity profile to preserve cash given the lack of clarity. We find ourselves unable to provide reliable guidance at this time. Turning now to COVID-19. We felt the impacts from certain customer shutdowns and suspensions and disruptions within certain shifts within our plants during the last three weeks of the quarter. Today, we have only three smaller plants, which are currently closed and they're in Europe. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we have commenced plans to reduce costs by a further $100 million on a run rate basis. This plan is incremental to the $50 million of carrier reactions we are making from 2019 and the actions we took them. Cost reductions are primarily driven by incremental overhead and some manufacturing reductions. Moreover, we will reduce our annual capital expenditures by approximately $100 million from the initial target provided at our February 25 Investor Day. The full year capital expenditure estimate of $200 million is driven by lower volumes and us cutting those costs. Lastly, we have temporarily suspended common stock dividend to preserve cash and provide additional flexibility. Despite the low volumes in 2020, we expect to be free cash flow positive for the year based upon these actions and this free cash flow is after pension after interest and, in fact, all items of cash flow. To give greater visibility to free cash flow, let's move to Slide 14 and its key components. We are providing Q1 results and annual estimates on an annual basis consistent with previous guidance, corporate overhead, depreciation and amortization and cash taxes are unchanged. Pension and OPEB payments have been updated to $210 million based upon final separation calculations. Interest payments have been updated for the new debt issuance and CapEx has been reduced by the $100 million previously mentioned. Common stock dividends have been temporarily suspended. Working capital will be a net source of cash for the year as AR inventory and accounts payable are reduced. Let's move to Slide 15 and talk about debt maturities. We've taken three actions in April. The first action on April 6, that we redeemed all of our 2020 bonds for $1 billion. Additionally, we redeemed $300 million of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, on April 24, we completed a bond issuance for $1.2 billion, which is due in 2025. Thirdly, we initiated two tender offers, one for $760 million for the portion of the remaining 2021 bonds, and the second tender offer for approximately $200 million for a portion of the 2022 bonds. These actions will result in the following three benefits. Firstly, we paid off all of the 2021 bonds. Secondly, we will take pressure off the balance sheet by reducing near-term maturities and turning them out a further five years. Thirdly, we'll be able to add approximately $119 million of cash to the balance sheet, which will add to our very healthy cash balance that we have currently. A pro forma cash balance as of April 24 would be approximately $1 billion. The pro forma cash balance would be after the Q1 seasonal working capital build. Moreover, we had reduced the operational cash requirements from $400 million to operate our business to $300 million based upon the updated seasonal working capital needs pertaining to Howmet. Finally, let's move to Slide 16. We have prepared a pro forma capital structure slides as of April 24. Pro forma cash would be approximately $1.30 [ph] billion and net debt would be approximately 2.4 times. Additionally, we have an undrawn revolver of some $1.5 billion. And with that let's move to Q&A. Good morning, Dan. Well, I think in terms of the total dollar amount, we should expect something rather lower, given the expectation of lower revenues, but the principle of an increase of an increase we believe to continue to be valid as it was then. And of course, what we think is, the any LTA renewals really need to look at the three to five year period and not a specific one or three year timeframe and the necessary capacities need to be put in place for when the full run rates are reachieved. So for example, in the case of Airbus, we expect that a couple of years and now that they quickly back up at 60 build rate per month or more. And the 737 MAX will be also going very well as the as the planes on the ground are cleared from what we've read from Boeing. It's still tough to have total visibility, given the fact that we've only recently had a return to work for those airplane makers. And they are, as you know, have been reassessing their own production plans and now that resetting their own inventories. My basic thought is that when we exited 2019, in fact, our arrears were at a higher level than we'd entered the year. And so given the arrears were so high, it would indicate that it wasn't an even sort of vast amount of inventory in the pipeline. But I guess it will be part specific and aircraft specific. So it's hard to give a very precise answer. But as a basic theme, if your arrears were even higher despite the massive increase in production that we did achieve and the part of the results we achieved last year, and we certainly didn't have a big burn down of inventory and arrears in the first quarter. So I don't know it's going to be a massive impact. At the same time, we don't have visibility into exactly what our customers are carrying. I think the best example I can give you is for the CFM engine, which has recently been replaced, as you know, by the engine ranges. And our view is that the peak demand for aftermarket is yet to come. And so that's assumed that peak demand per our estimate is around 2025. And so that would be, let's say approximately seven years after the engine replaced. So, while we have spares demand during across the life of any engine, its peak is normally after the installed base is at its highest, and therefore, I'd say approximately a seven-year lag, and therefore, we have that CFM spares, I say, yet to peak. So that gives you a general direction for it. But it's also influenced by the duty cycle of those airfoils on the engine. And I think you're probably aware that to achieve the fuel efficiencies that are required for the newer engines in the thrust for lower emissions and a lower carbon footprint, those engines are running at higher pressures and temperatures. And so we do our very best to work with the engine manufacturer to achieve similar life cycle of the blades. But certainly, the impact of those pressure and temperatures is higher. So early on in an engine life, we probably have a slightly reduced duty cycle. But then it evens out over time. So that gives you the best answer I can give you to it. I wasn't able to answer your final point about what exactly what percentage is that \u2013 I'd have to go and get that. That's going to be mainly CFM at this point in time, but there will be the offset on the \u2013 as an example, I mean I've just given you one engine range. Obviously, there will be the larger engines as well. And therefore, you have to build the, let's say, the 777 fleet into those numbers or the A330s in there. So there's a lot of things you've put in there. But basically, if you \u2013 the way I think about it is that of the \u2013 if you just took the narrow-body engines, come back to the vast majority of the aftermarket, would pertain to the previous sort of rather the current engine, albeit we will see those \u2013 that spares demand grow over time for the current engines as well for the LEAP-1A and 1B. Yes, absolutely. And the reason why we partitioned today, the spares, to give you a little bit more detail rather than everybody assumed that the $800 million will pertain to the commercial aerospace business. We also want to draw your attention to, obviously, supply spares to defense and industrial as well. Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Seth. Okay. I think the \u2013 first of all, the planned report out is that we've been thinking it's more likely that we give the segment information than anything else, albeit we've always given growth rates by end markets. And I understand why maybe the absolute percentages for end markets is also highly relevant. So, we'll assess that and see whether we put that out there. The way I think about it at the moment is, let's say, approximately 58%, just under 50% of our business pertains to commercial aerospace. And I'd say a very coarse level of analysis, so I think it's just \u2013 we're just worth \u2013 it's only a quarter's analysis at this stage. If you take the changes currently anticipated by Airbus, for example, narrow-body, the A320, more like about a 35% reduction and wide-bodies at about a 40%. And I'd say Boeing wide-body probably about the same, but it's a bit more cloudy because of the specific build quantities around the 737. So it's really difficult to give a generalized picture for the 737 at the moment. I mean, in fact, it's not recertified. But I'd take a broad sweep through it and say, down 35%, give or take, as a guesstimate at this point in time. Albeit we do need a little bit more time to be able to give a more accurate and be clear with a clearly thought through picture. On commercial transportation, I'm going to be rather more pessimistic and say about 15% of our end markets. We could see given the fact that if you take April, there was virtually no truck production. And therefore, I could see us being down close to 50% in that business ultimately. Given the current dramatic change in the order intake for Class A trucks, as an example, both in Europe and in the U.S. On defense, that 15%, you see double digits. I mean maybe it will be as big as the 17%, but that's on 15% growth. And then industrial, I'm going to say trucks, 10%, would be up, would be a guesstimate at this point for those sales or so. So when you \u2013 and that's the way I sort of test as we try to reforecast each quarter and trying to reforecast the year as we go through this. I test that against the course modeling that I just gave to you. And it triangulates reasonably well at this point, albeit we do need another quarter to go by, I think, in terms of getting enough information to have confidence in providing guidance, because I mean giving guidance, it's pretty serious. We try to get it to be something, which we believe is going to be done rather than just say, it's not a wish. Good morning, Josh. The way I believe that we should operate, that we should be exactly the same as what I went through in the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis, albeit in a different industry. I mean it should be much slimmer margin than aerospace that was in all over the company. Back then, we were cash flow positive when the capital is coming in and cash flow positive when capital is going out. And so that's where I start, because I think that's really important. And my expectation at this point, bear in mind, I'd say, we haven't given guidance, so there haven't been a newer number. But we expect to be cash flow positive in 2020 when we'll see an inflow, and we'll be cash positive in 2020 when we'll see an outflow. So at this point in time, that's what I believe to be the case. And I wouldn't be saying it if I didn't really believe it. We haven't given decremental margins. When I talked to \u2013 I talked to you quite a bit when we're doing that virtual \u2013 by virtue of the debt raise. Of course, we consider that 80% of our cost structure is variable. Now it doesn't all flex instantaneously as I'm sure you're well aware. There are things which move instantaneously, which is, for example, if you don't make the part, you don't buy the material. So you can expect material costs, by and large, to flex according to usage. And then we go through, as I said, the more extreme would be some of the staff costs, particularly in Europe, where any adjustments would need to be made after consultation with the European Works Councils and those sort of things. And so when we think about that, that it takes a longer time to flex it in accordance with the future demand outlook that we believe we'll see. And so that's what we're trying to do. So there's a guide in terms of what's truly fixed versus variable, and the variables is in accordance with time, because the basic philosophy being there's very little that should be considered to be permanent or fixed. It's all to do with the passage of time. Typically, we've been a working capital user. One of the things we've tried very hard last year for Arconic Inc. was to \u2013 rather than as we \u2013 all of the cash flow for the company in previous years had really been achieved in the fourth quarter. We advanced that significantly last year. So, we were generative in the third and fourth quarters. And we were clearly driving on that to really only have our first quarter being a quarter of cash outflow. And it's a bit too early to say whether that will be achieved given the uncertainty that we have and we're dealing with at the moment. But that's basically directionally where we believe to be. Now, what I expect to happen is for working capital, I think receivables and payables flex, I think, for the most part. The latest code of the day is that we have in the activity levels, the most difficult one will be inventory management. And my expectation is there, that in the earlier part of the remaining three quarters of the year, we will have a degradation of days of inventory. Part of it is just to do with the \u2013 able to respond and flex on input materials in real-time when you would have uncertain, I'd say, customer schedules. I mean plants have been \u2013 some are already closed with receiving docks closed. And therefore, if you can't deliver product, it's not surprising, your inventory will increase a bit. But then there's also the effect of an irreducible amount of inventory between machine stations and extrusion stations in the forging presses in the business. And so my expectation is that we will see both for Q2 and for the year, but to a lesser extent as we go through the year as we work this down. So, days will \u2013 I expect by the end of the year, days will be better than they are in Q2, but not as good as previously just because of the scale of, I'll say, demand contraction that is there potentially. And albeit we'll be grappling with it and driving inventory down in absolute dollars as we go through the year. So it's just \u2013 again, it's one of time. And so while we'll seem to be a little bit more inefficient in the second quarter, improving efficiency there afterwards. But in terms of inventory dollars, I struggle to believe that given the scale of diminution of \u2013 on the commercial aerospace business that we'll be as efficient as we were in these terms as 2019. Thank you. Okay. No, we've seen no change in our receipts from customers at all. So everybody's paid and been paying to terms. We always have a \u2013 at the end of any month, there's always a tiny delinquency in terms of being exactly on time. We terms of being exactly on time. We've never achieved 100% 30 days or 45 days, whatever the number is, in terms of receipts. But we're up at a very high level of collection percentage, and we've looked at that very carefully \u2013 and all receipts very carefully and there's no change. We've looked both at the OE bill and projected rates and that which goes through distribution where, of course, it's always \u2013 we have less visibility. Of course, our distribution sales are not really very high, neither in the context of fasteners nor in sort of in the context of total Howmet. And therefore, while we are, I think, appropriately cautious, currently, I think we believe we've got a handle on where that is. Albeit if we were surprised to the upside, that would be great. If we were surprised on the downside, I don't think it's going to be that significant to us overall. Thank you. You've come back and squeezed one more in... So, F-35 was \u2013 and I'm supposed to be giving you the answer I could get before I sort of give you more granular commentary. It's essentially all OE at this point in time, very little spares. That's not to say the spares aren't required because they are, because the duty cycle of that engine, given it's the military duty cycle, is far less than the average commercial engine.

Thank you very much. And I think that was the last question. So if we could close the call, please."

            "name": "Ken Giacobbe",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 6. So for Q1, revenues were $3.2 billion, down 6% organically year-over-year. Market declines were driven by disruptions from COVID-19 and 737 MAX production declines, which impacted both segments. Revenues for EP&F were down 4% organically, driven by reductions in commercial aerospace of 7% and commercial transportation of 21%. We did have favorability in defense aero, which was up 17% driven by the continued demand for the Joint Strike Fighter. Also, our industrial and other markets were up 13% driven by increased demand for industrial gas turbines as natural gas prices are at 25-year lows. GRP revenues were down 7% organically driven by all in markets with the exception of industrial, which was up 14% year-on-year as expected. Please move to Slide 7. On this slide, we've provided more visibility to the Howmet Aerospace end markets. The left-hand side of the slide breaks down Q1 revenue by market. So commercial aerospace, is 58% of total revenue. Defense aero is 15%, commercial transportation is also 15%. And industrial, combined with our other end markets are 12%. We expect defense aerospace to continue to grow year-over-year due to strong demand for the Joint Strike Fighter on both new builds and engine spares. Within the industrial and other markets slices of the pie, the highest growth section is IGT, our industrial gas turbines business. The IGT market was at a low level last year, and we expect to see growth in 2020 it's driven by increased demand for both new builds and spares. Regarding spares, we've previously communicated that airfoil spares represent approximately $800 million of annual revenue. Of the $800 million, approximately 50% relates to commercial aerospace engine spares and the other half for defense aero and IGT spares. Going forward, we expect reductions in commercial aero spares, but an increase in defense aero in IGT spares. Hopefully, this slide gives greater transparency into Howmet Aerospace's end markets. We have created the same slide for GRP, which is listed a Slide 21 in the appendix. Now, let's move to Slide 8. Operating profit, excluding special items, increased $75 million or 19% year-over-year, resulted in a record margin of 14.5% despite COVID-19 and 737 MAX impacts. Margin expansion was 350 basis points, up year-over-year, combined for total Arconic Inc. If we peel that back, EP&F had margin expansion of 300 basis points and GRP had margin expansion of 310 basis points. Corporate expenses, excluding special items, improved 29% year-over-year to $36 million, which is on track with our 2020 annual target. If we estimate a Q1 split of Arconic Inc.'s corporate expenses into the new Howmet Aerospace and new Arconic Corp. company is approximately $20 million of those corporate expenses go to Howmet and $16 million to Arconic Corp. Moving to EP&F. Our productivity continues to improve. For the first quarter, EP&F realized $26 million of year-over-year net cost reductions from actions that we took in 2019. The annual target for Howmet Aerospace was $50 million, and therefore, we're ahead of target for the first quarter. Additionally, we've announced another $100 million of incremental run rate net cost reductions and have taken a $16 million after-tax restructuring charge in the first quarter. Turning to price. We had $5 million of price increases in the first quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Moving forward, we expect greater price increases in quarters two through four despite the market conditions. GRP also had good net cost reductions in the quarter. GRP extrusions returned to profitability in Q1 and the Tennessee plant improved profitability by approximately $11 million year-over-year. Lastly, North American scrap utilization approached 60% to a record level. GRP price was approximately flat to the prior year quarter. So let's move to Slide 9. In Q1, we continued year-over-year segment margin expansion for both segments despite COVID-19 and the 737 impacts. To give you even greater visibility, let's quickly move to Slide 10. Since Q1 of 2018, EP&F segment operating profit has increased 520 basis points, and GRP's segment operating profit has increased 540 basis points. If we converted the EP&F segment operating profit to a pro forma Howmet Aerospace adjusted EBITDA, you get a percent of approximately 23.7%, which is in the top quartile of the peer group. Now let's move to Slide 11, where we have adjusted free cash flow and earnings per share. The charts show the consolidated company of Arconic Inc., and we've also tried to give you a view of what the estimate would be for Howmet Aerospace. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was negative $246 million. That was in line with our expectations due to our Q1 seasonal capital \u2013 seasonal working capital build and an expected incremental $70 million of variable compensation payments tied to 2019 performance. Free cash flow for Q1 was $19 million better than the prior year and is the best performance since our first separation in 2016. Howmet Aerospace's free cash flow is approximately 40% of the total at negative $100 million. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was a record of $0.62, up 44% from Q1 of 2019. As expected, earnings per share increased primarily due to operational improvements from segment and corporate productivity. Approximately 65% of the earnings per share relate to Howmet Aerospace or $0.40 per share. Special items totaled approximately $60 million after tax, and they were primarily driven by separation costs of $50 million and severance costs of $16 million. Most of the severance costs are tied to the new incremental $100 million cost reduction initiative to realign our cost base as we move into a period of demand uncertainty. With that, let me turn it back over to John."

My name is Natalia, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Natalia. Good morning. And welcome to the Howmet Aerospace fourth quarter and full year 2021 results conference call. I am joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today\u2019s presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the appendix in today\u2019s presentation. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, PT, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s move to slide four. First, let me frame the quarter for you. The environment was challenging with the new variant of Omicron emerging the day after Thanksgiving. Fortunately, once we take time to understanding the changing nature of the pandemic, we find that the virus appears to be weakening albeit it\u2019s quite transmissible. Boeing also continues to test us with reduced build or zero build of the 787 wide-body aircraft as recertification is once again delayed and unclear. Despite these impacts, Howmet performed well, with revenues of $1.285 billion, improving well above last year and in line with Q3. Adjusted EBITDA improved both over last year and sequentially and was $296 million, with an EBITDA margin at 23%. We were pleased with the margin exit rate for both the Q4 and the second half of 2021. The sales picture is one of strengthening Commercial Aerospace narrow-body production, healthy Defense and IGT sales combined with constrained sales of our high performance Wheels segment due to the supply chain constraints at our customers in the Commercial Truck Manufacturing business. Clearly, both Delta and Omicron variant of the virus impacted production operations. But nevertheless, we were able to bring through a good level of efficiency. Turning to the balance sheet now and the cash flow of the company, adjusted free cash flow was a record at $517 million for the year and well ahead of both last year and guidance, with a conversion rate of 117% of net income. We also made incremental voluntary pension contributions in the quarter, and if we exclude these contributions, adjusted free cash flow would have been 123% conversion of net income. For your information, the free cash flow conversion has continued in the last three years at a level well in excess of our long-term guide of 90%. The year-end cash balance was $722 million and reflects both the good cash flow conversion and the fact that in the fourth quarter, Howmet repurchased $205 million of shares at an average price of $30.32. For the fourth quarter average diluted share count reduced to 431 million and the year-end diluted share stood at 428 million. The repurchase of shares continued in early 2022 with a further 3 million shares purchased for $100 million during the month of January. As of the end of January, the diluted share count has been reduced to approximately 425 million shares. And finally, the 2021 tax rate was reduced by the work we have done and the effect was $0.01 on earnings in the fourth quarter. We look forward to 2022, and I will provide commentary when we get to the outlook section of our presentation. Meanwhile, I will hand the call over to Ken Giacobbe.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Let\u2019s -- please move to slide five. Fourth quarter total revenue was up 4% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Commercial Aerospace increased to 44% of total revenue, which is an improvement sequentially, but far short of the pre-COVID levels of 60%. Commercial Aerospace recovery continued in the fourth quarter, with Commercial Aerospace revenue up 13% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segment and the narrow-body recovery. Defense Aerospace was down 22% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the Joint Strike Fighter. Commercial Transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and the Fastening Systems segment, was up 20% year-over-year, driven by higher aluminum prices. However, the market was down 1% sequentially as the market continues to be impacted by supply chain constraints at our customers, which is limiting commercial truck production. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was down 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Now, let\u2019s move to slide six, which sums up the year nicely. Let\u2019s start with the P&L. For the full year, price increases were up year-over-year and in line with expectations, as they are primarily tied to long-term agreements. Structural cost reductions were approximately $130 million, which exceeded our target of $100 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year was 22.8%, which was an increase of 220 basis points year-over-year, despite $285 million of lower revenue. The fourth quarter exit rate was 23%. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 or 31% higher than 2020. Moving to the balance sheet, our cash balance was healthy at $722 million. Adjusted free cash flow was a record $517 million, which was well above the guidance. Free cash flow conversion was 117% of net income and if we exclude voluntary pension contributions of $28 million, adjusted free cash flow conversion was 123% of net income. Net pension and OPEB liabilities were reduced by approximately $275 million, while pension and OPEB expense, as well as the associated cash contributions were each reduced by approximately 54%. Net debt-to-EBITDA improved to 3.1 times. Regarding capital allocation, we have taken a balanced approach. Capital investment projects for Forged Wheels at Hungary and Mexico are now essentially complete. Concurrently, we have been investing in automation projects in the Engines and Fasteners segments. During the year, we paid down gross debt of approximately $845 million, with cash on hand and reduced annualized interest costs by approximately $70 million. We also reinstated the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock in Q3 of 2021. Lastly, we repurchased approximately 13.4 million shares of common stock for $430 million, with an average acquisition price of $32.07 per share. To sum it up, during the year, we enhanced our profitability, strengthened the balance sheet and we are balanced in our capital allocation. Let\u2019s move to slide seven to briefly cover the segment results. Engine Products year-over-year revenue was 9% higher in the fourth quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 39% higher driven by the narrow-body recovery. Defense Aerospace was down 26% year-over-year, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the Joint Strike Fighter. Operating profit increased 10% year-over-year and operating margin improved 20 basis points, despite adding approximately 150 employees in the fourth quarter, which now brings our total employees added since Q1 to approximately 950 employees. Now let\u2019s move to slide eight. As expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 3% lower in the fourth quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 15% lower, as we continued to experience production declines for the Boeing 787. Commercial Transportation was up approximately 46%. Year-over-year, Fastening Systems was able to maintain segment operating profit on $7 million of lower revenue. As a result, operating margin improved 50 basis points. Now let\u2019s move to slide nine. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 12% lower in the fourth quarter. Commercial Aerospace was flat, as the narrow-body recovery was offset by production declines for the Boeing 787. The Defense Aerospace market was down 26% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Year-over-year, Engine Structures was able to generate $3 million more in segment operating profit on $27 million of lower revenue, primarily due to permanent cost reductions and a favorable $2.5 million non-recurring adjustment related to a customer contract negotiation. As a result, operating margin improved 260 basis points. Finally, let\u2019s move to slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 15% higher in the fourth quarter. Approximately $28 million of the $31 million revenue increase was due to higher aluminum price pass-through. Pass-through of higher aluminum prices did not impact operating profit dollars, but unfavorably impacted operating profit margin by approximately 350 basis points. On a sequential basis, revenue and operating profit were essentially flat. Commercial Transportation demand remained strong, but volumes continued to be impacted by customer supply chain issues. Aluminum prices were flat sequentially, resulting in minimal impact to sequential operating profit margin. One final comment on the segments, the incremental profit flow-through for the segments in Q4 was 30% year-over-year and can be found in the appendix. The 30% includes a 55% increase in aluminum prices year-over-year, which adversely impacted the incremental profit flow-through. If we adjust for aluminum prices, incrementals were above 70%. Now let\u2019s move to slide 11. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. In 2021, we took actions to lower our annualized interest costs by approximately $70 million through a combination of paying down gross debt by approximately $845 million with cash on hand and also refinancing higher cost debt with lower cost debt. Gross debt remains at $4.2 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA improved to 3.1 times, despite cash used for debt refinancing, share buybacks and dividends. All debt is unsecured and the next maturity is in October of 2024. Finally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Before turning it back to John to discuss the guidance, I\u2019d like to point out a few items that you can find in the appendix. First, there\u2019s a slide in the appendix that covers special items in the quarter. Special items for the fourth quarter were a net charge of approximately $53 million, mainly driven by costs associated with non-cash pension plan settlement charges. Second, there\u2019s a slide in the appendix that summarizes the share repurchases that occurred in 2021, as well as the share repurchases in January of 2022. Remaining common stock share repurchase authority sits at $1.25 billion as of February 1, 2022. Finally, in the reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow, you will notice the cash receipt from sold receivables is zero dollars in the fourth quarter. As a result of restructuring our accounts receivable securitization program in Q3 2021, cash receipts from sold receivables will be zero going forward and the entire impact from the sale of accounts receivables will be in cash from operations. Therefore, starting with Q4 of 2021 and beyond, the definition of free cash flow will be simplified and be cash from operations less CapEx. Please note that the net cash funding from the sale of accounts receivable has been $250 million since Q4 of 2020, which means that the sale of accounts receivables has neither been a source of cash or a use of cash in 2021. So, with that, let me now turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken. Let\u2019s move to slide 12 for guidance for 2022. The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement, notably for domestic travel. We continue to hold the view that we will see an acceleration in revenue growth during the course of the year, following a fairly flat Q1 compared to Q4. The Engine Products business has led the recovery to-date and we now expect the Engineered Structures business will see lower revenue in the first half of 2022, due to the continued delays with the 787. Fastening Systems is expected to show growth in the first half of 2022, starting in the first quarter. In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following, the guidance for Q1 revenue at $1.3 billion, plus or minus $20 million, EBITDA of $295 million, plus or minus $9 million, EBITDA margin of 22.7%, plus or minus 30 basis points, and EPS of $0.29, plus or minus $0.01. And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5.64 billion, plus or minus $80 million, EBITDA at $1.3 billion, plus or minus $35 million, EBITDA margin of 23%, plus 30 basis points and minus 20 basis points, EPS to increase to $1.37, plus or minus $0.06, and cash flow to be $625 million, plus or minus $50 million. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide we expect the following. Revenue to the up approximately 13% versus 2021, driven by Commercial Aerospace, Commercial Transportation and the IGT market,  The 2022 revenue guidance includes more than $125 million of material pass-through impacted margins by at least 50 basis points. And for clarity, the price increases are excluded from the $125 million of pass-through Adjusting for that $125-plus million of material pass-through, then the incremental EBITDA margins fall nicely in the 30% to 35% range. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be up 15% versus last year, adjusted earnings per share to be up approximately 36% versus 2021, pension and OPEB contributions of approximately $60 million in the year. CapEx should be in the range of $220 million to $250 million and that continues to be less than depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net source of cash. Adjusted free cash flow compared to net income is approximately 110%. Incrementals adjusting for the metal between 30% and 35%, as previously stated. So let\u2019s move to slide 13 for the summary of 2021. In conclusion, Howmet delivered really well in 2021, and I note the challenges that we overcame. EBITDA and EBITDA margin increased with the Q4 exit rate of 23%. Operational productivity was healthy and structural costs reduced by $130 million. Prices, sorry, pricing was improved during the course of the year and well above inflation recovery. Free cash flow was excellent and allowed for further share buybacks of $430 million or $13 million -- 13 million shares, while also improving the net leverage of the company and reducing gross debt by $845 million, and furthermore, reducing interest carrying costs of $70 million, thereby improving future free cash flow yield of the company. Furthermore, pension and OPEB growth liabilities were reduced by $440 million, which is another huge step in the improvement in the balance sheet of the company and net liabilities by $275 million. Lastly, work performed and the tax rate showed improvement with the rate reduced by 250 basis points to 25%. Thank you. And now let\u2019s take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Rob.\nRobert Spingarn: John, I wanted to ask you about what we have been hearing on castings and forgings potentially being a bottleneck with capacity ramp from some of the OEMs and other folks in the industry. Could you talk about that?\nJohn Plant: Yeah. I mean, I will probably just give you what I seem to be, what I think are three levels of response to your question. I\u2019d probably just cover the first two. At its most simplest, no CEOs that have commented publicly have contacted me to register any concerns whatsoever. I could leave it at that. But I think I\u2019d like to go a little bit further, and say, I am really glad it\u2019s recognized just how hard and how exacting the production of such products are. And it\u2019s a good job that there is inventory in the pipeline at many levels, starting with completed engines at Boeing and Airbus, and also in the pipeline between us and the engine manufacturers. I think it will be also great to recognize the lead times with scheduled commitments to back up the skylines and aircraft production in full, assuming that these volumes are required. And then the third level of commentary would be, I will say, commenting on the whole supply chain, labor availability, skills, response times, et cetera. But for right now, I have no recognition of this as a significant issue in any dimension.\nRobert Spingarn: I think that\u2019s a fair point that there\u2019s so much uncertainty in the production rates. The other thing I\u2019d ask, John, is just, if the competition might not be able to keep up, does this present an opportunity for you?\nJohn Plant: Obviously, it always depends upon the parts that are in question. My expectation is that the spot business will pick up in 2022 and that will be to our benefit. And hopefully, we can respond in the same way that we were able to respond in 2019 and pick up the additional business should it occur and I think that\u2019s probably as far as I can go at this point, Rob.\nRobert Spingarn: Fair enough. Thank you, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Hey. Thanks, guys.\nJohn Plant: Hi.\nGautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could just spell out -- quantify the change in guidance from the Q3 earnings call, obviously, the sales taken down. But what are you now embedding in terms of 787 rate, 777 rate, just some of the moving parts relative to\u2026\nJohn Plant: Yeah.\nGautam Khanna: \u2026 what you previously had provided?\nJohn Plant: Yeah. So if I exclude metals from that revenue line, then the volume increase is around 11%. So, close to that 12% to 15% that I previously called, and the reason for it being at the lower-end of that is the 787 and the lack of visibility that we have to be going that aircraft. And we note that our customer hasn\u2019t provided any solid view skyline, and therefore, we have to make our own assumption of volume of production. And in addition, I\u2019d say, there\u2019s a bit of an inventory overhang on F-35, given that while we supplied to schedule during 2021, I note that Lockheed did not build the full quantity of aircraft. So while the aircraft production is going to increase in 2022 and increase in 2023 then that\u2019s great, but we have got to burn off a bit of an overhang in the early part of 2022 and then we will see further volume improvements as we go into 2023 when that overhang, hopefully, will no longer be there and it will be bit rise in the first part of this year. So those would be the, let\u2019s say, a couple of comments regarding the revenues for 2022 and the early part of the year. Does that cover it or do you need a bit more?\nGautam Khanna: Thank you. No. That\u2019s very helpful. And just to follow-up on Rob\u2019s earlier question on pinch points. Have you seen any pinch points upstream with respect to nickel billet or what have you given the PCP strike and Carpenter having the outage, the unexpected outage at Reading, I don\u2019t know. How do you feel about...\nJohn Plant: Yeah. So far nothing on nickel. I recognize the Carpenter matter and I think that\u2019s going to be a little bit of a pinch point in the first half of this year. Nothing dramatic that we see at this point, but definitely having some impact.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hi, David.\nDavid Strauss: Hi, John. So, I guess, within that 11% revenue growth, John, that you are talking about, can you just give us an idea by end market, what you are assuming, I guess, Aero Defense, Commercial Transportation being the big ones, maybe Industrial, if you want to throw it in there? And then on MAX, can you give us an idea of what you have produced in 2021 and what you are assuming for production in 2022? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Yeah. So by end markets, Commercial Aero is going to be up in 2022, led by narrow-body, but not a lot happening on wide-body with the 787 being the complete wild card in all of this. IGT should be -- continue to be healthy and I believe to be up in the year. And Commercial Transportation for our Wheels business will be up and I think the supply chain constraints ease that we are going to see a fairly healthy second half of the year in that business and a really great 2023. The weak point at the moment would be Defense for us. I think it\u2019s going to be flat to slightly down for the year and with most of that playing out in the first half of 2022. And oil and gas, too difficult to call at this point, we are hopeful for an improvement, but haven\u2019t planned on it. So that covers out the end markets. 737, I haven\u2019t got the exact numbers, but maybe while I am chatting here, Ken, get them. But essentially, while we note the production for last year and it\u2019s increased in the second half of the year to -- I don\u2019t know what the number was, let\u2019s say, 14, I am going to recognize rather than the numbers I have seen thrown around. We have seen that improvement. But again we have been supplying it below that level as the remains of the inventory is being burned off on particularly the LEAP 1B for us in the Engine segment and that\u2019s hopefully going to just show healthy growth for us this year, again, strengthening as we go through the year when we see the further rate increase and there\u2019s no inventory left in the pipeline to get burned off. And then should Boeing feel more confident and do consider raising the rate that will be great for us and above what we have guided. Spares, just to comment on that, that\u2019s going to be healthy for us this year, but rate of percentage increase, I am thinking on the Commercial Aero side, maybe something like a 30% increase in our aftermarket revenues, 30% plus. But as you know, it\u2019s coming at a fairly low base. So the dollars are beginning to be interesting but still well below our previous levels in 2019.\nKen Giacobbe: Yeah. And in terms of, David, the exit rate on the 737 in Q4, we were at about 17 aircraft. And as we look into 2022 consistent with what we said last quarter, probably, low 20s in the first half and low 30s in the second half.\nDavid Strauss: Great. Thanks for all the detail guys.\nJohn Plant: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. John, to follow up on this 787 issue, have you taken the 787 out completely from your 2022 revenue guidance? And then, secondly, assuming that\u2019s an accurate forecast, can you use this capacity for other stuff?\nJohn Plant: We have assumed, I mean, it\u2019s just a ballpark number, about 35 aircrafts are production for the year. It\u2019s just a guess, with very limited production there or maybe zero production in the first quarter. And then assuming there\u2019s something, but not quite sure what, so we ballparked it around that 35 level. In terms of those production facilities, if you take the air force that go into the Engines, clearly, I mean, while that will release casting capacity, it\u2019s -- if the device is dedicated to that aircraft. So nothing will be changed over there. And for the most part, that type of Fastening System and Titanium Structures are dedicated to the aircraft albeit there\u2019s enough capacity to produce for other customers for any of those flight types or any bulk fasteners. So, yes, there\u2019s use for them elsewhere, but we have already made provision to be at production rates for everything elsewhere. So, there\u2019s no upside in 787 being down. We just like the aircraft to get back certified and production to start and lift and that would be very helpful to us.\nRobert Stallard: Yeah. That\u2019s great. Thanks, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Ken or John. But on the cash flow, obviously, better performance in 2021 and then 2022, still at pretty elevated levels of conversion. I guess the question is, why aren\u2019t you building more working capital as you are ramping up into the double-digit growth likely this year and next year? Are the customers payables coming in or excuse me, receivables coming in at pace and POs coming in better than you would historically wanted or are we just setting a new bar for cash conversion versus the 90% long-term target?\nJohn Plant: No change to long-term guidance, just that when you have got, let\u2019s say, CapEx below D&A for a period of time, that\u2019s healthy, we expect, as I guided, the pension contributions to be lower in 2022 than previous year. So we are expecting some working capital build and should we hit our marks in terms of, I will say, receivables and payables, then I\u2019d be quite excited to use increased working capital in the back-end of the year, because that would mean a very healthy exit rate and great momentum going into 2022. Working capital drag for us is not the biggest deal, given the strength of margin and we much prefer to see the improved revenues. Having said all of that, we do hope to further improve our inventory efficiency during the course of the year. It\u2019s part of, I\u2019d say, what we do. And that\u2019s helping us reduce the -- what is pro rata or pro rata working capital drag from the increased revenue. So, in summary, there is a working capital drag on cash flow. We try to improve efficiency, but would love that drag to be even higher, because that shows strength particularly in the second half of the year.\nMyles Walton: Yeah. And did\u2026\nKen Giacobbe: And Myles, what I would add to that -- this is Ken. As John said, it\u2019s a modest cash burn in working capital. But as we exited 2021, we built some inventory, specifically in the Engines business on some of these key platforms in order to get ahead of the ramp. So we think we are in good shape.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And did you acquire any inventory from the supplier who maybe been liquidating in the fourth quarter?\nJohn Plant: Small amount, yeah.\nMyles Walton: Great. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman: Hey. Hi. Thanks very much and good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: I wonder if you could comment on maybe not the exact number, but in a relative sense, the LTAs are coming up this year relative to, I don\u2019t know, maybe if they are three years to five years on average, then you think of 25% coming up each year. Is this a heavier year, a lighter year and kind of what -- is there much expectation for what that might be able to deliver this year?\nJohn Plant: Yeah. So consistent with what I have said previously, the 2021 was a bigger year for us and you saw that. And I think the number through the third quarter was a cumulative $60-plus million of price, excluding inflationary pass-through. The Q4 number will be issued as we issue today in a week or so time. And the -- for 2022, the book of LTA will not be as big as 2021, again, consistent with what I previously said. Nothing\u2019s changed, we are well through our negotiations, but not completed for 2022, but well through and our expectation for the price improvement is exactly in line with previous statements.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Hi. Good morning, everybody.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: John, I heard your comments on the math of the pass-through versus the pricing in terms of what that does to margins. But just the midpoint of the EBITDA margin guidance is a little constrained year-over-year. It seems like sort of the high-end of the EBITDA versus the low-end of the revenue gets you to 35% incremental, but a lot of different places in the ranges don\u2019t get that incremental you have been speaking to. So maybe you are just trying to tell us there\u2019s risk to revenue, but you feel good about your operating performance. But just wanted to get your latest thinking on your incremental margin potential versus what you were saying last quarter?\nJohn Plant: Yeah. Well, the last quarter, I gave you 35%, plus or minus 5% approx and we are well within that. So I think it\u2019s exactly in line. I don\u2019t think anybody is going to argue for a couple of percent with all of the variables around us. So those variables will be Omicron, production disruption, I could talk about inflation, I could talk about recovery inflation, I could talk about 787, the F-35, the management of LEAP 1B inventory and also things like container availability, never mind the cost of containers. So there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on and within that overall context of uncertainty, then I think the guide is just exactly in line and we will see how things pan out during the course of the year.\nNoah Poponak: Okay.\nJohn Plant: I am not accustomed to disappointing and the most important one, not to disappoint myself. And so at the moment, I think, we are in line. I think the most important thing is, we are passing through, we can pass through these significant material changes and others. So that\u2019s the important thing. It\u2019s not an excuse me for reduce margins.\nNoah Poponak: Excellent. And is this...\nJohn Plant: And it\u2019s non -- once we get to it, it\u2019s a non-conversation. We have given you a range where we will take this and deliver, and hopefully, deliver improved margins in 2023, just in the same way as we deliver the improved margins in 2022 -- in 2021. And 2021, as you know, was a 200-plus-basis-point improvement over 2020 and we have guided you to, I think, 23% midpoint, which would be an increase over 2021.\nNoah Poponak: And Fastening didn\u2019t see that as much in 2021 and is the furthest below pre-pandemic. Now that the revenue has stabilized there, is that where there\u2019s the most upside left moving forward?\nJohn Plant: Well, I am certainly optimistic for our Fastener business, because that\u2019s a good margin business. I\u2019d be a lot more bullish about it, if I knew more about the 787.\nNoah Poponak: Yeah.\nJohn Plant: But while I don\u2019t, I am going to be fairly cautious. I still think that given, I mean, when you go into like sort through this, given, I think, in the Q4 revenue slightly down, but margin up, and if you think margin up when the wide-body is down and 787 down, and given the differential mix of Fastener on aircraft, it was a real credible and creditable performance for the Fastener business. \nNoah Poponak: Okay. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag: Hey. Good morning, guys. John, on Russia, there are discussions again on sanctions. How do you think this will pan out for the titanium industry? And is that a risk point or potential pain point for you? How are you thinking about all of this?\nJohn Plant: If anything, I did note comments in the press for -- from Boeing regarding concerns about geopolitical stability and the impact of titanium. And should that -- those concerns prove material or real, then that would be great for us, because we have got titanium capacity. We would be happy to commit to a long-term agreement with that customer or indeed any others. So if there is geopolitical uncertainty, whether it\u2019s for the defense contractors or for civil aerospace production, then I think that\u2019s -- we would be happy to take your calls.\nKristine Liwag: So, John, I mean, following up on that, I mean, how much capacity do you have for titanium, how much of the aerospace industry\u2019s demand can you meet, should this come about?\nJohn Plant: Well, it\u2019s clearly not the whole of the VSMPO [ph] demand, that\u2019s for sure. But it\u2019s like those who come first will get the contracts locked and the capacity we are able to offer. Our reuse of reverse and also titanium sponge, which for the most part for us comes from Japan, is not affected by the geopolitical uncertainties. And I would certainly want to guarantee for myself that I have got access to titanium.\nKristine Liwag: Thanks, John. Very helpful.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.\nMatt Akers: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Could you kind of share your thoughts on headcount additions at this point? You added a lot of people in 2021, are you sort of covered for this year or are there a lot more that you need to add to support some of the ramp-up later this year?\nJohn Plant: So we have tried to put headcount in sequence to those businesses that, I will say, the early movers in the aerospace recovery map. And so you have seen just under, I think, the number of 950 net adds in our Engine business. We think we are going to start adding in our Fastener business shortly, already are adding our Fastener business and so trying to get ahead of that volume recovery that we see. In terms of access and the availability of labor, so far, it\u2019s been okay. I am saying about 70% of its come from people that we have recalled, and let\u2019s say, therefore, 30% from fresh labor for us. My expectation is that, if things work out as we expect then we will probably be recruiting an additional similar number, probably, somewhere between 800 and 1,000 people during the course of 2022, and if things work out well, we will be on the upside of that, and if not, we will be on the downside, but we will keep adjusting it as we see fit during the year. But, again, if you think about what we have said to you today is that, we have tried to be thoughtful about the addition of labor to be ahead of the curve and training and taking those costs up so that we are not only able to meet our customer\u2019s demand in these, especially in those very difficult parts to manufacture I already talked about. But also we took the time and effort and cash cost of building some additional inventory such that we could protect some of the volume ramp that we expect coming. And we think that the demand actually could be quite healthy and rather than get stressed about our production, we want to be ahead of the game and that\u2019s where we think we are currently. \nMatt Akers: Great. Thanks and that\u2019s helpful.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.\nTimna Tanners: Yeah. Hey. Good morning. I just had a follow-up\u2026\nJohn Plant: Hi.\nTimna Tanners: \u2026 on asking about capital allocation, I know you mentioned that 2021 was a balanced approach. You did mention you don\u2019t see a lot of CapEx needs. So I guess really just remaining trying to get an understanding of how you are looking at dividends versus buybacks versus refinancing and other opportunities? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Yeah. My guess at this point is that, given our healthy cash flow, we will still be returning money of note to shareholders during 2022. In fact, if you think about it, we have already done $100 million in the first few weeks of January. So that gives you an idea of our confidence and strength in the cash flows of the company. We will feel our way through the year and see how we go. But, clearly, if all things go as we expect, then we will be buying additional shares back during the course of the year, with the cadence yet to be determined, but we have plenty of authorization to do so. Clearly, we are also going to make sure we fund the business appropriately and that\u2019s taken care of in a slightly higher CapEx number than before. And I guess that when we get through our first quarter, which we will be reporting to you in early May, we will obviously just take a view of the dividend and whether we feel as though that would benefit from being lifted or not or just do a sense check as we go through. So I expect a balanced approach, but with probably more share buyback as a dividend in terms of any cash flow implication for the company, but I am willing to consider all things. My guess is that when we exit 2022, we are going to also have improved leverage once again of a similar order of magnitude of turns compared to 2021. So I think we are going to have another conversation where we are going to buy back shares, consider dividend and improve our debt structure, and improve our leverage as we exit 2022, and that will set 2023 up in a really good way.\nTimna Tanners: Okay. Great. Thanks for the detail.\nJohn Plant: I can\u2019t believe I just talked about 2023. It\u2019s only the start of 2022. I must be getting carried away.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nPhil Gibbs: Hey. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Phil.\nPhil Gibbs: A question was on the pricing evolution. Safe to say that last year pricing gains were about $80 million and I think you already said this year is probably going to be something a bit less than that, is that fair?\nJohn Plant: Yeah. Well, the second part is I haven\u2019t commented on the first part, because that will be okay in a week or so it\u2019s time.\nPhil Gibbs: Okay. Then you talked about the pass-through, I think, largely -- I would think, largely in the Forged Wheels business for 2022. But aside from the labor bill that you expect over the course of the year, any other incremental inflationary factors that you guys have maybe at a bit higher level than you were expecting three months ago or something that you don\u2019t have hedged out?\nJohn Plant: Energy costs are high, that\u2019s for sure, particularly in Europe. So if you would to go to almost any country in Europe, all of them having differential percentage than the cost of energy, because of their, I will say, policy towards renewables, et cetera. And I will say security of energy is causing that to be an elevated level. It\u2019s also higher in the U.S., but nothing like the increases that are there in Europe. So I -- for your attention to energy as one thing, and of course, we are all familiar with why the general inflation increase, that\u2019s there, and I guess, that\u2019s very early.\nPhil Gibbs: And then just a second part to that, energy comment that you just made, are you all hedged in terms of your energy exposure there or are you feeling the brunt of the spot market gyration?\nJohn Plant: You can assume that it\u2019s pretty costly to hedge energy, and therefore, we will be incurring additional energy costs during the course of the year. And those which are, let\u2019s say, not covered by our customers are all contained within the guidance we have given. And as I said, our guidance is within the incremental range you already provided but just for that metal pass-through.\nPhil Gibbs: Thanks, John. Appreciate it.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Paretosh Misra with Berenberg.\nParetosh Misra: Thanks. Thanks. Good morning. On your CapEx guidance\u2026\nJohn Plant: Hi.\nParetosh Misra: \u2026 and recognizing it\u2019s below depreciation in 2022, but is there any larger project that you are undertaking that\u2019s worth flagging?\nJohn Plant: No. I mean, there\u2019s no significant projects at all. So there\u2019s no capacity expansion, for example, in our Engine business, as we have had previously. As Ken has already commented that, we finished the capacity expansion in our Wheels business in Hungary and Monterrey, Mexico. So that\u2019s also behind us and expect to see the benefits of that capacity available for our customers as we go through the year, and in particular, into next year. So that\u2019s all good. If there\u2019s one thing, I think, where we are going to have an elevated spend compared to previous years. It\u2019s the -- it will be the combination of many of the automation products that we have started throughout the company. And I\u2019d be willing to commit to those additional toric, in fact, stimulated in many cases, those projects, because I really do feel that\u2019s going to pay dividends for us in terms of meeting our ingestation of labor and also taking those inflationary costs for the future in terms of just managing our productivity. And also, I think, going along with that productivity, we will also gain further improvement in our quality indices and as you probably recall from previous earnings calls, I have noted that the improved quality and delivery from Howmet over the last two years or three years. And we would like to continue that path and I think automation is going to be key to do so, while we are going through the volume ramps that we are for the next two years or three years.\nParetosh Misra: Interesting. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on your comments regarding the aftermarket, sorry, if I missed that, but did you say how big your aftermarket business was last year in 2021?\nJohn Plant: I did not. But clarity for everybody now on the call, in Defense and Aerospace, we -- I think the mark we called out in 2019 was about $400 million and that\u2019s close to $500 million these days. And the $400 million, which was in Commercial and Industrial, that dropped the depth of, let\u2019s say, the pandemic to about $100 million more or less. And compared to, say, 2021, so a fractional improvement in the back-end of the year and it\u2019s on that Commercial Aerospace business, where, obviously, I believe we are going to have a 30%-plus improvement in 2022 for spares, both the narrow-body and wide-body.\nParetosh Misra: Got it. Thanks, John.\nJohn Plant: And business jet -- and business jet as well, because business jet is really going very well.\nParetosh Misra: Got it. Very clear.\nJohn Plant: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yeah. Good morning, John.\nJohn Plant: Good morning, George.\nGeorge Shapiro: For the last couple of quarters, you have been a little bit less in revenues than you thought, but the margin has either been as good or better than what you have been guiding to. So how long can you continue to do that, if we see the recovery somewhat slower, so the revenues continue to be a little bit less than expected out there?\nJohn Plant: Okay. But certainly, if you say compared to what I\u2019d like to have seen in the back-end of 2021, then revenue would have been a disappointment. But as you know, we can only supply that with what our customers want. And I think all of us recognize that, I mean, if you call out one instance rather than go through everything, then 787 overshadows everything in the back-end of the year, and in particular, effectively production going to zero in the fourth quarter. So, yeah, revenue line is a disappointment. The most important thing is that despite all and within that output, containing that through our cost reduction programs and our efficiency, despite all of the impact of Omicron and that production disruption that it did provide. Plus if you also want to pile on, you can add all of the additional protection that we try to provide our employees so we can maintain production, and there\u2019s like testing regimes and we have been whipsawed as you know, by mandates and government core changes, so again a lot going on. And if you look at the guide for the first quarter, it\u2019s not really -- if you then go through it closely, and you will say, well, part of our revenue, let\u2019s say, maybe half is material pass-through, so there\u2019s not much volume. And -- but when you adjust for that material, you will see that margin is right on top of where we exited the second half of 2021. So, at the moment, we are -- what we are telling you is we think we can continue to convert effectively, while, I will say, waiting for the volume. And then for me, the really interesting bit is what happens in our second quarter and second half, and we will know a lot more as we go through when we see firmness of production schedules. But we are getting a little bit more optimistic for the second quarter, and certainly, we feel more optimistic in the second half. Even though when you think about it in the round, it\u2019s never good to have a year where you are back-end loaded, but that\u2019s always going to be the nature of it when you are in a recovery situation that the -- certainly, Commercial Aerospace market is and recovery is going to be that way through, 2022 is going to be that way through 2023 as well. So, I\u2019d say, all good, George, with the moment trying to hold things together. We have held things together, while say the market hasn\u2019t been kind to us by way of volumes. And then should we get a little bit of a whiff of increase, like, sales we had in Q3, then I am hopeful we are going to convert and maybe enter those sunny uplands as I think.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. No. It\u2019s been impressive performance. I am just wondering how long you can keep it going if you don\u2019t get the revenue.\nJohn Plant: Yeah. Well, I guess, I mean, I keep -- if you want, light that candle that might make proud that I want the volume, because operating with the lack, I mean, the headwinds we have had over the last few quarters and years or two years, it\u2019s been tough. But the answer is we have converted, we have done what we should do and delivered, and are looking forward to the volume improvement, which will happen, it\u2019s a strong thing that will happen during 2022 at some point.\nGeorge Shapiro: Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: I think it\u2019s also important to keep the big picture in mind despite, I will call, all the little bits of stuff that you deal with, the big picture is, let\u2019s just consider, revenues are going up in recovery, the Commercial Aerospace business is going to improve, narrow-body is leading the way, volume will increase, whether it\u2019s from Airbus and Boeing, and hopefully, stronger from Boeing, and hopefully, aircraft will start being delivered in China shortly for the narrow-body. I mean, it\u2019s all good. So let\u2019s keep focused on the big picture here.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yeah. Very helpful. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, John. I just wanted to try to better understand what\u2019s going on with the 787. I am a little surprised by your comments that you are sort of not hearing much from them. I mean is that surprising to you, I know they have a lot of inventory, but they are talking about restarting the underlying production rate, presumably, they need to give the supply chain that info. So what\u2019s going on there and then putting their comments aside, what\u2019s your assessment of what\u2019s happening there, why it\u2019s taking so long and when it starts back up?\nJohn Plant: I don\u2019t know if my assessment count so much at all.\nNoah Poponak: It does.\nJohn Plant: But, I think, it\u2019s -- Boeing\u2019s assessment makes a lot of difference. My take is, Boeing rightly don\u2019t want to get ahead of the FAA in providing commentary. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been helpful in the past, and therefore, I think, a cautious line is being taken. And my thought is that, is it the Omicron, the MPS, the Italian Leonardo problem is behind them. Solutions are done. The gaps which were there and the shims are being worked through. The issue around the doors has been solved and is being worked through. And I think the audit of the supply base in terms of supplier performance has been completed. And so there\u2019s a lot of milestones, which I think are being done and everybody is a bit snake bit on making prediction -- are predictions for the aircraft. And my hope is that during this quarter is that or latest early second quarter is that the FAA give recertification. And then I think that those aircraft will be flowing because clearly as the fundamental demand for this composite wide-body aircraft and its efficiency and it\u2019s a great aircraft. So if you just look at some of the summer cancellation of schedules by the airlines, they need those aircraft. And so, as it gets recertified production, we will get a lift from the let\u2019s assume that those penny numbers are being done currently and we are going to see rates of five in the second half of this year, five per month that is. So I think that\u2019s the way it plays out, but I am not in control of those events at all and I am just trying to give you a view\u2026\nNoah Poponak: Yeah.\nJohn Plant: \u2026 albeit it\u2019s a view that, as I said, doesn\u2019t count that much really.\nNoah Poponak: No. It does. And that\u2019s helpful. And I guess given the inventory they have and then that the production rate would start pretty low and maybe be there for a bit, while it may sound surprising to me that they are not giving you a schedule, they don\u2019t necessarily need to, because they are going to restart at such a low rate, combine that with the sensitivity of being ahead of the regulator and that would explain that, that, what the communication is right now, even if things are going to restart\u2026\nJohn Plant: Yeah.\nNoah Poponak: \u2026 relatively soon.\nJohn Plant: Yeah. And I do believe they need to get back to five a month, and overall, if we are not careful, there\u2019s going to be, if we end up in zero for an extended period of time, then it\u2019s going to be really difficult to get production rates up for that aircraft. I mean that\u2019s\u2026\nNoah Poponak: Right.\nJohn Plant: \u2026it\u2019s a difficult aircraft to build, as we all know, that was an aircraft where not only was the fundamental technology change, but that\u2019s combined with a supply chain, change of great notes back in, say, the 2000, let\u2019s call it, 2008, 2009 timeframe. And when you think about all the different subs around the world, let\u2019s say, probably, as far away as Japan and lots of other countries as well, then there\u2019s inventory in the system all the way through and that will take a bit of burning off.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, PT, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to slide four. First, let me frame the quarter for you. The environment was challenging with the new variant of Omicron emerging the day after Thanksgiving. Fortunately, once we take time to understanding the changing nature of the pandemic, we find that the virus appears to be weakening albeit it's quite transmissible. Boeing also continues to test us with reduced build or zero build of the 787 wide-body aircraft as recertification is once again delayed and unclear. Despite these impacts, Howmet performed well, with revenues of $1.285 billion, improving well above last year and in line with Q3. Adjusted EBITDA improved both over last year and sequentially and was $296 million, with an EBITDA margin at 23%. We were pleased with the margin exit rate for both the Q4 and the second half of 2021. The sales picture is one of strengthening Commercial Aerospace narrow-body production, healthy Defense and IGT sales combined with constrained sales of our high performance Wheels segment due to the supply chain constraints at our customers in the Commercial Truck Manufacturing business. Clearly, both Delta and Omicron variant of the virus impacted production operations. But nevertheless, we were able to bring through a good level of efficiency. Turning to the balance sheet now and the cash flow of the company, adjusted free cash flow was a record at $517 million for the year and well ahead of both last year and guidance, with a conversion rate of 117% of net income. We also made incremental voluntary pension contributions in the quarter, and if we exclude these contributions, adjusted free cash flow would have been 123% conversion of net income. For your information, the free cash flow conversion has continued in the last three years at a level well in excess of our long-term guide of 90%. The year-end cash balance was $722 million and reflects both the good cash flow conversion and the fact that in the fourth quarter, Howmet repurchased $205 million of shares at an average price of $30.32. For the fourth quarter average diluted share count reduced to 431 million and the year-end diluted share stood at 428 million. The repurchase of shares continued in early 2022 with a further 3 million shares purchased for $100 million during the month of January. As of the end of January, the diluted share count has been reduced to approximately 425 million shares. And finally, the 2021 tax rate was reduced by the work we have done and the effect was $0.01 on earnings in the fourth quarter. We look forward to 2022, and I will provide commentary when we get to the outlook section of our presentation. Meanwhile, I will hand the call over to Ken Giacobbe. Thanks, Ken. Let's move to slide 12 for guidance for 2022. The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement, notably for domestic travel. We continue to hold the view that we will see an acceleration in revenue growth during the course of the year, following a fairly flat Q1 compared to Q4. The Engine Products business has led the recovery to-date and we now expect the Engineered Structures business will see lower revenue in the first half of 2022, due to the continued delays with the 787. Fastening Systems is expected to show growth in the first half of 2022, starting in the first quarter. In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following, the guidance for Q1 revenue at $1.3 billion, plus or minus $20 million, EBITDA of $295 million, plus or minus $9 million, EBITDA margin of 22.7%, plus or minus 30 basis points, and EPS of $0.29, plus or minus $0.01. And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5.64 billion, plus or minus $80 million, EBITDA at $1.3 billion, plus or minus $35 million, EBITDA margin of 23%, plus 30 basis points and minus 20 basis points, EPS to increase to $1.37, plus or minus $0.06, and cash flow to be $625 million, plus or minus $50 million. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide we expect the following. Revenue to the up approximately 13% versus 2021, driven by Commercial Aerospace, Commercial Transportation and the IGT market,  The 2022 revenue guidance includes more than $125 million of material pass-through impacted margins by at least 50 basis points. And for clarity, the price increases are excluded from the $125 million of pass-through Adjusting for that $125-plus million of material pass-through, then the incremental EBITDA margins fall nicely in the 30% to 35% range. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be up 15% versus last year, adjusted earnings per share to be up approximately 36% versus 2021, pension and OPEB contributions of approximately $60 million in the year. CapEx should be in the range of $220 million to $250 million and that continues to be less than depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net source of cash. Adjusted free cash flow compared to net income is approximately 110%. Incrementals adjusting for the metal between 30% and 35%, as previously stated. So let's move to slide 13 for the summary of 2021. In conclusion, Howmet delivered really well in 2021, and I note the challenges that we overcame. EBITDA and EBITDA margin increased with the Q4 exit rate of 23%. Operational productivity was healthy and structural costs reduced by $130 million. Prices, sorry, pricing was improved during the course of the year and well above inflation recovery. Free cash flow was excellent and allowed for further share buybacks of $430 million or $13 million -- 13 million shares, while also improving the net leverage of the company and reducing gross debt by $845 million, and furthermore, reducing interest carrying costs of $70 million, thereby improving future free cash flow yield of the company. Furthermore, pension and OPEB growth liabilities were reduced by $440 million, which is another huge step in the improvement in the balance sheet of the company and net liabilities by $275 million. Lastly, work performed and the tax rate showed improvement with the rate reduced by 250 basis points to 25%. Thank you. And now let's take your questions. Hey, Rob. Yeah. I mean, I will probably just give you what I seem to be, what I think are three levels of response to your question. I'd probably just cover the first two. At its most simplest, no CEOs that have commented publicly have contacted me to register any concerns whatsoever. I could leave it at that. But I think I'd like to go a little bit further, and say, I am really glad it's recognized just how hard and how exacting the production of such products are. And it's a good job that there is inventory in the pipeline at many levels, starting with completed engines at Boeing and Airbus, and also in the pipeline between us and the engine manufacturers. I think it will be also great to recognize the lead times with scheduled commitments to back up the skylines and aircraft production in full, assuming that these volumes are required. And then the third level of commentary would be, I will say, commenting on the whole supply chain, labor availability, skills, response times, et cetera. But for right now, I have no recognition of this as a significant issue in any dimension. Obviously, it always depends upon the parts that are in question. My expectation is that the spot business will pick up in 2022 and that will be to our benefit. And hopefully, we can respond in the same way that we were able to respond in 2019 and pick up the additional business should it occur and I think that's probably as far as I can go at this point, Rob. Thank you. Hi. Yeah. Yeah. So if I exclude metals from that revenue line, then the volume increase is around 11%. So, close to that 12% to 15% that I previously called, and the reason for it being at the lower-end of that is the 787 and the lack of visibility that we have to be going that aircraft. And we note that our customer hasn't provided any solid view skyline, and therefore, we have to make our own assumption of volume of production. And in addition, I'd say, there's a bit of an inventory overhang on F-35, given that while we supplied to schedule during 2021, I note that Lockheed did not build the full quantity of aircraft. So while the aircraft production is going to increase in 2022 and increase in 2023 then that's great, but we have got to burn off a bit of an overhang in the early part of 2022 and then we will see further volume improvements as we go into 2023 when that overhang, hopefully, will no longer be there and it will be bit rise in the first part of this year. So those would be the, let's say, a couple of comments regarding the revenues for 2022 and the early part of the year. Does that cover it or do you need a bit more? Yeah. So far nothing on nickel. I recognize the Carpenter matter and I think that's going to be a little bit of a pinch point in the first half of this year. Nothing dramatic that we see at this point, but definitely having some impact. Hi, David. Yeah. So by end markets, Commercial Aero is going to be up in 2022, led by narrow-body, but not a lot happening on wide-body with the 787 being the complete wild card in all of this. IGT should be -- continue to be healthy and I believe to be up in the year. And Commercial Transportation for our Wheels business will be up and I think the supply chain constraints ease that we are going to see a fairly healthy second half of the year in that business and a really great 2023. The weak point at the moment would be Defense for us. I think it's going to be flat to slightly down for the year and with most of that playing out in the first half of 2022. And oil and gas, too difficult to call at this point, we are hopeful for an improvement, but haven't planned on it. So that covers out the end markets. 737, I haven't got the exact numbers, but maybe while I am chatting here, Ken, get them. But essentially, while we note the production for last year and it's increased in the second half of the year to -- I don't know what the number was, let's say, 14, I am going to recognize rather than the numbers I have seen thrown around. We have seen that improvement. But again we have been supplying it below that level as the remains of the inventory is being burned off on particularly the LEAP 1B for us in the Engine segment and that's hopefully going to just show healthy growth for us this year, again, strengthening as we go through the year when we see the further rate increase and there's no inventory left in the pipeline to get burned off. And then should Boeing feel more confident and do consider raising the rate that will be great for us and above what we have guided. Spares, just to comment on that, that's going to be healthy for us this year, but rate of percentage increase, I am thinking on the Commercial Aero side, maybe something like a 30% increase in our aftermarket revenues, 30% plus. But as you know, it's coming at a fairly low base. So the dollars are beginning to be interesting but still well below our previous levels in 2019. Thank you. We have assumed, I mean, it's just a ballpark number, about 35 aircrafts are production for the year. It's just a guess, with very limited production there or maybe zero production in the first quarter. And then assuming there's something, but not quite sure what, so we ballparked it around that 35 level. In terms of those production facilities, if you take the air force that go into the Engines, clearly, I mean, while that will release casting capacity, it's -- if the device is dedicated to that aircraft. So nothing will be changed over there. And for the most part, that type of Fastening System and Titanium Structures are dedicated to the aircraft albeit there's enough capacity to produce for other customers for any of those flight types or any bulk fasteners. So, yes, there's use for them elsewhere, but we have already made provision to be at production rates for everything elsewhere. So, there's no upside in 787 being down. We just like the aircraft to get back certified and production to start and lift and that would be very helpful to us. Thank you. No change to long-term guidance, just that when you have got, let's say, CapEx below D&A for a period of time, that's healthy, we expect, as I guided, the pension contributions to be lower in 2022 than previous year. So we are expecting some working capital build and should we hit our marks in terms of, I will say, receivables and payables, then I'd be quite excited to use increased working capital in the back-end of the year, because that would mean a very healthy exit rate and great momentum going into 2022. Working capital drag for us is not the biggest deal, given the strength of margin and we much prefer to see the improved revenues. Having said all of that, we do hope to further improve our inventory efficiency during the course of the year. It's part of, I'd say, what we do. And that's helping us reduce the -- what is pro rata or pro rata working capital drag from the increased revenue. So, in summary, there is a working capital drag on cash flow. We try to improve efficiency, but would love that drag to be even higher, because that shows strength particularly in the second half of the year. Small amount, yeah. Thank you. Hey, Seth. Yeah. So consistent with what I have said previously, the 2021 was a bigger year for us and you saw that. And I think the number through the third quarter was a cumulative $60-plus million of price, excluding inflationary pass-through. The Q4 number will be issued as we issue today in a week or so time. And the -- for 2022, the book of LTA will not be as big as 2021, again, consistent with what I previously said. Nothing's changed, we are well through our negotiations, but not completed for 2022, but well through and our expectation for the price improvement is exactly in line with previous statements. Thank you. Hey, Noah. Yeah. Well, the last quarter, I gave you 35%, plus or minus 5% approx and we are well within that. So I think it's exactly in line. I don't think anybody is going to argue for a couple of percent with all of the variables around us. So those variables will be Omicron, production disruption, I could talk about inflation, I could talk about recovery inflation, I could talk about 787, the F-35, the management of LEAP 1B inventory and also things like container availability, never mind the cost of containers. So there's a lot of stuff going on and within that overall context of uncertainty, then I think the guide is just exactly in line and we will see how things pan out during the course of the year. I am not accustomed to disappointing and the most important one, not to disappoint myself. And so at the moment, I think, we are in line. I think the most important thing is, we are passing through, we can pass through these significant material changes and others. So that's the important thing. It's not an excuse me for reduce margins. And it's non -- once we get to it, it's a non-conversation. We have given you a range where we will take this and deliver, and hopefully, deliver improved margins in 2023, just in the same way as we deliver the improved margins in 2022 -- in 2021. And 2021, as you know, was a 200-plus-basis-point improvement over 2020 and we have guided you to, I think, 23% midpoint, which would be an increase over 2021. Well, I am certainly optimistic for our Fastener business, because that's a good margin business. I'd be a lot more bullish about it, if I knew more about the 787. But while I don't, I am going to be fairly cautious. I still think that given, I mean, when you go into like sort through this, given, I think, in the Q4 revenue slightly down, but margin up, and if you think margin up when the wide-body is down and 787 down, and given the differential mix of Fastener on aircraft, it was a real credible and creditable performance for the Fastener business. Thank you. If anything, I did note comments in the press for -- from Boeing regarding concerns about geopolitical stability and the impact of titanium. And should that -- those concerns prove material or real, then that would be great for us, because we have got titanium capacity. We would be happy to commit to a long-term agreement with that customer or indeed any others. So if there is geopolitical uncertainty, whether it's for the defense contractors or for civil aerospace production, then I think that's -- we would be happy to take your calls. Well, it's clearly not the whole of the VSMPO [ph] demand, that's for sure. But it's like those who come first will get the contracts locked and the capacity we are able to offer. Our reuse of reverse and also titanium sponge, which for the most part for us comes from Japan, is not affected by the geopolitical uncertainties. And I would certainly want to guarantee for myself that I have got access to titanium. Thank you. So we have tried to put headcount in sequence to those businesses that, I will say, the early movers in the aerospace recovery map. And so you have seen just under, I think, the number of 950 net adds in our Engine business. We think we are going to start adding in our Fastener business shortly, already are adding our Fastener business and so trying to get ahead of that volume recovery that we see. In terms of access and the availability of labor, so far, it's been okay. I am saying about 70% of its come from people that we have recalled, and let's say, therefore, 30% from fresh labor for us. My expectation is that, if things work out as we expect then we will probably be recruiting an additional similar number, probably, somewhere between 800 and 1,000 people during the course of 2022, and if things work out well, we will be on the upside of that, and if not, we will be on the downside, but we will keep adjusting it as we see fit during the year. But, again, if you think about what we have said to you today is that, we have tried to be thoughtful about the addition of labor to be ahead of the curve and training and taking those costs up so that we are not only able to meet our customer's demand in these, especially in those very difficult parts to manufacture I already talked about. But also we took the time and effort and cash cost of building some additional inventory such that we could protect some of the volume ramp that we expect coming. And we think that the demand actually could be quite healthy and rather than get stressed about our production, we want to be ahead of the game and that's where we think we are currently. Thank you. Hi. Yeah. My guess at this point is that, given our healthy cash flow, we will still be returning money of note to shareholders during 2022. In fact, if you think about it, we have already done $100 million in the first few weeks of January. So that gives you an idea of our confidence and strength in the cash flows of the company. We will feel our way through the year and see how we go. But, clearly, if all things go as we expect, then we will be buying additional shares back during the course of the year, with the cadence yet to be determined, but we have plenty of authorization to do so. Clearly, we are also going to make sure we fund the business appropriately and that's taken care of in a slightly higher CapEx number than before. And I guess that when we get through our first quarter, which we will be reporting to you in early May, we will obviously just take a view of the dividend and whether we feel as though that would benefit from being lifted or not or just do a sense check as we go through. So I expect a balanced approach, but with probably more share buyback as a dividend in terms of any cash flow implication for the company, but I am willing to consider all things. My guess is that when we exit 2022, we are going to also have improved leverage once again of a similar order of magnitude of turns compared to 2021. So I think we are going to have another conversation where we are going to buy back shares, consider dividend and improve our debt structure, and improve our leverage as we exit 2022, and that will set 2023 up in a really good way. I can't believe I just talked about 2023. It's only the start of 2022. I must be getting carried away. Hey, Phil. Yeah. Well, the second part is I haven't commented on the first part, because that will be okay in a week or so it's time. Energy costs are high, that's for sure, particularly in Europe. So if you would to go to almost any country in Europe, all of them having differential percentage than the cost of energy, because of their, I will say, policy towards renewables, et cetera. And I will say security of energy is causing that to be an elevated level. It's also higher in the U.S., but nothing like the increases that are there in Europe. So I -- for your attention to energy as one thing, and of course, we are all familiar with why the general inflation increase, that's there, and I guess, that's very early. You can assume that it's pretty costly to hedge energy, and therefore, we will be incurring additional energy costs during the course of the year. And those which are, let's say, not covered by our customers are all contained within the guidance we have given. And as I said, our guidance is within the incremental range you already provided but just for that metal pass-through. Thank you. Hi. No. I mean, there's no significant projects at all. So there's no capacity expansion, for example, in our Engine business, as we have had previously. As Ken has already commented that, we finished the capacity expansion in our Wheels business in Hungary and Monterrey, Mexico. So that's also behind us and expect to see the benefits of that capacity available for our customers as we go through the year, and in particular, into next year. So that's all good. If there's one thing, I think, where we are going to have an elevated spend compared to previous years. It's the -- it will be the combination of many of the automation products that we have started throughout the company. And I'd be willing to commit to those additional toric, in fact, stimulated in many cases, those projects, because I really do feel that's going to pay dividends for us in terms of meeting our ingestation of labor and also taking those inflationary costs for the future in terms of just managing our productivity. And also, I think, going along with that productivity, we will also gain further improvement in our quality indices and as you probably recall from previous earnings calls, I have noted that the improved quality and delivery from Howmet over the last two years or three years. And we would like to continue that path and I think automation is going to be key to do so, while we are going through the volume ramps that we are for the next two years or three years. I did not. But clarity for everybody now on the call, in Defense and Aerospace, we -- I think the mark we called out in 2019 was about $400 million and that's close to $500 million these days. And the $400 million, which was in Commercial and Industrial, that dropped the depth of, let's say, the pandemic to about $100 million more or less. And compared to, say, 2021, so a fractional improvement in the back-end of the year and it's on that Commercial Aerospace business, where, obviously, I believe we are going to have a 30%-plus improvement in 2022 for spares, both the narrow-body and wide-body. And business jet -- and business jet as well, because business jet is really going very well. Thank you. Good morning, George. Okay. But certainly, if you say compared to what I'd like to have seen in the back-end of 2021, then revenue would have been a disappointment. But as you know, we can only supply that with what our customers want. And I think all of us recognize that, I mean, if you call out one instance rather than go through everything, then 787 overshadows everything in the back-end of the year, and in particular, effectively production going to zero in the fourth quarter. So, yeah, revenue line is a disappointment. The most important thing is that despite all and within that output, containing that through our cost reduction programs and our efficiency, despite all of the impact of Omicron and that production disruption that it did provide. Plus if you also want to pile on, you can add all of the additional protection that we try to provide our employees so we can maintain production, and there's like testing regimes and we have been whipsawed as you know, by mandates and government core changes, so again a lot going on. And if you look at the guide for the first quarter, it's not really -- if you then go through it closely, and you will say, well, part of our revenue, let's say, maybe half is material pass-through, so there's not much volume. And -- but when you adjust for that material, you will see that margin is right on top of where we exited the second half of 2021. So, at the moment, we are -- what we are telling you is we think we can continue to convert effectively, while, I will say, waiting for the volume. And then for me, the really interesting bit is what happens in our second quarter and second half, and we will know a lot more as we go through when we see firmness of production schedules. But we are getting a little bit more optimistic for the second quarter, and certainly, we feel more optimistic in the second half. Even though when you think about it in the round, it's never good to have a year where you are back-end loaded, but that's always going to be the nature of it when you are in a recovery situation that the -- certainly, Commercial Aerospace market is and recovery is going to be that way through, 2022 is going to be that way through 2023 as well. So, I'd say, all good, George, with the moment trying to hold things together. We have held things together, while say the market hasn't been kind to us by way of volumes. And then should we get a little bit of a whiff of increase, like, sales we had in Q3, then I am hopeful we are going to convert and maybe enter those sunny uplands as I think. Yeah. Well, I guess, I mean, I keep -- if you want, light that candle that might make proud that I want the volume, because operating with the lack, I mean, the headwinds we have had over the last few quarters and years or two years, it's been tough. But the answer is we have converted, we have done what we should do and delivered, and are looking forward to the volume improvement, which will happen, it's a strong thing that will happen during 2022 at some point. I think it's also important to keep the big picture in mind despite, I will call, all the little bits of stuff that you deal with, the big picture is, let's just consider, revenues are going up in recovery, the Commercial Aerospace business is going to improve, narrow-body is leading the way, volume will increase, whether it's from Airbus and Boeing, and hopefully, stronger from Boeing, and hopefully, aircraft will start being delivered in China shortly for the narrow-body. I mean, it's all good. So let's keep focused on the big picture here. Thank you. I don't know if my assessment count so much at all. But, I think, it's -- Boeing's assessment makes a lot of difference. My take is, Boeing rightly don't want to get ahead of the FAA in providing commentary. I don't think that's been helpful in the past, and therefore, I think, a cautious line is being taken. And my thought is that, is it the Omicron, the MPS, the Italian Leonardo problem is behind them. Solutions are done. The gaps which were there and the shims are being worked through. The issue around the doors has been solved and is being worked through. And I think the audit of the supply base in terms of supplier performance has been completed. And so there's a lot of milestones, which I think are being done and everybody is a bit snake bit on making prediction -- are predictions for the aircraft. And my hope is that during this quarter is that or latest early second quarter is that the FAA give recertification. And then I think that those aircraft will be flowing because clearly as the fundamental demand for this composite wide-body aircraft and its efficiency and it's a great aircraft. So if you just look at some of the summer cancellation of schedules by the airlines, they need those aircraft. And so, as it gets recertified production, we will get a lift from the let's assume that those penny numbers are being done currently and we are going to see rates of five in the second half of this year, five per month that is. So I think that's the way it plays out, but I am not in control of those events at all and I am just trying to give you a view... ... albeit it's a view that, as I said, doesn't count that much really. Yeah. Yeah. And I do believe they need to get back to five a month, and overall, if we are not careful, there's going to be, if we end up in zero for an extended period of time, then it's going to be really difficult to get production rates up for that aircraft. I mean that's... ...it's a difficult aircraft to build, as we all know, that was an aircraft where not only was the fundamental technology change, but that's combined with a supply chain, change of great notes back in, say, the 2000, let's call it, 2008, 2009 timeframe. And when you think about all the different subs around the world, let's say, probably, as far away as Japan and lots of other countries as well, then there's inventory in the system all the way through and that will take a bit of burning off. Thank you."

            "name": "Ken Giacobbe",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Let's -- please move to slide five. Fourth quarter total revenue was up 4% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Commercial Aerospace increased to 44% of total revenue, which is an improvement sequentially, but far short of the pre-COVID levels of 60%. Commercial Aerospace recovery continued in the fourth quarter, with Commercial Aerospace revenue up 13% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segment and the narrow-body recovery. Defense Aerospace was down 22% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the Joint Strike Fighter. Commercial Transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and the Fastening Systems segment, was up 20% year-over-year, driven by higher aluminum prices. However, the market was down 1% sequentially as the market continues to be impacted by supply chain constraints at our customers, which is limiting commercial truck production. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was down 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Now, let's move to slide six, which sums up the year nicely. Let's start with the P&L. For the full year, price increases were up year-over-year and in line with expectations, as they are primarily tied to long-term agreements. Structural cost reductions were approximately $130 million, which exceeded our target of $100 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year was 22.8%, which was an increase of 220 basis points year-over-year, despite $285 million of lower revenue. The fourth quarter exit rate was 23%. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 or 31% higher than 2020. Moving to the balance sheet, our cash balance was healthy at $722 million. Adjusted free cash flow was a record $517 million, which was well above the guidance. Free cash flow conversion was 117% of net income and if we exclude voluntary pension contributions of $28 million, adjusted free cash flow conversion was 123% of net income. Net pension and OPEB liabilities were reduced by approximately $275 million, while pension and OPEB expense, as well as the associated cash contributions were each reduced by approximately 54%. Net debt-to-EBITDA improved to 3.1 times. Regarding capital allocation, we have taken a balanced approach. Capital investment projects for Forged Wheels at Hungary and Mexico are now essentially complete. Concurrently, we have been investing in automation projects in the Engines and Fasteners segments. During the year, we paid down gross debt of approximately $845 million, with cash on hand and reduced annualized interest costs by approximately $70 million. We also reinstated the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock in Q3 of 2021. Lastly, we repurchased approximately 13.4 million shares of common stock for $430 million, with an average acquisition price of $32.07 per share. To sum it up, during the year, we enhanced our profitability, strengthened the balance sheet and we are balanced in our capital allocation. Let's move to slide seven to briefly cover the segment results. Engine Products year-over-year revenue was 9% higher in the fourth quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 39% higher driven by the narrow-body recovery. Defense Aerospace was down 26% year-over-year, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the Joint Strike Fighter. Operating profit increased 10% year-over-year and operating margin improved 20 basis points, despite adding approximately 150 employees in the fourth quarter, which now brings our total employees added since Q1 to approximately 950 employees. Now let's move to slide eight. As expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 3% lower in the fourth quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 15% lower, as we continued to experience production declines for the Boeing 787. Commercial Transportation was up approximately 46%. Year-over-year, Fastening Systems was able to maintain segment operating profit on $7 million of lower revenue. As a result, operating margin improved 50 basis points. Now let's move to slide nine. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 12% lower in the fourth quarter. Commercial Aerospace was flat, as the narrow-body recovery was offset by production declines for the Boeing 787. The Defense Aerospace market was down 26% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Year-over-year, Engine Structures was able to generate $3 million more in segment operating profit on $27 million of lower revenue, primarily due to permanent cost reductions and a favorable $2.5 million non-recurring adjustment related to a customer contract negotiation. As a result, operating margin improved 260 basis points. Finally, let's move to slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 15% higher in the fourth quarter. Approximately $28 million of the $31 million revenue increase was due to higher aluminum price pass-through. Pass-through of higher aluminum prices did not impact operating profit dollars, but unfavorably impacted operating profit margin by approximately 350 basis points. On a sequential basis, revenue and operating profit were essentially flat. Commercial Transportation demand remained strong, but volumes continued to be impacted by customer supply chain issues. Aluminum prices were flat sequentially, resulting in minimal impact to sequential operating profit margin. One final comment on the segments, the incremental profit flow-through for the segments in Q4 was 30% year-over-year and can be found in the appendix. The 30% includes a 55% increase in aluminum prices year-over-year, which adversely impacted the incremental profit flow-through. If we adjust for aluminum prices, incrementals were above 70%. Now let's move to slide 11. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. In 2021, we took actions to lower our annualized interest costs by approximately $70 million through a combination of paying down gross debt by approximately $845 million with cash on hand and also refinancing higher cost debt with lower cost debt. Gross debt remains at $4.2 billion. Net debt-to-EBITDA improved to 3.1 times, despite cash used for debt refinancing, share buybacks and dividends. All debt is unsecured and the next maturity is in October of 2024. Finally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Before turning it back to John to discuss the guidance, I'd like to point out a few items that you can find in the appendix. First, there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items in the quarter. Special items for the fourth quarter were a net charge of approximately $53 million, mainly driven by costs associated with non-cash pension plan settlement charges. Second, there's a slide in the appendix that summarizes the share repurchases that occurred in 2021, as well as the share repurchases in January of 2022. Remaining common stock share repurchase authority sits at $1.25 billion as of February 1, 2022. Finally, in the reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow, you will notice the cash receipt from sold receivables is zero dollars in the fourth quarter. As a result of restructuring our accounts receivable securitization program in Q3 2021, cash receipts from sold receivables will be zero going forward and the entire impact from the sale of accounts receivables will be in cash from operations. Therefore, starting with Q4 of 2021 and beyond, the definition of free cash flow will be simplified and be cash from operations less CapEx. Please note that the net cash funding from the sale of accounts receivable has been $250 million since Q4 of 2020, which means that the sale of accounts receivables has neither been a source of cash or a use of cash in 2021. So, with that, let me now turn it back over to John. Yeah. And in terms of, David, the exit rate on the 737 in Q4, we were at about 17 aircraft. And as we look into 2022 consistent with what we said last quarter, probably, low 20s in the first half and low 30s in the second half. And Myles, what I would add to that -- this is Ken. As John said, it's a modest cash burn in working capital. But as we exited 2021, we built some inventory, specifically in the Engines business on some of these key platforms in order to get ahead of the ramp. So we think we are in good shape."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Erica. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace Third Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we've included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, PT. Good morning, and welcome to the call. We'll move quickly through the slides and then get to your questions. First, let's summarize the headline numbers, starting on Slide number 4. Revenue was $1.28 billion, adjusted EBITDA $292 million and EBITDA margin was 22.8%. Each number was within the guidance range provided. More importantly, year-over-year revenues increased for the first time. The revenue was led by Commercial Aerospace, up 15% year-over-year, and contributing to a total increase of 13%. Of note, the Howmet segment leading the increase was Engine Products as previously forecasted. The company was also able to overcome the challenges once again of the Boeing 787 build rate declines and the supply chain issues limiting commercial truck production, the 787 affecting Fastening Systems and Engineering Structures in particular. Aluminum prices continued their upward surge with aluminum and regional premiums increasing by over $400 per metric ton sequentially and impacting the margin rate by 20 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.27, and cash generated in the quarter was $115 million. AR securitization was unchanged at $250 million. On a sequential basis, Third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA were up 7% and adjusted earnings per share up 23%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $115 million, which results in a Q3 year-to-date free cash flow at a record $275 million. Ken will provide further details of our debt actions in the quarter, which included a bond tender refi \u2013 finance to fundamentally lower interest costs and thereby improve future free cash flow yields. The combination of debt actions in the third quarter, combined with our first half results and actions, will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $70 million. In the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 770,000 shares of common stock for $25 million, which increases share repurchases year-to-date to approximately 7 million shares for $225 million. The net result of all these actions plus the reinstatement of the common stock dividend and the $115 million cash inflow resulted in a cash balance of $726 million, similar to that at the end of Q2. Lastly, we continue to focus on legacy liabilities and have reduced pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $180 million year-to-date. Moreover, year-to-date pension and OPEB expense have reduced by approximately 50% compared to last year. Please move to Slide number 5. Revenue for the quarter increased 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As expected, Commercial Aerospace was up 15% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segment and narrow-body aircraft production. Commercial Transportation, namely Wheels, was up 38% year-over-year. Volume was impacted by supply chain constraints, limiting the commercial truck production. The volume reduction in the Wheels business was offset by metal recovery dollars. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 26% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven by new builds and spares. Defense Aerospace was down 11% year-over-year, driven by reductions in the Joint Strike Fighter builds, but was up 3% sequentially from the second quarter. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations. Structural cost reductions have exceeded our annual target of $100 million. Q3 structural cost reductions were $23 million year-over-year and $121 million year-to-date. Every segment achieved a strong year-on-year margin expansion as revenue increased for the first time in the year in aggregate. In the third quarter, Engine Products had an incremental operating margin of approximately 70%, and Forged Wheels had an incremental operating margin of approximately 45%. Fastening Systems and Engineering Structures both had a higher EBITDA and lower revenue. Fasteners had an operating margin expansion of some 630 basis points, while structures was up 210 basis points. As a result, Howmet's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded a full 800 basis points year-on-year, driven by volume, price and structural cost reductions. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $115 million and year-to-date $275 million. And as I said previously, AR securitization is unchanged from the start of the year. Lastly, we have lowered our annualized interest cost by $70 million through a combination of paying down debt and refinancing into lower cost debt. Please move to Slide number 6. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.8%, representing an 800 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2020. The margin for the third quarter was consistent with the last few quarters, despite the cost of adding employees to meet the increasing production demand and the effect on margins of the higher aluminum prices. In the quarter, Engine Products added approximately 500 employees net, which now brings the total to 800 net additional employees hired for that segment during the second and third quarters. We continue to review the headcount required in our other segments to adjust for future demand requirements. Now let me turn it over to Ken for further details on revenue by market and the detailed financials.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Please move to markets on Slide 7. Third quarter total revenue was up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Commercial Aerospace increased to 42% of total revenue, which is an improvement sequentially, but far short of pre-COVID levels of 60%. The third quarter marked the start of the Commercial Aerospace recovery, with commercial aerospace revenue up 15% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Defense Aerospace was down 11% year-over-year, driven by the Joint Strike Fighter and up 3% sequentially. Commercial Transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segment was up 38% year-over-year, however, flat sequentially after we adjust for the increase in aluminum prices. Finally, the Industrial and Other Markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was up 14% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. IGT, which makes up approximately 45% of this market continues to be strong and was up a healthy 26% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Let's move to Slide 8 for the segment results. As expected, Engine Products year-over-year revenue was 24% higher in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 50% higher, driven by the narrow-body recovery. IGT was 26% higher as demand for cleaner energy continues. Defense Aerospace was down 8% year-over-year, but up 7% sequentially. Incremental margins for Engine Products were approximately 70% for the quarter despite hiring back approximately 500 workers to prepare for future growth. Operating margin improved 1,200 basis points year-over-year. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's incremental margins for the quarter. Please move to Slide 9. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 6% lower in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 25% lower as we saw continued production declines for the Boeing 787 and customer inventory corrections. The commercial transportation and industrial markets within the Fastening Systems segments were approximately 55% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. Year-over-year Fastening Systems was able to generate $14 million more in operating profit, while revenue declined $17 million. As a result, operating margin improved 630 basis points. Please move to Slide 10. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 3% lower in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 13% higher as the narrow-body recovery was partially offset by production declines for the Boeing 787. Defense Aerospace was down 21% year-over-year but was flat sequentially. Year-over-year, Engineered Structures was able to generate $4 million more in operating profit on $7 million of lower revenue. As a result, operating margin improved 210 basis points. Finally, please move to Slide 11. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 34% higher in the third quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue and operating profit were essentially flat. The segment was able to overcome a 4% decrease in volume due to customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production, and a 13% increase in aluminum prices to maintain a healthy operating margin of approximately 27%. Year-over-year incremental margins for Forged Wheels were approximately 45% for the quarter. Improved margins were driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries. Now let's move to Slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. I would highlight three actions. First, in the first half of the year, we paid down approximately $835 million of debt by completing the early redemption of our 2021 and 2022 bonds with cash on hand. The annualized interest expense savings with this action is approximately $47 million. Second, in the third quarter we tendered $600 million of our 6.875% notes due in 2025 and issued $700 million of 3% notes due in 2029. The annualized interest expense savings with this action is approximately $20 million. Third, with cash on hand, we repurchased $100 million of our 2021 notes through an open market repurchase in Q3 and in October, which neutralized the gross debt impact of the tender and refinancing. The annualized interest expense saving with this action is approximately $5 million. As a result of these actions, we have lowered annualized interest costs by approximately $70 million and smoothed out our future debt maturities. At the end of Q3, gross debt was approximately $4.2 billion, which is similar to Q2. Net debt to EBITDA improved from 3.5x in Q2 to 3.2x despite the deployment of cash for debt refinancing, share buybacks and dividends. All debt is unsecured, and the next maturity is in October of 2024. Finally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Before turning it back to John to discuss guidance, I would like to point out that there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items for the quarter. Special items for the third quarter were a net charge of approximately $93 million, mainly driven by the costs associated with the bond tender and refinancing completed in the quarter. Now let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken. The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement, notably for domestic travel. But also we note the sort of revised requirements or restrictions being lifted for certainly transatlantic travel starting this month. As expected, Howmet transitioned to revenue growth in the third quarter, and we expect year-over-year revenue growth will continue into the fourth quarter and to 2022, with a growth of approximately 12% in commercial aerospace and total revenue growth in the fourth quarter of approximately 6%. Growth is expected to continue in 2022. As expected, the Engine Products business began to grow notably in the third quarter. We expect modest sequential growth in Q4 for Engineered Structures despite continued delays with the 787. Fastening Systems is expected to show growth in the first half of 2022. In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following: In terms of guidance for Q4, I'll just call out the midpoints, as you can read the slide: Revenue of $1.315 billion; EBITDA, $300 million; EBITDA margin, 22.8%; earnings per share of $0.29. And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5 billion, plus or minus; EBITDA at $1.135 billion; EBITDA margin at 22.7%; earnings per share increased to $1 per share; and cash flow of $450 million. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we expect the following: Second half revenue to be up approximately 8% versus the first half driven by Commercial Aerospace, Commercial Transportation and ITT; Q4 sequential segment incremental operating margins, we expect to be in the order of 28%. Price increases will continue to be greater than 2020, the cost-reduction carryover of $100 million, as already commented, is exceeded. Pension and OPEB contributions of approximately $120 million and CapEx should be in the range of $180 million to $200 million compared to depreciation of approximately $270 million. Adjusted free cash flow compared to net income continues to be approximately 100%. I'd now like to preview some initial thoughts regarding 2022. An early approximate total revenue guide would be for an increase in annual revenues of 12% to 15%, led by recovery in Commercial Aerospace. In aggregate, our current view is that we see an acceleration during the course of the year, following a fairly flat first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of this year, except for increased revenues due to metal recovery. We'll refine this view and provide guidance at our earnings call in February 2022. Now let's move to Slide 14 for the summary. We delivered strong performance in the third quarter, which was in line with guidance. Growth was very healthy, year-on-year and sequentially. Incrementals were truly exceptional, and the company's margin is in the top decile in aerospace. Q3 started \u2013 or marked the start of the Commercial Aerospace recovery. Moreover, we delivered sequential improvements in both EBITDA and earnings per share. We'll continue to manage costs very carefully during this recovery phase. Liquidity is strong, and we have very healthy cash generation. The fourth quarter for our revenue outlook is $30 million higher than the third quarter, with margins of approximately 23%, which sets a platform for a healthy 2022. Adjusted earnings per share guidance was increased reflecting lower interest costs. Thank you and we'll now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. Good morning everyone.\nJohn Plant: Hi, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: I guess maybe starting off, if you could tell us where you expect to exit the year on \u2013 in terms of rate on the two major narrow-body programs, on 737 and on A320?\nJohn Plant: Okay. For A320, the 45 rate that Airbus has called out seems to be the right number. In terms of Boeing, I've seen so many numbers, but it's really hard for us to know exactly what's the correct one. So I'm going to go with the \u2013 probably Skyline at 14 aircraft per month, even though I've seen reports of \u2013 last July on the 16 number, which I didn't recognize then and the 19 number. So I don't know, Seth. I'm going to stick with my 14 with the expectation uplift in the first quarter next year.\nSeth Seifman: Okay, very good. I will obey the moderate stick to one and get back in queue. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hi, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: John, I think I'll follow up on Seth's question with regard to the Boeing 787. Where are you at the moment? And what have you baked into that 2022 revenue number with regard to what the 787 deliveries could do? Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Okay. So, first of all, original expectation, if you went back six months, it was the 787 would continue through this year at rate 5 per month, clearly with Boeing wanting to reduce that in the latter part of the year. As far as we can see Boeing went as 0 build condition for 90 days. And while they've adjusted the rate for the fourth quarter to 2, my thought has been it's been a 0 build and then it will be built at may be 4 a month to 2 average that 2. I don't really know, there's some speculation that maybe have built to 2, but it's pretty opaque to us. The most important factor is when does recertification occur because whether they build or don't build, it's going to come out of inventory. And we've seen inventories drop as well. And so suppliers into the 787 have been low, and we expect them to continue to be low in the fourth quarter. And then the question is what will the rate be in 2022. Our thought at this point is that maybe a 2022 annual build might be 48 aircrafts, I don't know. We've had to make some guesstimates, and that's provided for in that 12% to 15% volume increase that I talked about in revenues as an initial thought for 2022. And that takes account of what we think the balance of probability is across all of the end markets that we serve. And maybe I'll just continue a bit further to give a better color is when you consider the overall uncertainty in the industry regarding liquidation of inventories and in particular, the \u2013 in wide-body, and the fact that it will probably be flat for a further 12 months, the supply chain issues, which are certainly very newsworthy but are real. And indeed caused the truck production to be lower in the third quarter, that's also combined with the annual shutdowns in Europe. And then, of course, this \u2013 I'm going to call 0 build condition or is it only 2 on the 787. Then I think the sequential growth is outstanding. And all we're doing is not debating the fact of recovery, but what's the exact angle of the slope of recovery. And that's about it really, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: Yes. Just one clarification, John. Are you therefore, assuming that the destock on the 787 is now done and you're basically going to be following the Boeing build rate?\nJohn Plant: You tell me what the build rate is going to be, and I'll tell you the destock is where I find myself. No, I'm not trying to be clever about the response to question, but I find myself in a position where we've been grappling all year with moving end markets. You're grappling with all the different end markets moving at different ways, whether it's industrial or commercial transportation or commercial aero or defense and you've got all of these things moving around. And then you overlaid that with some very specific issues at Boeing, which we know about but none of us knows the recertification date. And in fact, Boeing have not provided that guidance either themselves.\nRobert Stallard: That's very helpful. Thanks John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is open.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if I could ask one detail and one question about 2022. In the detail one, I think, the Structures business was more anticipated to be a fourth quarter growth. And obviously, you saw some pretty great sequential growth here in Structures and out of commercial aero in particular. Could you maybe talk to why that happened a little bit sooner? And then secondarily, the defense expectation for 2022, can you just benchmark where that is in the 12% to 15% top-line? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Yes. So let me deal with Structures first. I think that the growth is a little bit higher in our third quarter. I think it would be similar for fourth. And then depending on 787, I could see some inventory correction in the first quarter, don't know enough yet to really know. In terms of defense, of course, we all know that there's a little bit of seasonality to that, where we do get a second half lift generally, which is a little bit of payback in the first quarter on a use it or lose it basis for defense budgets for spares in particular. Defense for next year, I'm guessing at this point that I'm not going to get too far to 2022. But I'll say, fairly flat, if anything, given what Raytheon said about the rate reduction in engine that they see on the \u2013 let's say, the original equipment build side. Then that will be fairly muted for us and then maybe there'll be some pickup on the spare side. So it's difficult to really know there. And then the question is to what degree we'll see level loading from Lockheed on the overall business. So best guess is at the moment, I'd say, we shouldn't be anticipating too much by way of defense growth next year, but we should be expecting good growth in terms of the narrow-body commercial aircraft production and then continuing growth in IGT. And also we do anticipate some of these supply chain constraints will be affecting the commercial truck business to move away certainly by the second half of the year.\nMyles Walton: Okay, thank you.\nJohn Plant: It's all contained in that 12 to 15 best guess. And I don't want to call it a best guess rather than a guide at this point.\nMyles Walton: Fair enough. Thanks John.\nJohn Plant: You're welcome. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hi, David.\nDavid Strauss: So John, obviously, the announcement here recently, you've decided to stay on a bit longer. Maybe a little bit of color on your thinking there and how might longer, how might \u2013 longer might that be?\nJohn Plant: Well, sorry, you're disappointed, David, if my being around is going to sort of plague your life a little bit longer. But \u2013 no, basically, the color I'd give you is the Board concluded that Tolga wasn't demonstrating the leadership they felt necessary to succeed myself as simple as that. I think it's great credit to the Board that the they stepped up and made a determination and exercise that judgment. I think it's one of the most important things that a Board does. I've said that I'm willing to continue to lead Howmet through the aerospace recovery. As I talked about, all with all the different changes in all these end markets that we've covered already, but certainly discuss again that I think that will hopefully be to the benefit of the company. And with no specific end dates provided, so yes, I'm going to be talking to you for some time.\nDavid Strauss: All right. Perfect, John. Happy to have you here around.\nJohn Plant: Thank you. Thank you David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. \nGautam Khanna: Hi. Thanks. Good morning guys.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: A couple of questions \u2013 maybe a two-part question. I was just curious you gave a ballpark range for sales for next year. Do you want to venture a guess on EBITDA margin, adjusted EPS, just to calibrate people in front of the formal guide that's going to happen next quarter. Just maybe if you can talk through some of the moving pieces.\nJohn Plant: I don't really want to get that far ahead of myself, Gautam. I feel positive about next year. I'm convinced that \u2013 I can convince myself anyway that when we do guide, it will be healthy for next year without, again, saying what exactly what I mean by healthy because I don't want to give specific numbers for increased EBITDA and earnings per share. But right now, despite all the, I'll call it, uncertainties, and of course as you know, many companies are still not providing much by way of guidance or sometimes not at all, is that we feel confident enough to give you what we've already given you. And I feel confident enough to say that 2022 will be a healthy year for us. And that will be a combination of both \u2013 for both EBITDA and for cash flow.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And one other thing, we've heard incrementally some concerns about in the auto industry related to magnesium and what have you. I just \u2013 I'm curious, is this \u2013 are you seeing incrementally more difficult pinch points emerge? I mean, just \u2013 I know since last quarter, it sounds like things have gotten tougher on the supply chain.\nJohn Plant: We're not a massive user. We've already covered through the next few months and so no big deal for Howmet now.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMatt Akers: Yes, hi, good morning. Actually kind of to follow up on the last one. I guess some of the concerns I've heard is the magnesium shortage potentially close to kind of less aluminum? And I guess, is that an area where you guys are seeing any risk of lack of material availability or just kind of how long are you covered with sort of the inventory that's available?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I really don't believe that we're going to be calling out lack of magnesium as an issue for us meeting any guide that we give you at all. We looked at it recently. I can't make the exact numbers, but both when you look at the amount we use and \u2013 and then the \u2013 say, the contract commitments we've got, we are setting it in an okay territory. So it's not top of mind in terms of my worries. In fact, on the aero side, I don't really have much by way of input materials concerns at all. And the only time I have a concern is the way it affects our customers on the Commercial Transportation side.\nMatt Akers: Got it. Okay. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nParetosh Misra: Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your metal pass-through. So EBITDA margins are somewhat affected in the Wheels business because of the aluminum pass-through. But in the commercial aerospace business, we don't see a similar impact, even though the nickel prices have been very high, and I'm sure the other metal prices also went up. Is it because just that metal price is a much smaller component in aerospace? Or is there some difference in how revenues recorded in the two businesses?\nJohn Plant: No. I mean, the principle is exactly the same, Paretosh. So I rarely call out things. So for example, you don't hear me talking about bad weather in Texas. You don't hear me talking about a particular press going down, why not talk too much about labor and this sort of stuff. It's just we work off, just normal course of business. And indeed, for the \u2013 for margins, if you look at nickel, cobalt, all of these metals into our aerospace segments have also had very significant increases. It has aluminum into some of the bulk end in our structures business, and some elements of titanium, although titanium has been pretty muted in aggregate. So I just look at all of those things and say, I tend not to call out much. It's just that I think it was on the last call where it was Seth from JPM that was asking specifically about Wheels and the margin, and it's very noticeable for that segment. And so I had to comment about it. And basically, this quarter is exactly the same. So there's a metal impact. So last quarter, it was like at the company level, so I don't really get into it at the segment level, it was 30 basis points. And this quarter, it's about 20 basis points of impact. And I just called it out for the \u2013 for that Wheels segment. And obviously, I wanted to I'd be saying to you things like, well, 22.8 really is 23. And if I added a bit more on for aerospace, it's higher than that. But it's like I don't think it's worthy. And so just don't comment, just move on. And our job is to manage these things. And one day when metal begins to abate and goes the other way, maybe I won't be calling it out when things are really good either. So that's about it. But if you want to, use 20 or 30 basis points for aluminum impact on the total holdco for Howmet year-to-date.\nParetosh Misra: That\u2019s great to hear. Thanks, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNoah Poponak: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nJohn Plant: Hi, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: John, I just wanted to see if I could make sure I understand where Fastening Systems is and it's kind of sequential process since it started to decline later, and I think it still has some inventory destocking. It sounds like you're expecting that to be kind of flat sequentially in the fourth quarter. And then I think previously, you talked about it growing year-over-year in the first quarter, which would require a decent sequential step up. Is that the right shape? And just maybe you could talk about where that segment is in terms of snapping back to the actual end demand?\nJohn Plant: Yes. If you listened to my words carefully, what I spoke to earlier, I actually used the word first half rather than the first quarter. I don't mean by slide, but at least I'll call it out and be open about it, is that previously, we'd said that the destocking \u2013 and in particular, the washout through the wide-body we would like to be complete by the end of the year, and we start to see improvements in the first quarter of next year. I want to be a little bit more cautious today. And essentially, I'm going to hang it all on 787 because, as I said earlier, I don't know exactly what the build, but then neither does anybody seem to know the exact build. And so my assumption is that it's less likely that it will be back at rate five in January. And so based upon that, I'm going to say it's more like a Q2 effect. But again, you tell me 787, I'll tell you what fasteners does because it's significant in the life of that business. My assumption is the rest is pretty flat, wide-body, by improving on narrowbody. So it's really difficult to be precise on any of this at this point in time. That's why all I know is that recovery is occurring, revenues are going up. And the only thing we were really debating here is just what exactly is the angle, that requires us to make a judgment around labor inputs. The rest just falls into place when we know the angle will be upswing. And so I just think that's \u2013 let's not get too wrapped around on a minute. The answer is good things are occurring a lot of moving parts, but generally, things are looking positive.\nNoah Poponak: It sounds like that's probably hit its low watermark given 87 is already down. And then to your point, it's a debate around timing and pace of recovery. But it probably doesn't need to go lower based on everything you just said.\nJohn Plant: It's difficult to go below zero. Yes.\nNoah Poponak: Right. Okay.\nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean anticipating that some are going to be built. But again, it's not that we know precisely exactly what build rate is. But \u2013 so at the moment, I'll just say, yes, I completely stand at an average of two for the quarter with that now the exact shape of production, whether it's just one or two, or is it zero and then three or four, I don't know. It doesn't really matter.\nNoah Poponak: Yes. I mostly just was in how much inventory stock has left.\nJohn Plant: Yes, the critical thing is when recertification \u2013 and at that point, the sky begin to turn blue. And the things just begin to feel a bit better. That's why I give you a broad calibration of where I think we're going to head towards next year.\nNoah Poponak: So is there no inventory destock left in that segment?\nJohn Plant: Well, there is while they've just got the bill down to the end of the \u2013 let's call it two level. Yes, the corrective inventory again.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nPhil Gibbs: Hey, John and team. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, how are you doing?\nPhil Gibbs: Doing well. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the aftermarket, particularly as it relates to the air foils side? And then also whether or not we should expect you to have some price increase opportunities next year?\nJohn Plant: Okay. So first of all, we did see an uptick in the aftermarket demand in coils in Q3. We're expecting a similar sort of improvement in the fourth quarter. So overall, it's good to see. But of course, as I've explained before, because the level comes off a really low level, then what I talk about as an increase as a percentage, it's notable, it's not exactly great in terms of dollar terms. Our thought is that, that continues on the talking, generally Commercial Aerospace and the air foils that will continue to show further growth in 2022. Within the overall Commercial Aerospace, clearly, business jet is doing quite well. And we say at that moment, that segment, is healthy. And we expect to see improvements in narrow-body as we move through the next few quarters to quite a healthy level in 2022. So I think then the dollars do become more significant for us because a similar percentage increase on a larger dollar base begins to become more material. Price increases, my statement is, I think that 2022 will be \u2013 will be positive, not as big as 2021. That's not in terms of a difference in percentage but more in terms of just the base for renewal. So that's the what I'd say that subject.\nPhil Gibbs: Thank you. And then as a follow-up, Ken, on the interest expense side, what should we be modeling relative to the $63 million level that we saw in the third quarter on a run rate basis looking ahead with all the moves you've made? Congrats. Thanks.\nKen Giacobbe: Yes. Just the way I would look at interest expense for next year, about $235 million, substantial action that we took on the debt profile this year, as we talked about on the call. So around $235 million for next year seems to be in good shape.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Josh.\nJosh Sullivan: Just curious on the conversations around the overall cost reductions potentially for the F-35 program. How are \u2013 or are those discussions reaching your desk yet, either on price, volumes, redesigns? Just curious how you're navigating that.\nJohn Plant: We had conversations on that more over a year ago, so no update since then. I mean the \u2013 I think being public about our \u2013 the LTA was renewed and pricing settled on that program. So nothing going on at the moment.\nJosh Sullivan: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.\nGeorge Shapiro: John, just a quick couple for you. Is the ship set value of a 787 between $6 million to $7 million, in that way we can obviously put in our own expectations for what the build rate is going to be next year?\nJohn Plant: I've never been willing to call out ship set values, George. There's guesstimates out there, but it's not a place that I want to go because cutting out ship set values are people trying to model things up and down when they don't know exactly what they all are, what the inventory takes, put and takes are. I think it just clouds the whole position. I think I'd much rather keep people focused on the big relevant numbers, which essentially is how I guide. And basically, clearly, always people are going to go up or down around that. I always think I'd give you a really ahead of me, I think we get below me, and that's how I think about it. But chipset value is an area I'm not being prepared to go.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. And then just a follow-up on your comments in the wheel business. You said you expect the supply chain issues to maybe resolve by next year. So can you tell us the ballpark is how much you would expect that wheel business to grow next year, if that's the case?\nJohn Plant: At the moment, I'm convincing myself that we're going to see supply chain issues through the first half of next year. I'm not subscribing to anything that magically changes on the first of January as just another day in our lives. But I do think that things begin to ease as we go through the back end of the year and whether it's the chip shortages begin to ease or whether it's resins or whether it's glass, all of these things. We have been working on that for six, nine months. And so bit by bit, they do get resolved capacities, broad supply chains ironed out, people come back to work and vaccination rates go up, and so labor availability, let's say, in Malaysia gets better, and so on. So the end market demand for commercial trucks is slightly really high. And so this quarter, what we saw was that some of our major customers have actually \u2013 I'm going to say, given up trying to build on three shifts and having it and build aren't off every few days. It's so, I call it our customers completely abandoned its third shift. I just accepted that for the next for \u2013 let's say, the balance of year, they're going to just operate on two shifts, reassess again in 2022. My expectation is that the \u2013 well, orders, dealerships have been very high. Those will be further improved when 2022 pricing is announced for your end markets for those trucks. So that's why I'm giving you my best estimate of what I think is going to happen. But there's no \u2013 I mean I don't have a special fact set that's private to me, just like just like looking at all of the factors which have been constraining supply and saying, what do I think and what's a balanced view? And are you going to go with \u2013 it begins to materially improve in the second half of next year because the demand is there. And what we don't build, we'll just get to the backlog where the backlog is already enormous, it will get added to 2023 backlog.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks for the follow-up. I guess, John, maybe to go about the margin question in a less direct way. You've talked in the past about\u2026\nJohn Plant: Sorry.\nSeth Seifman: That\u2019s okay, kind of a target sort of incremental for the business as a whole. Is there any reason to think that 2022 should be significantly above or below that sort of target incremental level you've discussed in the past?\nJohn Plant: No, I don't think so. My \u2013 clearly, we start going to be the sort of incrementals you saw in the third quarter, which yearly are fabulous. And the fact that we not only called it but did it is good. I think best guess for next year is that normalized the sort of level that we've talked about in the past. So let's use the word 35% plus or minus, and apply that to the volume side of the \u2013 whatever the volume is. And then you only adjust it fractionally for the whole issue of dollar of metal and a dollar of revenue in terms of recovery. So that's the one where you can get it wrong, I think. Assuming we do our staff operationally and keep it on the full incremental, even though that's going to be really good if we do that.\nSeth Seifman: All right. Okay. Very good. And either John or Ken, if you could maybe run through some of the \u2013 not operational but sort of big moving pieces we can think about for cash next year, so kind of pension, CapEx, tax working capital?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I'll have a go at the big strokes and then let Ken refine it. So my guess is that CapEx when we guide it, will be a bit higher than this year, but still a source of cash compared to depreciation. I think cash taxes will be higher. That's just a function of profit. So that's kind of the piece of the equation. Working capital, it depends on the slope of the recovery, but I guess it will be a slight drag. I think pension in aggregate will be lower at cash cost than 2021. Not as much as I've got \u2013 we've got to view what each of those numbers is. But at the moment, we're still refining it as we get a better view on the overall demand side. Ken, anything you'd like to supplement a bit more granular than that?\nKen Giacobbe: No. The only thing that I would add to that is just the work that we've done on the pension and OPEB side. So to your point, this year, cash contributions for pension and OPEB, about $120 million. We think it's going to be less next year, Seth. And you saw in the materials here, what we've been doing on pension and OPEB this year and that always benefits next year. But just a couple of items, if I start first with the balance sheet side of the equation, the liability has gone down around $180 million for pension and OPEB. That's significant. That's a combination of company actions that we've taken, as well as the asset returns that we had last year that flow into 2021 and then our contributions. But the little known fact as well is we have been spending a lot of time to reduce our gross liability for the pension. Last year, you saw us move around $320 million, either annuitizing or buying out certain programs. We intend to continue that this year, probably another $230 million of gross liability reduction in our gross liability. So that will help us out. And then we're also assuming everything right now, all these numbers that discount rates stay where they're at. If we looked at where discount rates finished last year, it was about 2.5%. And if you snap the line today, it would be about 2.8%, so a 30 basis point improvement, that's going to help. We've shared our sensitivity in the past, about a 25 basis point improvement, improves our position by about $90 million. So hopefully, that stays where it's at. But definitely doing a lot of work on the balance sheet side. You see how that flows into the P&L. Our pension and OPEB expenses this year, year-to-date, are about $12 million. It's a 50% reduction to where we were from last year. But not only P&L, but as we talked about, that will all help us out from the cash contribution side next year. So we anticipate, as we mentioned, to be lower than $120 million.\nJohn Plant: I think the gross liability reduction is probably something is fundamentally underappreciated. I mean, well over $0.5 billion of gross liabilities come off the balance sheet, which inherently reduces its volatility to both mortality and the interest rates going forward. So I treat that as a really outstanding outcome with essentially very little cash used to achieve that. And it's hard to draw a line between that exactly in value, but it does matter in terms of what that gross and then also the net liabilities are for the company.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Great. And then, since we're in the second round here, if I can overstate my welcome. It sounds like you're done hiring for this year. Is there \u2013 where are you set for in terms of people, in terms of how far sort of into next year before the next round of adding folks might come?\nJohn Plant: It's difficult to exactly know at this point. As you say, we've taken on, say, net 800 into the engine business, if you asked me before, I thought we would have been hiring in Q1. I'm not really sure if I call it today. I think we probably will be towards the end of Q1. And we want to take a cautious view on all of that. I mean there's a lot of stuff that's got to play out here, all the uncertain I talked to. I'll give you piece of information here. You didn't ask for it just because it is interesting. Just by way of information, our vaccination rate is over 70% across the company, between 70% and 75%. So that's been responding fairly well to the encouragement that we've been providing to our workforce to provide that protection for everybody. And we hope it continues to improve.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Okay. Thanks. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: All right. Thanks. I don't think you mentioned this, John, but 2022 price negotiations, where those stand today, how far are you through that? And what might pricing look like relative to 2021?\nJohn Plant: Exactly in line with what I previously said, is that 2022 will be a lower year than 2021 by a significant demand. It will still be healthy, but just the \u2013 I'll call it the natural flow of the LTA renewals. So I would say, all in order there from the previous, I'll say, dialogue. What was the part question, part from?\nDavid Strauss: I think that was it.\nJohn Plant: Okay.\nDavid Strauss: Yes, I think that was it. Yes, as a follow-up, I think you've gotten some relief to do higher levels of cash return between dividends and share repo. But what about the potential to even get more relief, just given where your balance sheet is and the cash generation looks like that will come through next year?\nJohn Plant: Well, first of all, we've certainly increased both the authorization and the scale of baskets that we have to do that. Critical to that in terms of utilization of those baskets is the view of the industry and the strength of view of that industry, and maybe some of the current uncertainties. It would be great to see those recede. I mean we've talked very clear about the solid recovery of the narrow-body business. And then recertification, I think it would be great to see, let's say, the 737 certified in China, the 787 recertified, I'd say, globally to build condition. And then I think those give us further confidence in deployment. If I roll myself forward let's say, a year, I'm not really sure whether \u2013 depending upon exactly what I'll guide to by way of cash flow for next year. I don't know whether there will be, much by way of restrictions a year from now, if any. But I'm not sure it actually would change the mindset over what we'll be prepared to do. So I think we'll again take a forward view of what our leverage will be, how much wings deployed, what's the overall confidence level in doing so. And basically to provide a balanced set of returns to our stakeholders or our shareholders, in particular.\nDavid Strauss: All right. Thanks very much John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, PT. Good morning, and welcome to the call. We'll move quickly through the slides and then get to your questions. First, let's summarize the headline numbers, starting on Slide number 4. Revenue was $1.28 billion, adjusted EBITDA $292 million and EBITDA margin was 22.8%. Each number was within the guidance range provided. More importantly, year-over-year revenues increased for the first time. The revenue was led by Commercial Aerospace, up 15% year-over-year, and contributing to a total increase of 13%. Of note, the Howmet segment leading the increase was Engine Products as previously forecasted. The company was also able to overcome the challenges once again of the Boeing 787 build rate declines and the supply chain issues limiting commercial truck production, the 787 affecting Fastening Systems and Engineering Structures in particular. Aluminum prices continued their upward surge with aluminum and regional premiums increasing by over $400 per metric ton sequentially and impacting the margin rate by 20 basis points. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.27, and cash generated in the quarter was $115 million. AR securitization was unchanged at $250 million. On a sequential basis, Third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA were up 7% and adjusted earnings per share up 23%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was strong at $115 million, which results in a Q3 year-to-date free cash flow at a record $275 million. Ken will provide further details of our debt actions in the quarter, which included a bond tender refi \u2013 finance to fundamentally lower interest costs and thereby improve future free cash flow yields. The combination of debt actions in the third quarter, combined with our first half results and actions, will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $70 million. In the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 770,000 shares of common stock for $25 million, which increases share repurchases year-to-date to approximately 7 million shares for $225 million. The net result of all these actions plus the reinstatement of the common stock dividend and the $115 million cash inflow resulted in a cash balance of $726 million, similar to that at the end of Q2. Lastly, we continue to focus on legacy liabilities and have reduced pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $180 million year-to-date. Moreover, year-to-date pension and OPEB expense have reduced by approximately 50% compared to last year. Please move to Slide number 5. Revenue for the quarter increased 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. As expected, Commercial Aerospace was up 15% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segment and narrow-body aircraft production. Commercial Transportation, namely Wheels, was up 38% year-over-year. Volume was impacted by supply chain constraints, limiting the commercial truck production. The volume reduction in the Wheels business was offset by metal recovery dollars. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 26% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven by new builds and spares. Defense Aerospace was down 11% year-over-year, driven by reductions in the Joint Strike Fighter builds, but was up 3% sequentially from the second quarter. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations. Structural cost reductions have exceeded our annual target of $100 million. Q3 structural cost reductions were $23 million year-over-year and $121 million year-to-date. Every segment achieved a strong year-on-year margin expansion as revenue increased for the first time in the year in aggregate. In the third quarter, Engine Products had an incremental operating margin of approximately 70%, and Forged Wheels had an incremental operating margin of approximately 45%. Fastening Systems and Engineering Structures both had a higher EBITDA and lower revenue. Fasteners had an operating margin expansion of some 630 basis points, while structures was up 210 basis points. As a result, Howmet's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded a full 800 basis points year-on-year, driven by volume, price and structural cost reductions. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $115 million and year-to-date $275 million. And as I said previously, AR securitization is unchanged from the start of the year. Lastly, we have lowered our annualized interest cost by $70 million through a combination of paying down debt and refinancing into lower cost debt. Please move to Slide number 6. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.8%, representing an 800 basis point improvement compared to the third quarter of 2020. The margin for the third quarter was consistent with the last few quarters, despite the cost of adding employees to meet the increasing production demand and the effect on margins of the higher aluminum prices. In the quarter, Engine Products added approximately 500 employees net, which now brings the total to 800 net additional employees hired for that segment during the second and third quarters. We continue to review the headcount required in our other segments to adjust for future demand requirements. Now let me turn it over to Ken for further details on revenue by market and the detailed financials. Thanks, Ken. The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement, notably for domestic travel. But also we note the sort of revised requirements or restrictions being lifted for certainly transatlantic travel starting this month. As expected, Howmet transitioned to revenue growth in the third quarter, and we expect year-over-year revenue growth will continue into the fourth quarter and to 2022, with a growth of approximately 12% in commercial aerospace and total revenue growth in the fourth quarter of approximately 6%. Growth is expected to continue in 2022. As expected, the Engine Products business began to grow notably in the third quarter. We expect modest sequential growth in Q4 for Engineered Structures despite continued delays with the 787. Fastening Systems is expected to show growth in the first half of 2022. In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following: In terms of guidance for Q4, I'll just call out the midpoints, as you can read the slide: Revenue of $1.315 billion; EBITDA, $300 million; EBITDA margin, 22.8%; earnings per share of $0.29. And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5 billion, plus or minus; EBITDA at $1.135 billion; EBITDA margin at 22.7%; earnings per share increased to $1 per share; and cash flow of $450 million. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide, we expect the following: Second half revenue to be up approximately 8% versus the first half driven by Commercial Aerospace, Commercial Transportation and ITT; Q4 sequential segment incremental operating margins, we expect to be in the order of 28%. Price increases will continue to be greater than 2020, the cost-reduction carryover of $100 million, as already commented, is exceeded. Pension and OPEB contributions of approximately $120 million and CapEx should be in the range of $180 million to $200 million compared to depreciation of approximately $270 million. Adjusted free cash flow compared to net income continues to be approximately 100%. I'd now like to preview some initial thoughts regarding 2022. An early approximate total revenue guide would be for an increase in annual revenues of 12% to 15%, led by recovery in Commercial Aerospace. In aggregate, our current view is that we see an acceleration during the course of the year, following a fairly flat first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of this year, except for increased revenues due to metal recovery. We'll refine this view and provide guidance at our earnings call in February 2022. Now let's move to Slide 14 for the summary. We delivered strong performance in the third quarter, which was in line with guidance. Growth was very healthy, year-on-year and sequentially. Incrementals were truly exceptional, and the company's margin is in the top decile in aerospace. Q3 started \u2013 or marked the start of the Commercial Aerospace recovery. Moreover, we delivered sequential improvements in both EBITDA and earnings per share. We'll continue to manage costs very carefully during this recovery phase. Liquidity is strong, and we have very healthy cash generation. The fourth quarter for our revenue outlook is $30 million higher than the third quarter, with margins of approximately 23%, which sets a platform for a healthy 2022. Adjusted earnings per share guidance was increased reflecting lower interest costs. Thank you and we'll now take your questions. Hi, Seth. Okay. For A320, the 45 rate that Airbus has called out seems to be the right number. In terms of Boeing, I've seen so many numbers, but it's really hard for us to know exactly what's the correct one. So I'm going to go with the \u2013 probably Skyline at 14 aircraft per month, even though I've seen reports of \u2013 last July on the 16 number, which I didn't recognize then and the 19 number. So I don't know, Seth. I'm going to stick with my 14 with the expectation uplift in the first quarter next year. Okay. Hi, Rob. Okay. So, first of all, original expectation, if you went back six months, it was the 787 would continue through this year at rate 5 per month, clearly with Boeing wanting to reduce that in the latter part of the year. As far as we can see Boeing went as 0 build condition for 90 days. And while they've adjusted the rate for the fourth quarter to 2, my thought has been it's been a 0 build and then it will be built at may be 4 a month to 2 average that 2. I don't really know, there's some speculation that maybe have built to 2, but it's pretty opaque to us. The most important factor is when does recertification occur because whether they build or don't build, it's going to come out of inventory. And we've seen inventories drop as well. And so suppliers into the 787 have been low, and we expect them to continue to be low in the fourth quarter. And then the question is what will the rate be in 2022. Our thought at this point is that maybe a 2022 annual build might be 48 aircrafts, I don't know. We've had to make some guesstimates, and that's provided for in that 12% to 15% volume increase that I talked about in revenues as an initial thought for 2022. And that takes account of what we think the balance of probability is across all of the end markets that we serve. And maybe I'll just continue a bit further to give a better color is when you consider the overall uncertainty in the industry regarding liquidation of inventories and in particular, the \u2013 in wide-body, and the fact that it will probably be flat for a further 12 months, the supply chain issues, which are certainly very newsworthy but are real. And indeed caused the truck production to be lower in the third quarter, that's also combined with the annual shutdowns in Europe. And then, of course, this \u2013 I'm going to call 0 build condition or is it only 2 on the 787. Then I think the sequential growth is outstanding. And all we're doing is not debating the fact of recovery, but what's the exact angle of the slope of recovery. And that's about it really, Rob. You tell me what the build rate is going to be, and I'll tell you the destock is where I find myself. No, I'm not trying to be clever about the response to question, but I find myself in a position where we've been grappling all year with moving end markets. You're grappling with all the different end markets moving at different ways, whether it's industrial or commercial transportation or commercial aero or defense and you've got all of these things moving around. And then you overlaid that with some very specific issues at Boeing, which we know about but none of us knows the recertification date. And in fact, Boeing have not provided that guidance either themselves. Thank you. Yes. So let me deal with Structures first. I think that the growth is a little bit higher in our third quarter. I think it would be similar for fourth. And then depending on 787, I could see some inventory correction in the first quarter, don't know enough yet to really know. In terms of defense, of course, we all know that there's a little bit of seasonality to that, where we do get a second half lift generally, which is a little bit of payback in the first quarter on a use it or lose it basis for defense budgets for spares in particular. Defense for next year, I'm guessing at this point that I'm not going to get too far to 2022. But I'll say, fairly flat, if anything, given what Raytheon said about the rate reduction in engine that they see on the \u2013 let's say, the original equipment build side. Then that will be fairly muted for us and then maybe there'll be some pickup on the spare side. So it's difficult to really know there. And then the question is to what degree we'll see level loading from Lockheed on the overall business. So best guess is at the moment, I'd say, we shouldn't be anticipating too much by way of defense growth next year, but we should be expecting good growth in terms of the narrow-body commercial aircraft production and then continuing growth in IGT. And also we do anticipate some of these supply chain constraints will be affecting the commercial truck business to move away certainly by the second half of the year. It's all contained in that 12 to 15 best guess. And I don't want to call it a best guess rather than a guide at this point. You're welcome. Hi, David. Well, sorry, you're disappointed, David, if my being around is going to sort of plague your life a little bit longer. But \u2013 no, basically, the color I'd give you is the Board concluded that Tolga wasn't demonstrating the leadership they felt necessary to succeed myself as simple as that. I think it's great credit to the Board that the they stepped up and made a determination and exercise that judgment. I think it's one of the most important things that a Board does. I've said that I'm willing to continue to lead Howmet through the aerospace recovery. As I talked about, all with all the different changes in all these end markets that we've covered already, but certainly discuss again that I think that will hopefully be to the benefit of the company. And with no specific end dates provided, so yes, I'm going to be talking to you for some time. Thank you. Thank you David. Thanks, Gautam. I don't really want to get that far ahead of myself, Gautam. I feel positive about next year. I'm convinced that \u2013 I can convince myself anyway that when we do guide, it will be healthy for next year without, again, saying what exactly what I mean by healthy because I don't want to give specific numbers for increased EBITDA and earnings per share. But right now, despite all the, I'll call it, uncertainties, and of course as you know, many companies are still not providing much by way of guidance or sometimes not at all, is that we feel confident enough to give you what we've already given you. And I feel confident enough to say that 2022 will be a healthy year for us. And that will be a combination of both \u2013 for both EBITDA and for cash flow. We're not a massive user. We've already covered through the next few months and so no big deal for Howmet now. Thank you. Yes. I really don't believe that we're going to be calling out lack of magnesium as an issue for us meeting any guide that we give you at all. We looked at it recently. I can't make the exact numbers, but both when you look at the amount we use and \u2013 and then the \u2013 say, the contract commitments we've got, we are setting it in an okay territory. So it's not top of mind in terms of my worries. In fact, on the aero side, I don't really have much by way of input materials concerns at all. And the only time I have a concern is the way it affects our customers on the Commercial Transportation side. Thank you. No. I mean, the principle is exactly the same, Paretosh. So I rarely call out things. So for example, you don't hear me talking about bad weather in Texas. You don't hear me talking about a particular press going down, why not talk too much about labor and this sort of stuff. It's just we work off, just normal course of business. And indeed, for the \u2013 for margins, if you look at nickel, cobalt, all of these metals into our aerospace segments have also had very significant increases. It has aluminum into some of the bulk end in our structures business, and some elements of titanium, although titanium has been pretty muted in aggregate. So I just look at all of those things and say, I tend not to call out much. It's just that I think it was on the last call where it was Seth from JPM that was asking specifically about Wheels and the margin, and it's very noticeable for that segment. And so I had to comment about it. And basically, this quarter is exactly the same. So there's a metal impact. So last quarter, it was like at the company level, so I don't really get into it at the segment level, it was 30 basis points. And this quarter, it's about 20 basis points of impact. And I just called it out for the \u2013 for that Wheels segment. And obviously, I wanted to I'd be saying to you things like, well, 22.8 really is 23. And if I added a bit more on for aerospace, it's higher than that. But it's like I don't think it's worthy. And so just don't comment, just move on. And our job is to manage these things. And one day when metal begins to abate and goes the other way, maybe I won't be calling it out when things are really good either. So that's about it. But if you want to, use 20 or 30 basis points for aluminum impact on the total holdco for Howmet year-to-date. Thank you. Hi, Noah. Yes. If you listened to my words carefully, what I spoke to earlier, I actually used the word first half rather than the first quarter. I don't mean by slide, but at least I'll call it out and be open about it, is that previously, we'd said that the destocking \u2013 and in particular, the washout through the wide-body we would like to be complete by the end of the year, and we start to see improvements in the first quarter of next year. I want to be a little bit more cautious today. And essentially, I'm going to hang it all on 787 because, as I said earlier, I don't know exactly what the build, but then neither does anybody seem to know the exact build. And so my assumption is that it's less likely that it will be back at rate five in January. And so based upon that, I'm going to say it's more like a Q2 effect. But again, you tell me 787, I'll tell you what fasteners does because it's significant in the life of that business. My assumption is the rest is pretty flat, wide-body, by improving on narrowbody. So it's really difficult to be precise on any of this at this point in time. That's why all I know is that recovery is occurring, revenues are going up. And the only thing we were really debating here is just what exactly is the angle, that requires us to make a judgment around labor inputs. The rest just falls into place when we know the angle will be upswing. And so I just think that's \u2013 let's not get too wrapped around on a minute. The answer is good things are occurring a lot of moving parts, but generally, things are looking positive. It's difficult to go below zero. Yes. Yes. I mean anticipating that some are going to be built. But again, it's not that we know precisely exactly what build rate is. But \u2013 so at the moment, I'll just say, yes, I completely stand at an average of two for the quarter with that now the exact shape of production, whether it's just one or two, or is it zero and then three or four, I don't know. It doesn't really matter. Yes, the critical thing is when recertification \u2013 and at that point, the sky begin to turn blue. And the things just begin to feel a bit better. That's why I give you a broad calibration of where I think we're going to head towards next year. Well, there is while they've just got the bill down to the end of the \u2013 let's call it two level. Yes, the corrective inventory again. Thank you. Hey, how are you doing? Okay. So first of all, we did see an uptick in the aftermarket demand in coils in Q3. We're expecting a similar sort of improvement in the fourth quarter. So overall, it's good to see. But of course, as I've explained before, because the level comes off a really low level, then what I talk about as an increase as a percentage, it's notable, it's not exactly great in terms of dollar terms. Our thought is that, that continues on the talking, generally Commercial Aerospace and the air foils that will continue to show further growth in 2022. Within the overall Commercial Aerospace, clearly, business jet is doing quite well. And we say at that moment, that segment, is healthy. And we expect to see improvements in narrow-body as we move through the next few quarters to quite a healthy level in 2022. So I think then the dollars do become more significant for us because a similar percentage increase on a larger dollar base begins to become more material. Price increases, my statement is, I think that 2022 will be \u2013 will be positive, not as big as 2021. That's not in terms of a difference in percentage but more in terms of just the base for renewal. So that's the what I'd say that subject. Hey, Josh. We had conversations on that more over a year ago, so no update since then. I mean the \u2013 I think being public about our \u2013 the LTA was renewed and pricing settled on that program. So nothing going on at the moment. Thank you. I've never been willing to call out ship set values, George. There's guesstimates out there, but it's not a place that I want to go because cutting out ship set values are people trying to model things up and down when they don't know exactly what they all are, what the inventory takes, put and takes are. I think it just clouds the whole position. I think I'd much rather keep people focused on the big relevant numbers, which essentially is how I guide. And basically, clearly, always people are going to go up or down around that. I always think I'd give you a really ahead of me, I think we get below me, and that's how I think about it. But chipset value is an area I'm not being prepared to go. At the moment, I'm convincing myself that we're going to see supply chain issues through the first half of next year. I'm not subscribing to anything that magically changes on the first of January as just another day in our lives. But I do think that things begin to ease as we go through the back end of the year and whether it's the chip shortages begin to ease or whether it's resins or whether it's glass, all of these things. We have been working on that for six, nine months. And so bit by bit, they do get resolved capacities, broad supply chains ironed out, people come back to work and vaccination rates go up, and so labor availability, let's say, in Malaysia gets better, and so on. So the end market demand for commercial trucks is slightly really high. And so this quarter, what we saw was that some of our major customers have actually \u2013 I'm going to say, given up trying to build on three shifts and having it and build aren't off every few days. It's so, I call it our customers completely abandoned its third shift. I just accepted that for the next for \u2013 let's say, the balance of year, they're going to just operate on two shifts, reassess again in 2022. My expectation is that the \u2013 well, orders, dealerships have been very high. Those will be further improved when 2022 pricing is announced for your end markets for those trucks. So that's why I'm giving you my best estimate of what I think is going to happen. But there's no \u2013 I mean I don't have a special fact set that's private to me, just like just like looking at all of the factors which have been constraining supply and saying, what do I think and what's a balanced view? And are you going to go with \u2013 it begins to materially improve in the second half of next year because the demand is there. And what we don't build, we'll just get to the backlog where the backlog is already enormous, it will get added to 2023 backlog. Sorry. No, I don't think so. My \u2013 clearly, we start going to be the sort of incrementals you saw in the third quarter, which yearly are fabulous. And the fact that we not only called it but did it is good. I think best guess for next year is that normalized the sort of level that we've talked about in the past. So let's use the word 35% plus or minus, and apply that to the volume side of the \u2013 whatever the volume is. And then you only adjust it fractionally for the whole issue of dollar of metal and a dollar of revenue in terms of recovery. So that's the one where you can get it wrong, I think. Assuming we do our staff operationally and keep it on the full incremental, even though that's going to be really good if we do that. Yes. I'll have a go at the big strokes and then let Ken refine it. So my guess is that CapEx when we guide it, will be a bit higher than this year, but still a source of cash compared to depreciation. I think cash taxes will be higher. That's just a function of profit. So that's kind of the piece of the equation. Working capital, it depends on the slope of the recovery, but I guess it will be a slight drag. I think pension in aggregate will be lower at cash cost than 2021. Not as much as I've got \u2013 we've got to view what each of those numbers is. But at the moment, we're still refining it as we get a better view on the overall demand side. Ken, anything you'd like to supplement a bit more granular than that? I think the gross liability reduction is probably something is fundamentally underappreciated. I mean, well over $0.5 billion of gross liabilities come off the balance sheet, which inherently reduces its volatility to both mortality and the interest rates going forward. So I treat that as a really outstanding outcome with essentially very little cash used to achieve that. And it's hard to draw a line between that exactly in value, but it does matter in terms of what that gross and then also the net liabilities are for the company. It's difficult to exactly know at this point. As you say, we've taken on, say, net 800 into the engine business, if you asked me before, I thought we would have been hiring in Q1. I'm not really sure if I call it today. I think we probably will be towards the end of Q1. And we want to take a cautious view on all of that. I mean there's a lot of stuff that's got to play out here, all the uncertain I talked to. I'll give you piece of information here. You didn't ask for it just because it is interesting. Just by way of information, our vaccination rate is over 70% across the company, between 70% and 75%. So that's been responding fairly well to the encouragement that we've been providing to our workforce to provide that protection for everybody. And we hope it continues to improve. Thank you. Exactly in line with what I previously said, is that 2022 will be a lower year than 2021 by a significant demand. It will still be healthy, but just the \u2013 I'll call it the natural flow of the LTA renewals. So I would say, all in order there from the previous, I'll say, dialogue. What was the part question, part from? Okay. Well, first of all, we've certainly increased both the authorization and the scale of baskets that we have to do that. Critical to that in terms of utilization of those baskets is the view of the industry and the strength of view of that industry, and maybe some of the current uncertainties. It would be great to see those recede. I mean we've talked very clear about the solid recovery of the narrow-body business. And then recertification, I think it would be great to see, let's say, the 737 certified in China, the 787 recertified, I'd say, globally to build condition. And then I think those give us further confidence in deployment. If I roll myself forward let's say, a year, I'm not really sure whether \u2013 depending upon exactly what I'll guide to by way of cash flow for next year. I don't know whether there will be, much by way of restrictions a year from now, if any. But I'm not sure it actually would change the mindset over what we'll be prepared to do. So I think we'll again take a forward view of what our leverage will be, how much wings deployed, what's the overall confidence level in doing so. And basically to provide a balanced set of returns to our stakeholders or our shareholders, in particular. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Please move to markets on Slide 7. Third quarter total revenue was up 13% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Commercial Aerospace increased to 42% of total revenue, which is an improvement sequentially, but far short of pre-COVID levels of 60%. The third quarter marked the start of the Commercial Aerospace recovery, with commercial aerospace revenue up 15% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Defense Aerospace was down 11% year-over-year, driven by the Joint Strike Fighter and up 3% sequentially. Commercial Transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segment was up 38% year-over-year, however, flat sequentially after we adjust for the increase in aluminum prices. Finally, the Industrial and Other Markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was up 14% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. IGT, which makes up approximately 45% of this market continues to be strong and was up a healthy 26% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Let's move to Slide 8 for the segment results. As expected, Engine Products year-over-year revenue was 24% higher in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 50% higher, driven by the narrow-body recovery. IGT was 26% higher as demand for cleaner energy continues. Defense Aerospace was down 8% year-over-year, but up 7% sequentially. Incremental margins for Engine Products were approximately 70% for the quarter despite hiring back approximately 500 workers to prepare for future growth. Operating margin improved 1,200 basis points year-over-year. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's incremental margins for the quarter. Please move to Slide 9. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 6% lower in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 25% lower as we saw continued production declines for the Boeing 787 and customer inventory corrections. The commercial transportation and industrial markets within the Fastening Systems segments were approximately 55% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. Year-over-year Fastening Systems was able to generate $14 million more in operating profit, while revenue declined $17 million. As a result, operating margin improved 630 basis points. Please move to Slide 10. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 3% lower in the third quarter. Commercial Aerospace was 13% higher as the narrow-body recovery was partially offset by production declines for the Boeing 787. Defense Aerospace was down 21% year-over-year but was flat sequentially. Year-over-year, Engineered Structures was able to generate $4 million more in operating profit on $7 million of lower revenue. As a result, operating margin improved 210 basis points. Finally, please move to Slide 11. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 34% higher in the third quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue and operating profit were essentially flat. The segment was able to overcome a 4% decrease in volume due to customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production, and a 13% increase in aluminum prices to maintain a healthy operating margin of approximately 27%. Year-over-year incremental margins for Forged Wheels were approximately 45% for the quarter. Improved margins were driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries. Now let's move to Slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. I would highlight three actions. First, in the first half of the year, we paid down approximately $835 million of debt by completing the early redemption of our 2021 and 2022 bonds with cash on hand. The annualized interest expense savings with this action is approximately $47 million. Second, in the third quarter we tendered $600 million of our 6.875% notes due in 2025 and issued $700 million of 3% notes due in 2029. The annualized interest expense savings with this action is approximately $20 million. Third, with cash on hand, we repurchased $100 million of our 2021 notes through an open market repurchase in Q3 and in October, which neutralized the gross debt impact of the tender and refinancing. The annualized interest expense saving with this action is approximately $5 million. As a result of these actions, we have lowered annualized interest costs by approximately $70 million and smoothed out our future debt maturities. At the end of Q3, gross debt was approximately $4.2 billion, which is similar to Q2. Net debt to EBITDA improved from 3.5x in Q2 to 3.2x despite the deployment of cash for debt refinancing, share buybacks and dividends. All debt is unsecured, and the next maturity is in October of 2024. Finally, our $1 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Before turning it back to John to discuss guidance, I would like to point out that there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items for the quarter. Special items for the third quarter were a net charge of approximately $93 million, mainly driven by the costs associated with the bond tender and refinancing completed in the quarter. Now let me turn it back over to John. Yes. Just the way I would look at interest expense for next year, about $235 million, substantial action that we took on the debt profile this year, as we talked about on the call. So around $235 million for next year seems to be in good shape. No. The only thing that I would add to that is just the work that we've done on the pension and OPEB side. So to your point, this year, cash contributions for pension and OPEB, about $120 million. We think it's going to be less next year, Seth. And you saw in the materials here, what we've been doing on pension and OPEB this year and that always benefits next year. But just a couple of items, if I start first with the balance sheet side of the equation, the liability has gone down around $180 million for pension and OPEB. That's significant. That's a combination of company actions that we've taken, as well as the asset returns that we had last year that flow into 2021 and then our contributions. But the little known fact as well is we have been spending a lot of time to reduce our gross liability for the pension. Last year, you saw us move around $320 million, either annuitizing or buying out certain programs. We intend to continue that this year, probably another $230 million of gross liability reduction in our gross liability. So that will help us out. And then we're also assuming everything right now, all these numbers that discount rates stay where they're at. If we looked at where discount rates finished last year, it was about 2.5%. And if you snap the line today, it would be about 2.8%, so a 30 basis point improvement, that's going to help. We've shared our sensitivity in the past, about a 25 basis point improvement, improves our position by about $90 million. So hopefully, that stays where it's at. But definitely doing a lot of work on the balance sheet side. You see how that flows into the P&L. Our pension and OPEB expenses this year, year-to-date, are about $12 million. It's a 50% reduction to where we were from last year. But not only P&L, but as we talked about, that will all help us out from the cash contribution side next year. So we anticipate, as we mentioned, to be lower than $120 million."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace Second Quarter 2021 Results. My name is Catherine, and I'll be your operator for today. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace Secondt Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Tolga Oal, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John, Tolga and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we've included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, PT. Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter call. I'll start with an overview of Howmet's second quarter performance. Then pass to Tolga, who will talk more to our market. And then, Ken will provide further financial detail. I also plan to talk to ESG and we'll do so in about once a year going forward. And then provide guidance and talk to guidance for the third quarter and the full year 2021. So let's move to slide number four. Let me start with some commentary on the second quarter, which was the first comparable quarter for Howmet post separation with no pro forma numbers. Revenue was $1.2 billion and in line with expectations, while EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share exceeded our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $272 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was on par with Q1 2021 and Q4 2020 at 22.8%, despite the addition of costs to prepare for the second half ramp up in commercial aerospace production. Earnings per share excluding special items was $0.22 and ahead of our expectations. Historically, the first half has been a cash outflow for the company. The increased operating performance focus of Howmet has led to improve margins, enhanced working capital control and capital discipline, which generated $160 million of cash in the first half of the year. We expect continued cash generation in the third and fourth quarters. Year to-date, we have reduced debt by approximately $835 million by completing the early redemption of 2021 notes in Q1 and the 2022 notes in Q2 with cash on hand. These transactions reduced 2021 interest expense by approximately $28 million, and approximately $47 million on an annual run rate basis. This helps with increased 2022 free cash flow. In the second quarter, we continue to return money to shareholders with the completion of a 200 million share buyback program. The weighted average acquisition price was $34.02 per share, approximately 5.9 million shares. The second quarter and cash balance was $716 million.  Lastly, we continue to focus on reducing legacy liabilities. Year to-date, we have reduced our pension and OPEB liabilities for approximately $160 million. Moreover, full year pension and OpEx expense is expected to improve approximately 50% compare to last year. Now let's move to markets and performance on slide five. Q2 revenue was 5% less year-over-year and in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis commercial aerospace was 31% less driven by lower aircraft builds, spares and the lingering effects of customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue compared to pre-COVID levels of 60%. The commercial aerospace decline is partially offset by our continued strength in other markets. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 13% year-over-year driven by new builds and spares. The commercial transportation business was up 89% year-over-year as it rebounds from customer shutdowns in Q2 of 2020. Truck demand remains strong as our customers manage through their own supply chain issues with several components, which are in short supply. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction, margin expansion and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations, as they are tied to long-term agreements. Structural cost reductions are also in line with expectations with the $37 million year-over-year benefit, which reflects the decisive actions we started in the second quarter of 2020 at the onset of the pandemic and continued through last year. Year-to-date structural cost reductions are $98 million, which have essentially achieved already a target of approximately $100 million. The aerospace decremental operating margins continue to be very good at only 19%.,while the wheel segment had an incremental margin of 47%. EBITDA margin expanded by 310 basis points year-on-year driven by price, variable cost flexing and fixed cost reductions. The team delivered strong margin expansion despite a reduction in revenue. Capital expenditure was $36 million for the quarter and continues to be less than depreciation and amortization resulting in a net source of cash. Lastly, free cash flow was $164 million for the quarter, resulting in a record first half. Now let's move to slide six. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter is 22.8% and consistent with the last couple of quarters on approximately $43 million of less revenue. The margin results overcame both the effects of the low revenue and the cost of many additional employees to meet the increasing production demand coming in the third quarter. Q2 revenue at $1.2 billion was in line with expectations. You can see the benefit of our actions since the start of the pandemic in Q2 with a solid 310 basis points -- EBITDA margin expansion, while revenue is approximately $58 million less in the same period. Now let me hand it over to Tolga to give an overview of the markets.\nTolga Oal: Thank you, John. Please move to slide seven, and some more details about our year-over-year revenue performance. Second quarter revenue was 5% less driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Commercial aerospace was 31% less year-over-year in line without projections as expected inventory corrections continued. Defense aerospace was essentially flat in the second quarter as we are on a diverse set of programs with the joint strike fighter being approximately 40% of the total defense business. Commercial transportation which impacts both the forged wheels and the Fastening Systems segments was up 89% year-over-year as second quarter of last year was significantly impacted by customer shutdowns. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was up 13%. IGT which makes up approximately 45% of this market continues to be strong and was up a healthy 13% year-over-year. I will now turn it over to Ken to give a more detailed view of the financials.\nKenneth Giacobbe: Thank you, Tolga. Let's move to slide eight for the segment results. As expected engine products, year-over-year revenue was 7% less than the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 17% less driven by customer inventory corrections and reduced demand for spares. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a year-over-year increase of 13% in IGT. The IGT business continues to be strong as demand for cleaner energy continues. Decremental margins for engines were 12% for the quarter as we hired back approximately 300 workers to prepare for the anticipated growth in the second half of this year. In the appendix of the presentation we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's incremental or decremental margins for the quarter. Now let's move to Fastening Systems on slide nine. Also with expected Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 20% less in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 42% less. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in commercial aerospace. The industrial and commercial transportation markets within the Fastening Systems segment were both up approximately 45% year-over-year. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems were 31% for the second quarter as segment operating profit margin was approximately 19%. Please move to slide 10 to review engineered structures. Engineered structures year-over-year revenue was 30% less in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 45% less driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the Boeing 787. Defense aerospace was relatively flat year-over-year. Decremental margins for engineered structures were 12% for the quarter. Lastly, please move to slide 11 for forged wheels. Forged wheels revenue doubled year-over-year as last year's results were impacted by customer shutdowns. On a sequential basis volumes were down approximately 7% due to customer supply chain issues. Reported revenue was essentially flat sequentially driven by a 20% increase in aluminum prices. Although, higher middle costs are passed through to customers to avoid a profit impact, you will see a reduction in EBITDA percent resulting from the pass through. Segment operating profit margin was approximately 27% and year-over-year incremental margin was 47%. Improved margin was driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries. Please move to slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. In the first half of the year we completed the early redemption of our 2021 and 2022 bonds with cash on hand. Gross debt stands at approximately $4.2 billion. All debt is unsecured and the next maturity is in October of 2024. Finally our $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Before turning it back to John to discuss ESG and 2021 guidance, I would like to point out that there's a slide in the appendix that it covers special items in the quarter. Special items for the second quarter were a net charge of approximately $22 million mainly driven by the costs associated with the early redemption of the 2022 bonds completed in early May. Now, let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you, Ken. And let's move to slide 13. Moving to ESG, I'd encourage you to read our sustainability report found at howmet.com in the investor section. For Howmet aerospace, environmental, social and governance is about generating meaningful change for a more sustainable future, improving our diversity and inclusion inside our company and in the communities in which we operate. Regarding employee safety, we are maintaining attention on safety through uncertain operational conditions presented by COVID-19. Total recordable incidents continue to be significantly better than the aerospace and defense industry average. For 2020, we had a 20% year-over-year improvement in rate to 0.71. Additionally 84% of our locations worldwide were without a lost workday incident. This is a tremendous testament to the dedication and focus of our workforce. We continue to underscore the importance and power of diversity, equity and inclusion in our company. We value the rich diversity of expertise, backgrounds and viewpoints that fuel our innovation and we are committed to improving diversity of employees at all levels. Recently, we were recognized by the 50-50 women on boards organization for our commitment to broad diversity. In addition to gender diversity, we also partner with key external organizations including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Hispanic Corporate Council and Diversity Best Practices to review and continuously improve our initiatives. With respect to sustainability. Nowhere is this more evident than in the products that we provide to our customers. Our proprietary technologies help reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions contributing to the aerospace industry's goal of a smaller carbon footprint. Five specific areas are at the bottom left of the slide. The Commercial Aerospace, Next Generation, Jet Engine Technology reduces fuel consumption by approximately 15%. Moreover, Howmet's increased content on composite aircraft of two times contributes to light weighting solutions and reduces fuel use as composite aircraft are approximately 20% more fuel efficient than comparable metallic aircraft. For forged wheels, Howmet's aluminum wheels are five times stronger than steel, while being 47% lighter. Customers can realize up to 1,400 pounds of weight savings from retrofitting an 18-wheeler class 8 truck of steel to aluminum wheels. For IGT, Howmet's products continue to enable higher operating temperatures in the turbine and also pressures, which increase load efficiency towards approximately 64% and reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by approximately 40%. Lastly, for renewables, Howmet's Fastening Systems used in solar panels improved strength and clamping by five to ten times and reduce insulation time by up to 80%. Moving to STEM education and inclusiveness. Howmet is dedicated to increasing STEM opportunities and education in the local community through the Howmet Aerospace Foundation with grants to institutions and schools. Also we've renewed our commitment to support our six employee resource groups with strategic focus on community, culture and careers. Let me now move to slide 14 for our third quarter and annual guidance. The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement notably for domestic travel. This includes online searches for air tickets, increases in flight schedules across most of the world and beginnings of some international travel. Orders for aircraft by airlines and assembly partners are increasing rapidly. The expectation that Howmet will transition into revenue growth in the third quarter continues with growth of approximately 15% in commercial aerospace and total revenue growth of approximately 9%. We look forward to managing and leading this exciting growth phase for Howmet after the devastation of the pandemic on the industry. Growth is expected to continue into Q4 and into 2021 -- sorry, 2022 and beyond. The sequence for our businesses is that we expect increases in the engine business notably starting in the third quarter, followed by structures in the fourth quarter and fasteners starting in the first quarter of 2022. In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following. For the third quarter, revenue of $1.3 billion, plus or minus $20 million, EBITDA of $295 million, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA margin of 22.7%, plus or minus 40 basis points and earnings for share of $0.25, plus a minus $0.02. And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5.1 billion, plus or minus 50%. EBITDA baseline to increase to $1.17 billion, plus or minus -- plus 15%, minus 25%. EBITDA margin to increase to 22.9%, plus 10 basis points and minus -- to minus 20 basis points. Earnings per share increase to $0.99, plus or minus $0.03, cash flow baseline increased to $450 million, plus or minus $35 million. Moving to the right hand side of the slide, we expect the following. Second half revenue to be up approximately 12% versus the first half driven by commercial aerospace, defense and IGT. Second half year-over-year incremental margins of over 50% compared to the prior year. Price increases will continue to be greater than 2020. The cost reduction carryover of a $100 million is already achieved with some potential modest upside. Pensions and OPEB contributions of approximately $120 million. We are reducing cash pension contributions by approximately $40 million based upon the American rescue plan. CapEx should be in the range of $200 million to $220 million compared to depreciation of approximately $270 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion continues to be in excess of net income at approximately 100%. Lastly, as in last month, we have reinstated the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per common stock starting in the third quarter. Now let's move to slide 15 for a summary. The second quarter was solid and it's described as a quarter to get through, while we wait for the volume lift in the third quarter. It was better than expectations with improved margins and excellent cash flow. The net recruitment of production operators in the second quarter was approximately 300 people, principally in our engine business. And we -- of course, will continue to manage costs very carefully during this recovery phase. In the second half we plan to recruit another net 500 people. Liquidity is strong and we have healthy cash generation. The third quarter outlook for revenue to be approximately $100 million higher in the second quarter with margins somewhere between 22.3% and 23.1%. For the second half, we expect extra costs. However, year-over-year incremental margins are expected to be over 50%. Consolidated EBITDA margins for the second half are expected to be 22.6% to 23.2% setting a platform for a healthy 2022, and overcoming the drag of the increased labor costs from the recruitment that I talked about. And of course the net effect of the metal recoveries. Thank you very much. And now we'll take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And now we will begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research.\nCarter Copeland: Hey, good morning gentlemen.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Cater.\nCarter Copeland: John, I wondered if you could kind of give us some color on the composition of the hedge you're adding back to the system. Are some of these former employees or are new. I know last quarter you talked a lot about the training expectations and wanting to get the productivity to the right level from the start. Just any color you can give us on how that adding back resources is going?\nJohn Plant: Yes. So we talked to about 300 people in Q2. And as you recall, I said, we'd add these people essentially no add button. You can see that our sales did not increase, and so it was exactly in line with expectations from the revenue side. We mentioned that we would possibly recruit 400 to 500 people in the second quarter. So we're a little bit below that. And that was essentially us keeping tight control of the cost going forward. The majority of the employees that we've recruited so far, and in fact the majority in our third quarter will be for the engine business. So far about three-quarters of the increase has come from people that we've recalled from a previous employment, and four-quarter of new employees. I expect that blend to change as we move through the next, let's say, period of time. And it's maybe to 50/50 and then the majority will be fresh employees I think as we exit the year. To give you a roadmap for the second half, let's say, first, Q3 will be principally engine. And then we'll be looking to add selectively in our structures business in the fourth quarter. And also for our faster businesses as we get looking into 2022 to be ready for that. So, about 500 people I think we're planning for the second half. So getting towards a 1000 for the year.\nCarter Copeland: Great. Thank you for the color. I'll stick to one.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Thank you. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Good morning, David.\nDavid Strauss: John, could you comment on or give your perspective on the airbus rate, narrow-body rate increases that they've been now with proposing out. And '23, '24, '25, what that could mean for you all from a revenue perspective? Does that allow you to kind of grow above the prior peak of $7 billion in revenue? And I guess how well are you capacitized to handle those kind of rates? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Okay. So let's talk narrow-body in total, because I think that's the most important, really metric for the next 18 months or so. So 2019, the combination of the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 Max was peaked at about 100 maybe fractionally over 100, maybe 105 in a couple of months and so. That would be, let's say, the prior aggregation of the two. Clearly, that mix is changing currently with the view that the Airbus is moving to -- is it 47 in January and then 55 by the middle of the year. While say, Boeing is still planning to raise production to I think just over 30. Let's go to 31 in January of 2022 and has been silent there afterwards at this point. So the combo total is in the mid 80s. And so you can see for 2022, still a very significant increase on the last year or last and indeed this year. So the percentage increase is enormous. It still isn't back to 2019 levels. And then if it's right that by the middle of or maybe the end of 2023 we're up in the mid 60s for airbus and we don't yet know for Boeing. But you can envisage that we will be right back at that 100 maybe breaking through the 105 barrier on a combined basis at that point in time. And with the potential, a further rate increases should airbus confirm their aspirations to go to 70 and above. So, that's the roadmap there. But for 18 months while we're getting to 100, it basically just puts us back in the same territory that we've already been in, and so we have -- certainly adding capacity for all of that. If you then, obviously have to blend in what's happening with wide-body and it's probably a little bit too early to say. But I expect probably by the second half of 2023 that wide-body will be picking up. In fact I also think that we'll see some benefits as we go into 2022. So for example, should 787 return from to five a month from its current production level, then that would also be an increase for us. My expectation is that we'll see like all three volume lift, we'll see the lift from of us being the low current build rate just because parts have been take of inventory. Then we'll also will go to a rate match situation where we sell, ship set of aircraft parts equivalent to an aircraft that will volume lift 1. We then going to see volume lift 2, which is the increase that we'll have to make to continue to pace with the rates that are being talked about. So let's say, Boeing going from 14 to 31 and from Airbus going from 40 to 55. So those are both very healthy increases. And then, of course, for this to be done, then inventory has to be bought back in the system. So I expect that during 2022 and into 2023 we're going to see benefits above rate, because inventory just has to be put back into the system to guarantee these levels of aircraft production. So when you put it all back together and I'll just say, pick a moment in time, let's say, let's pick under 23 into 24 then my expectation is that all other things being equal will be at a rate of revenue above 2019. And basically with the content increases that we have or are built in plus any net benefits on price is that on a like-for-like basis, we'd probably be closer to the $7.5 billion to $8 billion on the equivalent production of aircraft. I mean, that's very approximately. But obviously it's a lot of changing parts amongst all of that as we go through the next two or three years. But the way I look at it, David, is that we've got three years, a pretty significant growth to look forward to. And then maybe by the middle of the decade reverting to the more normal 4% or 5% depending upon what end market demand is at that time.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks for all the color, John. It was great.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Co.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Dan on for Gautam. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Good morning, Dan.\nUnidentified Analyst: So, hey, how you doing? So, my question is actually pretty similar. But I wanted to ask from a different perspective. What will be your greatest challenges in meeting the narrow-body production ramps in I guess in the short term to medium term? And also would you see any benefit on, I guess, at least on the labor side or anywhere else from depressed wide-body rate that would maybe allow for greater utilization on the narrow-body side or is that not really relevant here?\nJohn Plant: Well, if we have to break it down between let's say, machine tool capacity by that I mean essentially like take casting machines or core scrap [ph] machines. And then, I'll take the tooling that goes with the specific part number. In terms of machine tools, we have no problems whatsoever in terms of capacity, because we've already made, let's say, a hundred plus narrow-bodies in 2019 and as you know, we certainly in our engine business, we put a $0.25 billion [ph] of investment in place to take that capacity up. And so -- and then of course, the capacity just came in then the pandemic hit us and so we've carried that capacity for the last, let's say, 18 months now, and therefore it's still totally available to us. So, we in terms of machine tool capacity we could take back to a 400 plus narrow-body rate, all the wide-body rate and the significant increase above that. And so, in terms of a plant and equipment we have essentially no restrictions whatsoever. And that's also gives me confidence that we can still operate for a year or so with capital expenditures being below depreciation, because the capacity is essentially already there. To get further into your question though is that until we know the exact mix of requirements, it's difficult to say on the tooling side. So again, for the next 18 months I see no problems at all in terms of meeting customer demand. And if you took narrow-bodies at let's say 105 level combined then no problems. It's only when we -- if we were to add, let's say, if Airbus were getting to 75 and if Boeing were back above 50, and so we're talking 125 aircraft per month then clearly at that point we'd be at a balance of certainly in terms of tooling or die capacity for some of the Airbus parts. And therefore additional tooling would have to be put down to cope with those -- that volume scenario should it finally be confirmed. So, well, I think about for next couple of years, we have no capacity limitations apart from the ability to onboard labor and train it effectively to do all of that side of the business. But softer side -- but in terms of hard plant and machinery we're fully capacitized and then we have to be thinking about increasing tool capacity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Beth [Indiscernible] with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Thanks very much and good morning guys.\nJohn Plant: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Wanted to ask a quick question about forged wheels. And just to make sure, understand the materials dynamic there, and how to model things going forward. I guess, can you talk about what happened to kind of the real demand sequentially from Q1 to Q2? And how to think about the trajectory of that? And then when it might pick up again?\nJohn Plant: Yes. So let me break it down between fundamental and market demand and then the demand that we saw. So the order in take for Class 8 truck trail has been at an extraordinary level for some time. And so, the backlog is truly extraordinary. And so, in one sense, the demand is there such our confidence over balance of year in fact the whole of 2022 for commercial transportation business is really high. So it's like a great outlook. In fact, I don't think we've ever seen it so strong. The issue that we had in the second quarter was I recall, despite that extraordinary end market demand we actually were in a position where we did not supply, not because essentially we were unable to supply, but we took a large amount of down days and it was different by end customer, because they were unable to complete assembly of trucks due to missing parts whether it was missing tires or windshields, other structural components or of course the one that everybody's very familiar with is the issue of electronics and semiconductors. And so, we have a lot of partially built trucks that are there, which are in obtained fields around the both the U.S. and in Europe. And even some of those are delivered dealers with parts missing until they can go back and retrofit them. So what I'm trying to do is picture the market for us was one where great end market, but just short-term supply constraints by customers couldn't get parts. They couldn't build. And we were taking days down here or there just because they think you don't ship because we can't build anymore. Got no place to stick them because we haven't got part. That resulted in a 7% volume reduction for us of delivered end product in Q2 compared to Q1. So let's call it $18 million worth of revenue volume, which happened to be made up then by basically repricing for metal. So the metal escalators that we have covered up for the volume shortfall. So essentially, it says, if you take our on a percentage basis if you take our EBITDA margin of Q1 and divided by the -- you take those revenues and you flex it by 18. Then you can see that that totally counts for about a few hundred basis points of margin impact. So the way you should think about the second quarter for wheels was we had a 7% volume drop and also a metals impact. And basically if you adjust for those two actually the margin was very respectable. And if you want to extrapolate it a little bit further, so we didn't call it out because we tend not to call such things out. In fact, if you were to adjust for that, let's call it, $18 million, $20 million at the Howmet level of basically metal pass through just on wheels alone then in fact our EBITDA margins would have been just over 23%. So significant improvement on Q1 on a like-for-like basis, all be masked by just the fact that the denominator goes up and numerator goes up because of the way we recover metal. So that walks you through both wheels and for Howmet.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, as we look to the second half, you see the volumes continuing to go down, because these bottlenecks continue? Or can you kind of -- can the volumes kind of stabilize at this level and just wait for the your customers to be able to handle the increase in demand that might show up in 2022?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I think we're going to have a similar Q3 to Q2 on the truck side, that would be my thought there. Just because the part shortages haven't really eased yet. And I do think that we're going to see as best I can guess that some of those will begin to ease towards the back end of the year. So I'm hoping for a fairly robust fourth quarter on wheels. Although I can just hope it's not a strategy. But the answer is, my thought is that it should be getting better and then like a really good 2022, because I say, the order books there and the backlog's just increasing just because the demand is there, but it's the inability for truck manufacturers to satisfy the market at the moment.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks very much, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi. Good morning. John, I wanted to ask you about spares or probe and despairs a little bit both commercial airfoils and defense airfoils. And just get a sense for how those have trended March to June quarters especially since another supplier surprised us with a downtick, the sequential downtick on supply chain issues? And I don't know if that's relevant here. But I understand the business isn't very big. But what are you seeing trend wise both commercial and defense spares as we go through 2021?\nTolga Oal: So, as you know, we have to guestimate that isn't the biggest number for us. But we actually saw a small uptick in the aftermarket demand for airfoils in the second quarter in the context of Howmet being nothing material at all. We are planning and scheduling that we will have an increased second half in airfoil aftermarket going through our customers of [Indiscernible] and Pratt & Whitney. So while the percentage, I think is it's certain - I can't make that one. But certainly well into the double digits in percentage increase. Again, it's not huge numbers, but we it's pleasing to see that demand and then all goes well again as we exit this year into next year. So when I bifurcated the strength that we saw in defense and IGT spares has continued all the way through with no real let up on that side at all. And so, it's a fairly strong growth in 2020 continued 2021. But the commercial aerospace business has been very, very muted certainly in Q1, small increase in Q2 and we're seeing higher percentage increases. But it don't become material in dollar terms until 2022.\nRobert Spingarn: And other than the bottlenecks you mentioned a few minutes ago. Are there any supply chain areas that we should just be focused on anywhere in the business that could be disruptive?\nTolga Oal: No. There's nothing that we see that's problematic for Howmet at all. It was scanned our supply base last year, the one area of concern we had basically disappeared by the late fall and currently we don't see any supply constraint for metal input to any of our plants. And we are securing supply as best as we know for what we believe in market demand as we go the turn of the year, because it's important to start thinking more about lead times. We're encouraging our customers to be forthcoming in trying to give greater visibility for their schedules for those parts, which I expect the world [ph] has been a significant amount of metal availability in the system, the last 12 month. That is tightening. And clearly I think for some of our product range that we will see those lead times go out to beyond six months to nine and twelve months or certainly as we move into 2022. So we really have to plan for those. But that's only covers part of the product that we make where we have those really extended lead times.\nRobert Spingarn: As those tighten should we expect any margin pressure or these are all under LTAs and so not an issue?\nTolga Oal: Not an issue, yes.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.\nTolga Oal: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Good morning, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: John, you mentioned de-stocking in your commentary. And I was wondering if you could run through what the latest sort of situation is there how it could differ from aircraft to aircraft model? And what sort of visibility you have on when this could end?\nJohn Plant: Okay. Well it's the most complete part of what we've been doing with the last few quarters in terms of what is the true level of availability. And also to some degree it also depends now as we go forward the safety stock that our customers would also like to carry. Our thought is that basically our narrow-body by the end of this year there is no -- there's no inventory left in the system and we have to be in an inventory bill situation and it's only isolated pockets. Because essentially as these rate increases take effect in the second half of this year that's just chewing up any remaining parts that's available. And obviously, we always have to see through where whether in a Tier 1 situation directly to an airframe manufacturer compared to an engine manufacturer to try to heat [ph] that's what the engine going for system as well.\nTolga Oal: So, it's different on wide-body by the end of the year. And I'm struggling to remember the number, but let's assume we still have some trapped inventory in the system. And we'll be carrying I think something but now less than about 50 million of trapped inventory in our system which will liquidate during 2022. But for narrow-body the way to think about it essentially there's no trapped inventory in our system left and I think there'll be very little if any in our customer systems left for a narrow-body as we as we transition through the month of year with tightening each quarter.\nRobert Stallard: Yes. That's great. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.\nMatt Akers: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Could you comment on the -- I guess the 1% decline for defense in the quarter. What were kind of the big moving pieces there? And what are your latest thoughts on F-35 kind of rate going from here?\nJohn Plant: I think a broader perspective is better on defense and then we should be able to bring ___ right back into the here. And now, so we read that maybe Lockheed won't be building as quite as many as they have thought. And that happened was last year and seems to be this year in terms of maybe supplier availability or impact of COVID on the workforce, we're not sure. But -- I mean, there has been an increase between 2020 and 2021. We are seeing, well, I think Lockheed is talking about a slightly reduced 2022 compared to that previous forecast that maybe I'm going to call it 169 down to 159 or something. It's still above 2021. And so we see you know steady growing F35s from last year this year into next year, and then pretty steady for the following couple of years. And for us, if the build were to be reduced by 5% or so let's say in 2024 or 2025, don't know yet. Then that would be when the increase in spares would be occurring pretty far engine program. So, we expect the spares requirements to become quite significant for that aircraft as we move towards the middle of the decade. And so, we probably look at it as the F35 on a combined say early and after market continues to improve and increase slightly for Howmet over the next few years. You do know additional orders whether it's -- we're just coming with a order of 36 aircraft or even in the proposed defense budget that was actually lifted by I think the senate to have a slightly higher increase in quantity of F35 than was in the original White House budget. So it's trending fairly well for us at this point in time. And on the here and now. You also have to pick through the seasonality of defense orders, they always tend to be a little bit lighter in the first half being a bit heavier in the second half of the year. And we saw that again significantly in Q4 of last year where the defense demand was filled basically on a -- on the DOD budget. So when you have to blend through from our city of f35 still the 40% of total defense sales. If I called it now, I'd say, pretty stable year on year, maybe with a slight increase and increasing towards the back end of the year. And then we see some healthy signs orbits too early to really define 2022, yet some healthy signs for some of the other military programs due to roads across that we're looking at for that year. So, I don't know that's enough for you or you still need.\nMatt Akers: Yes. No. That's great. Thanks for the color.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Berenberg.\nParetosh Misra: Thank you. Good morning. John, I was wondering if you have any sense that to how much of your commercial aerospace businesses regional and business jet. So basically how much is not Boeing or Airbus linked?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean, we have a significant exposure to boost jet and helicopter. But I'm not sure as we've ever really disclosed it. So, before I comment on this call I'll look at it and see whether we get as they can do to call you back if we have. But I'm not aware that we actually have broken that whole segment down for you. But to say, and if you called out any business jet then you'd see us highly represented whether it's for our engine products or indeed any of the structural faster products.\nParetosh Misra: Understood. And maybe if you could just talk a bit about what you're seeing in the industrial segment that business for the second half both OEM and the aftermarket in that business?\nJohn Plant: Yes. So break it down between as a industrial, industrial gas turbine and oil and gas the IGT part of the business is very strong. And we're in a situation where we actually just can't make enough at this point in time. And therefore essentially it's on us just to make more and that's both for the new larger blade for the new turbines, which I mentioned in my earlier comment which we provide gas turbines which have fundamentally higher output and lower emissions of both carbon and nitrogen oxide. And so, we have a very strong demand for that and a significant backlog. Although for all of our customers whether it's GE, Zeeman, [Indiscernible] et cetera. And that's also combined with a very strong aftermarket for what called predecessor products. Well say, not as big blades you're trying to put that way. It's still pretty big compared to an aircraft turbine, but not as big as the new latest fleet of very large gas turbine engine. And there the supply situation is easier for us and we do have very significant demand basis because the natural gas turbines in particular are being worked harder given the relatively attractive. I'll say the input fuel content of the natural gas compared to oil or coal and certainly in their lower emissions even though that they also emit a thing. So a very healthy situation there. Oil and gas, the leading indicators of replant are going up very significantly. But we're not currently seeing increasing demand yet. I guess we're in that inventory burn out situation and therefore I guess hope that that will turn into an increase for us in 2022. And in general, industrial is you'll see that it also continues to be strong, but not as strong as the IGT market where really I would say, we just do with you see more instead it's more plants and the sort of equipment for these turbine is not fungible from an aircraft basically.\nParetosh Misra: Appreciate all the color, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.\nGeorge Shapiro: Hi. Yes John. I wanted to pursue a little bit more defense, because sequentially it was down 16% and engines were actually down 20%. So was there something odd this quarter that made it deteriorate so much relative to Q1?\nJohn Plant: No. There's nothing special at all George. I mean, we were down -- I think we sequentially we're down last year as well. So we always tend to have this stronger Q1 middle of the year, it's not so strong. And then basically a very strong back end to the defense aftermarket rather than defensively that causes that let's call it in-year seasonality. So nothing in particular at all. But no worries. Nothing we've lost at all. It's just - it's not very satisfying, but just the way it is.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. And then can you disclose the mix of sales between narrow-body and wide-body in 2019 versus where it is today? And is there any difference in profitability between the two sectors -- between the two businesses?\nJohn Plant: Okay. The metrics carry on mine is 19 was like 55% Boeing versus Airbus which wasn't a question, narrow-body, but for wide-body was just fractionally over 50% narrow versus wide. They're very similar numbers. Obviously, that's been moving around the last year or so. In terms of underlying profitability, very similar, but I'd give the edge to wide bodies being slightly more profitable. Obviously, -- but different volume, variety situation. But wide-body would be a little bit more profitable. But nothing that knocks the whole company out of joints. And if you were to have the extremes that we're facing at the moment in terms of the differentiability narrow and wide, I'd be surprised if it made more than 1% difference on our margin as you look at it in aggregate if now. So it's not nothing a great note and fully taken account of in any of the I'll say forward looking though we haven't given you a 2022 yet is that the way we've called out the second half is that we see, margins improving. It's already taken on into account that differential I mentioned to served in terms of get a dollar of recovery of metal for a dollar of input cost fully recovered, but it's still it's your margin and I called out that was probably worth taking out 22.8 just to over the 23. And similarly the -- that's taken account of the changing blend that we're seeing with narrow-body coming back stronger. So we're still seeing that expected margin improvement despite that fractional mix change.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, PT. Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter call. I'll start with an overview of Howmet's second quarter performance. Then pass to Tolga, who will talk more to our market. And then, Ken will provide further financial detail. I also plan to talk to ESG and we'll do so in about once a year going forward. And then provide guidance and talk to guidance for the third quarter and the full year 2021. So let's move to slide number four. Let me start with some commentary on the second quarter, which was the first comparable quarter for Howmet post separation with no pro forma numbers. Revenue was $1.2 billion and in line with expectations, while EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share exceeded our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $272 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was on par with Q1 2021 and Q4 2020 at 22.8%, despite the addition of costs to prepare for the second half ramp up in commercial aerospace production. Earnings per share excluding special items was $0.22 and ahead of our expectations. Historically, the first half has been a cash outflow for the company. The increased operating performance focus of Howmet has led to improve margins, enhanced working capital control and capital discipline, which generated $160 million of cash in the first half of the year. We expect continued cash generation in the third and fourth quarters. Year to-date, we have reduced debt by approximately $835 million by completing the early redemption of 2021 notes in Q1 and the 2022 notes in Q2 with cash on hand. These transactions reduced 2021 interest expense by approximately $28 million, and approximately $47 million on an annual run rate basis. This helps with increased 2022 free cash flow. In the second quarter, we continue to return money to shareholders with the completion of a 200 million share buyback program. The weighted average acquisition price was $34.02 per share, approximately 5.9 million shares. The second quarter and cash balance was $716 million.  Lastly, we continue to focus on reducing legacy liabilities. Year to-date, we have reduced our pension and OPEB liabilities for approximately $160 million. Moreover, full year pension and OpEx expense is expected to improve approximately 50% compare to last year. Now let's move to markets and performance on slide five. Q2 revenue was 5% less year-over-year and in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis commercial aerospace was 31% less driven by lower aircraft builds, spares and the lingering effects of customer inventory corrections. Commercial aerospace continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue compared to pre-COVID levels of 60%. The commercial aerospace decline is partially offset by our continued strength in other markets. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 13% year-over-year driven by new builds and spares. The commercial transportation business was up 89% year-over-year as it rebounds from customer shutdowns in Q2 of 2020. Truck demand remains strong as our customers manage through their own supply chain issues with several components, which are in short supply. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction, margin expansion and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations, as they are tied to long-term agreements. Structural cost reductions are also in line with expectations with the $37 million year-over-year benefit, which reflects the decisive actions we started in the second quarter of 2020 at the onset of the pandemic and continued through last year. Year-to-date structural cost reductions are $98 million, which have essentially achieved already a target of approximately $100 million. The aerospace decremental operating margins continue to be very good at only 19%.,while the wheel segment had an incremental margin of 47%. EBITDA margin expanded by 310 basis points year-on-year driven by price, variable cost flexing and fixed cost reductions. The team delivered strong margin expansion despite a reduction in revenue. Capital expenditure was $36 million for the quarter and continues to be less than depreciation and amortization resulting in a net source of cash. Lastly, free cash flow was $164 million for the quarter, resulting in a record first half. Now let's move to slide six. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter is 22.8% and consistent with the last couple of quarters on approximately $43 million of less revenue. The margin results overcame both the effects of the low revenue and the cost of many additional employees to meet the increasing production demand coming in the third quarter. Q2 revenue at $1.2 billion was in line with expectations. You can see the benefit of our actions since the start of the pandemic in Q2 with a solid 310 basis points -- EBITDA margin expansion, while revenue is approximately $58 million less in the same period. Now let me hand it over to Tolga to give an overview of the markets. Thank you, Ken. And let's move to slide 13. Moving to ESG, I'd encourage you to read our sustainability report found at howmet.com in the investor section. For Howmet aerospace, environmental, social and governance is about generating meaningful change for a more sustainable future, improving our diversity and inclusion inside our company and in the communities in which we operate. Regarding employee safety, we are maintaining attention on safety through uncertain operational conditions presented by COVID-19. Total recordable incidents continue to be significantly better than the aerospace and defense industry average. For 2020, we had a 20% year-over-year improvement in rate to 0.71. Additionally 84% of our locations worldwide were without a lost workday incident. This is a tremendous testament to the dedication and focus of our workforce. We continue to underscore the importance and power of diversity, equity and inclusion in our company. We value the rich diversity of expertise, backgrounds and viewpoints that fuel our innovation and we are committed to improving diversity of employees at all levels. Recently, we were recognized by the 50-50 women on boards organization for our commitment to broad diversity. In addition to gender diversity, we also partner with key external organizations including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Hispanic Corporate Council and Diversity Best Practices to review and continuously improve our initiatives. With respect to sustainability. Nowhere is this more evident than in the products that we provide to our customers. Our proprietary technologies help reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions contributing to the aerospace industry's goal of a smaller carbon footprint. Five specific areas are at the bottom left of the slide. The Commercial Aerospace, Next Generation, Jet Engine Technology reduces fuel consumption by approximately 15%. Moreover, Howmet's increased content on composite aircraft of two times contributes to light weighting solutions and reduces fuel use as composite aircraft are approximately 20% more fuel efficient than comparable metallic aircraft. For forged wheels, Howmet's aluminum wheels are five times stronger than steel, while being 47% lighter. Customers can realize up to 1,400 pounds of weight savings from retrofitting an 18-wheeler class 8 truck of steel to aluminum wheels. For IGT, Howmet's products continue to enable higher operating temperatures in the turbine and also pressures, which increase load efficiency towards approximately 64% and reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by approximately 40%. Lastly, for renewables, Howmet's Fastening Systems used in solar panels improved strength and clamping by five to ten times and reduce insulation time by up to 80%. Moving to STEM education and inclusiveness. Howmet is dedicated to increasing STEM opportunities and education in the local community through the Howmet Aerospace Foundation with grants to institutions and schools. Also we've renewed our commitment to support our six employee resource groups with strategic focus on community, culture and careers. Let me now move to slide 14 for our third quarter and annual guidance. The leading indicators for air travel continue to show improvement notably for domestic travel. This includes online searches for air tickets, increases in flight schedules across most of the world and beginnings of some international travel. Orders for aircraft by airlines and assembly partners are increasing rapidly. The expectation that Howmet will transition into revenue growth in the third quarter continues with growth of approximately 15% in commercial aerospace and total revenue growth of approximately 9%. We look forward to managing and leading this exciting growth phase for Howmet after the devastation of the pandemic on the industry. Growth is expected to continue into Q4 and into 2021 -- sorry, 2022 and beyond. The sequence for our businesses is that we expect increases in the engine business notably starting in the third quarter, followed by structures in the fourth quarter and fasteners starting in the first quarter of 2022. In terms of specific numbers, we expect the following. For the third quarter, revenue of $1.3 billion, plus or minus $20 million, EBITDA of $295 million, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA margin of 22.7%, plus or minus 40 basis points and earnings for share of $0.25, plus a minus $0.02. And for the year, we expect revenue to be $5.1 billion, plus or minus 50%. EBITDA baseline to increase to $1.17 billion, plus or minus -- plus 15%, minus 25%. EBITDA margin to increase to 22.9%, plus 10 basis points and minus -- to minus 20 basis points. Earnings per share increase to $0.99, plus or minus $0.03, cash flow baseline increased to $450 million, plus or minus $35 million. Moving to the right hand side of the slide, we expect the following. Second half revenue to be up approximately 12% versus the first half driven by commercial aerospace, defense and IGT. Second half year-over-year incremental margins of over 50% compared to the prior year. Price increases will continue to be greater than 2020. The cost reduction carryover of a $100 million is already achieved with some potential modest upside. Pensions and OPEB contributions of approximately $120 million. We are reducing cash pension contributions by approximately $40 million based upon the American rescue plan. CapEx should be in the range of $200 million to $220 million compared to depreciation of approximately $270 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion continues to be in excess of net income at approximately 100%. Lastly, as in last month, we have reinstated the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per common stock starting in the third quarter. Now let's move to slide 15 for a summary. The second quarter was solid and it's described as a quarter to get through, while we wait for the volume lift in the third quarter. It was better than expectations with improved margins and excellent cash flow. The net recruitment of production operators in the second quarter was approximately 300 people, principally in our engine business. And we -- of course, will continue to manage costs very carefully during this recovery phase. In the second half we plan to recruit another net 500 people. Liquidity is strong and we have healthy cash generation. The third quarter outlook for revenue to be approximately $100 million higher in the second quarter with margins somewhere between 22.3% and 23.1%. For the second half, we expect extra costs. However, year-over-year incremental margins are expected to be over 50%. Consolidated EBITDA margins for the second half are expected to be 22.6% to 23.2% setting a platform for a healthy 2022, and overcoming the drag of the increased labor costs from the recruitment that I talked about. And of course the net effect of the metal recoveries. Thank you very much. And now we'll take your questions. Hey, Cater. Yes. So we talked to about 300 people in Q2. And as you recall, I said, we'd add these people essentially no add button. You can see that our sales did not increase, and so it was exactly in line with expectations from the revenue side. We mentioned that we would possibly recruit 400 to 500 people in the second quarter. So we're a little bit below that. And that was essentially us keeping tight control of the cost going forward. The majority of the employees that we've recruited so far, and in fact the majority in our third quarter will be for the engine business. So far about three-quarters of the increase has come from people that we've recalled from a previous employment, and four-quarter of new employees. I expect that blend to change as we move through the next, let's say, period of time. And it's maybe to 50/50 and then the majority will be fresh employees I think as we exit the year. To give you a roadmap for the second half, let's say, first, Q3 will be principally engine. And then we'll be looking to add selectively in our structures business in the fourth quarter. And also for our faster businesses as we get looking into 2022 to be ready for that. So, about 500 people I think we're planning for the second half. So getting towards a 1000 for the year. Thank you. Good morning, David. Okay. So let's talk narrow-body in total, because I think that's the most important, really metric for the next 18 months or so. So 2019, the combination of the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 Max was peaked at about 100 maybe fractionally over 100, maybe 105 in a couple of months and so. That would be, let's say, the prior aggregation of the two. Clearly, that mix is changing currently with the view that the Airbus is moving to -- is it 47 in January and then 55 by the middle of the year. While say, Boeing is still planning to raise production to I think just over 30. Let's go to 31 in January of 2022 and has been silent there afterwards at this point. So the combo total is in the mid 80s. And so you can see for 2022, still a very significant increase on the last year or last and indeed this year. So the percentage increase is enormous. It still isn't back to 2019 levels. And then if it's right that by the middle of or maybe the end of 2023 we're up in the mid 60s for airbus and we don't yet know for Boeing. But you can envisage that we will be right back at that 100 maybe breaking through the 105 barrier on a combined basis at that point in time. And with the potential, a further rate increases should airbus confirm their aspirations to go to 70 and above. So, that's the roadmap there. But for 18 months while we're getting to 100, it basically just puts us back in the same territory that we've already been in, and so we have -- certainly adding capacity for all of that. If you then, obviously have to blend in what's happening with wide-body and it's probably a little bit too early to say. But I expect probably by the second half of 2023 that wide-body will be picking up. In fact I also think that we'll see some benefits as we go into 2022. So for example, should 787 return from to five a month from its current production level, then that would also be an increase for us. My expectation is that we'll see like all three volume lift, we'll see the lift from of us being the low current build rate just because parts have been take of inventory. Then we'll also will go to a rate match situation where we sell, ship set of aircraft parts equivalent to an aircraft that will volume lift 1. We then going to see volume lift 2, which is the increase that we'll have to make to continue to pace with the rates that are being talked about. So let's say, Boeing going from 14 to 31 and from Airbus going from 40 to 55. So those are both very healthy increases. And then, of course, for this to be done, then inventory has to be bought back in the system. So I expect that during 2022 and into 2023 we're going to see benefits above rate, because inventory just has to be put back into the system to guarantee these levels of aircraft production. So when you put it all back together and I'll just say, pick a moment in time, let's say, let's pick under 23 into 24 then my expectation is that all other things being equal will be at a rate of revenue above 2019. And basically with the content increases that we have or are built in plus any net benefits on price is that on a like-for-like basis, we'd probably be closer to the $7.5 billion to $8 billion on the equivalent production of aircraft. I mean, that's very approximately. But obviously it's a lot of changing parts amongst all of that as we go through the next two or three years. But the way I look at it, David, is that we've got three years, a pretty significant growth to look forward to. And then maybe by the middle of the decade reverting to the more normal 4% or 5% depending upon what end market demand is at that time. Thank you. Good morning, Dan. Well, if we have to break it down between let's say, machine tool capacity by that I mean essentially like take casting machines or core scrap [ph] machines. And then, I'll take the tooling that goes with the specific part number. In terms of machine tools, we have no problems whatsoever in terms of capacity, because we've already made, let's say, a hundred plus narrow-bodies in 2019 and as you know, we certainly in our engine business, we put a $0.25 billion [ph] of investment in place to take that capacity up. And so -- and then of course, the capacity just came in then the pandemic hit us and so we've carried that capacity for the last, let's say, 18 months now, and therefore it's still totally available to us. So, we in terms of machine tool capacity we could take back to a 400 plus narrow-body rate, all the wide-body rate and the significant increase above that. And so, in terms of a plant and equipment we have essentially no restrictions whatsoever. And that's also gives me confidence that we can still operate for a year or so with capital expenditures being below depreciation, because the capacity is essentially already there. To get further into your question though is that until we know the exact mix of requirements, it's difficult to say on the tooling side. So again, for the next 18 months I see no problems at all in terms of meeting customer demand. And if you took narrow-bodies at let's say 105 level combined then no problems. It's only when we -- if we were to add, let's say, if Airbus were getting to 75 and if Boeing were back above 50, and so we're talking 125 aircraft per month then clearly at that point we'd be at a balance of certainly in terms of tooling or die capacity for some of the Airbus parts. And therefore additional tooling would have to be put down to cope with those -- that volume scenario should it finally be confirmed. So, well, I think about for next couple of years, we have no capacity limitations apart from the ability to onboard labor and train it effectively to do all of that side of the business. But softer side -- but in terms of hard plant and machinery we're fully capacitized and then we have to be thinking about increasing tool capacity. Good morning. Yes. So let me break it down between fundamental and market demand and then the demand that we saw. So the order in take for Class 8 truck trail has been at an extraordinary level for some time. And so, the backlog is truly extraordinary. And so, in one sense, the demand is there such our confidence over balance of year in fact the whole of 2022 for commercial transportation business is really high. So it's like a great outlook. In fact, I don't think we've ever seen it so strong. The issue that we had in the second quarter was I recall, despite that extraordinary end market demand we actually were in a position where we did not supply, not because essentially we were unable to supply, but we took a large amount of down days and it was different by end customer, because they were unable to complete assembly of trucks due to missing parts whether it was missing tires or windshields, other structural components or of course the one that everybody's very familiar with is the issue of electronics and semiconductors. And so, we have a lot of partially built trucks that are there, which are in obtained fields around the both the U.S. and in Europe. And even some of those are delivered dealers with parts missing until they can go back and retrofit them. So what I'm trying to do is picture the market for us was one where great end market, but just short-term supply constraints by customers couldn't get parts. They couldn't build. And we were taking days down here or there just because they think you don't ship because we can't build anymore. Got no place to stick them because we haven't got part. That resulted in a 7% volume reduction for us of delivered end product in Q2 compared to Q1. So let's call it $18 million worth of revenue volume, which happened to be made up then by basically repricing for metal. So the metal escalators that we have covered up for the volume shortfall. So essentially, it says, if you take our on a percentage basis if you take our EBITDA margin of Q1 and divided by the -- you take those revenues and you flex it by 18. Then you can see that that totally counts for about a few hundred basis points of margin impact. So the way you should think about the second quarter for wheels was we had a 7% volume drop and also a metals impact. And basically if you adjust for those two actually the margin was very respectable. And if you want to extrapolate it a little bit further, so we didn't call it out because we tend not to call such things out. In fact, if you were to adjust for that, let's call it, $18 million, $20 million at the Howmet level of basically metal pass through just on wheels alone then in fact our EBITDA margins would have been just over 23%. So significant improvement on Q1 on a like-for-like basis, all be masked by just the fact that the denominator goes up and numerator goes up because of the way we recover metal. So that walks you through both wheels and for Howmet. Yes. I think we're going to have a similar Q3 to Q2 on the truck side, that would be my thought there. Just because the part shortages haven't really eased yet. And I do think that we're going to see as best I can guess that some of those will begin to ease towards the back end of the year. So I'm hoping for a fairly robust fourth quarter on wheels. Although I can just hope it's not a strategy. But the answer is, my thought is that it should be getting better and then like a really good 2022, because I say, the order books there and the backlog's just increasing just because the demand is there, but it's the inability for truck manufacturers to satisfy the market at the moment. Thank you. Good morning, Rob. Okay. Well it's the most complete part of what we've been doing with the last few quarters in terms of what is the true level of availability. And also to some degree it also depends now as we go forward the safety stock that our customers would also like to carry. Our thought is that basically our narrow-body by the end of this year there is no -- there's no inventory left in the system and we have to be in an inventory bill situation and it's only isolated pockets. Because essentially as these rate increases take effect in the second half of this year that's just chewing up any remaining parts that's available. And obviously, we always have to see through where whether in a Tier 1 situation directly to an airframe manufacturer compared to an engine manufacturer to try to heat [ph] that's what the engine going for system as well. Thank you. I think a broader perspective is better on defense and then we should be able to bring ___ right back into the here. And now, so we read that maybe Lockheed won't be building as quite as many as they have thought. And that happened was last year and seems to be this year in terms of maybe supplier availability or impact of COVID on the workforce, we're not sure. But -- I mean, there has been an increase between 2020 and 2021. We are seeing, well, I think Lockheed is talking about a slightly reduced 2022 compared to that previous forecast that maybe I'm going to call it 169 down to 159 or something. It's still above 2021. And so we see you know steady growing F35s from last year this year into next year, and then pretty steady for the following couple of years. And for us, if the build were to be reduced by 5% or so let's say in 2024 or 2025, don't know yet. Then that would be when the increase in spares would be occurring pretty far engine program. So, we expect the spares requirements to become quite significant for that aircraft as we move towards the middle of the decade. And so, we probably look at it as the F35 on a combined say early and after market continues to improve and increase slightly for Howmet over the next few years. You do know additional orders whether it's -- we're just coming with a order of 36 aircraft or even in the proposed defense budget that was actually lifted by I think the senate to have a slightly higher increase in quantity of F35 than was in the original White House budget. So it's trending fairly well for us at this point in time. And on the here and now. You also have to pick through the seasonality of defense orders, they always tend to be a little bit lighter in the first half being a bit heavier in the second half of the year. And we saw that again significantly in Q4 of last year where the defense demand was filled basically on a -- on the DOD budget. So when you have to blend through from our city of f35 still the 40% of total defense sales. If I called it now, I'd say, pretty stable year on year, maybe with a slight increase and increasing towards the back end of the year. And then we see some healthy signs orbits too early to really define 2022, yet some healthy signs for some of the other military programs due to roads across that we're looking at for that year. So, I don't know that's enough for you or you still need. Thank you. Yes. I mean, we have a significant exposure to boost jet and helicopter. But I'm not sure as we've ever really disclosed it. So, before I comment on this call I'll look at it and see whether we get as they can do to call you back if we have. But I'm not aware that we actually have broken that whole segment down for you. But to say, and if you called out any business jet then you'd see us highly represented whether it's for our engine products or indeed any of the structural faster products. Yes. So break it down between as a industrial, industrial gas turbine and oil and gas the IGT part of the business is very strong. And we're in a situation where we actually just can't make enough at this point in time. And therefore essentially it's on us just to make more and that's both for the new larger blade for the new turbines, which I mentioned in my earlier comment which we provide gas turbines which have fundamentally higher output and lower emissions of both carbon and nitrogen oxide. And so, we have a very strong demand for that and a significant backlog. Although for all of our customers whether it's GE, Zeeman, [Indiscernible] et cetera. And that's also combined with a very strong aftermarket for what called predecessor products. Well say, not as big blades you're trying to put that way. It's still pretty big compared to an aircraft turbine, but not as big as the new latest fleet of very large gas turbine engine. And there the supply situation is easier for us and we do have very significant demand basis because the natural gas turbines in particular are being worked harder given the relatively attractive. I'll say the input fuel content of the natural gas compared to oil or coal and certainly in their lower emissions even though that they also emit a thing. So a very healthy situation there. Oil and gas, the leading indicators of replant are going up very significantly. But we're not currently seeing increasing demand yet. I guess we're in that inventory burn out situation and therefore I guess hope that that will turn into an increase for us in 2022. And in general, industrial is you'll see that it also continues to be strong, but not as strong as the IGT market where really I would say, we just do with you see more instead it's more plants and the sort of equipment for these turbine is not fungible from an aircraft basically. Thank you. No. There's nothing special at all George. I mean, we were down -- I think we sequentially we're down last year as well. So we always tend to have this stronger Q1 middle of the year, it's not so strong. And then basically a very strong back end to the defense aftermarket rather than defensively that causes that let's call it in-year seasonality. So nothing in particular at all. But no worries. Nothing we've lost at all. It's just - it's not very satisfying, but just the way it is. Okay. The metrics carry on mine is 19 was like 55% Boeing versus Airbus which wasn't a question, narrow-body, but for wide-body was just fractionally over 50% narrow versus wide. They're very similar numbers. Obviously, that's been moving around the last year or so. In terms of underlying profitability, very similar, but I'd give the edge to wide bodies being slightly more profitable. Obviously, -- but different volume, variety situation. But wide-body would be a little bit more profitable. But nothing that knocks the whole company out of joints. And if you were to have the extremes that we're facing at the moment in terms of the differentiability narrow and wide, I'd be surprised if it made more than 1% difference on our margin as you look at it in aggregate if now. So it's not nothing a great note and fully taken account of in any of the I'll say forward looking though we haven't given you a 2022 yet is that the way we've called out the second half is that we see, margins improving. It's already taken on into account that differential I mentioned to served in terms of get a dollar of recovery of metal for a dollar of input cost fully recovered, but it's still it's your margin and I called out that was probably worth taking out 22.8 just to over the 23. And similarly the -- that's taken account of the changing blend that we're seeing with narrow-body coming back stronger. So we're still seeing that expected margin improvement despite that fractional mix change."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Please move to slide seven, and some more details about our year-over-year revenue performance. Second quarter revenue was 5% less driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Commercial aerospace was 31% less year-over-year in line without projections as expected inventory corrections continued. Defense aerospace was essentially flat in the second quarter as we are on a diverse set of programs with the joint strike fighter being approximately 40% of the total defense business. Commercial transportation which impacts both the forged wheels and the Fastening Systems segments was up 89% year-over-year as second quarter of last year was significantly impacted by customer shutdowns. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was up 13%. IGT which makes up approximately 45% of this market continues to be strong and was up a healthy 13% year-over-year. I will now turn it over to Ken to give a more detailed view of the financials. So, as you know, we have to guestimate that isn't the biggest number for us. But we actually saw a small uptick in the aftermarket demand for airfoils in the second quarter in the context of Howmet being nothing material at all. We are planning and scheduling that we will have an increased second half in airfoil aftermarket going through our customers of [Indiscernible] and Pratt & Whitney. So while the percentage, I think is it's certain - I can't make that one. But certainly well into the double digits in percentage increase. Again, it's not huge numbers, but we it's pleasing to see that demand and then all goes well again as we exit this year into next year. So when I bifurcated the strength that we saw in defense and IGT spares has continued all the way through with no real let up on that side at all. And so, it's a fairly strong growth in 2020 continued 2021. But the commercial aerospace business has been very, very muted certainly in Q1, small increase in Q2 and we're seeing higher percentage increases. But it don't become material in dollar terms until 2022. No. There's nothing that we see that's problematic for Howmet at all. It was scanned our supply base last year, the one area of concern we had basically disappeared by the late fall and currently we don't see any supply constraint for metal input to any of our plants. And we are securing supply as best as we know for what we believe in market demand as we go the turn of the year, because it's important to start thinking more about lead times. We're encouraging our customers to be forthcoming in trying to give greater visibility for their schedules for those parts, which I expect the world [ph] has been a significant amount of metal availability in the system, the last 12 month. That is tightening. And clearly I think for some of our product range that we will see those lead times go out to beyond six months to nine and twelve months or certainly as we move into 2022. So we really have to plan for those. But that's only covers part of the product that we make where we have those really extended lead times. Not an issue, yes. Thank you. So, it's different on wide-body by the end of the year. And I'm struggling to remember the number, but let's assume we still have some trapped inventory in the system. And we'll be carrying I think something but now less than about 50 million of trapped inventory in our system which will liquidate during 2022. But for narrow-body the way to think about it essentially there's no trapped inventory in our system left and I think there'll be very little if any in our customer systems left for a narrow-body as we as we transition through the month of year with tightening each quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Tolga. Let's move to slide eight for the segment results. As expected engine products, year-over-year revenue was 7% less than the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 17% less driven by customer inventory corrections and reduced demand for spares. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a year-over-year increase of 13% in IGT. The IGT business continues to be strong as demand for cleaner energy continues. Decremental margins for engines were 12% for the quarter as we hired back approximately 300 workers to prepare for the anticipated growth in the second half of this year. In the appendix of the presentation we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's incremental or decremental margins for the quarter. Now let's move to Fastening Systems on slide nine. Also with expected Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 20% less in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 42% less. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in commercial aerospace. The industrial and commercial transportation markets within the Fastening Systems segment were both up approximately 45% year-over-year. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems were 31% for the second quarter as segment operating profit margin was approximately 19%. Please move to slide 10 to review engineered structures. Engineered structures year-over-year revenue was 30% less in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 45% less driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the Boeing 787. Defense aerospace was relatively flat year-over-year. Decremental margins for engineered structures were 12% for the quarter. Lastly, please move to slide 11 for forged wheels. Forged wheels revenue doubled year-over-year as last year's results were impacted by customer shutdowns. On a sequential basis volumes were down approximately 7% due to customer supply chain issues. Reported revenue was essentially flat sequentially driven by a 20% increase in aluminum prices. Although, higher middle costs are passed through to customers to avoid a profit impact, you will see a reduction in EBITDA percent resulting from the pass through. Segment operating profit margin was approximately 27% and year-over-year incremental margin was 47%. Improved margin was driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries. Please move to slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. In the first half of the year we completed the early redemption of our 2021 and 2022 bonds with cash on hand. Gross debt stands at approximately $4.2 billion. All debt is unsecured and the next maturity is in October of 2024. Finally our $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility remains undrawn. Before turning it back to John to discuss ESG and 2021 guidance, I would like to point out that there's a slide in the appendix that it covers special items in the quarter. Special items for the second quarter were a net charge of approximately $22 million mainly driven by the costs associated with the early redemption of the 2022 bonds completed in early May. Now, let me turn it back over to John."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Shelby. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace First Quarter 2021 Results Conference Call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Tolga Oal, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John, Tolga and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we've included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, PT. Good morning, and welcome to the call. Similar to last quarter, I will give an overview of Howmet's first quarter performance, then pass to Tolga, who will talk to our markets, and then Ken will provide further financial detail. I'll return to the call to talk to guidance for the second quarter and the full year 2021. Please move to Slide 4. Let me start with some commentary on the first quarter. Revenue was $1.2 billion and in line with expectations while EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share exceeded expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $275 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was a healthy 22.7%, similar to the fourth quarter of 2020. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.22, which was ahead of expectations and ahead of Q4 2020. Historically, Q1 has been a significant cash outflow for the company. However, with improved margins and enhanced working capital control, the outcome has noticeably improved. This will be followed by cash generation in quarters 2, 3 and 4. Lastly, in the first quarter, we focused on deleveraging, completing the early redemption of the 2021 notes at par for approximately $360 million of cash in -- using cash in hand. The resulting quarter end cash balance was $1.24 billion. Moreover, on May 3, we completed the early redemption of the $476 million of notes due in 2022 for approximately $500 million, inclusive of the accrued interest and fees. Both transactions were completed with cash on hand. Year-to-date, we have reduced debt by approximately $840 million, which reduces the 2021 interest expense by $38 million and $47 million on a run rate basis. In addition, in 2022, there will be a carryover interest savings of $10 million. Now let's move to markets and performance on Slide 5. Q1 revenue was the same as the Q2 to Q4 2020 average and in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, commercial aerospace was down 52%, driven by the lingering effects of customer inventory reductions and fundamentally lower builds, starting with the Boeing MAX. Commercial aerospace continues to represent 40% of the total revenue of the company, compared to pre-COVID levels of 60%. The commercial aerospace decline is partially offset by continued strength in our other markets. Defense aerospace was up 12% year-over-year, driven by the Joint Strike Fighter new builds and spares. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 35% year-over-year, also driven by new builds and spares. Lastly, the commercial transportation business was up 15% year-over-year, despite customer supply chain constraints. Although truck demand is very strong, our customers managed through supply chain issues with several commodities, which are in short supply, including semiconductors, tires and glass, to name just a few. We are working closely with our customers to meet demand, which is showing some interruptions. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations. Structural cost reductions are also in line with expectations, with a $61 million year-over-year benefit. Segment decremental margins continue to be good at 27%, driven by price, variable cost flexing and fixed cost management. CapEx was $55 million in the quarter and continues to be less than depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net source of cash. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.7% and consistent with Q4 2020 on approximately $30 million of less revenue. Q1 revenue of $1.2 billion was consistent with the Q4 -- Q2 to Q4 2020 average. You can see the benefit of our actions since the start of the pandemic with a 300 basis point EBITDA margin expansion while revenue was approximately $45 million less than the same period, so good year-on-year performance. Now let me turn it over to Tolga to give an overview of the markets.\nTolga Oal: Thank you, John. Please move to Slide 7. Now to year-over-year revenue performance. Q1 revenue was down 26%, driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 52% year-over-year, in line with our projections, as we continue to see customer inventory corrections as expected. Defense aerospace continues to grow and was up 12% in Q1 as we are on a diverse set of programs, with the Joint Strike Fighter being approximately 40% of the total defense business. Commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segments, was up 15% year-over-year with a very strong market demand. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which consists of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial, was up 1%. IGT, which makes up approximately 45% of this market, continues to be strong and was up a healthy 35% year-over-year. I will now turn it over to Ken to give a more detailed view of the financials.\nKenneth Giacobbe: Thank you, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. Now let's move to Slide 8 for the segment results. As expected, Engine Products year-over-year revenue was down 32% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 55%, driven by customer inventory corrections and reduced demand for spares. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a year-over-year increase of 18% in defense aerospace and a 35% increase in IGT. IGT continues to be strong, and we will continue to make investments in this business as demand has been increasing for cleaner energy. Decremental margins for engines were 26% for the quarter as segment operating profit margin was approximately 19%. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's decremental margins for Q3 2020 through Q1 2021. Now let's move to Fastening Systems on Slide 9. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was down 29% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 42%. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in the commercial aerospace market. The industrial and commercial transportation markets were down 2% year-over-year, but up 19% sequentially. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems were 45% for the first quarter as furloughed workers returned to work. Please move to Slide 10 to review Engineered Structures. For Engineered Structures, year-over-year revenue was down 36% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 57%, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the 787 and 737 MAX. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 10% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Decremental margins for Engineered Structures were 18% for the quarter, compared to 24% in Q4. Lastly, please move to Slide 11 for Forged Wheels. Forged Wheels revenue increased 19% year-over-year despite customer supply chain constraints. Forged Wheels revenue grew faster than the overall market, in part due to Howmet's new innovative 39-pound wheel. Segment operating profit margin was another record at almost 31% as year-over-year incremental margins were 56%. The improved margin was driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries. Please move to Slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. First, we completed 2 early redemptions of our bonds. The first transaction was on January 15. We used cash on hand to complete the early redemption at par of the 2021 bonds due in April 2021. By paying down the bonds 3 months early at no additional cost, we saved $5 million of interest. The second transaction was earlier this week on May 3. We used cash on hand to complete the early redemption of the bonds that are due in February 2022. The bonds were redeemed at a cost of approximately $500 million. As a result, the interest costs have been reduced by approximately $47 million year-over-year. Moreover, as John has mentioned, in 2022, we'll get an incremental $10 million of carryover interest savings. Gross debt stands at $4.2 billion. All debt is unsecured, and the next maturity is in 2024. Finally, our $1 billion revolver remains undrawn. Before I turn it back to John to discuss the 2021 guidance, I would point out that there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items in the quarter. Special items for the quarter were a charge for approximately $16 million after tax, and the charge was primarily related to 3 items: first, we had fire costs at 2 of our plants of $7 million; second, we had an impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell a small manufacturing business in France of $4 million; and third, we had a pension settlement charge in the U.S. of $3 million. Finally, we continue to work on reducing legacy liabilities and improving asset returns for the pension plan. I would highlight 2 significant items: first, we had announced a planned administration change of certain prescription drug benefits that is expected to reduce cost and reduce our OPEB liability by approximately 20% or $39 million; second, we are benefiting from pension asset investment returns of over 13% that we realized in 2020. The combination of the asset returns and the liability reduction have decreased annual pension and OPEB expense by 37% or $13 million annually. So now let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken. Let me move to Slide 13 for the Q2 and annual guidance. First, the good news is that we're another quarter along towards the recovery of the commercial aerospace market. This will go a long way in helping profitability and complementing the growth and solidity at the defense aerospace, IGT and commercial transportation markets. There are a series of leading indicators that are showing very well for us: numbers of flight inquiries, bookings of flights, hotels and car rentals, and we also note the increase in U.S.A. TSA numbers, flight takeoffs, particularly in the U.S. and China. Europe remains somewhat muted given the effects of the pandemic and slower implementation of COVID vaccines. All of this should begin to help airlines with aircraft production, particularly of narrow-body aircraft. We note that the demand for wide-body aircraft probably may not reappear until mid-2022 or even into 2023. We see at the end of the second quarter as to be an inflection point to the beginnings of production increases for Howmet in the second half of the year, with the exact precise timing yet to be determined. We are planning to bring back from furlough or recruit several hundred workers during the next 2 quarters to train and retrain to be ready for this demand, just in the same effective way that we did in the third quarter of 2020 for the commercial wheels business. My expectation is that these costs plus cost of recommencing mothball plants and equipment will hold EBITDA margins at around the 22% level until further stabilization is reached. We also know that there is an effect on the commercial transportation market of part shortages, particularly semiconductors, which is reducing shifts and production work in the second quarter. As noted earlier today, the timing for cash generation has been a focus for us. And instead of the normal large Q1 outflow, which then has to be subsequently overcome, the first quarter was essentially breakeven and all subsequent quarters are expected to be cash generative. Specifically, the guidance for Q2: sales at $1.2 billion, plus or minus $30 million; EBITDA of $265 million, plus or minus $5 million; EBITDA margin of 22.1%, plus or minus 10 basis points; and earnings per share of $0.20, plus or minus $0.01. And for the year, sales of $5.1 billion, plus $100 million, minus $50 million; EBITDA line increases -- the EBITDA baseline increases by $50 million to $1.15 billion, with a range of plus $50 million to minus $25 million; EBITDA margin baseline has now increased to 22.5%, plus 60 basis points and minus 20 basis points in terms of a range. The earnings per share baseline increases to $0.95, a significant increase over prior guidance and with a range of plus $0.07 to minus $0.04. And the cash flow baseline increased to $425 million, plus or minus $30 million. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We noted that second half revenue is expected to be up 12% for the total company, driven by the increases in commercial aerospace, defense and IGT. Price increases to be greater than 2020. Cost reduction carryover of approximately $100 million, and pension and OPEB contributions of $160 million. We continue to evaluate the impacts of the American Rescue Plan Act upon pension contributions and we'll determine those later in the year. CapEx is expected to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million compared to depreciation and amortization of $270 million. And adjusted free cash flow conversion is about 100% of net income. We plan to reinstate the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock in the third quarter of 2021, pending the final Board approval. Now please move to Slide 14. To summarize, Q1 was a healthy start to the year, and liquidity of the company continues to be strong. The guidance provided is raised from that given in early February and reflects our first quarter profitability strength. The redemption of bonds for cash, the reinstitution of the dividend, all of which provide value to shareholders. More broadly, the focus is now turning to the beginning of the revenue recovery in the second half, commencing with commercial aerospace and the run rate of both revenues and margins as we exit 2021 and move into 2022, where we see the prospect of further leading indicator improvements. Thank you, and now we'll take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman: Just looking at the different segments and sort of where aero came down, I guess, if you think about where you are relative to the bottom, it sounds like, obviously, there's increases coming for the second half. But for -- I guess, for fasteners, I guess, do you feel like you have visibility with regard to what the level of destocking is and at the -- what we've seen in Q1 is kind of close to the bottom and then, I guess, similarly for structures as well?\nJohn Plant: Yes. So the way I think about it is in terms of sequence of the transition and with the end of the second quarter being the transition from basically the current holding part and recent results of the reduced demand and then the correction of the inventory to our customers. And already, we know that commercial transportation is going well, subject to those, I'll say, interruptions because of supply shortages. The big third comes in commercial aerospace, we believe, at the end of the second quarter. And I think that's going to be led by the engines business in terms of the first uptick in demand with -- and supported by structures, with fasteners probably still being a little bit behind that by another quarter or so. So my picture for the year is that commercial aerospace, I think, year-on-year, we're going to see that segment up 15% to 20% in the third quarter compared to second. Second quarter will be a reduced decrement compared to what we see the 52% currently. And then as that increase that we see as the turn occurs will be led by engine, supported by structures, with fasteners following maybe fourth quarter or even at the end of the year just as those inventories are absorbed then with what we think will be a fairly a significant snapback in the first part of 2022. So that gives the sequence that I expect both for the commercial aerospace markets and how it affects each of our segments through the next 3 quarters.\nSeth Seifman: Great. That's very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, can you talk about your level of visibility on the 737 MAX versus, I guess, when we were on the call 3 months ago?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean, we think that it's going to continue in line with Boeing's build rate, which is currently at 7, rising to 14 in the late summer and then into the, I think, 22 per month range as we start 2022 and then up to 30 a month. So it seems set well at the moment. We're still, as I said on the previous call, have been supplying effectively below the 7 rate per month in aggregate. Obviously, different levels go into different product lines. But we are expecting to see being in line with shipset values to equal production and then the lift of production as we go forward. So that's all built into what we think would be that 20% increase in commercial aero in the -- commencing in the third quarter. And also supported by the increase in production that in narrow-body for the A320 for Airbus as well.\nOperator: Your next question is from Robert Spingarn of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nRobert Spingarn: John, just following up on Seth's question there on the MAX, maybe just to ask it slightly differently. But with Boeing or other suppliers talking about 160 aircraft being produced in 2021, can you tell us where you are relative to that number given the inventories in this already in the supply chain and so on? In other words, how much production do you need to do to match to their 160?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I think we are closer to the 120 level, so let's say, 25% below that number for the year is how we see it with, say, that inflection point coming -- a significant inflection point coming as we start Q3, for which, if we didn't have confidence, we would not be going through the recruitment and bringing back of people in the second quarter, starting the second quarter, and seeing significant employment increases during the next two quarters.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And just on that, I guess, on the other question that Seth asked, and you talked about the second half improvement earlier led by engines. When will you actually know how far in advance of the shop visits? Are they scheduled? And are parts ordered? And what are the lead times for structures and fasteners as well? So in other words, when will you know what your second half looks like?\nJohn Plant: Okay. We have already begun to receive order intake now from our customers, particularly on the engine side, with letters of commitments on the, I'll say, schedule releases and EDI transmission. So what we're seeing is all the things which have been stated appear to be materializing as we speak to. Even in the last week, we received letters from, let's say, Safran or CFM and meetings with GE Aviation, et cetera. So it's gone from what we think may happen to, I can say, a lot more confidence. And the question is one of just the final degree to be determined. So there's other stuff which has to be filled in, but an increasing level of confidence compared to 3 months ago.\nRobert Spingarn: And is it different for fasteners? It's much more book and burn, so the lead times are shorter and you won't yet have a firm view on that?\nJohn Plant: Yes. We operate with some of our customers on min-max systems. And so the averages take some time to re-average. So at the moment, as they -- we were re-averaging down on those min-max systems, it takes time for it to feed through. And then it will then snap back. It gained more significant to the upside. But with that to -- I'd say maybe a 2-quarter delay for that segment is what I see as the most likely scenario. So that's why I said I think that fasteners will be a quarter or 2 behind what we're seeing elsewhere.\nOperator: Your next question is from David Strauss of Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: John, can you touch on what an inflationary environment might mean for your business, thinking about it from a pricing and raw material standpoint? Is an inflation -- as you net all of it, do you think an inflationary environment potentially going forward will it be a net positive for the business?\nJohn Plant: For the next few years, I don't see it significant either way because material inflation will essentially be passed through to our customers by the escalator agreements that we have. And therefore, we're talking more about what would be the impact of labor inflation. Labor -- for labor inflation, some significant parts of our businesses those are already set for the next, I'll say, 2 to 4 years depending upon the various labor agreements that we have in place. But obviously, some of the workforce, it's an annual event. And then it's up for us to gain the productivity that we seek to gain each year to offset that labor inflation. So I'm -- in an inflationary environment, I don't expect that to be a problem for us. And indeed, with customer agreements that we have and also some of that we see is, say, being taken care of with the -- within the bandwidth of the LTA negotiations that we've been undergoing.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. As a follow-up on the capital deployment front, I know you've -- you've taken out a fair amount of debt reinstituting the dividend, but it still looks like the way you're tracking your cash balance will be well over $1 billion at year-end without doing anything else. So now that you don't have much, it looks like, to do on the debt side of things, how are you thinking about share repurchase from here?\nJohn Plant: Yes. So we described the potential for capital allocation strategies in some detail on the last call. In fact, I think I called it smorgasbord of opportunity to do various things. What we considered is the first order of battle was to deal with the next couple of maturities of our bonds. We did that easily from cash on hand. And that obviously produces a lower interest burden for the company, lower gross debt. And therefore, it's also seen some improvement from the rating agencies. So that's been, I think, a good step for us. And now the next thing you have to address at some point, but not, I don't think, just now is the October 2024 at some point. So that's 3.5 years away in terms of bonds. So I'd say that part of the balance sheet is dealt with. We felt confident in the cash flows of the business to reinstate the dividend. That's an expression of our confidence and, again, part of our plan to return money to shareholders. And then the other 2 aspects that we have to consider is what about share repurchase and also to what degree, if anything, do we participate in any M&A activity, which may materialize over the next, say, year or so as the commercial aerospace market solidifies into, let's say, skylines and the confidence that we all can believe in. Clearly, that's beginning to happen given what I said about the inflection point that we see coming. And I guess, we're in that position, David, that you said, is that if all things work out as planned, is that we'll have a very significant cash balance at the end of the year and have the ability to make other decisions in capital deployment in the future. So I think it's always well in terms of, let's say, the whole capital allocation strategy that we set out for ourselves in the recent months.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Carter Copeland of Melius Research.\nCarter Copeland: One question. David is in trouble. I guess I got to stick to one, right, John?\nJohn Plant: Well, you never do anyway, Carter. So I just like -- it's one of these like aspiration things, but yes, you go for the -- you go for the multiple 5-part question.\nCarter Copeland: That's fine. I'll do 1-parter. So obviously, the shift in focus is moving to going back up in production and then bringing people back from furlough, training and the like. But one of the things that we used to talk about before this all went down was yield, whether that's first pass yields or rolled throughput yields in some of those key spots in your facilities. When you look at yields and production facilities today versus where those were when we were talking about shortages and engine OEM factories 2 years ago or so, how does that stand today? And how does that play into your confidence and conviction around going up without hiccups?\nJohn Plant: Okay. When I look at the last couple of years in our aerospace business, I think one of the untold stories is the improvement in delivery performance and our quality levels where it's been reducing arrears, whether it's being parts per mining defects or even internal scrap in our manufacturing plants. And yields have clearly have definitely improved both for defense aerospace and commercial aerospace segments. And so it's all good. I really want to protect reputation and reliability with our customers and really seek to do that by bringing labor back and training it. So I think the things we did last year in the third quarter for our wheels business have paid off handsomely in terms of our ability to increase production with excellent quality and deliver these very significant incremental margins that we've seen in that wheels business. And so rather than, I think, stumble through this, we're trying to be ahead of it, being planful on labor and recognizing that there is a training time or retraining for people to be able to deliver the yields that we currently have and hopefully continue to improve them. So that's why I want to plan carefully through the next couple of quarters because we are talking a very significant increase in labor. Obviously, we'll be tailoring it to and then trimming it exactly as we see to go through it. But I really want to be ahead of this thing and not chasing it and having yield issues and arrears build and all the consequences that, that puts upon the business. So if it cost us, let's say, a couple of -- 200, 300 basis points or whatever margin for a quarter or so, I think that's money really well spent because it's going to be what's the margin as we exit this year and how do we perform into 2022. So really trying to be planful about the next phase of our business and not just react to it after the event and that you seem to be scrambling. So that's all part of the value we bring to, I think, to the industry and to our customers.\nOperator: Your next question is from Gautam Khanna of Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Forgive a two question asked. But first, I was curious about lead time discussions with customers, are you having those? I mean I imagine it's chicken or egg if the lead times are short. They don't have the urgency to place orders. But then we have as the order books pick up, the lead times extend, and there's a queuing effect. I mean, do you think that plays out over the next 1.5 years where we see kind of a bullwhip effect? I know you just talked about the second half being above the first half. But I mean, could we see kind of outsized growth as we move in? Or do you think it will be just feathered in gradually in terms of the recovery? And then I have a follow-up.\nJohn Plant: Yes. The way I see it at the moment is everybody is aware there's plenty of metal in the system, and that gives people, I'll say, the ability to drop in a little bit later than would have been normal. If you looked at the demand levels of 2019 where lead times were, let's say, to get metal for some of our products was over 12 months. So we need to recognize the situation we're all in with carrying some trapped inventory. And we still have trapped inventory, which we plan to liquidate during the balance of 2021. And it's really interesting. Because when we look at our inventory levels as we move through the year, one of recent discussions in our quarterly review has been to what degree do we hold on to some of those in the latter part of the year just so again we're in a really strong position as we enter 2022 with what we think will be a fairly strong year for us in terms of demand. So where we find ourselves at the moment is our customers know that there's metal in the system, we know there's trapped inventory. And so we're more on that 3 to 6 months of lead times. And people have been holding off, and we've been seeing that fill in very significantly in the last few weeks. And then obviously, it's like everything is going to depend. But I do see, if we look at 6 months from now, then those lead times are going to be significantly increased. And therefore, orders are going to have to be placed. Otherwise, with some of the production increases on narrow-bodies, in particular, that Airbus and Boeing are looking at for 2022 and certainly later in 2022, I mean they won't occur unless orders are placed because the availability of that inventory and the current excess of metals has just been in the system for the last year just won't be there.\nGautam Khanna: That is helpful. And then I just wanted to ask, last quarter, we talked about how the Boeing schedule is a little bit more in flux than the Airbus production schedule. But we heard Spirit yesterday talk about 9 to 10 A350s coming out of the plan this year and next. So I was curious, how stable is it now on the Airbus side? Did you see much in the way of changes over the past 3 months? And is that in...\nJohn Plant: No, we've seen no changes on Airbus. It's been solid. Solid all the way through, meeting what they've said, reinforcing what they've said, issuing both skyline and production schedules. So no changes for Airbus at all. And in fact, in the more recent past, we have not seen changes from Boeing either, which in last years have tend to be towards the downside. Again, none of that's been occurring.\nOperator: Your next question is from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: John, we're seeing some pretty positive things about what we could be seeing in 2022 and beyond. But I was wondering, as we feed this volume through the system, what your thoughts might be on incremental margins as volumes recover? Can we say, for example, take your experience in wheels and apply that to aerospace?\nJohn Plant: I think there -- obviously, we also have a different profile to our engine business, to our structures business. So it's got to be segment by segment. But essentially, I am on record having said that we expect fairly strong incrementals as we go forward. Because in the way that we managed through this crisis, you can see that, compared to our normal decrementals of, let's call it, 40%, we've been getting those into the 20s and have been quite pleased with both the way we've managed our structural cost takeouts and the variable costs. And it's our job not to allow those more fixed cost to creep back into the system. And they also, indeed, try to be sticky on those variable costs as we go back up the production volume curve. So we are expecting healthy incremental margins. And part of it is also getting that labor in place at the right time and trained and ready, as I tried to describe on a couple of questions ago. So we don't stumble our way through this. It's planfully set out and accepting it as if it cost us 200 or 300 basis points of margin -- not being 200 but 20 or 30 basis points of margin. So I think I just can't get to like just over 22% for the second quarter just to take out of -- I'd rather bring the labor in and then look forward to those healthy incrementals going forward.\nRobert Stallard: That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. That margin impact from extra labor, that's baked into your 2021 guidance?\nJohn Plant: Yes, it is.\nOperator: Your next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: John, having 2Q revenue be down year-over-year a little bit, despite that lapping a largely pandemic-impacted quarter, the low end of the 2Q guide being down a little sequentially, that's pretty surprising given your mix. I kind of expect that in aerospace original equipment as that's longer cycle, but aerospace aftermarket, defense, truck, industrial would think would all be up year-over-year and sequentially. Is there just more destocking in aerospace original equipment or a longer time for you to link up to Boeing and Airbus than maybe I had appreciated? And so if you could help me understand that and maybe just get specific on how much inventory destock left and anywhere where you're not yet linked up to Boeing and Airbus would be really helpful.\nJohn Plant: So Q2 of 2020, our customers were not rapid to change some of the production requirements, and that became more of featured in the third quarter, as you know, from last year. So when we look at Q2 this year, because some of the schedules have not been reduced that significantly, although they were reduced and you say plants were closed down, it's a very, I'll call, turbulent quarter to comp against. And so the way I look at it is more, let's say, on a sequential basis, where I'm thinking that, well, commercial aero was down 52%, it's going to be down a lot less than that in terms of build comparisons. And then the only other muting effect I'm thinking about at the moment is we are careful in terms of the commercial truck build plans of our customers, just because of those part shortages. So we are seeing shifts go down and customers take weeks out in the second quarter. And that's part of what we are guiding to as well, including that in our numbers as best as we can estimate it at this point in time. So it's a fairly, I must say, careful assumption around the commercial transportation business for the second quarter. At the same time, I would say to you now the flip side of that is that order intake for us pretty much globally has been very healthy. And you've seen class 8 truck and trailer orders at levels now, which essentially secure the backlog for the balance of 2021 and most of the way through 2022 at the moment. And so -- whereas before, we were thinking we had a fairly good trajectory, but it wasn't filled in totally. Now you see that demand so strong. So for example, if you wanted to buy a new trailer to go with your truck at the moment, if you ordered it today, you wouldn't be thinking about taking delivery for 12 months. So you're looking out into the second quarter of 2022. Now that's how long lead times are in the commercial transportation industry. So that's really very healthy for us and really puts a very solid platform on 2022 and never mind the balance of this year. So I just want to give you the full picture around that. And so if we're cautious on, I'll call, supply-based interruptions the truck build in the very short term, given the strength of the economy, what we see by way of transportation and shipping of things, it's producing a very solid picture for backlog for the next, let's say, 18 months.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. That's really helpful. Could you just put a little more detail around where, if anywhere, you're not yet linked up to Boeing and Airbus or where in the business there's more inventory destock yet to occur?\nJohn Plant: Basically, we are still having inventory taken out in the second quarter. And then we think, and it's like it's the best judgment that basically that just essentially stops and so at the end of the second quarter. So we begin to see our structures business in the second half where we're planning for increased production. We're seeing it clearly. I've already mentioned the engine-based business and the only business which is going to lag for, again, a couple of quarters behind that is going to be our fastener business where I think we're going to be close on, balanced all inventories up by the -- maybe by the end of the third quarter, could stray into Q4. But that's how we see it at the moment. So different flavors for those different segments according to basically lead times and trying to get ahead of it. Because I think one thing our customers don't want to have is some of the supply constraints, particularly around engine parts, which are really long lead-time items ultimately. They're on the same constraints as we saw a couple of years ago.\nOperator: Your next question is from Paretosh Misra of Berenberg.\nParetosh Misra: I'm guessing structures have the highest wide-body exposure, and probably engines have the highest narrow-body exposure. Is that correct? And if any way you could further quantify it as to what's the wide-body versus narrow-body split in engine versus structures.\nJohn Plant: Certainly, you're right in terms of basic structures on our fastener business because of the composite content of wide-body aircraft. So if you're thinking Airbus A350s as an example or Boeing 787s and with those composite structures more titanium, whole different suite of fasteners, then you can see that impact in the way we've laid out our revenue expectations with then, as we said, I'll say, an improving situation somewhat behind the engine business. If you look at the traditional split going back to -- you got to have to go back to 2019 because it's been moving around. And I'm just trying to keep all of these numbers in my head, but it's like a 60-40 narrow -- maybe 55-45 narrow to wide-body split. That has shifted the same as Boeing and Airbus has shifted over the last 12 months. So to give you a picture on that, I think, traditionally, Boeing would have been 60, Airbus 40, split the other way, and they could rebalance again in 2021, to some degree, as the MAX gets back up and going. For engines, I actually don't keep the numbers in my head in terms of what the exact split is. Certainly, in terms of what we see over the next 12, 18 months is that the narrow-body engines, so think LEAP-1A, LEAP-1B and then obviously, some of the aftermarket service business coming back, particularly for the CFM engines. So what we see begin to fill in the back end of the year to 2022. But I think that's best I can do at this point. I can't exactly remember the split between wide and narrow for engine and maybe we haven't given it.\nParetosh Misra: This is great, John. I really appreciate all the details. And maybe as a follow-up, with regard to the industrial and other end market, I'm sorry if I missed this, but have you given out what sort of full year growth rate is baked in your revenue guidance for the year?\nJohn Plant: For the gross industrial markets, we haven't called that out. But just to me just give you a picture on that, the way we see us going through IGT part of that business is strong and getting stronger, in fact. And so at the moment, we could sell everything we could make. And so again, we're working on raising production for that. So that's, I'll say, fairly exciting. Oil and gas has been really very muted for the last year and the first half of this year. But we -- our thought process is that maybe in the fourth quarter or certainly by the first quarter of next year, we think in the oil and gas begins to show an improvement for us. We see Texas crude now at $66, plus or minus, and natural gas has moved up. And rig count has moved up significantly for the Gulf. And so all that's talking well to us in terms of the demand partners we work through inventories in oil and gas. And then in general, industrial is also strengthening, as we see through the balance of 2021, again, in the second half. So basically, snapshot is IGT is strong. Oil and gas, another quarter or two of weakness, followed by some strength, and then general industrial progressively getting better as well.\nOperator: Your next question is from Phil Gibbs of KeyBanc Capital.\nMichael Leshock: It's Mike on for Phil. I wanted to get an update on price increases here. You're getting good traction there and you expect to be greater than what you saw in 2020. But do you have visibility into when you expect the lion's share of those price increases to be seen in the year? Or should we expect fairly steady benefits quarter-over-quarter?\nJohn Plant: I think we're going to see a fairly steady pattern throughout the year. Most of our agreements have now been -- in fact, I think all of our agreements have been renewed in terms of LTA for '21. We don't expect much by way of spot business, unless something occurs in the back end of the year where a demand is mismatched to previous schedule. So I mean that's the picture there. And I guess, we'll be giving enhanced detail in our 10-Q, which we plan to issue later today. But basically, everything is in order in that side compared to previous statements.\nOperator: Your next question is from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes, John, it looks like sequentially commercial aero was maybe down about 2%, if you could validate that. And if you could also break out what you think the mix is now between OE and aftermarket. And then the improvement you're looking for in the second half, is that primarily OE or aftermarket?\nJohn Plant: Okay. So benefits in the second half essentially is OE. There will be some modest improvement, I think, in commercial aero, but fairly modest. If you -- to give you a picture, if you go back, 2019 as the reference point, $800 million of spares, which essentially is engine, plus -- on top of that, fasteners and structure business. It was $400 million of defense and industrial that grew, let's say, let's call it, 20% over the last year or so. So healthy growth there. But for the most part, the spares or parts we sell through to the MRO shops through our customers just dropped off a cliff in the second half of last year. So basically, you see limited demand, but still a demand like commercial business jet and some very modest levels of spares business. And that picture through that is first half of this year is pretty much the same as the back half of last year. So compared to $100 million a quarter, I think, more like $20 million a quarter. It can be below that, could be just above it, just depends on the quarter. It's just bouncing around with small numbers. In the second half of this year, I think we're expecting a modest lift, but not planning for anything significant in that spares business in the second half at this point, but let's say a little bit higher than that. That's clear compared to the $20 million a quarter, thinking more like that $25 million to $30 million a quarter. It doesn't move the needle for us at this point in time. I think it will in '22. So all the guidance I've given you is essentially balance in the commercial aerospace part of our business is coming off the OE demand.\nOperator: Your final question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.\nJohn Plant: Noah, you're back.\nNoah Poponak: I'm back.\nJohn Plant: That's way to get more than one question in.\nNoah Poponak: I totally never violate the stick to one question rule. So I came back. Just kidding. John, the last time commercial aerospace was in a similar point in its cycle sort of looking at the early part of the recovery, the fasteners market was just volatile and it turned out that because of a lot of use of distributors and just kind of maybe a long path from the part OEM to the airplane OEM, it ended up just taking a long time to recover and was just kind of messy. And hearing you talk about the inventory destock maybe lasting a little longer there, maybe you could just help us get comfortable that the issues that drove that last time around aren't in the system again. And I guess, how worried are you about that in that business?\nJohn Plant: Well, I don't know if I can give you any more comfort. I think I wasn't sticking around when the last cycle really occurred, so I don't know. We've done a lot of efforts in our business to try to grow it, not just in OE demand, but also through distribution. And at the moment, I think it's good and clear that we've called it out, being probably a couple of quarters behind where we think some of the other parts of our commercial aerospace business are beginning to respond. And so I think that's a fairly thought-through and quality view of the market at this point. I recognize that we do have extended change. So for example, part of our -- if you could just take the North American business, and so I'll just confine my comments to that. Yes, we'll supply directly to Boeing. So that's part of the demand. But we also supply into -- in Spirit. And therefore, it's another step in the supply chain. And what we're clear at is that we've been supplying at the low rate for some time. We're not trying to be optimistic in saying we're going to see that recover in the Q3 or Q4. We've been saying it's a couple of quarters behind and do think that it will begin to recover or will maybe even -- maybe it's the bullwhip comment that Gautam used or is it snapback. I think we're going to see significant demand increases for our fastener business in 2022. That's the best I can guide you at this point in time without the perfect visibility that, I guess, we'd all like, but we don't have.\nNoah Poponak: Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And just one more while I'm on here. The cost you've referred to, to sort of prepared to have growth come back, hiring, et cetera, is there any range of an absolute dollar number you could put on that just so we could then compare that to the cost-out number you've had?\nJohn Plant: Well, it's -- of course, it's -- the cost-out number is essentially more of a structural cost takeout rather than the variable cost side. The cost -- the employment that I'm talking about bringing into the business is essentially in our variable cost structure. So you need to understand it's completely different parts of bucketing in the P&L. And I just consider like direct labor reflect in accordance with the production requirements. To give you a picture for second quarter, then we're thinking of, let's say, around 400 people, could be 500 people, to bring into the business in -- during April, May and June to prepare ourselves for what we've talked about and recognizing that many of those hours won't be necessarily that productive as we go through. So you can begin to work out if you just apply an average direct labor cost per employee for that sort of numbers and average them through a quarter. You can see the sort of costs that we're talking about this being there. But I believe that, that's essential for us to be able to then achieve the yields, the incremental margins that we've talked about, which is really what this business is all about and the way we should think about it.\nNoah Poponak: So I should just think of it as your structural cost-out number you've spoken to, then obviously variable cost tethered to revenue, but that you're going to have some variable costs lead the revenue recovery as you anticipate it.\nJohn Plant: Exactly. So production works will be taken on. We're preparing, let's say, go to waxing and I say, prep the slurry tanks and then de-mothballing our casting machines and lines so that all of that occurs. So we can take the production on as we go into Q3 and Q4. Okay. Thank you very much. And I think that concludes today. But if I -- leave the operator to conclude it for us.\nOperator: We have no further questions in queue. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for your participation. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, PT. Good morning, and welcome to the call. Similar to last quarter, I will give an overview of Howmet's first quarter performance, then pass to Tolga, who will talk to our markets, and then Ken will provide further financial detail. I'll return to the call to talk to guidance for the second quarter and the full year 2021. Please move to Slide 4. Let me start with some commentary on the first quarter. Revenue was $1.2 billion and in line with expectations while EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share exceeded expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $275 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was a healthy 22.7%, similar to the fourth quarter of 2020. Earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.22, which was ahead of expectations and ahead of Q4 2020. Historically, Q1 has been a significant cash outflow for the company. However, with improved margins and enhanced working capital control, the outcome has noticeably improved. This will be followed by cash generation in quarters 2, 3 and 4. Lastly, in the first quarter, we focused on deleveraging, completing the early redemption of the 2021 notes at par for approximately $360 million of cash in -- using cash in hand. The resulting quarter end cash balance was $1.24 billion. Moreover, on May 3, we completed the early redemption of the $476 million of notes due in 2022 for approximately $500 million, inclusive of the accrued interest and fees. Both transactions were completed with cash on hand. Year-to-date, we have reduced debt by approximately $840 million, which reduces the 2021 interest expense by $38 million and $47 million on a run rate basis. In addition, in 2022, there will be a carryover interest savings of $10 million. Now let's move to markets and performance on Slide 5. Q1 revenue was the same as the Q2 to Q4 2020 average and in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, commercial aerospace was down 52%, driven by the lingering effects of customer inventory reductions and fundamentally lower builds, starting with the Boeing MAX. Commercial aerospace continues to represent 40% of the total revenue of the company, compared to pre-COVID levels of 60%. The commercial aerospace decline is partially offset by continued strength in our other markets. Defense aerospace was up 12% year-over-year, driven by the Joint Strike Fighter new builds and spares. The industrial gas turbine business continues to grow and was up 35% year-over-year, also driven by new builds and spares. Lastly, the commercial transportation business was up 15% year-over-year, despite customer supply chain constraints. Although truck demand is very strong, our customers managed through supply chain issues with several commodities, which are in short supply, including semiconductors, tires and glass, to name just a few. We are working closely with our customers to meet demand, which is showing some interruptions. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the progress on price, cost reduction and cash management. Price increases are up year-over-year and continue to be in line with expectations. Structural cost reductions are also in line with expectations, with a $61 million year-over-year benefit. Segment decremental margins continue to be good at 27%, driven by price, variable cost flexing and fixed cost management. CapEx was $55 million in the quarter and continues to be less than depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net source of cash. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 22.7% and consistent with Q4 2020 on approximately $30 million of less revenue. Q1 revenue of $1.2 billion was consistent with the Q4 -- Q2 to Q4 2020 average. You can see the benefit of our actions since the start of the pandemic with a 300 basis point EBITDA margin expansion while revenue was approximately $45 million less than the same period, so good year-on-year performance. Now let me turn it over to Tolga to give an overview of the markets. Thanks, Ken. Let me move to Slide 13 for the Q2 and annual guidance. First, the good news is that we're another quarter along towards the recovery of the commercial aerospace market. This will go a long way in helping profitability and complementing the growth and solidity at the defense aerospace, IGT and commercial transportation markets. There are a series of leading indicators that are showing very well for us: numbers of flight inquiries, bookings of flights, hotels and car rentals, and we also note the increase in U.S.A. TSA numbers, flight takeoffs, particularly in the U.S. and China. Europe remains somewhat muted given the effects of the pandemic and slower implementation of COVID vaccines. All of this should begin to help airlines with aircraft production, particularly of narrow-body aircraft. We note that the demand for wide-body aircraft probably may not reappear until mid-2022 or even into 2023. We see at the end of the second quarter as to be an inflection point to the beginnings of production increases for Howmet in the second half of the year, with the exact precise timing yet to be determined. We are planning to bring back from furlough or recruit several hundred workers during the next 2 quarters to train and retrain to be ready for this demand, just in the same effective way that we did in the third quarter of 2020 for the commercial wheels business. My expectation is that these costs plus cost of recommencing mothball plants and equipment will hold EBITDA margins at around the 22% level until further stabilization is reached. We also know that there is an effect on the commercial transportation market of part shortages, particularly semiconductors, which is reducing shifts and production work in the second quarter. As noted earlier today, the timing for cash generation has been a focus for us. And instead of the normal large Q1 outflow, which then has to be subsequently overcome, the first quarter was essentially breakeven and all subsequent quarters are expected to be cash generative. Specifically, the guidance for Q2: sales at $1.2 billion, plus or minus $30 million; EBITDA of $265 million, plus or minus $5 million; EBITDA margin of 22.1%, plus or minus 10 basis points; and earnings per share of $0.20, plus or minus $0.01. And for the year, sales of $5.1 billion, plus $100 million, minus $50 million; EBITDA line increases -- the EBITDA baseline increases by $50 million to $1.15 billion, with a range of plus $50 million to minus $25 million; EBITDA margin baseline has now increased to 22.5%, plus 60 basis points and minus 20 basis points in terms of a range. The earnings per share baseline increases to $0.95, a significant increase over prior guidance and with a range of plus $0.07 to minus $0.04. And the cash flow baseline increased to $425 million, plus or minus $30 million. Moving to the right-hand side of the slide. We noted that second half revenue is expected to be up 12% for the total company, driven by the increases in commercial aerospace, defense and IGT. Price increases to be greater than 2020. Cost reduction carryover of approximately $100 million, and pension and OPEB contributions of $160 million. We continue to evaluate the impacts of the American Rescue Plan Act upon pension contributions and we'll determine those later in the year. CapEx is expected to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million compared to depreciation and amortization of $270 million. And adjusted free cash flow conversion is about 100% of net income. We plan to reinstate the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock in the third quarter of 2021, pending the final Board approval. Now please move to Slide 14. To summarize, Q1 was a healthy start to the year, and liquidity of the company continues to be strong. The guidance provided is raised from that given in early February and reflects our first quarter profitability strength. The redemption of bonds for cash, the reinstitution of the dividend, all of which provide value to shareholders. More broadly, the focus is now turning to the beginning of the revenue recovery in the second half, commencing with commercial aerospace and the run rate of both revenues and margins as we exit 2021 and move into 2022, where we see the prospect of further leading indicator improvements. Thank you, and now we'll take your questions. Yes. So the way I think about it is in terms of sequence of the transition and with the end of the second quarter being the transition from basically the current holding part and recent results of the reduced demand and then the correction of the inventory to our customers. And already, we know that commercial transportation is going well, subject to those, I'll say, interruptions because of supply shortages. The big third comes in commercial aerospace, we believe, at the end of the second quarter. And I think that's going to be led by the engines business in terms of the first uptick in demand with -- and supported by structures, with fasteners probably still being a little bit behind that by another quarter or so. So my picture for the year is that commercial aerospace, I think, year-on-year, we're going to see that segment up 15% to 20% in the third quarter compared to second. Second quarter will be a reduced decrement compared to what we see the 52% currently. And then as that increase that we see as the turn occurs will be led by engine, supported by structures, with fasteners following maybe fourth quarter or even at the end of the year just as those inventories are absorbed then with what we think will be a fairly a significant snapback in the first part of 2022. So that gives the sequence that I expect both for the commercial aerospace markets and how it affects each of our segments through the next 3 quarters. Yes. I mean, we think that it's going to continue in line with Boeing's build rate, which is currently at 7, rising to 14 in the late summer and then into the, I think, 22 per month range as we start 2022 and then up to 30 a month. So it seems set well at the moment. We're still, as I said on the previous call, have been supplying effectively below the 7 rate per month in aggregate. Obviously, different levels go into different product lines. But we are expecting to see being in line with shipset values to equal production and then the lift of production as we go forward. So that's all built into what we think would be that 20% increase in commercial aero in the -- commencing in the third quarter. And also supported by the increase in production that in narrow-body for the A320 for Airbus as well. Yes. I think we are closer to the 120 level, so let's say, 25% below that number for the year is how we see it with, say, that inflection point coming -- a significant inflection point coming as we start Q3, for which, if we didn't have confidence, we would not be going through the recruitment and bringing back of people in the second quarter, starting the second quarter, and seeing significant employment increases during the next two quarters. Okay. We have already begun to receive order intake now from our customers, particularly on the engine side, with letters of commitments on the, I'll say, schedule releases and EDI transmission. So what we're seeing is all the things which have been stated appear to be materializing as we speak to. Even in the last week, we received letters from, let's say, Safran or CFM and meetings with GE Aviation, et cetera. So it's gone from what we think may happen to, I can say, a lot more confidence. And the question is one of just the final degree to be determined. So there's other stuff which has to be filled in, but an increasing level of confidence compared to 3 months ago. Yes. We operate with some of our customers on min-max systems. And so the averages take some time to re-average. So at the moment, as they -- we were re-averaging down on those min-max systems, it takes time for it to feed through. And then it will then snap back. It gained more significant to the upside. But with that to -- I'd say maybe a 2-quarter delay for that segment is what I see as the most likely scenario. So that's why I said I think that fasteners will be a quarter or 2 behind what we're seeing elsewhere. For the next few years, I don't see it significant either way because material inflation will essentially be passed through to our customers by the escalator agreements that we have. And therefore, we're talking more about what would be the impact of labor inflation. Labor -- for labor inflation, some significant parts of our businesses those are already set for the next, I'll say, 2 to 4 years depending upon the various labor agreements that we have in place. But obviously, some of the workforce, it's an annual event. And then it's up for us to gain the productivity that we seek to gain each year to offset that labor inflation. So I'm -- in an inflationary environment, I don't expect that to be a problem for us. And indeed, with customer agreements that we have and also some of that we see is, say, being taken care of with the -- within the bandwidth of the LTA negotiations that we've been undergoing. Yes. So we described the potential for capital allocation strategies in some detail on the last call. In fact, I think I called it smorgasbord of opportunity to do various things. What we considered is the first order of battle was to deal with the next couple of maturities of our bonds. We did that easily from cash on hand. And that obviously produces a lower interest burden for the company, lower gross debt. And therefore, it's also seen some improvement from the rating agencies. So that's been, I think, a good step for us. And now the next thing you have to address at some point, but not, I don't think, just now is the October 2024 at some point. So that's 3.5 years away in terms of bonds. So I'd say that part of the balance sheet is dealt with. We felt confident in the cash flows of the business to reinstate the dividend. That's an expression of our confidence and, again, part of our plan to return money to shareholders. And then the other 2 aspects that we have to consider is what about share repurchase and also to what degree, if anything, do we participate in any M&A activity, which may materialize over the next, say, year or so as the commercial aerospace market solidifies into, let's say, skylines and the confidence that we all can believe in. Clearly, that's beginning to happen given what I said about the inflection point that we see coming. And I guess, we're in that position, David, that you said, is that if all things work out as planned, is that we'll have a very significant cash balance at the end of the year and have the ability to make other decisions in capital deployment in the future. So I think it's always well in terms of, let's say, the whole capital allocation strategy that we set out for ourselves in the recent months. Well, you never do anyway, Carter. So I just like -- it's one of these like aspiration things, but yes, you go for the -- you go for the multiple 5-part question. Okay. When I look at the last couple of years in our aerospace business, I think one of the untold stories is the improvement in delivery performance and our quality levels where it's been reducing arrears, whether it's being parts per mining defects or even internal scrap in our manufacturing plants. And yields have clearly have definitely improved both for defense aerospace and commercial aerospace segments. And so it's all good. I really want to protect reputation and reliability with our customers and really seek to do that by bringing labor back and training it. So I think the things we did last year in the third quarter for our wheels business have paid off handsomely in terms of our ability to increase production with excellent quality and deliver these very significant incremental margins that we've seen in that wheels business. And so rather than, I think, stumble through this, we're trying to be ahead of it, being planful on labor and recognizing that there is a training time or retraining for people to be able to deliver the yields that we currently have and hopefully continue to improve them. So that's why I want to plan carefully through the next couple of quarters because we are talking a very significant increase in labor. Obviously, we'll be tailoring it to and then trimming it exactly as we see to go through it. But I really want to be ahead of this thing and not chasing it and having yield issues and arrears build and all the consequences that, that puts upon the business. So if it cost us, let's say, a couple of -- 200, 300 basis points or whatever margin for a quarter or so, I think that's money really well spent because it's going to be what's the margin as we exit this year and how do we perform into 2022. So really trying to be planful about the next phase of our business and not just react to it after the event and that you seem to be scrambling. So that's all part of the value we bring to, I think, to the industry and to our customers. Yes. The way I see it at the moment is everybody is aware there's plenty of metal in the system, and that gives people, I'll say, the ability to drop in a little bit later than would have been normal. If you looked at the demand levels of 2019 where lead times were, let's say, to get metal for some of our products was over 12 months. So we need to recognize the situation we're all in with carrying some trapped inventory. And we still have trapped inventory, which we plan to liquidate during the balance of 2021. And it's really interesting. Because when we look at our inventory levels as we move through the year, one of recent discussions in our quarterly review has been to what degree do we hold on to some of those in the latter part of the year just so again we're in a really strong position as we enter 2022 with what we think will be a fairly strong year for us in terms of demand. So where we find ourselves at the moment is our customers know that there's metal in the system, we know there's trapped inventory. And so we're more on that 3 to 6 months of lead times. And people have been holding off, and we've been seeing that fill in very significantly in the last few weeks. And then obviously, it's like everything is going to depend. But I do see, if we look at 6 months from now, then those lead times are going to be significantly increased. And therefore, orders are going to have to be placed. Otherwise, with some of the production increases on narrow-bodies, in particular, that Airbus and Boeing are looking at for 2022 and certainly later in 2022, I mean they won't occur unless orders are placed because the availability of that inventory and the current excess of metals has just been in the system for the last year just won't be there. No, we've seen no changes on Airbus. It's been solid. Solid all the way through, meeting what they've said, reinforcing what they've said, issuing both skyline and production schedules. So no changes for Airbus at all. And in fact, in the more recent past, we have not seen changes from Boeing either, which in last years have tend to be towards the downside. Again, none of that's been occurring. I think there -- obviously, we also have a different profile to our engine business, to our structures business. So it's got to be segment by segment. But essentially, I am on record having said that we expect fairly strong incrementals as we go forward. Because in the way that we managed through this crisis, you can see that, compared to our normal decrementals of, let's call it, 40%, we've been getting those into the 20s and have been quite pleased with both the way we've managed our structural cost takeouts and the variable costs. And it's our job not to allow those more fixed cost to creep back into the system. And they also, indeed, try to be sticky on those variable costs as we go back up the production volume curve. So we are expecting healthy incremental margins. And part of it is also getting that labor in place at the right time and trained and ready, as I tried to describe on a couple of questions ago. So we don't stumble our way through this. It's planfully set out and accepting it as if it cost us 200 or 300 basis points of margin -- not being 200 but 20 or 30 basis points of margin. So I think I just can't get to like just over 22% for the second quarter just to take out of -- I'd rather bring the labor in and then look forward to those healthy incrementals going forward. Yes, it is. So Q2 of 2020, our customers were not rapid to change some of the production requirements, and that became more of featured in the third quarter, as you know, from last year. So when we look at Q2 this year, because some of the schedules have not been reduced that significantly, although they were reduced and you say plants were closed down, it's a very, I'll call, turbulent quarter to comp against. And so the way I look at it is more, let's say, on a sequential basis, where I'm thinking that, well, commercial aero was down 52%, it's going to be down a lot less than that in terms of build comparisons. And then the only other muting effect I'm thinking about at the moment is we are careful in terms of the commercial truck build plans of our customers, just because of those part shortages. So we are seeing shifts go down and customers take weeks out in the second quarter. And that's part of what we are guiding to as well, including that in our numbers as best as we can estimate it at this point in time. So it's a fairly, I must say, careful assumption around the commercial transportation business for the second quarter. At the same time, I would say to you now the flip side of that is that order intake for us pretty much globally has been very healthy. And you've seen class 8 truck and trailer orders at levels now, which essentially secure the backlog for the balance of 2021 and most of the way through 2022 at the moment. And so -- whereas before, we were thinking we had a fairly good trajectory, but it wasn't filled in totally. Now you see that demand so strong. So for example, if you wanted to buy a new trailer to go with your truck at the moment, if you ordered it today, you wouldn't be thinking about taking delivery for 12 months. So you're looking out into the second quarter of 2022. Now that's how long lead times are in the commercial transportation industry. So that's really very healthy for us and really puts a very solid platform on 2022 and never mind the balance of this year. So I just want to give you the full picture around that. And so if we're cautious on, I'll call, supply-based interruptions the truck build in the very short term, given the strength of the economy, what we see by way of transportation and shipping of things, it's producing a very solid picture for backlog for the next, let's say, 18 months. Basically, we are still having inventory taken out in the second quarter. And then we think, and it's like it's the best judgment that basically that just essentially stops and so at the end of the second quarter. So we begin to see our structures business in the second half where we're planning for increased production. We're seeing it clearly. I've already mentioned the engine-based business and the only business which is going to lag for, again, a couple of quarters behind that is going to be our fastener business where I think we're going to be close on, balanced all inventories up by the -- maybe by the end of the third quarter, could stray into Q4. But that's how we see it at the moment. So different flavors for those different segments according to basically lead times and trying to get ahead of it. Because I think one thing our customers don't want to have is some of the supply constraints, particularly around engine parts, which are really long lead-time items ultimately. They're on the same constraints as we saw a couple of years ago. Certainly, you're right in terms of basic structures on our fastener business because of the composite content of wide-body aircraft. So if you're thinking Airbus A350s as an example or Boeing 787s and with those composite structures more titanium, whole different suite of fasteners, then you can see that impact in the way we've laid out our revenue expectations with then, as we said, I'll say, an improving situation somewhat behind the engine business. If you look at the traditional split going back to -- you got to have to go back to 2019 because it's been moving around. And I'm just trying to keep all of these numbers in my head, but it's like a 60-40 narrow -- maybe 55-45 narrow to wide-body split. That has shifted the same as Boeing and Airbus has shifted over the last 12 months. So to give you a picture on that, I think, traditionally, Boeing would have been 60, Airbus 40, split the other way, and they could rebalance again in 2021, to some degree, as the MAX gets back up and going. For engines, I actually don't keep the numbers in my head in terms of what the exact split is. Certainly, in terms of what we see over the next 12, 18 months is that the narrow-body engines, so think LEAP-1A, LEAP-1B and then obviously, some of the aftermarket service business coming back, particularly for the CFM engines. So what we see begin to fill in the back end of the year to 2022. But I think that's best I can do at this point. I can't exactly remember the split between wide and narrow for engine and maybe we haven't given it. For the gross industrial markets, we haven't called that out. But just to me just give you a picture on that, the way we see us going through IGT part of that business is strong and getting stronger, in fact. And so at the moment, we could sell everything we could make. And so again, we're working on raising production for that. So that's, I'll say, fairly exciting. Oil and gas has been really very muted for the last year and the first half of this year. But we -- our thought process is that maybe in the fourth quarter or certainly by the first quarter of next year, we think in the oil and gas begins to show an improvement for us. We see Texas crude now at $66, plus or minus, and natural gas has moved up. And rig count has moved up significantly for the Gulf. And so all that's talking well to us in terms of the demand partners we work through inventories in oil and gas. And then in general, industrial is also strengthening, as we see through the balance of 2021, again, in the second half. So basically, snapshot is IGT is strong. Oil and gas, another quarter or two of weakness, followed by some strength, and then general industrial progressively getting better as well. I think we're going to see a fairly steady pattern throughout the year. Most of our agreements have now been -- in fact, I think all of our agreements have been renewed in terms of LTA for '21. We don't expect much by way of spot business, unless something occurs in the back end of the year where a demand is mismatched to previous schedule. So I mean that's the picture there. And I guess, we'll be giving enhanced detail in our 10-Q, which we plan to issue later today. But basically, everything is in order in that side compared to previous statements. Okay. So benefits in the second half essentially is OE. There will be some modest improvement, I think, in commercial aero, but fairly modest. If you -- to give you a picture, if you go back, 2019 as the reference point, $800 million of spares, which essentially is engine, plus -- on top of that, fasteners and structure business. It was $400 million of defense and industrial that grew, let's say, let's call it, 20% over the last year or so. So healthy growth there. But for the most part, the spares or parts we sell through to the MRO shops through our customers just dropped off a cliff in the second half of last year. So basically, you see limited demand, but still a demand like commercial business jet and some very modest levels of spares business. And that picture through that is first half of this year is pretty much the same as the back half of last year. So compared to $100 million a quarter, I think, more like $20 million a quarter. It can be below that, could be just above it, just depends on the quarter. It's just bouncing around with small numbers. In the second half of this year, I think we're expecting a modest lift, but not planning for anything significant in that spares business in the second half at this point, but let's say a little bit higher than that. That's clear compared to the $20 million a quarter, thinking more like that $25 million to $30 million a quarter. It doesn't move the needle for us at this point in time. I think it will in '22. So all the guidance I've given you is essentially balance in the commercial aerospace part of our business is coming off the OE demand. Noah, you're back. That's way to get more than one question in. Well, I don't know if I can give you any more comfort. I think I wasn't sticking around when the last cycle really occurred, so I don't know. We've done a lot of efforts in our business to try to grow it, not just in OE demand, but also through distribution. And at the moment, I think it's good and clear that we've called it out, being probably a couple of quarters behind where we think some of the other parts of our commercial aerospace business are beginning to respond. And so I think that's a fairly thought-through and quality view of the market at this point. I recognize that we do have extended change. So for example, part of our -- if you could just take the North American business, and so I'll just confine my comments to that. Yes, we'll supply directly to Boeing. So that's part of the demand. But we also supply into -- in Spirit. And therefore, it's another step in the supply chain. And what we're clear at is that we've been supplying at the low rate for some time. We're not trying to be optimistic in saying we're going to see that recover in the Q3 or Q4. We've been saying it's a couple of quarters behind and do think that it will begin to recover or will maybe even -- maybe it's the bullwhip comment that Gautam used or is it snapback. I think we're going to see significant demand increases for our fastener business in 2022. That's the best I can guide you at this point in time without the perfect visibility that, I guess, we'd all like, but we don't have. Well, it's -- of course, it's -- the cost-out number is essentially more of a structural cost takeout rather than the variable cost side. The cost -- the employment that I'm talking about bringing into the business is essentially in our variable cost structure. So you need to understand it's completely different parts of bucketing in the P&L. And I just consider like direct labor reflect in accordance with the production requirements. To give you a picture for second quarter, then we're thinking of, let's say, around 400 people, could be 500 people, to bring into the business in -- during April, May and June to prepare ourselves for what we've talked about and recognizing that many of those hours won't be necessarily that productive as we go through. So you can begin to work out if you just apply an average direct labor cost per employee for that sort of numbers and average them through a quarter. You can see the sort of costs that we're talking about this being there. But I believe that, that's essential for us to be able to then achieve the yields, the incremental margins that we've talked about, which is really what this business is all about and the way we should think about it. Exactly. So production works will be taken on. We're preparing, let's say, go to waxing and I say, prep the slurry tanks and then de-mothballing our casting machines and lines so that all of that occurs. So we can take the production on as we go into Q3 and Q4. Okay. Thank you very much. And I think that concludes today. But if I -- leave the operator to conclude it for us."

Q1 revenue was down 26%, driven by commercial aerospace, which continues to represent approximately 40% of total revenue in the quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 52% year-over-year, in line with our projections, as we continue to see customer inventory corrections as expected. Defense aerospace continues to grow and was up 12% in Q1 as we are on a diverse set of programs, with the Joint Strike Fighter being approximately 40% of the total defense business. Commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segments, was up 15% year-over-year with a very strong market demand. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which consists of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial, was up 1%. IGT, which makes up approximately 45% of this market, continues to be strong and was up a healthy 35% year-over-year. I will now turn it over to Ken to give a more detailed view of the financials."

            "name": "Kenneth Giacobbe",
            "content": "Thank you, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. Now let's move to Slide 8 for the segment results. As expected, Engine Products year-over-year revenue was down 32% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 55%, driven by customer inventory corrections and reduced demand for spares. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a year-over-year increase of 18% in defense aerospace and a 35% increase in IGT. IGT continues to be strong, and we will continue to make investments in this business as demand has been increasing for cleaner energy. Decremental margins for engines were 26% for the quarter as segment operating profit margin was approximately 19%. In the appendix of the presentation, we have provided a schedule which shows each segment's decremental margins for Q3 2020 through Q1 2021. Now let's move to Fastening Systems on Slide 9. Also as expected, Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was down 29% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 42%. Like the engine segment, we continue to experience inventory corrections in the commercial aerospace market. The industrial and commercial transportation markets were down 2% year-over-year, but up 19% sequentially. Decremental margins for Fastening Systems were 45% for the first quarter as furloughed workers returned to work. Please move to Slide 10 to review Engineered Structures. For Engineered Structures, year-over-year revenue was down 36% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was down 57%, driven by customer inventory corrections and production declines for the 787 and 737 MAX. Commercial aerospace was partially offset by a 10% year-over-year increase in defense aerospace. Decremental margins for Engineered Structures were 18% for the quarter, compared to 24% in Q4. Lastly, please move to Slide 11 for Forged Wheels. Forged Wheels revenue increased 19% year-over-year despite customer supply chain constraints. Forged Wheels revenue grew faster than the overall market, in part due to Howmet's new innovative 39-pound wheel. Segment operating profit margin was another record at almost 31% as year-over-year incremental margins were 56%. The improved margin was driven by continued cost management and maximizing production in low-cost countries. Please move to Slide 12. We continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. First, we completed 2 early redemptions of our bonds. The first transaction was on January 15. We used cash on hand to complete the early redemption at par of the 2021 bonds due in April 2021. By paying down the bonds 3 months early at no additional cost, we saved $5 million of interest. The second transaction was earlier this week on May 3. We used cash on hand to complete the early redemption of the bonds that are due in February 2022. The bonds were redeemed at a cost of approximately $500 million. As a result, the interest costs have been reduced by approximately $47 million year-over-year. Moreover, as John has mentioned, in 2022, we'll get an incremental $10 million of carryover interest savings. Gross debt stands at $4.2 billion. All debt is unsecured, and the next maturity is in 2024. Finally, our $1 billion revolver remains undrawn. Before I turn it back to John to discuss the 2021 guidance, I would point out that there's a slide in the appendix that covers special items in the quarter. Special items for the quarter were a charge for approximately $16 million after tax, and the charge was primarily related to 3 items: first, we had fire costs at 2 of our plants of $7 million; second, we had an impairment of assets associated with an agreement to sell a small manufacturing business in France of $4 million; and third, we had a pension settlement charge in the U.S. of $3 million. Finally, we continue to work on reducing legacy liabilities and improving asset returns for the pension plan. I would highlight 2 significant items: first, we had announced a planned administration change of certain prescription drug benefits that is expected to reduce cost and reduce our OPEB liability by approximately 20% or $39 million; second, we are benefiting from pension asset investment returns of over 13% that we realized in 2020. The combination of the asset returns and the liability reduction have decreased annual pension and OPEB expense by 37% or $13 million annually. So now let me turn it back over to John."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, sir.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace fourth quarter and full year 2022 results conference call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In today's presentation, references to EBITDA and EPS mean adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items and adjusted EPS excluding special items. These measures are among the non-GAAP financial measures that we've included in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, P.T., and welcome, everybody, to the Howmet Q4 earnings call. Let's start by dealing with the headline numbers on slide four. For the fourth quarter, revenue accelerated as we exited the year, and it was above the high end of the guide at $1.51 billion, up 18% year-on-year. Commercial aerospace continues to be strong and was up 29% in the quarter. EBITDA was $336 million, at the high end of the guide. Revenue and EBITDA continued to improve sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter. The strong operating EBITDA was mitigated by a couple of below-the-line items that Ken will cover in his commentary. Earnings per share was at guidance at $0.38, which benefited from the strong EBITDA and the Q4 tax rate, which mitigated the below-the-line items. For the year, despite the choppy backlog, year-over-year revenue was up 14% and EBITDA was up 12%, which drove a healthy earnings per share growth of 39%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow was within the guided range of $540 million and as commented on the previous earnings call, included an inventory build for commercial aerospace to help smooth production adds as we move between years. Despite the inventory build, free cash flow conversion continues to be strong at 91%. Liquidity is healthy, with year-end cash balance on hand of $792 million and this was after share buybacks, bond repurchases and dividends. In the quarter, an additional $65 million of common stock was repurchased and the full year repurchase of common stock was $400 million. The December 2022 fully diluted share count exit rate was 418 million shares, which is an improvement of approximately 80 million shares since the start of 2019. This was accomplished while reducing net debt over the last four years as well. There was also some minor repurchases of bonds in Q4, taking the full year repurchases to $69 million. The bond repurchase program continued into the first quarter of 2023. And by the end of January, an additional $26 million of bonds were repurchased at a small discount to par. This continues our plan of reducing interest costs year-on-year. And going into 2023, it will be lower than 2022. And this is despites the global rising interest rate costs. Hence, we set ourselves up for a fundamentally different approach to most companies where interest costs will be lower for the coming year.  We've improved Howmet's leverage ratio, which now stands at 2.6 times net debt to EBITDA compared to our long-term target of just under two turns. All of Howmet's debt is unsecured and at fixed rates. Howmet's $1.1 billion revolver is undrawn. At the top level, we were pleased with the year. We exceeded the initial EPS guide for the year again. And in the case of 2022, we faced an extremely choppy backlog of below build expectations of both aircraft and engines compared to initial expectations. Furthermore, the extraordinary uptick inflation overcome despite its margin impact and all of this talks to the performance and resiliency of Howmet. Ken will now detail the 2022 performance, and then I'll cover the outlook after that.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Please move to slide 5 for an overview of the markets. Revenue was up 18% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and up 14% for the full year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued throughout 2022, with fourth quarter commercial aerospace revenue up 29% year-over-year and up 28% for the full year, driven by engine products, engineered structures and the narrow-body recovery. Commercial aerospace has grown for seven consecutive quarters and stands at 48% of total revenue, but continues to be short of the pre-COVID level, which was 60% of total revenue. Defense Aerospace was up 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by year end seasonality and down 3% for the full year, driven by customer inventory corrections for the F-35. Commercial transportation, which impacts forged wheels and fastening systems, was up 12% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 14% for the full year, driven by higher aluminum prices and higher volumes, partially offset by foreign currency. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial, was essentially flat for the fourth quarter and for the year. For the fourth quarter, within the industrial and other markets, oil and gas was up 22%, IGT was up 2% and general industrial was down 10% on a year-over-year basis. Now let's move to slide 6. We will start with the P&L with a focus on enhanced profitability. For the fourth quarter, we had six consecutive quarters of growth in revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share. Revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share exceeded or were in line with guidance. For the full year, revenue was up 9% year-over-year excluding material pass-through of approximately $225 million. EBITDA was $1.28 billion or up 12% year-over-year. Adjusting for the year-over-year material pass-through, EBITDA margin was 23.5%, and flow-through of incremental revenue to EBITDA was strong at approximately 30%. The full year operating tax rate was 22.5%, an improvement of 250 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share was $1.40 for the year and up 39% year-over-year. The average diluted share count improved to a Q4 exit rate of 418 million shares. As John mentioned, the strong operating EBITDA and favorable tax rate in the fourth quarter were mitigated by a few items below the line. The impact of foreign currency and deferred comp was $9 million pretax charge, as these items fluctuate based on market conditions. For the year, the impact of foreign currency was essentially breakeven and deferred comp was favorable. Final note on earnings. As expected, we did not have significant net headcount additions in the fourth quarter. However, we hired approximately 1,000 new employees to offset Q4 attrition and absorbed incremental training and production costs. Moving to the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the year was a record $540 million, including an inventory build of approximately $235 million, primarily for the commercial aerospace recovery. For 2022, as well as in every year since separation, we achieved free cash flow conversion of net income in excess of our long-term target of 90%. Year-end cash balance was a healthy $792 million after approximately $513 million of capital allocation to common stock repurchases, 2024 bond repurchases and the quarterly dividends. Year-over-year net pension and OPEB liabilities were reduced by approximately $180 million, and cash contributions were reduced by approximately 50% or $56 million. Since 2019, net pension and OPEB liabilities have been reduced by approximately $470 million and gross pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $1.4 billion. Net pension and OPEB liabilities now stand at less than 5% of Howmet's market capitalization. Finally, net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 2.6 times, all bond debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of interest rate expense in the future. Our next bond maturity is in October of 2024, and the $1 billion revolver is undrawn. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. Capital expenditures were $193 million for the year and were approximately 75% of depreciation. Capital installed prior to COVID-19 puts us in a very strong position to support the expected commercial aerospace growth. Fourth quarter was the seventh consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. For the year, we repurchased approximately 11.4 million shares of common stock for $400 million with an average acquisition price of $35.22 per share. Share buyback authority stands at $947 million. Moving to debt. We repurchased $69 million of our 2024 bonds last year with cash on hand. These repurchases will lower our annualized interest costs by approximately $4 million. Moreover, we continue to repurchase 2024 bonds in January, with another $26 million of repurchases at a slight discount to par. Repurchases were made with cash on hand. Lastly, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, the quarterly common stock dividend was doubled to $0.04 per share, dividends in 2022 were $44 million, and we expect to increase to approximately $68 million in 2023. Let's move to slide 7 now to cover the segment results. Q4 was another solid quarter for engine products. Year-over-year revenue was 21% higher in the fourth quarter with commercial aerospace up 30%, driven by the narrow-body recovery. Defense Aerospace was up 17%, IGT was up 2%, and oil and gas was up 19%. EBITDA increased 26% year-over-year and margin improved 110 basis points to 26.1% despite the addition of new employees and the associated near-term training and production costs. Let's move to slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 11% higher in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace was 17% higher, driven by the narrow-body recovery. Defense Aerospace was up 21% and Industrial was down 13%. Year-over-year segment EBITDA decreased 3% due to the addition of new employees and the near-term training and production costs. In the fourth quarter, Fasteners added approximately 200 new hires to offset 200 exits. Now let's move to slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was up 21% in the fourth quarter, with commercial aerospace up 40%, driven by the narrow-body recovery was approximately $20 million of Russian titanium share gain. Gains were partially offset by the impact of production declines for the Boeing 787. Segment EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year despite the inventory burn down of the F-35, and the continued zero to low build of the Boeing 787. Structures 2022 full year EBITDA margin was 14.1%, and was on par with 2019 levels when revenue was 37% higher. Finally, let's move to slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 14% higher in the fourth quarter. The $32 million increase in revenue year-over-year was almost entirely driven by higher aluminum prices. Commercial transportation demand remained strong, but volumes continue to be impacted by customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production. Segment EBITDA was flat year-over-year as higher volumes were offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, and primarily driven by the euro. While the pass-through of higher aluminum prices did not impact EBITDA dollars, it did impact margin by approximately 300 basis points. Lastly, in the appendix on slide 15, we've included some assumptions around 2023. We expect non-service pension and OPEB expense to increase approximately $20 million year-over-year to approximately $40 million. The increase will unfavorably impact year-over-year earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per share and is mainly due to low asset returns impacting non-service costs, which are non-cash. In addition to the increase in pension expense of $20 million, we continue to expect miscellaneous other expenses, which are below the line be minimal at approximately $8 million for the year, but can be volatile within quarters. Pension and OPEB cash contributions are expected to be flat with 2022 and approximately $56 million for the year. CapEx should be in the range of $230 million to $260 million, which continues to be less in depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net source of cash. Now let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken. Let's look at Commercial Aerospace first, which was up 28% this year. Airlines are experiencing strong growth for both domestic travel and now for international travel as well. Load factors are high in the US and Europe. China is now reopened and is increasing load factors at a rapid rate. This builds momentum on top of the increased Asia Pacific travel already seen. Backlogs of aircraft demand at Boeing and Airbus are at all-time highs for narrow-body aircraft. Wide-body demand is increasing rapidly, and further rate increases are expected. Airlines are bringing A380s back into service to meet international demand. This is clearly an inferior solution to having modern composite-based twin engine 787s or Airbus A350s with their vastly better fuel efficiency and lower carbon footprint. The demand for improved emissions alone secures the increased build, never mind the huge demand for travel. While noting very favorable air travel demand conditions, Howmet does rely upon aircraft builds by Boeing and Airbus, while also considering that we'll see rate increases for spares. Here, we're going to take a cautious and conservative view of 2023 until we know more and see consistent aircraft build rate increases. For example, underpinning the full year 2023 guidance, our assumed monthly build rates are approximately 30 per month for the Boeing 737 MAX, 53 to 54 for Airbus A320, A321. Additionally, we have assumed approximately 30 Boeing 787 builds for the year and 65 to 70 Airbus A350 build for the year. Within these outline numbers, we expect to see strength improving in the second half. These build assumptions underpin our assumed 17% Commercial Aerospace growth for the year. Now let me turn to other markets before commenting on inflation. In Defense, we expect to see low-single-digit increases in 2023 with less overhang to the F-35 structures inventory. Demand for the F-35 is strong and high builds are now expected throughout the remainder of the decade. This is further supported by both increased engine spares demand and upgrades of engines associated with the 2028 Block 4 requirements. Our business supports helicopters, drones and aerospace, which is a very healthy increase in revenue for us for these space-related programs. And at this increasing pace, I expect it will provide a lot more commentary on the space segment in the future. Gas turbine revenues are expected to grow at single-digit growth, supported by an increase for the Agent class turbines. I believe that everyone is aware of our very balanced IGT business, which supports GE Power, Siemens Power and also Mitsubishi Heavy, which is another global business for Howmet. Oil and gas should remain strong at high single-digit growth or maybe low double-digit growth. General industrial is expected to be down in, say, low single-digits. Finally, we take a more cautious view of commercial transportation in our wheel segment, where the expectation is for reduced demand in the second half of 2023, notably in Europe. In aggregate, fundamental demand might be down 0.5 million wheels before the improvement of 250,000 wheels driven by penetration of aluminum wheels versus steel wheels and share improvement. Sector growth continues in wheels, which will accelerate with future electrification of the truck sector, especially in Europe. Turning to material and inflationary costs. These remain volatile. We expect the combination of material, inflationary costs to be in the range of $70 million to $100 million for the year. As we did in 2022, our intent is to pass-through the majority of the inflationary costs. Let's turn to some specific numbers now for the first quarter of the year. Revenue, we see at $1.5 billion, plus or minus $25 million, EBITDA of $335 million, plus or minus $10 million, EPS of $0.37, plus or minus $0.02. For the year, revenue of $6.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million, EBITDA of $1.375 billion, plus or minus $40 million and EPS of $1.60, plus or minus $0.07. Earnings per share assumes continued capital allocation to common stock and bond repurchases, dependent upon market conditions. Our free cash flow guide is $615 million, plus or minus $35 million. We set our year up with appropriate caution given recent aircraft build volatility, while at the same time, noting fundamental -- fundamentally strong demand which will see further increases as we plan our pathway through into 2024 and 2025. Now let's turn to a summary. 2022 was another strong year for Howmet. Revenue increased by 14%, EBITDA by $140 million and 12%. Margins were above 22%, despite the extraordinary inflationary conditions. The effective tax rate improved to 22.5%, which is an improvement of 500 basis points from 2020. Earnings per share increased to $1.40 and by 39%. Free cash flow increased to $540 million, despite the inventory build of approximately $235 million for Commercial Aerospace. $513 million of capital was deployed back to share buybacks, bond repurchases and dividends and the dividends were as you know, doubled. Liquidity is very strong. We have cash on hand of $792 million and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. Leverage improved from 3.1 times net debt-to-EBITDA to 2.6 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Compared to our initial 2022 guide, we overcame a really good amount of headwinds. We exceeded initial EPS guidance of $1.37 while navigating unstable aircraft builds. $225 million of material pass-through costs and above the initial estimate of $125 million, rapid non-metal inflation and new employee costs. All the while, we strengthened our balance sheet, generated $540 million of free cash flow and deployed over $500 million to repurchases of bonds, dividends, et cetera. 2023 is expected to have strong growth and free cash flow generation. Since we expect similar challenges in 2022, we've taken a cautious conservative view until we have greater visibility regarding actual aircraft build rates. We look forward to above-trend growth in 2023, 2024 and 2025, and that will be reflected in additional profits and cash coming from the business. Thank you very much, and now let's move to your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question here will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: John, a question for you on these OEM build rates. There's obviously been quite a lot of talk about Airbus potentially elongating the ramp on the A320. I was wondering from your perspective, could this actually be a help in that it reduces risk, I mean you don't have to add as much cost or labor as quickly as you would do normally and then ultimately, you could get better margins in that scenario?\nJohn Plant: I think when you look back over the last few quarters, when we've had steadier build increases, drop-through has been significantly higher compared to those quarters where we've seen, I'll say, urgent or rapid demand changes and also where we've been asked by customers to chop and change on production schedules to meet maybe availability of parts they have rather than a positive scheduled. And so you can see, I think, in our third quarter, drop-throughs were probably in the high 30s, maybe 39%. And you saw the -- if you look at the tracker revenue changes in those quarters compared to the revenue changes in the higher quarters, then I think in the fourth quarter, it was -- I can't know exactly number let's call it in the -- below 30%. So I think steady as you go does help us. At the same time, because of the base of employment that we have has been growing, then the increments -- or incremental each step of the demand gets that much easier to accommodate compared to what we saw was, I think, extreme volatility in 2022. And I mean, in one sense, I'd like to expand the question a lot more broadly and talk about that volatility, but I don't want to miss the point of your question, but essentially, I think steady plan for rate increases are really helpful to us. And that's when we convert best, albeit we're setting ourselves up to do that and hopefully take also advantage of additional demand should it come towards us.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, John, I just want to follow-up on Rob's question on production rates here. I mean, when we look at where the other supply chains are \u2013 is in production rates, you've got periods gearing towards 42 per month by year-end. I mean, Boeing reiterated their outlook of 50 per month for 2025 plus 2026. We saw, obviously, Monster Air, India order today. So why do you see so much volatility? I mean, historically, the engine supply chain needs to ramp up before the airframers. And so what am I missing? I would have thought that you guys would get more of a priority and you would get the orders in now in order to support 50 per month.\nJohn Plant: Yes. I got to try to separate my comments between that which Howmet controls and that which is -- I mean, therefore outside of our control. And when I look at last year, we started the year full of optimism and thought the 2022 was going to be really easy. And it didn't quite turn out that way with lower fundamental volumes, which were masked by inflation recoveries. Inflation itself within the demand we had significant volatility in schedules from our customers. And as you know, when I spoke to you in the fall, we've seen cutbacks for engine business at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And we ended up carrying probably $70 million to $100 million of additional inventory, which we had not planned or expected for because customers did not need those parts. And so if you go back again in the middle of the year last year, we were talking with Boeing about rate 38 such numbers. And we're really giving ourselves up to be able to address all of that. Also, I'll say, schedules of engine requirements, et cetera, et cetera, that would make made bills, even though 38 did not materialize. Even though as you mentioned now we're hearing, as I noted from the spirit caller that you referred to, I think it's 38 in the summer and 42 in October. I mean, as such is great, and we'd love it. And there's nothing which would give us more, I will say, pleasure and benefits than things that rates. But we also noted that during the fourth quarter that -- the third quarter and fourth quarter is that the actual numbers of aircraft sold, for example, by Boing was stated to be, let's say, back and by the time you took out claims from inventory, build rates were actually more or like in the 20s. And then we interpretably stated that it maybe it was higher to the high 20s in the fourth quarter, albeit you're never sure how many were just being finished off, et cetera. So, what was the level of actual build? We don't know. And so when we look at this year, I start off with saying, let me think about guidance. And guidance for us is something which we take very seriously. It's a base from which I think shareholders can realize -- it's a number that can be relied upon. So, if you look at 2019 where we're comfortably exceeded it 2020 our COVID year 2021, we blew passed it. In 2022, despite extraordinary difficult conditions, we achieved and exceeded that guidance that we gave at the start of the year. And so this is not like a wet paper tissue waving in the air. This is something we take very seriously. And the -- and so what can we rely upon and we felt as though those numbers, which I know are cautious. I know that they're below what many other people have and calling out 30 for a 737 or 53, 54 for an A320, those maybe seem to be low. And if you take 30 for a 787, that might also deem to be extremely low compared to what may be the outcome even though we know that very few were built in the in the fourth quarter. But if you take it as this is something that helps us plan the baseline of our business, sets our cost structures up properly. And should those sort of numbers that you mentioned materialize? Then just let's imagine what that might be. And what that might be? Might be, I don't know, 100, 200, probably more like a couple of -- towards a couple of hundred million more revenue. And if you take then the incremental drop-through for that, then you would be saying, while those incrementals look great, the margin rate should be above 23% because we've set our cost structure appropriately. And obviously, then things would begin to look progressively brighter during the course of the year, but that's not what we know. That's what we hope for. And so we set ourselves up with a guy which gives us a sense of security. If things turn actually better, we'll welcome it. I think you could rely upon Howmet to manufacture well the operationally in control and convert at a good rate. And so that's how we thought about it. And I don't want to be hostage to giving a guidance, which could be, obviously, have a much more optimistic on it and then find myself being worried every month what did they really build, et cetera, et cetera. And then put ourselves hostage to not only aircraft build rates of actual production, but also the rest of the supply base if we will match to the weakest link in the supply chain. And because I don't know where every one of those weak links are, I choose to take something which is fundamentally good, improving, significantly increasing, solid. If it turns out to be better, that will be great for us. I hope that gives you the context, Kristine?\nKristine Liwag : That's great color, John. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. John, a quick clarification. Really appreciate the conservative look at the guidance. I'm sure there was frustration through most of 2022. I'm just curious, does the guidance line up with your operations? And then also just maybe a comment on the responsiveness of your operations if things started to go better, how responsive can you be to some of the upside rates that are out there for going out of 2023 into 2024?\nJohn Plant: Yes. So obviously, because of the amount of people recruited last year, we are set up pretty well for the first quarter to be able to produce at this level or above. Should it reach those heavy rates of 38 and 42 as an example, or if Airbus are in the 57, 58? Provided we know that they're heading that way, and we've got about six months lead time, we'll be in good shape to meet it. We've been particularly good at being able to recruit labor to meet our needs. I'll recognize that sometimes the stability of that labor hasn't been everything we'd wanted, but getting the headline numbers has been something which we've been very comfortable with. We've put increased disciplines around our own recruitment process to make sure we have a higher level of retention, improved training routine, et cetera. So I think we're doing all the right things in the same way as we set ourselves up for the initial aerospace ramp to be in a good condition. And so fundamentally, I believe that we'll be able to respond to meet those customer demands. Clearly -- for example, if Airbus got a hit rate 65 for A320s in mid-2024s that's still the current number. Then, again, knowing it sooner rather than later is highly beneficial to us and also the commensurate engine rate builds from our customers. I think you saw last quarter my commentary that, we were able to produce at a fundamentally higher rate only to get cut back, because the other parts of the supply chain were there. So I feel reasonably confident, Myles, in there to do that.\nMyles Walton: Thanks a lot. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much and good morning, everyone.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: John, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the profitability in engine products, and we saw kind of in the first half kind of mid-27% type of margin and then, it's come down in the second half and kind of makes sense that new hires would weigh on the profitability there. But, I guess, when we think about what's the level setting on the right margin for this business, I think there was a thought that maybe the 27% we saw in the first half was a good margin and then with growth, you'd see incrementals above that, and there'd be some expansion. But, I guess, from a long-term perspective, how should we think about where that shakes out?\nJohn Plant: Okay. Well, first of all, let me comment on profitability in the second half. That was, I'll say, fundamentally impacted by the fact we -- as it turned out, well, we thought we'd recruited to the right outline demand. As you know, because of those cutbacks, not only did we not produce as much, but some of what we did produce inventory, we eventually therefore, we didn't make the profit on it. The worst condition we were in is that, in actual fact, even though across Howmet, labor was pretty flat in the fourth quarter. So we -- let's say, net we didn't hire back where we were slightly down on labor. But in our engine products, we were down significantly. So more than 100 people down as -- which is most unusual to think about, we were cutting labor, given the underlying engine demand and basically because we were holding costs, which we did not need to be able to produce what we required. So we were in that pretty lethal band of having unfortunately stepped up to what customers had scheduled and then didn't require. We carry excess labor, and that labor we had was obviously not effective as it might be, because new labor does produce scrap. So we ended up with new labor producing higher rates of scrap combined with the cost of that. Now, we do expect that given the actions we took, trim labor, we're on a steadier -- we are back in recruitment mode, which we do have some cause for optimism for the future. In terms of rate builds and increases, even though we've chosen to be cautious about it is that -- I see no fundamental issues, not restoring those margins to at least the first -- the rate of the first half of 2022. And so, I never like to use the word like don't worry about it, but it really is. I don't think if you worry about it.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. No, that's very helpful. And maybe -- so just to clarify, the margin, when we think about company-wide, the margin -- the sort of flattish EBITDA margin company-wide expected for '23, that's not a function at this point of having excess labor above the production rates that are in your guidance. You're kind of appropriately sized for what's in your guidance. And to the extent that there is revenue upside, then with the appropriate lead time, you'll be able to bring in the cost structure that you need to produce at that rate?\nJohn Plant: Yes, pretty much. So, the labor overhang, certainly by the end of January. So, we saw to bring this in the right ZIP code there. We believe, our scrap rates are going to continue to improve. The guidance we gave on margin is right, given the conservative demand pattern we gave. Plus, if you pick up the words I used about it, let's call it about $100 million of inflation and that's probably mostly nonmaterial inflation this year. We still there to be recovered. And as you know, last year, if our 22.5% would have been like 100 basis points higher with that $300 million inflation that we recovered. Then this year, let's call it's just less than half of that. So again, taking an appropriately cautious line on where inflation might be at this point in time. And hopefully, it begins to become a very benign factor as we go through the year and things will begin to look better.\nSeth Seifman: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey David. How are you?\nDavid Strauss: Hey John. Good, how are you?\nJohn Plant: Good.\nDavid Strauss: Good. The 17% commercial aero growth that you forecast, how does that look across the different segments? And on commercial transportation, I think you outlined kind of your volume assumptions. But what should we look for in terms of just commercial transportation revenue next year, I guess, including pass-through as well? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Yes. Let me deal with the latter part first, because I tend not to comment too much on individual segments growth anticipation thereof. For wheels, as an aggregate next year, my best assumption at this point in time is a $50 million to $60 million revenue decline and with the volume element of that being in the second half. I mean, it doesn't have to be that way, David. It's an assumption of what if there is a recession, its impact in Europe. I could get more optimistic about it, given I'll say the labor strength and recent strength in Europe. But at this point in time, much will be cautious. Right now, build rates in the commercial truck and trailer business are pretty healthy and healthier probably than we thought going into the year. Maybe that's because now the supply chain issues that the commercial truck manufacturers have faced beginning to ease and they can be able to build that some of the really high backlog that they've got. So it's no more an assumption, but if you can assume that we've got $50 million to $60 million of revenue decline in our numbers, in our guide at this point. In terms of the commercial aerospace percentage by segments, actually haven't got in my mind, that will have to be a follow-up with Ken and let\u2019s kind of go to him, but we tend not to pull it out anyway.\nDavid Strauss: Yes, it was just -- yes, I get that. I was just getting at, would you expect maybe fasteners to outgrow from a narrow perspective, just given how the press, the overall numbers still are there in that segment?\nJohn Plant: If anything, at the moment, I would expect as we move from Q1 into Q2 and Q3, actually, our engine business will probably show a higher rate of commercial revenue growth because I think the engine manufacturers have a job of catch-up from 22 to accomplish as well as look forward to future rate increases. So at this stage, a very rough assumption against 17%, I wouldn't be surprised to see it's a little bit higher, maybe 20% in our engine business and a little bit lower elsewhere. And then I think we haven't covered is the titanium that level obviously factor into 2023, as we go through it again, increasing as we go through the year.\nKen Giacobbe: Yes. So David, I'd put engines in the number one position, structures in number two and then fasteners in number three position.\nDavid Strauss: Great. Thanks, guys.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna, your line is open.\nJohn Plant: We can't hear you, Gautam. Okay, lets move to the next.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey, good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Rob.\nRobert Spingarn: John, going back, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were pretty good years for you on price. And given that your LTAs are typically three to five years long, could you talk about the pricing opportunity this year and next and any opportunity to pick up share? And also if in these newer LTAs, can you build in mechanisms to pass-through freight costs and energy prices?\nJohn Plant: Yes. So first of all, where we file our K, which I think we are anticipating to be this evening, you'll see the final outcome for price in 2022. And the -- and that just evolve straight, if you could almost like take Qs one through three and the pro rata for the year. So it's a good outcome there. In 2023, I think you can expect a similar number in terms of price increase. So it is part of the methodology that I talked about for some years now, and it was not a one-off correction but more of the ongoing ability that we have to reflect value for the Howmet products that we bring to the marketplace. Our LTA cadence is pretty well set. We've already been in to now into the 2024s and so on because we are probably 85% to 90% complete already for 2023. So that's in good shape. Most of our conversations have been \u2013 it's and conversation as I call it, it's share because of our resiliency in terms of ability to build. And we started to see now an increase in spot business availability to us. So that's again good. And, clearly, we've always sought in recent times to protect ourselves for, let's call it, those inflation elements which are not part of that 95% plus raw material. So we're in good \u2013 an improving condition there as well, Rob. So, across the whole sector or questions that you're in good shape.\nRobert Spingarn: Is there any way to quantify the share gain opportunity over time? Is there an algorithm or something we can look to?\nJohn Plant: What I'd love to do one day is to call out for you, this is the aircraft build rate, and this is the amount of rates that should \u2013 a higher rate for Howmet. I haven't done it yet. I've just felt, we've got so many different segments to cover. And so it's been a particular skew of fundamentally relative differential rates of growth between Boeing and Airbus between narrow-body, wide-body, I felt that there have been so many elements of volatility of those demand pattern changes that come the day. And it will happen, Rob. One day, we'll be in that more \u2013 equanimity, where Boeing and Airbus settle into a future pattern, narrowbody and widebody will settle into that future pattern. I think production rates are going to come up and steady. And then that will be like the golden days, which are yet to come for all aerospace and aerospace suppliers at Howmet, in particular. So I think those conditions are coming, they're not yet here. I don't know I'm not saying, they're here for 2023. That's very clear what I talked to you earlier in this call about, but those things are going to happen. And I know, whether it's back half of 2023 or is it 2024, or is it 2025? I don't know yet. But at some stage, it will happen. And I think prior to that then I'd like to be able to say, this is the Howmet growth rate and to give you the percentage above aircraft build. And at that point, I feel confident in giving it to you rather than have it muddied by these \u2013 really these fundamental instability of narrow-body, wide-body Boeing, Airbus, et cetera, et cetera. So I think that's the appropriate time, Rob.\nRobert Spingarn: That's great. Thanks, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Hey. Yeah. Good morning, John.\nJohn Plant: Good morning. Good morning.\nRon Epstein: Just a lot of the questions are focused on the company's new supply, but let's kind of go the other way. How is the health of your supply chain? And what are you seeing there? To help some of those suppliers out, I mean, what's going on there, if you can give us a feel for that?\nJohn Plant: In 2021, it seemed to be can much better than it was by the back end of 2022 for us. And when I talk about that, where we buy base metal, we had no issues all the way through. But where we buy somebody else's alloy metal, that's given us heartaches for sure, and that heartache definitely increased in the back end of 2022. And that's impacted the stability in throughput, for example, of our ring segment in engine that it's affected our faster business. And while we think we have scheduled appropriate, we've had outages of somebody else's forge or say metal cincturing. We've had recently a fire in one of our, I'll say, waste competitor. It also -- it supplies us for certain parts. And so those -- I'll say that availability of metal has been much more prevalent in the last few months. Now, again, hopefully, it begins to smooth out as we move into 2023. Again, I think it's some months away before we get visibility. But I've got a list of items today where we're in a, I'll say, a low or no-build condition because of availability. But I'll say I'd look more -- to those two areas I talked about, which is rings and fasteners will be the areas which you've had the majority of the problem. And there's also been a bit of a problem on titanium revert as well, but again, smoothing that through and trying to step up to the increasing titanium that we're experiencing.\nRon Epstein: Got it. Got it. Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Can you guys hear me?\nJohn Plant: Can hear you now, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Terrific. Sorry about that earlier. I'm not sure what happened. Hey, I had a couple of questions. First, I was wondering, do you guys have a sense for where you were on Q4 production rates by the platforms that you guided for in 2023? So, like where you were on the 37, where you were on 320, et cetera?\nJohn Plant: Okay. We were below -- I think we were below 50% on the Airbus platforms just fractionally, let's call it 48%, 49%. And I'm going to call it, high 20s -- mid to high 20s on Boeing is my best guess. So, these are just guesses at this point.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And 87, I imagine, is like two or zero, where do you think you were?\nJohn Plant: Compared to one a month, you can call it, more like half a month.\nGautam Khanna: Got it. Were there big differences by the various segments, engine versus fasteners versus structures?\nJohn Plant: That's tough for me to picture all of that going back to last quarter. I think widebody was a particularly notable lower number for our fastener business in the fourth quarter. So, I know we were below whatever we built on the 787. I can't do from memory across every platform in the last quarter, however, they just think about it or may it must be a follow-up question.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And also just on 350 as well, A350 Q4 rate?\nJohn Plant: Yes, 350, that's been much more stable for us. Again, built fractionally below this year. We're optimistic in that I think our rates between five and six. And I actually think there's a good case for fundamental demand to be well above six. And so I don't know where Airbus will finally plan that second half rate and rating to 2024. But from what I could see of airline demand and particularly, the amount of 747s, which are flying around A380s, I think if they could access 787s or A350s, they would be desperate to do so. And so I think airlines need them not only for their own profitability, but also for their own carbon footprint. And I really do think there's a case for looking at that carbon footprint, and we need those composite based aircraft. And so I think we should be very optimistic on that twin engine wide-body demand in the back end of 2023 going into 2024 and I can see clear reason for higher rates. And so when Boeing talked about the rate 10 787s, is it 2026? I think that's definitely really very realistic and similarly taking Airbus up into that same sort of A350 that number. I really believe it's that strong, if not stronger.\nGautam Khanna: That's helpful. And then I apologize for the several questions. But I also am curious, a couple of years ago, you gave us some contract color with RTX on airfoils, F135, GTF, et cetera. Any update there on your visibility, because as you know, they're building that Asheville facility. I don't know if that's had any impact, or will have any impact in the next couple of years in terms of\u2026?\nJohn Plant: It's always difficult to really know, because we're not part in privy to the detailed plans from Raytheon. What the big that we do know is that we are intimate on the improved, let's say, advantage engine, and we're providing -- or going to provide more content and sophisticated product there to allow higher thrust and fuel efficiency. We are also -- in my comments earlier on the call, I spoke to 2028 Block 4, and we're intimating in that. We're deep into with both US engine manufacturers for the potential next-generation fighter programs in terms of engine. And so I think we\u2019re well-positioned and every one of those products I'm talking about is a level of sophistication higher than is in the market today and bringing what is not only, I mean, today's uniqueness, where we're the only supplier able to do it. We're taking that further by considerable margin to enable those upgrades to happen. And the cost of, therefore, by comparison to the benefit provided by, I'll say, increased flying time and less fuel usage and increased path of the avionics is just enormous.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. Could you guys say what happened to the $70 million of deferred shipments in Q4? Will that get reabsorbed in Q1, or is that through the course of the year? Thank you.\nJohn Plant: I think that will disappear very readily during the first part of this year. So -- and maybe if volumes begin to get -- we take a more optimistic volume, it may well be we might choose to hold some of that inventory by the end of the year, because we'll be looking at 2024. But at the moment, our going in assumption is that the rates I've given will burn some of that off. And we'll see where we go for the second half, Gautam. I mean, part of me would like to be optimistic, but I've chosen to be -- let's keep our feet on the ground and give you the guidance we've given.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you so much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question today will come from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMatt Akers : I wanted to ask on CapEx. It looks like you guys are expecting a step up this year. I know it's still below D&A and below kind of what it was a few years ago, but just what's driving the uptick and how we should think about that kind of as we ramp up aero production here?\nJohn Plant: Yes. So, first of all, we've taken, I will say, pressed out on the CapEx for the last two or three years and to be sub $200 million, I think, was a good outcome for the year. I do think that because of not only rate increases are coming, we feel not something you can turn on. You have to prepare for them and provide CapEx, not for some aspects of the volume, but also some of the technological changes that we've talked about. We're also spending again on automation, and that's proving to be, again, beneficial to us over the last couple of years. But I think it's part of -- as we move into looking at 2024, 2025, if it turns out to be the more optimistic scenarios that we've talked about of both narrow-body rate and wide-body rate, then I think for us to be in that ZIP code of just below inflation will serve us well, and it will be a source of cash and just let it through the next couple of years at that sort of level. And if we achieve that, I think in terms of CapEx usage for the business and coming up to our target -- utilization rates will be in a good shape to achieve all of that.\nMatt Akers : Okay. Great. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and also concludes today's call. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, P.T., and welcome, everybody, to the Howmet Q4 earnings call. Let's start by dealing with the headline numbers on slide four. For the fourth quarter, revenue accelerated as we exited the year, and it was above the high end of the guide at $1.51 billion, up 18% year-on-year. Commercial aerospace continues to be strong and was up 29% in the quarter. EBITDA was $336 million, at the high end of the guide. Revenue and EBITDA continued to improve sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter. The strong operating EBITDA was mitigated by a couple of below-the-line items that Ken will cover in his commentary. Earnings per share was at guidance at $0.38, which benefited from the strong EBITDA and the Q4 tax rate, which mitigated the below-the-line items. For the year, despite the choppy backlog, year-over-year revenue was up 14% and EBITDA was up 12%, which drove a healthy earnings per share growth of 39%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow was within the guided range of $540 million and as commented on the previous earnings call, included an inventory build for commercial aerospace to help smooth production adds as we move between years. Despite the inventory build, free cash flow conversion continues to be strong at 91%. Liquidity is healthy, with year-end cash balance on hand of $792 million and this was after share buybacks, bond repurchases and dividends. In the quarter, an additional $65 million of common stock was repurchased and the full year repurchase of common stock was $400 million. The December 2022 fully diluted share count exit rate was 418 million shares, which is an improvement of approximately 80 million shares since the start of 2019. This was accomplished while reducing net debt over the last four years as well. There was also some minor repurchases of bonds in Q4, taking the full year repurchases to $69 million. The bond repurchase program continued into the first quarter of 2023. And by the end of January, an additional $26 million of bonds were repurchased at a small discount to par. This continues our plan of reducing interest costs year-on-year. And going into 2023, it will be lower than 2022. And this is despites the global rising interest rate costs. Hence, we set ourselves up for a fundamentally different approach to most companies where interest costs will be lower for the coming year.  We've improved Howmet's leverage ratio, which now stands at 2.6 times net debt to EBITDA compared to our long-term target of just under two turns. All of Howmet's debt is unsecured and at fixed rates. Howmet's $1.1 billion revolver is undrawn. At the top level, we were pleased with the year. We exceeded the initial EPS guide for the year again. And in the case of 2022, we faced an extremely choppy backlog of below build expectations of both aircraft and engines compared to initial expectations. Furthermore, the extraordinary uptick inflation overcome despite its margin impact and all of this talks to the performance and resiliency of Howmet. Ken will now detail the 2022 performance, and then I'll cover the outlook after that. Thanks, Ken. Let's look at Commercial Aerospace first, which was up 28% this year. Airlines are experiencing strong growth for both domestic travel and now for international travel as well. Load factors are high in the US and Europe. China is now reopened and is increasing load factors at a rapid rate. This builds momentum on top of the increased Asia Pacific travel already seen. Backlogs of aircraft demand at Boeing and Airbus are at all-time highs for narrow-body aircraft. Wide-body demand is increasing rapidly, and further rate increases are expected. Airlines are bringing A380s back into service to meet international demand. This is clearly an inferior solution to having modern composite-based twin engine 787s or Airbus A350s with their vastly better fuel efficiency and lower carbon footprint. The demand for improved emissions alone secures the increased build, never mind the huge demand for travel. While noting very favorable air travel demand conditions, Howmet does rely upon aircraft builds by Boeing and Airbus, while also considering that we'll see rate increases for spares. Here, we're going to take a cautious and conservative view of 2023 until we know more and see consistent aircraft build rate increases. For example, underpinning the full year 2023 guidance, our assumed monthly build rates are approximately 30 per month for the Boeing 737 MAX, 53 to 54 for Airbus A320, A321. Additionally, we have assumed approximately 30 Boeing 787 builds for the year and 65 to 70 Airbus A350 build for the year. Within these outline numbers, we expect to see strength improving in the second half. These build assumptions underpin our assumed 17% Commercial Aerospace growth for the year. Now let me turn to other markets before commenting on inflation. In Defense, we expect to see low-single-digit increases in 2023 with less overhang to the F-35 structures inventory. Demand for the F-35 is strong and high builds are now expected throughout the remainder of the decade. This is further supported by both increased engine spares demand and upgrades of engines associated with the 2028 Block 4 requirements. Our business supports helicopters, drones and aerospace, which is a very healthy increase in revenue for us for these space-related programs. And at this increasing pace, I expect it will provide a lot more commentary on the space segment in the future. Gas turbine revenues are expected to grow at single-digit growth, supported by an increase for the Agent class turbines. I believe that everyone is aware of our very balanced IGT business, which supports GE Power, Siemens Power and also Mitsubishi Heavy, which is another global business for Howmet. Oil and gas should remain strong at high single-digit growth or maybe low double-digit growth. General industrial is expected to be down in, say, low single-digits. Finally, we take a more cautious view of commercial transportation in our wheel segment, where the expectation is for reduced demand in the second half of 2023, notably in Europe. In aggregate, fundamental demand might be down 0.5 million wheels before the improvement of 250,000 wheels driven by penetration of aluminum wheels versus steel wheels and share improvement. Sector growth continues in wheels, which will accelerate with future electrification of the truck sector, especially in Europe. Turning to material and inflationary costs. These remain volatile. We expect the combination of material, inflationary costs to be in the range of $70 million to $100 million for the year. As we did in 2022, our intent is to pass-through the majority of the inflationary costs. Let's turn to some specific numbers now for the first quarter of the year. Revenue, we see at $1.5 billion, plus or minus $25 million, EBITDA of $335 million, plus or minus $10 million, EPS of $0.37, plus or minus $0.02. For the year, revenue of $6.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million, EBITDA of $1.375 billion, plus or minus $40 million and EPS of $1.60, plus or minus $0.07. Earnings per share assumes continued capital allocation to common stock and bond repurchases, dependent upon market conditions. Our free cash flow guide is $615 million, plus or minus $35 million. We set our year up with appropriate caution given recent aircraft build volatility, while at the same time, noting fundamental -- fundamentally strong demand which will see further increases as we plan our pathway through into 2024 and 2025. Now let's turn to a summary. 2022 was another strong year for Howmet. Revenue increased by 14%, EBITDA by $140 million and 12%. Margins were above 22%, despite the extraordinary inflationary conditions. The effective tax rate improved to 22.5%, which is an improvement of 500 basis points from 2020. Earnings per share increased to $1.40 and by 39%. Free cash flow increased to $540 million, despite the inventory build of approximately $235 million for Commercial Aerospace. $513 million of capital was deployed back to share buybacks, bond repurchases and dividends and the dividends were as you know, doubled. Liquidity is very strong. We have cash on hand of $792 million and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. Leverage improved from 3.1 times net debt-to-EBITDA to 2.6 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Compared to our initial 2022 guide, we overcame a really good amount of headwinds. We exceeded initial EPS guidance of $1.37 while navigating unstable aircraft builds. $225 million of material pass-through costs and above the initial estimate of $125 million, rapid non-metal inflation and new employee costs. All the while, we strengthened our balance sheet, generated $540 million of free cash flow and deployed over $500 million to repurchases of bonds, dividends, et cetera. 2023 is expected to have strong growth and free cash flow generation. Since we expect similar challenges in 2022, we've taken a cautious conservative view until we have greater visibility regarding actual aircraft build rates. We look forward to above-trend growth in 2023, 2024 and 2025, and that will be reflected in additional profits and cash coming from the business. Thank you very much, and now let's move to your questions. Hey, Rob. I think when you look back over the last few quarters, when we've had steadier build increases, drop-through has been significantly higher compared to those quarters where we've seen, I'll say, urgent or rapid demand changes and also where we've been asked by customers to chop and change on production schedules to meet maybe availability of parts they have rather than a positive scheduled. And so you can see, I think, in our third quarter, drop-throughs were probably in the high 30s, maybe 39%. And you saw the -- if you look at the tracker revenue changes in those quarters compared to the revenue changes in the higher quarters, then I think in the fourth quarter, it was -- I can't know exactly number let's call it in the -- below 30%. So I think steady as you go does help us. At the same time, because of the base of employment that we have has been growing, then the increments -- or incremental each step of the demand gets that much easier to accommodate compared to what we saw was, I think, extreme volatility in 2022. And I mean, in one sense, I'd like to expand the question a lot more broadly and talk about that volatility, but I don't want to miss the point of your question, but essentially, I think steady plan for rate increases are really helpful to us. And that's when we convert best, albeit we're setting ourselves up to do that and hopefully take also advantage of additional demand should it come towards us. Yes. I got to try to separate my comments between that which Howmet controls and that which is -- I mean, therefore outside of our control. And when I look at last year, we started the year full of optimism and thought the 2022 was going to be really easy. And it didn't quite turn out that way with lower fundamental volumes, which were masked by inflation recoveries. Inflation itself within the demand we had significant volatility in schedules from our customers. And as you know, when I spoke to you in the fall, we've seen cutbacks for engine business at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And we ended up carrying probably $70 million to $100 million of additional inventory, which we had not planned or expected for because customers did not need those parts. And so if you go back again in the middle of the year last year, we were talking with Boeing about rate 38 such numbers. And we're really giving ourselves up to be able to address all of that. Also, I'll say, schedules of engine requirements, et cetera, et cetera, that would make made bills, even though 38 did not materialize. Even though as you mentioned now we're hearing, as I noted from the spirit caller that you referred to, I think it's 38 in the summer and 42 in October. I mean, as such is great, and we'd love it. And there's nothing which would give us more, I will say, pleasure and benefits than things that rates. But we also noted that during the fourth quarter that -- the third quarter and fourth quarter is that the actual numbers of aircraft sold, for example, by Boing was stated to be, let's say, back and by the time you took out claims from inventory, build rates were actually more or like in the 20s. And then we interpretably stated that it maybe it was higher to the high 20s in the fourth quarter, albeit you're never sure how many were just being finished off, et cetera. So, what was the level of actual build? We don't know. And so when we look at this year, I start off with saying, let me think about guidance. And guidance for us is something which we take very seriously. It's a base from which I think shareholders can realize -- it's a number that can be relied upon. So, if you look at 2019 where we're comfortably exceeded it 2020 our COVID year 2021, we blew passed it. In 2022, despite extraordinary difficult conditions, we achieved and exceeded that guidance that we gave at the start of the year. And so this is not like a wet paper tissue waving in the air. This is something we take very seriously. And the -- and so what can we rely upon and we felt as though those numbers, which I know are cautious. I know that they're below what many other people have and calling out 30 for a 737 or 53, 54 for an A320, those maybe seem to be low. And if you take 30 for a 787, that might also deem to be extremely low compared to what may be the outcome even though we know that very few were built in the in the fourth quarter. But if you take it as this is something that helps us plan the baseline of our business, sets our cost structures up properly. And should those sort of numbers that you mentioned materialize? Then just let's imagine what that might be. And what that might be? Might be, I don't know, 100, 200, probably more like a couple of -- towards a couple of hundred million more revenue. And if you take then the incremental drop-through for that, then you would be saying, while those incrementals look great, the margin rate should be above 23% because we've set our cost structure appropriately. And obviously, then things would begin to look progressively brighter during the course of the year, but that's not what we know. That's what we hope for. And so we set ourselves up with a guy which gives us a sense of security. If things turn actually better, we'll welcome it. I think you could rely upon Howmet to manufacture well the operationally in control and convert at a good rate. And so that's how we thought about it. And I don't want to be hostage to giving a guidance, which could be, obviously, have a much more optimistic on it and then find myself being worried every month what did they really build, et cetera, et cetera. And then put ourselves hostage to not only aircraft build rates of actual production, but also the rest of the supply base if we will match to the weakest link in the supply chain. And because I don't know where every one of those weak links are, I choose to take something which is fundamentally good, improving, significantly increasing, solid. If it turns out to be better, that will be great for us. I hope that gives you the context, Kristine? Thank you. Yes. So obviously, because of the amount of people recruited last year, we are set up pretty well for the first quarter to be able to produce at this level or above. Should it reach those heavy rates of 38 and 42 as an example, or if Airbus are in the 57, 58? Provided we know that they're heading that way, and we've got about six months lead time, we'll be in good shape to meet it. We've been particularly good at being able to recruit labor to meet our needs. I'll recognize that sometimes the stability of that labor hasn't been everything we'd wanted, but getting the headline numbers has been something which we've been very comfortable with. We've put increased disciplines around our own recruitment process to make sure we have a higher level of retention, improved training routine, et cetera. So I think we're doing all the right things in the same way as we set ourselves up for the initial aerospace ramp to be in a good condition. And so fundamentally, I believe that we'll be able to respond to meet those customer demands. Clearly -- for example, if Airbus got a hit rate 65 for A320s in mid-2024s that's still the current number. Then, again, knowing it sooner rather than later is highly beneficial to us and also the commensurate engine rate builds from our customers. I think you saw last quarter my commentary that, we were able to produce at a fundamentally higher rate only to get cut back, because the other parts of the supply chain were there. So I feel reasonably confident, Myles, in there to do that. Thank you. Hey, Seth. Okay. Well, first of all, let me comment on profitability in the second half. That was, I'll say, fundamentally impacted by the fact we -- as it turned out, well, we thought we'd recruited to the right outline demand. As you know, because of those cutbacks, not only did we not produce as much, but some of what we did produce inventory, we eventually therefore, we didn't make the profit on it. The worst condition we were in is that, in actual fact, even though across Howmet, labor was pretty flat in the fourth quarter. So we -- let's say, net we didn't hire back where we were slightly down on labor. But in our engine products, we were down significantly. So more than 100 people down as -- which is most unusual to think about, we were cutting labor, given the underlying engine demand and basically because we were holding costs, which we did not need to be able to produce what we required. So we were in that pretty lethal band of having unfortunately stepped up to what customers had scheduled and then didn't require. We carry excess labor, and that labor we had was obviously not effective as it might be, because new labor does produce scrap. So we ended up with new labor producing higher rates of scrap combined with the cost of that. Now, we do expect that given the actions we took, trim labor, we're on a steadier -- we are back in recruitment mode, which we do have some cause for optimism for the future. In terms of rate builds and increases, even though we've chosen to be cautious about it is that -- I see no fundamental issues, not restoring those margins to at least the first -- the rate of the first half of 2022. And so, I never like to use the word like don't worry about it, but it really is. I don't think if you worry about it. Yes, pretty much. So, the labor overhang, certainly by the end of January. So, we saw to bring this in the right ZIP code there. We believe, our scrap rates are going to continue to improve. The guidance we gave on margin is right, given the conservative demand pattern we gave. Plus, if you pick up the words I used about it, let's call it about $100 million of inflation and that's probably mostly nonmaterial inflation this year. We still there to be recovered. And as you know, last year, if our 22.5% would have been like 100 basis points higher with that $300 million inflation that we recovered. Then this year, let's call it's just less than half of that. So again, taking an appropriately cautious line on where inflation might be at this point in time. And hopefully, it begins to become a very benign factor as we go through the year and things will begin to look better. Thank you. Hey David. How are you? Good. Yes. Let me deal with the latter part first, because I tend not to comment too much on individual segments growth anticipation thereof. For wheels, as an aggregate next year, my best assumption at this point in time is a $50 million to $60 million revenue decline and with the volume element of that being in the second half. I mean, it doesn't have to be that way, David. It's an assumption of what if there is a recession, its impact in Europe. I could get more optimistic about it, given I'll say the labor strength and recent strength in Europe. But at this point in time, much will be cautious. Right now, build rates in the commercial truck and trailer business are pretty healthy and healthier probably than we thought going into the year. Maybe that's because now the supply chain issues that the commercial truck manufacturers have faced beginning to ease and they can be able to build that some of the really high backlog that they've got. So it's no more an assumption, but if you can assume that we've got $50 million to $60 million of revenue decline in our numbers, in our guide at this point. In terms of the commercial aerospace percentage by segments, actually haven't got in my mind, that will have to be a follow-up with Ken and let's kind of go to him, but we tend not to pull it out anyway. If anything, at the moment, I would expect as we move from Q1 into Q2 and Q3, actually, our engine business will probably show a higher rate of commercial revenue growth because I think the engine manufacturers have a job of catch-up from 22 to accomplish as well as look forward to future rate increases. So at this stage, a very rough assumption against 17%, I wouldn't be surprised to see it's a little bit higher, maybe 20% in our engine business and a little bit lower elsewhere. And then I think we haven't covered is the titanium that level obviously factor into 2023, as we go through it again, increasing as we go through the year. Thank you. We can't hear you, Gautam. Okay, lets move to the next. Hey, Rob. Yes. So first of all, where we file our K, which I think we are anticipating to be this evening, you'll see the final outcome for price in 2022. And the -- and that just evolve straight, if you could almost like take Qs one through three and the pro rata for the year. So it's a good outcome there. In 2023, I think you can expect a similar number in terms of price increase. So it is part of the methodology that I talked about for some years now, and it was not a one-off correction but more of the ongoing ability that we have to reflect value for the Howmet products that we bring to the marketplace. Our LTA cadence is pretty well set. We've already been in to now into the 2024s and so on because we are probably 85% to 90% complete already for 2023. So that's in good shape. Most of our conversations have been \u2013 it's and conversation as I call it, it's share because of our resiliency in terms of ability to build. And we started to see now an increase in spot business availability to us. So that's again good. And, clearly, we've always sought in recent times to protect ourselves for, let's call it, those inflation elements which are not part of that 95% plus raw material. So we're in good \u2013 an improving condition there as well, Rob. So, across the whole sector or questions that you're in good shape. What I'd love to do one day is to call out for you, this is the aircraft build rate, and this is the amount of rates that should \u2013 a higher rate for Howmet. I haven't done it yet. I've just felt, we've got so many different segments to cover. And so it's been a particular skew of fundamentally relative differential rates of growth between Boeing and Airbus between narrow-body, wide-body, I felt that there have been so many elements of volatility of those demand pattern changes that come the day. And it will happen, Rob. One day, we'll be in that more \u2013 equanimity, where Boeing and Airbus settle into a future pattern, narrowbody and widebody will settle into that future pattern. I think production rates are going to come up and steady. And then that will be like the golden days, which are yet to come for all aerospace and aerospace suppliers at Howmet, in particular. So I think those conditions are coming, they're not yet here. I don't know I'm not saying, they're here for 2023. That's very clear what I talked to you earlier in this call about, but those things are going to happen. And I know, whether it's back half of 2023 or is it 2024, or is it 2025? I don't know yet. But at some stage, it will happen. And I think prior to that then I'd like to be able to say, this is the Howmet growth rate and to give you the percentage above aircraft build. And at that point, I feel confident in giving it to you rather than have it muddied by these \u2013 really these fundamental instability of narrow-body, wide-body Boeing, Airbus, et cetera, et cetera. So I think that's the appropriate time, Rob. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. In 2021, it seemed to be can much better than it was by the back end of 2022 for us. And when I talk about that, where we buy base metal, we had no issues all the way through. But where we buy somebody else's alloy metal, that's given us heartaches for sure, and that heartache definitely increased in the back end of 2022. And that's impacted the stability in throughput, for example, of our ring segment in engine that it's affected our faster business. And while we think we have scheduled appropriate, we've had outages of somebody else's forge or say metal cincturing. We've had recently a fire in one of our, I'll say, waste competitor. It also -- it supplies us for certain parts. And so those -- I'll say that availability of metal has been much more prevalent in the last few months. Now, again, hopefully, it begins to smooth out as we move into 2023. Again, I think it's some months away before we get visibility. But I've got a list of items today where we're in a, I'll say, a low or no-build condition because of availability. But I'll say I'd look more -- to those two areas I talked about, which is rings and fasteners will be the areas which you've had the majority of the problem. And there's also been a bit of a problem on titanium revert as well, but again, smoothing that through and trying to step up to the increasing titanium that we're experiencing. Thank you. Can hear you now, Gautam. Okay. We were below -- I think we were below 50% on the Airbus platforms just fractionally, let's call it 48%, 49%. And I'm going to call it, high 20s -- mid to high 20s on Boeing is my best guess. So, these are just guesses at this point. Compared to one a month, you can call it, more like half a month. That's tough for me to picture all of that going back to last quarter. I think widebody was a particularly notable lower number for our fastener business in the fourth quarter. So, I know we were below whatever we built on the 787. I can't do from memory across every platform in the last quarter, however, they just think about it or may it must be a follow-up question. Yes, 350, that's been much more stable for us. Again, built fractionally below this year. We're optimistic in that I think our rates between five and six. And I actually think there's a good case for fundamental demand to be well above six. And so I don't know where Airbus will finally plan that second half rate and rating to 2024. But from what I could see of airline demand and particularly, the amount of 747s, which are flying around A380s, I think if they could access 787s or A350s, they would be desperate to do so. And so I think airlines need them not only for their own profitability, but also for their own carbon footprint. And I really do think there's a case for looking at that carbon footprint, and we need those composite based aircraft. And so I think we should be very optimistic on that twin engine wide-body demand in the back end of 2023 going into 2024 and I can see clear reason for higher rates. And so when Boeing talked about the rate 10 787s, is it 2026? I think that's definitely really very realistic and similarly taking Airbus up into that same sort of A350 that number. I really believe it's that strong, if not stronger. It's always difficult to really know, because we're not part in privy to the detailed plans from Raytheon. What the big that we do know is that we are intimate on the improved, let's say, advantage engine, and we're providing -- or going to provide more content and sophisticated product there to allow higher thrust and fuel efficiency. We are also -- in my comments earlier on the call, I spoke to 2028 Block 4, and we're intimating in that. We're deep into with both US engine manufacturers for the potential next-generation fighter programs in terms of engine. And so I think we're well-positioned and every one of those products I'm talking about is a level of sophistication higher than is in the market today and bringing what is not only, I mean, today's uniqueness, where we're the only supplier able to do it. We're taking that further by considerable margin to enable those upgrades to happen. And the cost of, therefore, by comparison to the benefit provided by, I'll say, increased flying time and less fuel usage and increased path of the avionics is just enormous. I think that will disappear very readily during the first part of this year. So -- and maybe if volumes begin to get -- we take a more optimistic volume, it may well be we might choose to hold some of that inventory by the end of the year, because we'll be looking at 2024. But at the moment, our going in assumption is that the rates I've given will burn some of that off. And we'll see where we go for the second half, Gautam. I mean, part of me would like to be optimistic, but I've chosen to be -- let's keep our feet on the ground and give you the guidance we've given. Thank you. Yes. So, first of all, we've taken, I will say, pressed out on the CapEx for the last two or three years and to be sub $200 million, I think, was a good outcome for the year. I do think that because of not only rate increases are coming, we feel not something you can turn on. You have to prepare for them and provide CapEx, not for some aspects of the volume, but also some of the technological changes that we've talked about. We're also spending again on automation, and that's proving to be, again, beneficial to us over the last couple of years. But I think it's part of -- as we move into looking at 2024, 2025, if it turns out to be the more optimistic scenarios that we've talked about of both narrow-body rate and wide-body rate, then I think for us to be in that ZIP code of just below inflation will serve us well, and it will be a source of cash and just let it through the next couple of years at that sort of level. And if we achieve that, I think in terms of CapEx usage for the business and coming up to our target -- utilization rates will be in a good shape to achieve all of that. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Please move to slide 5 for an overview of the markets. Revenue was up 18% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and up 14% for the full year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued throughout 2022, with fourth quarter commercial aerospace revenue up 29% year-over-year and up 28% for the full year, driven by engine products, engineered structures and the narrow-body recovery. Commercial aerospace has grown for seven consecutive quarters and stands at 48% of total revenue, but continues to be short of the pre-COVID level, which was 60% of total revenue. Defense Aerospace was up 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by year end seasonality and down 3% for the full year, driven by customer inventory corrections for the F-35. Commercial transportation, which impacts forged wheels and fastening systems, was up 12% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 14% for the full year, driven by higher aluminum prices and higher volumes, partially offset by foreign currency. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial, was essentially flat for the fourth quarter and for the year. For the fourth quarter, within the industrial and other markets, oil and gas was up 22%, IGT was up 2% and general industrial was down 10% on a year-over-year basis. Now let's move to slide 6. We will start with the P&L with a focus on enhanced profitability. For the fourth quarter, we had six consecutive quarters of growth in revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share. Revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share exceeded or were in line with guidance. For the full year, revenue was up 9% year-over-year excluding material pass-through of approximately $225 million. EBITDA was $1.28 billion or up 12% year-over-year. Adjusting for the year-over-year material pass-through, EBITDA margin was 23.5%, and flow-through of incremental revenue to EBITDA was strong at approximately 30%. The full year operating tax rate was 22.5%, an improvement of 250 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share was $1.40 for the year and up 39% year-over-year. The average diluted share count improved to a Q4 exit rate of 418 million shares. As John mentioned, the strong operating EBITDA and favorable tax rate in the fourth quarter were mitigated by a few items below the line. The impact of foreign currency and deferred comp was $9 million pretax charge, as these items fluctuate based on market conditions. For the year, the impact of foreign currency was essentially breakeven and deferred comp was favorable. Final note on earnings. As expected, we did not have significant net headcount additions in the fourth quarter. However, we hired approximately 1,000 new employees to offset Q4 attrition and absorbed incremental training and production costs. Moving to the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the year was a record $540 million, including an inventory build of approximately $235 million, primarily for the commercial aerospace recovery. For 2022, as well as in every year since separation, we achieved free cash flow conversion of net income in excess of our long-term target of 90%. Year-end cash balance was a healthy $792 million after approximately $513 million of capital allocation to common stock repurchases, 2024 bond repurchases and the quarterly dividends. Year-over-year net pension and OPEB liabilities were reduced by approximately $180 million, and cash contributions were reduced by approximately 50% or $56 million. Since 2019, net pension and OPEB liabilities have been reduced by approximately $470 million and gross pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $1.4 billion. Net pension and OPEB liabilities now stand at less than 5% of Howmet's market capitalization. Finally, net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 2.6 times, all bond debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of interest rate expense in the future. Our next bond maturity is in October of 2024, and the $1 billion revolver is undrawn. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. Capital expenditures were $193 million for the year and were approximately 75% of depreciation. Capital installed prior to COVID-19 puts us in a very strong position to support the expected commercial aerospace growth. Fourth quarter was the seventh consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. For the year, we repurchased approximately 11.4 million shares of common stock for $400 million with an average acquisition price of $35.22 per share. Share buyback authority stands at $947 million. Moving to debt. We repurchased $69 million of our 2024 bonds last year with cash on hand. These repurchases will lower our annualized interest costs by approximately $4 million. Moreover, we continue to repurchase 2024 bonds in January, with another $26 million of repurchases at a slight discount to par. Repurchases were made with cash on hand. Lastly, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, the quarterly common stock dividend was doubled to $0.04 per share, dividends in 2022 were $44 million, and we expect to increase to approximately $68 million in 2023. Let's move to slide 7 now to cover the segment results. Q4 was another solid quarter for engine products. Year-over-year revenue was 21% higher in the fourth quarter with commercial aerospace up 30%, driven by the narrow-body recovery. Defense Aerospace was up 17%, IGT was up 2%, and oil and gas was up 19%. EBITDA increased 26% year-over-year and margin improved 110 basis points to 26.1% despite the addition of new employees and the associated near-term training and production costs. Let's move to slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 11% higher in the fourth quarter. Commercial aerospace was 17% higher, driven by the narrow-body recovery. Defense Aerospace was up 21% and Industrial was down 13%. Year-over-year segment EBITDA decreased 3% due to the addition of new employees and the near-term training and production costs. In the fourth quarter, Fasteners added approximately 200 new hires to offset 200 exits. Now let's move to slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was up 21% in the fourth quarter, with commercial aerospace up 40%, driven by the narrow-body recovery was approximately $20 million of Russian titanium share gain. Gains were partially offset by the impact of production declines for the Boeing 787. Segment EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year despite the inventory burn down of the F-35, and the continued zero to low build of the Boeing 787. Structures 2022 full year EBITDA margin was 14.1%, and was on par with 2019 levels when revenue was 37% higher. Finally, let's move to slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 14% higher in the fourth quarter. The $32 million increase in revenue year-over-year was almost entirely driven by higher aluminum prices. Commercial transportation demand remained strong, but volumes continue to be impacted by customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production. Segment EBITDA was flat year-over-year as higher volumes were offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, and primarily driven by the euro. While the pass-through of higher aluminum prices did not impact EBITDA dollars, it did impact margin by approximately 300 basis points. Lastly, in the appendix on slide 15, we've included some assumptions around 2023. We expect non-service pension and OPEB expense to increase approximately $20 million year-over-year to approximately $40 million. The increase will unfavorably impact year-over-year earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per share and is mainly due to low asset returns impacting non-service costs, which are non-cash. In addition to the increase in pension expense of $20 million, we continue to expect miscellaneous other expenses, which are below the line be minimal at approximately $8 million for the year, but can be volatile within quarters. Pension and OPEB cash contributions are expected to be flat with 2022 and approximately $56 million for the year. CapEx should be in the range of $230 million to $260 million, which continues to be less in depreciation and amortization, resulting in a net source of cash. Now let me turn it back over to John. Yes. So David, I'd put engines in the number one position, structures in number two and then fasteners in number three position."

[Operator Instructions] And please note that this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Cole. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace Third Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will contain Forward-Looking Statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today\u2019s presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In today's presentation, references to EBITDA and EPS, meaning adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items and adjusted EPS excluding special items. These measures are among the non-GAAP financial measures that we've included in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the appendix in today\u2019s presentation. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, P.T., and welcome everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. Howmet continued to perform well in the third quarter, earnings per share were in line with guidance midpoint and EBITDA margin was strong at 22.5%. Revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share, all grew for the fifth consecutive quarter. Q3 revenue was $1.433 billion and was factually lower compared to the midpoint of guidance of $1.44 billion.  All aerospace segments showed strong performance with sequential growth in the third quarter. Commercial transportation was lower reflecting normal seasonality and the effect of the wheels [indiscernible], which has now been resolved and production at the site brought back fully online as of the third week of October.  In September, we saw Commercial Aerospace customers rebate their schedules, notably in engine products, reflecting two dynamics. Firstly, a lower narrow body engine build over the summer and early fall than was originally envisaged, and due partially to the availability of structural castings. And secondly, customers bringing airfoil inventory levels in line by year end. I'll provide further commentary in the outlook section of my remarks. EBITDA was $323 million and further progression on Q1 and Q2 of the year. Free cash flow was positive as forecasted, however, impacted by carrying higher commercial aerospace inventory levels, again, due to the scheduled rebalances of our customers. Q3 ending cash was a healthy $454 million after repurchasing approximately 2.8 million shares for $100 million at an average price of $36.17 per share and also paying the quarterly dividend. Legacy pension and OPEB liabilities continue to be reduced, which resulted in a reduced year-to-date cash contributions of approximately 45%. I'll now pass the call to Ken for commentary by end markets and by each business segment.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Please move to Slide 5 for an overview of the markets. Third quarter revenue was up 12% year-over-year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued in the third quarter, with commercial aerospace revenue up 23% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segment and the narrow body recovery. Commercial aerospace has grown for sixth consecutive quarter and stands at 47% of total revenue but continues to be far short of the pre-COVID level, which was 60% of total revenue. Defense Aerospace was down 4% year-over-year, driven by continued customer inventory corrections for the F-35, which was in line with our expectations. Commercial Transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segment was up 13% year-over-year driven by higher aluminum prices and higher volumes, partially offset by foreign currency. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was down 2% year-over-year. Within the industrial and other markets, oil and gas was up 11%, IGT was down 2% and general industrial was down 9% on a year-over-year basis. Now let's move to Slide 6. As usual, we'll start with the P&L and the focus on enhanced profitability. In the third quarter, revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share were all in line with guidance. Revenue was up 12% year-over-year, including material pass-through of approximately $70 million. EBITDA was $323 million, and EBITDA margin was a healthy 22.5%. If we exclude the $70 million impact of higher material pass-through, EBITDA margin was 120 basis points higher to 23.7%. Adjusting for material pass-through, the flow-through of incremental revenue in the quarter to EBITDA was strong at 39%. During Q3, we continued the recruitment of headcount by approximately 350 employees primarily in engines. Year-to-date, we have increased headcount by approximately 1,575 employees focused in engines and fasteners. In Q4, we do not expect significant headcount additions. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.36, up 33% year-over-year. For the quarter, the impact of foreign currency was minimal. Moving to the balance sheet. Free cash flow year-to-date was $130 million, including an inventory build of approximately $270 million primarily for the commercial aerospace recovery. Cash on hand was healthy at $454 million after buying back $100 million of common stock and funding the quarterly dividend. The average diluted share count improved to a Q3 exit rate of 419 million shares. Year-to-date, net pension and OPEB liabilities were reduced by approximately $85 million and cash contributions were reduced by approximately 45% or $35 million. Discount rates continue to be favorable and will be remeasured at the end of the year, which should further reduce net pension liabilities. We continue to expect annual cash contributions to be approximately $60 million versus expense of $20 million. Finally, net debt to EBITDA remains at 3x, all bond debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of our interest rate expense. Our next bond maturity is in November of 2024. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. Capital expenditures continue to be less than depreciation at approximately 65% in the third quarter. Productivity CapEx continues to focus on automation products, projects in the engines and fasteners business to improve yields, enhance quality, reduce outsourcing and mitigate labor risk. We purchased approximately 2.8 million shares of common stock in the quarter from $100 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares of common stock for $335 million with an average acquisition price of $34.60 per share. Share buyback authority from the Board of Directors stands at $1 billion. Lastly, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. The quarterly dividend was doubled to $0.04 per share per quarter with the first higher payment to be made in November of 2022. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover segment results. Q3 was another solid quarter for engines. Year-over-year revenue was 14% higher in the third quarter with commercial aerospace up 30%, driven by the narrow body recovery. Defense Aerospace was down 5%, IGT was down 2% and oil and gas was up 11%. EBITDA increased 23% year-over-year and margin improved 200 basis points to 27.2%, despite adding approximately 260 employees in the third quarter. Year-to-date net headcount additions for the engine business was approximately 1,040 employees. While the headcount additions are preparing us for the future commercial aerospace growth, it does unfavorably impact near-term results due to the time and cost required to train new employees, which could take several months depending on the position. Now let's move to Slide 8. Fasting Systems year-over-year revenue was 15% higher in the third quarter. Commercial aerospace was 24% higher driven by the narrow-body recovery, somewhat offset by continued production declines for the Boeing 787. Defense Aerospace was up 16%. Year-over-year segment EBITDA increased 8% despite the addition of employees to support future growth. Year-to-date headcount additions for fasteners was approximately 410 employees. Sequentially, EBITDA margin improved 180 basis points to 22%. Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was down 3% in the quarter. Defense Aerospace was down 14% year-over-year, driven by customer inventory corrections for the F-35 as expected. Commercial aerospace was 5% higher as the narrow-body recovery offset the impact of production declines for the Boeing 787. Segment EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year. EBITDA margin improved 140 basis points to 14.5% despite the inventory burn down of the F-35, continued 0 to low build on the 787 and inflationary cost pressures. Structures Q3 2022 EBITDA margin of 14.5% was greater than the 2019 annual rate of 14.2% and when 2019 revenues were over $1.25 billion. Finally, let's move to Slide 10. As expected, Portsville's year-over-year revenue was 15% higher in the third quarter. The $35 million increase in revenue year-over-year was almost entirely driven by higher aluminum prices. Commercial transportation demand remained strong, but volumes continue to be impacted by customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production.  Segment EBITDA decreased 11% due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, primarily driven by the euro. While the pass-through of the higher aluminum prices did not impact EBITDA dollars, it did unfavorably impact margin by approximately 340 basis points. The impact on EBITDA margin increases to more than 550 basis points if you also include the unfavorable margin impact of passing through higher inflationary costs like the European energy costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Before turning it back over to John, I will remind you that the impact of foreign currency to Howmet in total is minimal as the Aerospace segments provide a natural foreign currency hedge against the Forged Wheels segment. Lastly, in the appendix, we've updated assumptions, including an improvement in the annual operational tax rate to approximately 23.5%, which translates into a Q4 operational tax rate of approximately 22%. Also, we have updated annual assumptions to reflect improvements in our cash tax rate, net pension liabilities, depreciation and amortization, CapEx and diluted share count. Now let me turn that back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken. So let's move to Slide #11. First, let me comment on the wider picture in commercial aerospace. Recovery continues with increasing airline schedules and load factors, especially in Europe and North America. Airline profits are rebounding well, and new aircraft are being ordered, especially narrow-body aircraft. International travel has also rebounded during the year and is showing strength, which is leading to modest increased production as we move into 2023, notably Airbus A350 and the Boeing 787 after its recent recertification. Spares for the aftermarket also continued to increase. This trend provides optimism that aircraft build volume will continue to strengthen throughout 2023 and 2024.  Recent aircraft build rate issues have been more the result of parts availability, especially but not confined to engines. While we have to be cautious at this time, pending more visibility of unrestricted builds, allowing Airbus to reach their build levels of 55 per month for the A320, and Boeing to reach their build levels of 31 per month on the 737 MAX, we do envisage \u2013 envision that commercial aerospace revenue should be up around 20% in 2023. Consolidated Howmet, including commercial aerospace and its other sectors of defense, industrial gas turbine, oil and gas and commercial transportation is expected to be up approximately 10% plus or minus 2% in revenue. Further refinement will be provided in February 2023 upon the release of Q4 earnings. In the more immediate time frame of Q4, we do envision further sequential growth. However, approximately $70 million of lower revenue compared to previously envisaged primarily in engine products as a result of the lower engine bill achieved and customer inventory drawdown or the end of year toward my earlier comments. This results in an annual guide of $5.62 billion due to a small offset in other business areas beyond engine and earnings per share of $0.38 in the fourth quarter, which again is another sequential increase as we've shown in each quarter of 2022. Higher inventory will now be needed at year-end to accommodate the snapback and increasing build starting in the first quarter of next year once we've got through this inventory correction. More specifically, the guidance for Q4 is as follows: revenue, $1.47 billion, plus $30 million, minus $20 million; EBITDA $330 million, plus $6 million, minus $5 million; earnings per share of $0.38, plus or minus $0.01. For the full year, revenue of $5.62 billion, plus $30 million, minus $20 million; EBITDA of $1.27 billion, plus $6 million, minus $5 million; earnings per share of $1.40, plus or minus $0.01 as we've narrowed the range from previous guidance. Free cash flow of $560 million, plus $20 million, minus $40 million, and this is driven -- this reduction compared to prior guidance is driven by the higher year-end inventory carried into 2023 for the continued commercial growth -- aerospace growth in the first quarter. Let's move to Slide 12 for summary. 2022 is another solid year with increases of revenue and profit building in each quarter and sequentially into Q4. Momentum does continue into 2023 with commercial aerospace expected to perform above normal growth rates in 2023, 2024 and also 2025 before reverting to a more normal 4% per year growth for Aerospace. We look forward to the future. So let's now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn: John, there seems to be a bit of a disconnect in commercial aero and the messaging from Boeing and Airbus. So engine deliveries for Pratt and CFM were up significantly. And Airbus has the OEMs, the engine OEMs are catching up. But Boeing says -- talks about the bottleneck, which you referred to earlier. So are you seeing more volumes for LEAP-1A versus LEAP-1B, how do we make sense of this difference that we think is occurring on the LEAP?\nJohn Plant : Okay. So First of all, let me agree with you that it is confusing, I think it's confusing for everybody at the moment. But let's start off with the broad picture and then talk about Howmet before any commentary on a wider basis. So I think the big picture is commercial aerospace continues to grind higher. Everybody is trying to do the right things. And airlines are improving. I think aerospace manufacturers are improving their throughputs and the engine manufacturer supporting those aircraft builds are also doing their part of the whole thing. I guess not everything is going perfectly, as we've seen from some of the numbers and some of the disconnects apparent from commentary on calls last week. Let me deal with Howmet first and say, we've been really well prepared through the last year and beyond. As you know, we started recruitment of labor in the second quarter of last year and hired almost 1,000 people last year. Through year-to-date, I think we're approaching now something like 1,500 people through the end of the third quarter. And then I think the most salient factor for ourselves was that during September is that compared to the schedules and delivery requirements that we thought we would see for both September and the fourth quarter, we saw a complete rebasing of those requirements where we've had arrears which should be built up according to, I think, the anticipated engine mills, in particular. And as we know, the anticipated engine builds were not as high as -- the actual is not as high as anticipated. And you saw Airbus commenting on the fact they had lied us in the like 70 at one point, then it was down to maybe 10 or 20. So while I'll say deliveries of engines did improve, I don't think anybody believes that the quantity of engines that was originally envisaged to be built were built. In terms of the splits of whatever was delivered on LEAP between 1A, 1B, 1C, we don't have any visibility into that. I mean we do note that from the call last week from GE Aviation, which provides a lot of those engines is that they were significantly up with an improved deliveries, I think, in the near 350 engines. How many went to Airbus, how many went to Boeing, COMAC. And indeed, how many of those engines, which we also -- you sometimes forget they go to airlines or spares and also aircraft leasing companies or spares, I don't really know, it's difficult to judge. Certainly, you feel as though there was enough engines in the whole system, but maybe they were out of parts of the -- difficult to really know. Nevertheless, the big picture is those actual builds both by CFM engines and LEAP engines were less than a bit envisaged. And I think we've heard in the past about restrictions around structural castings in particular, probably not confined just to that. And therefore, when customers looked at where they were and what they expected to finish the year with and also where they had received from ourselves, for example, all of the airfoils they required and more maybe is to balance their own inventories for the end of the year is that they were cut back. And so despite still sequential growth quarter-on-quarter that growth is not as high as we had envisaged.  So right now, we've drawn our labor recruitment down significantly. So we'll be -- probably recruit selective in a few areas in the fourth quarter. Essentially, the rest will go to 0. And because we don't want to certainly stop production, we're going to carry about $70 million of additional inventory, which will hit our cash balance at the end of the year. And as we need that that inventory to carry us through into the first quarter where we do expect those requirements will be placed back on us significantly, engine build will improve, and hopefully, aircraft production will improve.  And so we're trying to smooth ourselves out. So we'll utilize all of the labor that we've recruited, carry on with production, put it into inventory. So we have a smooth startup into the start of next year. So we keep all of our customers happy. But it does enable us to stop ourselves hiring a lot of people, and so we will eliminate some of that cost, albeit, as you can imagine, we were holding that cost in the month of September than we are into the balance of the year.So that's the big picture.  In terms of exactly what the rate of production of the 737 is and the A320, I don't think we are best placed to answer and I believe that most people are heading off on the sell side to Seattle this week so you really get a clearer picture during those visits. So I don't know, whether that covers it out for you, rob, but just trying to give you a sweep through the whole situation.\nRobert Spingarn: That's really helpful, John. And even with what you just said, and I am heading out there with the others. Just on the 87, are you still looking for 15 shipsets for this year? And do you have any insight into next year?\nJohn Plant : We have a revised skyline for next year. We don't have much for this year. I think it's going to be de minimis of any production on the 87. My guess is it's probably just about month that we've seen previously. I don't really know. It's pretty opaque to us. And I'm assuming there's inventory in the system for that.  We do have skylines showing clear improvements on the 787 build during the course of next year. And I think from memory, it's probably the back end of the year at around about 5 aircraft per month. And I do have confidence that there is a market requirement for that because when I look at the return of international demand for travel, just look at, I'll say, the cutbacks that were made in widebody during the last few years, then if anything, my guess is that there's going to be a higher demand on wide-body, which will support a rate for both Airbus and for Boeing for their A350s and 787s above that rate. So I'm actually tending towards the optimistic side of fundamental demand. And then the only question that we have is, in terms of our own guidance is how conservative should we be because we do hear this noise that you referred to about exactly how many were made and where that parts are and what are the constraints. And so that also causes us to be just a little bit cautious given the factors that we've encountered in the last month or 2 enrolling into the end of the year, albeit against we see that spiking up in the first quarter.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: I wanted to ask if you could talk about share gain opportunity. So anything incremental on titanium? And are any of these pinch points on engines accruing to your benefit where customers are engaging on castings reported. If you could speak to that?\nJohn Plant : In the -- I mean, the biggest pinch points for engine we would like to think has been around the structural castings. There's probably some engine controllers as well, but I don't really know that. It's probably lots of other things, which I'm not fully aware of. But I think the commentary around structural castings is pretty widely publicized. In the short term, it doesn't really -- it presents an opportunity to us because there is a specific tooling and certification procedures which are required. And so it really is a case of getting the structural castings from the relevant supplier.  In terms of ourselves, while we have been tighter than we'd like on structural castings is that we don't believe that we've caused any engine build issues and indeed beginning to see in that segment significant improvements in our throughput and abilities. And its not quite as good as the flow of air flows that we've been seeing because that's been a really, I'll say, high-class output for us during the year. But short term, nothing we can point to, I think, in the medium to longer term, we will see benefits on the structural casting side across the various sectors of the industry. But nothing for us to put into a, let's say, 2023 planning at all. On titanium, which was your other question, is that those orders continue to improve. So we've booked additional orders for -- during the third and fourth quarter, and that's looking better for us, albeit there's still significant areas to go because we still have, in particular, 1 of the airframe manufacturers, which has got a lot of inventory and hasn't really yet moved to cut orders lease on the supply base. So more to come on that subject as we move into next year.\nOperator: And our next question will come from David Strauss with Barclays.\nDavid Strauss : John, so to try to simplify this. Are you at 31 a month on the MAX on the engine side, are you at 45 to 50 on the engine side for Airbus. And this just really has to do with a shortage of other parts. And as a result, the manufacturers kind of slowed down things to get everything aligned given that they're building below the rate that you are currently producing at?\nJohn Plant : Yes. We've been building at rates. So we've taken the requirements from our engine customers and the airframe manufacturers, and we've just been more or less in line with that, I'll say, 50-plus for A320s as an example. Probably with some attempted inventory for the infill rate build increases next year. And in the case of Boeing, we were fully planning on the 31 a month and had anticipated that those according to, let's say, verbal communication, not any scheduled commitments, originally, were planned to rise during the first quarter of 2023. As we all know that those production levels probably have not been achieved and the airframe manufacturers and certainly on the engine side, and so where we've been in line at or even, I would say, meeting for rate increases next year is that, that inventory is being taken back out of the system to bring it down to what actually has been produced and the requirements seen for, in particular, the engine manufacturers towards their own year-end and the inventory that they're carrying. So there\u2019s point in carrying say, additional air flows when you have some of the other parts to go with the engine. It's pretty -- simple, David.\nDavid Strauss : And John, do you see, at least from your side where you sit, any constraints, whether it be hiring additional headcount, training headcount, raw material, anything? Do you see constraints to go up to the mid-50s to 60 that Airbus is talking about on narrowbody and Boeing going up to, let's say, low 40s? Do you see a constraint from your side of things?\nJohn Plant : Not from our side. We think our tight quantity in structural castings have been or are being addressed and so that's in good shape. We are going to pull back on our hiring, as I said, again, selectively. So we will continue, for example, hiring and training in our structural casting plants. But at the moment, if you take our airfoils, we will just stay with the labor we had at the end of the third quarter and pause it to balance our own requirements. So far, we've been able to increase our quantity of people, and it hasn't really presented a great impediment to us. Sometimes the turnover of those people has been higher than we'd like, but the quantity of labor has not been an issue for us so far.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Myles Walton with Wolfe.\nMyles Walton : Looking sequentially into 4Q, it looks like you're looking for a $4 million EBITDA growth on the $40 million of sales growth. Just curious, is that lower incremental driven by something like FX or mix, it sounds like labor is probably a help and raw material pass-through might be a push?\nJohn Plant : So can you start the first sentence again, if you wouldn't mind?\nMyles Walton : Yes, sure thing, John. So if I just look sequentially from 3Q to 4Q, you've got pretty minimal EBITDA growth, about $4 million on the $40 million sales growth. I'm just curious the holding you back if labor and raw materials and pass-through aren't the issue?\nJohn Plant : So let me start with commentary regarding the third quarter first. I mean adjusted for the material pass-through, incrementals were really strong at 39%which was above the, I'll say, the midpoint of where we talked previously, you said 35% plus or minus 5%. So I think that was a really strong quarter. The reason why we are being cautious about our fourth quarter is that we're carrying that labor into the fourth quarter that we probably don't need now for that reduced level of build. And so there's a labor drag plus also in the preparation of, I'll say, a lot of other production parts and facilities that could go along with that. And so that's the reason why you're not seeing the same level of incremental pull-through in the first -- I mean, in the fourth quarter. So I think you should look at that just as a rebalancing of ourselves as we have drawn down that $70 million plus of engine products, which is a high-margin business for us. And so I think it's completely in line with the commentary I've given.\nMyles Walton : Okay. Fair enough. And then in that 10% growth sales in '23, do you have a flavor for what we should think about from incremental margins there?\nJohn Plant : I think we'll talk more about that in the February call. I know that last year, I gave a revenue guide, I thought it was important for '22. I think the same is important. So we really understand the wider picture around the company. And having the confidence that we should be anywhere from, I would say, 10%, plus or minus 8% to 12% is a statement of confidence in that we're on trajectory and we're only just debating the angle of the recovery, either which rates above the normal for aerospace, if aerospace is normally 4% or 5%, it's more than double that rate. And so it's pretty healthy. But not -- we're not ready to give any margin guidance at this point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman : John, I wonder the -- so the 10% growth outlook for next year if aerospace is growing 20%, and that's, let's say, 45% of the sales base this year, it implies really minimal growth in the rest of the portfolio. So if you could just talk about the -- what's happening in the other end markets? And then specifically, maybe help us around forged wheels. I mean between the currency and energy pass-throughs and aluminum pass-throughs, there's a lot of ups and downs, especially in terms of the revenue numbers and the margin rate. But if we think about the baseline of EBITDA dollars there and what this quarter says about what that might be going forward, any help there would be appreciated as well?\nJohn Plant : Okay. So in terms of the defense business and oil and gas and the industrial gas turbine, I think all of those will see at this point, a low single-digit growth. And my guess is that maybe oil and gas will be higher, maybe defense below, but still expecting some growth in those. So if you plan for that and lay it across with the commercial aero, then the 1 segment where I think we're going to see a revenue decrease will be in the forged wheel business for the Commercial Transportation segment. So let me try to explain what we see there. I mean the first thing is, of course, the headline number is affected by the price of aluminium, because as aluminum has fallen during the course of this year from its peak of $4,500 a ton, including Midwest premiums or Rotterdam premiums is that it's more like probably $2,800 now. And as we rebalance the pricing because we will pass that back, then you get a couple of effects of those new prices going into effect on the 1st of January is that there is a revenue decline, which doesn't affect the EBITDA dollars, and therefore, there is a margin rate improvement from that. At the same time, let me think about what do we expect by way of volumes? We do note that the order intake, for example, for Class 8 truck was the highest it's ever been in a September, I think, 53,000 plus trucks, which is really, I'd say, great number, probably inflated by the fact that many say, the truck manufacturers haven't been willing to take orders for next year until they were clearer regarding the input prices of their materials. So it's difficult to separate out what's really going on, except that the fourth quarter should see solid production improved compared to we've been, and I think that will continue in the first and second quarters next year. And my caution at the moment is in the second half of next year when I think we'll see the effect of the higher interest rates bear on the economies, in particular in Europe, which is overlaid with energy prices. And so I think there will be a dampening of demand. And it's probably around more the distribution and the trader segment of the business. And so my anticipation is that second half of next year will be a tougher comparison to the second half of this year. And I mean, obviously, it's only speculative at this stage because I want to be cautious about it. But I think the correct planning assumption is solid performance through the next 3 quarters then anticipate a bit of a drawdown depending on how the economy is really doing. And does it go into a recession or not and then try to make the assessment. So the best I can do at this stage is that when I look at it, my guesstimate has been something like on a volume basis that we could be, let's say, I just -- can you give an example of the thought at the moment is on the year, maybe 300, 000 or 400,000 wheels down in volume. We will probably pull half of that back by additional penetration of aluminum versus steel, and I'll say another I'll say, programs, we have to increase our share. But net, I'm thinking that a little bit of volume caution in the second half plus with the effect of the aluminum reduction, we'll produce a drawdown of revenue albeit the only effect on EBITDA will be that net drawdown of volume should it occur. And I don't think there's a reason to be optimistic and say, all is great, and it will continue.  I don't think it's going to -- we are going to be affected by the emissions legislation for '24 because there's an inability to build ahead. And so it's all down to that second half assumption of next year or so, which is just to guess on commercial wheels at this stage, nothing -- nobody knows. But the way I put it out there, it's going to be good.  If you -- so if you put that wheeling as a down at the other single digit in commercial, I think you can get to the guidance range of that 8% to 12%.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag : John, you've been clear that you now have the labor in place to ramp up next year. So when you think about their training, you said 6 months or so, how much have they pressured margins to have labor this early. And how should we think about incremental margins next year when we actually get the benefit of volume coming through?\nJohn Plant : Okay. Well, we're going to pause for the main in Q4 for recruitment, not totally. It will be 2 or 3 or 4 plants that will continue, but out of our complete network we are choosing to pause that at this stage until we know more and let the additional people that we've already recruited during this recovery, which is some, I'll say, 2,500 come up to rate and let that hopefully, productivity improve.  Depending on the job, it can take anywhere from I'm going to say, 3 months to bring in somebody into the plant and to be, I'll say, reasonably effective all the way up to 2 years and beyond for some skilled areas, and we have to move people around to try to balance all that out. So I think there will be a benefit for that stabilization. How much, its difficult to say at this stage. And it obviously depends on the growth next year. We will commence recruitment again in larger numbers in January as we expect the build rate to increase in January. We'll go to the first quarter taking some of it out of inventory, certainly fourth quarter, but we\u2019ll continue then to restart and fire up to recruit people again. And so that's headcount availing. I\u2019m not yet ready to give any commentary about margins for 2023 at this point.\nKristine Liwag : And maybe following up on the inventory build, the castings and the shortage in castings and forgings have been well publicized and the OEMs have been very clear that the strong demand for aircraft out there. I guess I would have thought that we'd be in an environment of full steam ahead for demand for your product. What's causing the uncertainty? And also with the $80 million inventory headwind that you highlighted in this quarter, when does this unwind? And where could peak balance be?\nJohn Plant : I think everybody expected continued buoyancy as we did for increases in builds. I think they are occurring. It's only a question of degree. And as I said, if we haven't built as many aircraft has there been thought and there seems to be a case where that's correct, you're just going off the earnings calls last year from the airframe manufacturers. And while there's a notable and real improvement in engine build, it still is in aggregate, I think a little bit lower than people had probably planned for. And so I mean, everybody is trying really hard throughout the whole system. Airlines are doing well and improving, their trying hard and getting people and bringing aircraft back into service. I think the engine manufacturers are trying really hard. Now I think the airframe manufacturers -- yeah, everybody\u2019s trying really hard to get up this ramp and deal with all the factors that they've had to cope with in terms of -- which starts with COVID and the supply shortages and freight rates and just training of labor and availability and then other, I'll say, impediments in other materials in the supply chain. So there's been a lot going on. So I think everybody is trying to do the right thing. And I think all we're talking about here for Howmet is that where some of our parts are being brought into line with what they cash for elsewhere and maybe just a little bit of a less ambitious plan in terms of build rates just because I mean we -- I think you can see that probably we haven't built -- or there has not been as many MAX\u2019s built or maybe as many narrow-body Airbus\u2019s built as visually envisaged, is my guesstimate from trying to assess the information available from what's been said publicly on the earnings calls of all the companies.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Elizabeth Grenfell with Bank of America.\nElizabeth Grenfell: How are the different customers prioritized in your queue? Are more profitable customers prioritized first? And then -- I'll start with that.\nJohn Plant : Okay. No, we treat every customer, their requirements with equal respect. So there's no prioritization, I don't think that would be appropriate. You're either a customer and we make a commitment and when we do that, we deliver to you to the very best of our abilities.\nElizabeth Grenfell: Okay. So if you had a certain number to ship out and the demand was mismatched, there would be no prioritization in terms of who got what?\nJohn Plant : No, I don't think so. I think we should, again, respect that there's a requirement our customers have placed on us. I don't think that we have a policy nor a plan nor even the ability. So if you think about our shipping docs, they operate to the MRP schedule, the customer demand and they ship. They don't say I'll stick a few extra boxes of parts to some because they're more profitable. The people who do that, they don't have that information. So no, we supply to that which we've committed and with no instruction to say, please send to this customer because they're more profitable now.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: John, could you maybe just give us a broader update on where your market share gain efforts stand? It seems like that's maybe happening in part related to these supply chain challenges across the engine supply chain and then also titanium sourcing. And I know you've talked about sort of being in different RFP processes and trying to write long-term contracts? And I'm curious how that's going.\nJohn Plant : Yes. So as a more general note, we go through our own planning routines during the course of the year. And we try to run through in terms of review each of our customers and where those opportunities may lie. And then we have our planning round where we look at, so where is the best place to place resources, both engineering and then capital deployment. And with a view that our job as a set of executives is to basically grow above the market rates. My view is that if we only grow at market rates, then we're not adding the value that we should be because we should be seeking to do more than that. And more than that, just noting in terms of margin performance, but in particular, the opportunity to grow our share or take content into Howmet. So that's the basic stance that we have, Noah. And then once we've got that on the see before us, all of the opportunities, then at that point, we can make our own resource decisions whether we allocate more capital to this area or in that area according to the prospect of returns for it. And clearly, at that point, then we resource allocate. So it isn't a matter of just bottoms up, we just -- there's a process where everybody wants more capital or more resources, everybody gets a fair shake on it. It's not that at all, it's more. These are all the opportunities. And then our job as the leadership of the company is to then determine how we allocate.  So whereas on the last question from Elizabeth, she was asking, do we prioritize in the short term and the immediacy of deliveries, no, we don't. But in the long term, absolutely, we do. So we do resource allocate to those different areas and have a clear process for doing so. And with the objective of meeting the target to be above the rate of normal increase for those end markets we serve.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. And last quarter, I think you specified adding $20 million of revenue to the fourth quarter fairly specifically related to titanium sourcing. Any update on that specifically and how that looks beyond this year?\nJohn Plant : It clearly continues to improve. We've booked more orders in the end in the third quarter into the fourth quarter, and that continues to be a positive for us. But it's still continuing, and we have 1 major manufacturer where we've engaged but still yet to really move in terms of any significant orders essentially because there's a lot of inventory of titanium in the system at the moment with that reduced wide-body build that we talked about. So more to come. I'm hopeful that we'll give you some improved assessment in February. But at the moment, if we just -- just assume that we are on track to achieve that $20 million or slightly better for the fourth quarter, and it will continue to improve in 2023 and 2024.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.\nMatt Akers: Could you touch on the defense decline in the quarter, and specifically, I guess, the F-35, some of the inventory corrections you saw how much longer does that still have to go on?\nJohn Plant : Yes. So our assumption is that Lockheed do produce somewhere in that $1.45 to $1.55 range this year. And if anything, probably let's say, just take the $150 million or a little bit less, is probably the -- our assumption, which will be an increase on the production in last year. We do note that the order intake for F-35 seems particularly strong. And so that 150 plus rates should continue, we think, probably for the rest of the decade. And so that's all good news.  For us specifically, because for the last 2 years of 2020 and 2021, we did produce at a higher rate for the customer sort of schedule requirements anticipating as they did, I think they would make closer to the 150 aircraft. And as we know they produced probably in that 130 to 140 range and therefore, they carry the inventory into this year, which we said we would correct for the most part, during 2022. So in particular, for the airframe and bulkheads part of the aircraft is that we've seen that downdraft, and we've commented on that affecting our structures business, and Ken called it out again in Q3 as the major factor on the impact on defense sales that continued the inventory correction.  Our view is that, that will continue in Q4 and into Q1 next year, and we're hopeful that by the second half of next year, the latest is that we are in balance. And so our production will be coming up on the F-35 to match rate, which will obviously be a significant improvement for us. And if that's combined with the increase in rates for the 787 then we should see some very positive demand requirements for our structures business in particular. And that's also part of my expectation within that range of guidance given to you for 2023?\nMatt Akers: That's helpful. And then if I could do 1 more on pension. I guess, I know you mentioned with a higher rate, but the liability, it's a little bit better. But I guess when you factor in asset returns year-to-date, is it meaningfully different kind of next year versus 2022?\nJohn Plant : Yes. I'll pass that across to Ken to give you a little bit more color on that. But essentially, as interest rates have moved up, then that provides a downdraft on the liability side significance. Asset returns this year are lighter and lower than last year, and I don't have the exact numbers to hand, that will be a negative for that situation. And then when you put 2 together, is that along with the cash contributions we have made, we have a net liability reduction. And my anticipation is that we'll show further reduction of liability in the fourth quarter to make a meaningful change in the reduction of those legacy liabilities. And I think on a net basis, we're probably down to I mean, I guess, around $700 million-ish plus or minus. So it's a pretty diminish number for the company now, very different than it was 2 or 3 years ago. But let me pass you across to Ken to comment specifically on the expected liabilities and assets.\nKen Giacobbe: Yes. So Matt, we've been doing a lot of work on the pension and OPEB program. So if you compare to where we are today, we've improved around $85 million in terms of net liability. A lot of that's driven by actions we started taking to clip off gross liabilities going back to Q2 of 2020, believe it or not, when we took out some U.K. buyout programs. But from Q2 of 2020 to current, we've taken off about $600 million of actions, right? So that's helping drive the net liability down. But as John mentioned, at the end of the year, we\u2019ll snap the line again in terms of where we're at. We get a nice favorability around discount rates because discount rates have moved from around 2.7% at the end of last year to mid-5% right now. So you're going to get a nice good guy on the liability side. To your point, the assets, if you even just track the S&P 500, they will be negative. You pushed the 2 of them together, though, you're going to get a nice reduction in terms of net liability. Also, we've got to get to the end of the year, but we anticipate cash contributions next year will probably be the same, if not less, based on all the work that we've done over the years.\nJohn Plant : Maybe I'll just add to give you a bit of a broader perspective. So when I think about the environment we're in where interest rates are going up rapidly, and it's possible this week we'll see a further 75 basis points increase in federal funds rate. I mean that generally is bad news for most companies. In the case of ourselves on a net basis is that if I look at our debt then essentially all of our debt is fixed rate. And so it only can impact the refinancing of an exchange of bonds depending on what we've paid down of those bonds as well.  So I'm not anticipating that our interest rate costs go up at all in the next 2 or 3 years. So that's good. Our pension liabilities will go down, and that's good. And when I think about the markets we serve, I think we've already had our recession in the time of 2020, 2021 and the effects of COVID and then overlay that with the specific issues that Boeing had regarding production of C-737 and 787. And so we should be set for -- maybe uniquely as a sector set for growth for the next 2 or 3 years. And that growth should come through and our balance sheet should improve as a result of the interest rate movement. So it's a pretty unique and good set of circumstances. That's my optimism coming through. \nOperator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session and also concluding today's call. We'd like to thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, P.T., and welcome everyone. Let's move to Slide 4. Howmet continued to perform well in the third quarter, earnings per share were in line with guidance midpoint and EBITDA margin was strong at 22.5%. Revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share, all grew for the fifth consecutive quarter. Q3 revenue was $1.433 billion and was factually lower compared to the midpoint of guidance of $1.44 billion.  All aerospace segments showed strong performance with sequential growth in the third quarter. Commercial transportation was lower reflecting normal seasonality and the effect of the wheels [indiscernible], which has now been resolved and production at the site brought back fully online as of the third week of October.  In September, we saw Commercial Aerospace customers rebate their schedules, notably in engine products, reflecting two dynamics. Firstly, a lower narrow body engine build over the summer and early fall than was originally envisaged, and due partially to the availability of structural castings. And secondly, customers bringing airfoil inventory levels in line by year end. I'll provide further commentary in the outlook section of my remarks. EBITDA was $323 million and further progression on Q1 and Q2 of the year. Free cash flow was positive as forecasted, however, impacted by carrying higher commercial aerospace inventory levels, again, due to the scheduled rebalances of our customers. Q3 ending cash was a healthy $454 million after repurchasing approximately 2.8 million shares for $100 million at an average price of $36.17 per share and also paying the quarterly dividend. Legacy pension and OPEB liabilities continue to be reduced, which resulted in a reduced year-to-date cash contributions of approximately 45%. I'll now pass the call to Ken for commentary by end markets and by each business segment. Thanks, Ken. So let's move to Slide #11. First, let me comment on the wider picture in commercial aerospace. Recovery continues with increasing airline schedules and load factors, especially in Europe and North America. Airline profits are rebounding well, and new aircraft are being ordered, especially narrow-body aircraft. International travel has also rebounded during the year and is showing strength, which is leading to modest increased production as we move into 2023, notably Airbus A350 and the Boeing 787 after its recent recertification. Spares for the aftermarket also continued to increase. This trend provides optimism that aircraft build volume will continue to strengthen throughout 2023 and 2024.  Recent aircraft build rate issues have been more the result of parts availability, especially but not confined to engines. While we have to be cautious at this time, pending more visibility of unrestricted builds, allowing Airbus to reach their build levels of 55 per month for the A320, and Boeing to reach their build levels of 31 per month on the 737 MAX, we do envisage \u2013 envision that commercial aerospace revenue should be up around 20% in 2023. Consolidated Howmet, including commercial aerospace and its other sectors of defense, industrial gas turbine, oil and gas and commercial transportation is expected to be up approximately 10% plus or minus 2% in revenue. Further refinement will be provided in February 2023 upon the release of Q4 earnings. In the more immediate time frame of Q4, we do envision further sequential growth. However, approximately $70 million of lower revenue compared to previously envisaged primarily in engine products as a result of the lower engine bill achieved and customer inventory drawdown or the end of year toward my earlier comments. This results in an annual guide of $5.62 billion due to a small offset in other business areas beyond engine and earnings per share of $0.38 in the fourth quarter, which again is another sequential increase as we've shown in each quarter of 2022. Higher inventory will now be needed at year-end to accommodate the snapback and increasing build starting in the first quarter of next year once we've got through this inventory correction. More specifically, the guidance for Q4 is as follows: revenue, $1.47 billion, plus $30 million, minus $20 million; EBITDA $330 million, plus $6 million, minus $5 million; earnings per share of $0.38, plus or minus $0.01. For the full year, revenue of $5.62 billion, plus $30 million, minus $20 million; EBITDA of $1.27 billion, plus $6 million, minus $5 million; earnings per share of $1.40, plus or minus $0.01 as we've narrowed the range from previous guidance. Free cash flow of $560 million, plus $20 million, minus $40 million, and this is driven -- this reduction compared to prior guidance is driven by the higher year-end inventory carried into 2023 for the continued commercial growth -- aerospace growth in the first quarter. Let's move to Slide 12 for summary. 2022 is another solid year with increases of revenue and profit building in each quarter and sequentially into Q4. Momentum does continue into 2023 with commercial aerospace expected to perform above normal growth rates in 2023, 2024 and also 2025 before reverting to a more normal 4% per year growth for Aerospace. We look forward to the future. So let's now take your questions. Okay. So First of all, let me agree with you that it is confusing, I think it's confusing for everybody at the moment. But let's start off with the broad picture and then talk about Howmet before any commentary on a wider basis. So I think the big picture is commercial aerospace continues to grind higher. Everybody is trying to do the right things. And airlines are improving. I think aerospace manufacturers are improving their throughputs and the engine manufacturer supporting those aircraft builds are also doing their part of the whole thing. I guess not everything is going perfectly, as we've seen from some of the numbers and some of the disconnects apparent from commentary on calls last week. Let me deal with Howmet first and say, we've been really well prepared through the last year and beyond. As you know, we started recruitment of labor in the second quarter of last year and hired almost 1,000 people last year. Through year-to-date, I think we're approaching now something like 1,500 people through the end of the third quarter. And then I think the most salient factor for ourselves was that during September is that compared to the schedules and delivery requirements that we thought we would see for both September and the fourth quarter, we saw a complete rebasing of those requirements where we've had arrears which should be built up according to, I think, the anticipated engine mills, in particular. And as we know, the anticipated engine builds were not as high as -- the actual is not as high as anticipated. And you saw Airbus commenting on the fact they had lied us in the like 70 at one point, then it was down to maybe 10 or 20. So while I'll say deliveries of engines did improve, I don't think anybody believes that the quantity of engines that was originally envisaged to be built were built. In terms of the splits of whatever was delivered on LEAP between 1A, 1B, 1C, we don't have any visibility into that. I mean we do note that from the call last week from GE Aviation, which provides a lot of those engines is that they were significantly up with an improved deliveries, I think, in the near 350 engines. How many went to Airbus, how many went to Boeing, COMAC. And indeed, how many of those engines, which we also -- you sometimes forget they go to airlines or spares and also aircraft leasing companies or spares, I don't really know, it's difficult to judge. Certainly, you feel as though there was enough engines in the whole system, but maybe they were out of parts of the -- difficult to really know. Nevertheless, the big picture is those actual builds both by CFM engines and LEAP engines were less than a bit envisaged. And I think we've heard in the past about restrictions around structural castings in particular, probably not confined just to that. And therefore, when customers looked at where they were and what they expected to finish the year with and also where they had received from ourselves, for example, all of the airfoils they required and more maybe is to balance their own inventories for the end of the year is that they were cut back. And so despite still sequential growth quarter-on-quarter that growth is not as high as we had envisaged.  So right now, we've drawn our labor recruitment down significantly. So we'll be -- probably recruit selective in a few areas in the fourth quarter. Essentially, the rest will go to 0. And because we don't want to certainly stop production, we're going to carry about $70 million of additional inventory, which will hit our cash balance at the end of the year. And as we need that that inventory to carry us through into the first quarter where we do expect those requirements will be placed back on us significantly, engine build will improve, and hopefully, aircraft production will improve.  And so we're trying to smooth ourselves out. So we'll utilize all of the labor that we've recruited, carry on with production, put it into inventory. So we have a smooth startup into the start of next year. So we keep all of our customers happy. But it does enable us to stop ourselves hiring a lot of people, and so we will eliminate some of that cost, albeit, as you can imagine, we were holding that cost in the month of September than we are into the balance of the year.So that's the big picture.  In terms of exactly what the rate of production of the 737 is and the A320, I don't think we are best placed to answer and I believe that most people are heading off on the sell side to Seattle this week so you really get a clearer picture during those visits. So I don't know, whether that covers it out for you, rob, but just trying to give you a sweep through the whole situation. We have a revised skyline for next year. We don't have much for this year. I think it's going to be de minimis of any production on the 87. My guess is it's probably just about month that we've seen previously. I don't really know. It's pretty opaque to us. And I'm assuming there's inventory in the system for that.  We do have skylines showing clear improvements on the 787 build during the course of next year. And I think from memory, it's probably the back end of the year at around about 5 aircraft per month. And I do have confidence that there is a market requirement for that because when I look at the return of international demand for travel, just look at, I'll say, the cutbacks that were made in widebody during the last few years, then if anything, my guess is that there's going to be a higher demand on wide-body, which will support a rate for both Airbus and for Boeing for their A350s and 787s above that rate. So I'm actually tending towards the optimistic side of fundamental demand. And then the only question that we have is, in terms of our own guidance is how conservative should we be because we do hear this noise that you referred to about exactly how many were made and where that parts are and what are the constraints. And so that also causes us to be just a little bit cautious given the factors that we've encountered in the last month or 2 enrolling into the end of the year, albeit against we see that spiking up in the first quarter. In the -- I mean, the biggest pinch points for engine we would like to think has been around the structural castings. There's probably some engine controllers as well, but I don't really know that. It's probably lots of other things, which I'm not fully aware of. But I think the commentary around structural castings is pretty widely publicized. In the short term, it doesn't really -- it presents an opportunity to us because there is a specific tooling and certification procedures which are required. And so it really is a case of getting the structural castings from the relevant supplier.  In terms of ourselves, while we have been tighter than we'd like on structural castings is that we don't believe that we've caused any engine build issues and indeed beginning to see in that segment significant improvements in our throughput and abilities. And its not quite as good as the flow of air flows that we've been seeing because that's been a really, I'll say, high-class output for us during the year. But short term, nothing we can point to, I think, in the medium to longer term, we will see benefits on the structural casting side across the various sectors of the industry. But nothing for us to put into a, let's say, 2023 planning at all. On titanium, which was your other question, is that those orders continue to improve. So we've booked additional orders for -- during the third and fourth quarter, and that's looking better for us, albeit there's still significant areas to go because we still have, in particular, 1 of the airframe manufacturers, which has got a lot of inventory and hasn't really yet moved to cut orders lease on the supply base. So more to come on that subject as we move into next year. Yes. We've been building at rates. So we've taken the requirements from our engine customers and the airframe manufacturers, and we've just been more or less in line with that, I'll say, 50-plus for A320s as an example. Probably with some attempted inventory for the infill rate build increases next year. And in the case of Boeing, we were fully planning on the 31 a month and had anticipated that those according to, let's say, verbal communication, not any scheduled commitments, originally, were planned to rise during the first quarter of 2023. As we all know that those production levels probably have not been achieved and the airframe manufacturers and certainly on the engine side, and so where we've been in line at or even, I would say, meeting for rate increases next year is that, that inventory is being taken back out of the system to bring it down to what actually has been produced and the requirements seen for, in particular, the engine manufacturers towards their own year-end and the inventory that they're carrying. So there's point in carrying say, additional air flows when you have some of the other parts to go with the engine. It's pretty -- simple, David. Not from our side. We think our tight quantity in structural castings have been or are being addressed and so that's in good shape. We are going to pull back on our hiring, as I said, again, selectively. So we will continue, for example, hiring and training in our structural casting plants. But at the moment, if you take our airfoils, we will just stay with the labor we had at the end of the third quarter and pause it to balance our own requirements. So far, we've been able to increase our quantity of people, and it hasn't really presented a great impediment to us. Sometimes the turnover of those people has been higher than we'd like, but the quantity of labor has not been an issue for us so far. So can you start the first sentence again, if you wouldn't mind? So let me start with commentary regarding the third quarter first. I mean adjusted for the material pass-through, incrementals were really strong at 39%which was above the, I'll say, the midpoint of where we talked previously, you said 35% plus or minus 5%. So I think that was a really strong quarter. The reason why we are being cautious about our fourth quarter is that we're carrying that labor into the fourth quarter that we probably don't need now for that reduced level of build. And so there's a labor drag plus also in the preparation of, I'll say, a lot of other production parts and facilities that could go along with that. And so that's the reason why you're not seeing the same level of incremental pull-through in the first -- I mean, in the fourth quarter. So I think you should look at that just as a rebalancing of ourselves as we have drawn down that $70 million plus of engine products, which is a high-margin business for us. And so I think it's completely in line with the commentary I've given. I think we'll talk more about that in the February call. I know that last year, I gave a revenue guide, I thought it was important for '22. I think the same is important. So we really understand the wider picture around the company. And having the confidence that we should be anywhere from, I would say, 10%, plus or minus 8% to 12% is a statement of confidence in that we're on trajectory and we're only just debating the angle of the recovery, either which rates above the normal for aerospace, if aerospace is normally 4% or 5%, it's more than double that rate. And so it's pretty healthy. But not -- we're not ready to give any margin guidance at this point. Okay. So in terms of the defense business and oil and gas and the industrial gas turbine, I think all of those will see at this point, a low single-digit growth. And my guess is that maybe oil and gas will be higher, maybe defense below, but still expecting some growth in those. So if you plan for that and lay it across with the commercial aero, then the 1 segment where I think we're going to see a revenue decrease will be in the forged wheel business for the Commercial Transportation segment. So let me try to explain what we see there. I mean the first thing is, of course, the headline number is affected by the price of aluminium, because as aluminum has fallen during the course of this year from its peak of $4,500 a ton, including Midwest premiums or Rotterdam premiums is that it's more like probably $2,800 now. And as we rebalance the pricing because we will pass that back, then you get a couple of effects of those new prices going into effect on the 1st of January is that there is a revenue decline, which doesn't affect the EBITDA dollars, and therefore, there is a margin rate improvement from that. At the same time, let me think about what do we expect by way of volumes? We do note that the order intake, for example, for Class 8 truck was the highest it's ever been in a September, I think, 53,000 plus trucks, which is really, I'd say, great number, probably inflated by the fact that many say, the truck manufacturers haven't been willing to take orders for next year until they were clearer regarding the input prices of their materials. So it's difficult to separate out what's really going on, except that the fourth quarter should see solid production improved compared to we've been, and I think that will continue in the first and second quarters next year. And my caution at the moment is in the second half of next year when I think we'll see the effect of the higher interest rates bear on the economies, in particular in Europe, which is overlaid with energy prices. And so I think there will be a dampening of demand. And it's probably around more the distribution and the trader segment of the business. And so my anticipation is that second half of next year will be a tougher comparison to the second half of this year. And I mean, obviously, it's only speculative at this stage because I want to be cautious about it. But I think the correct planning assumption is solid performance through the next 3 quarters then anticipate a bit of a drawdown depending on how the economy is really doing. And does it go into a recession or not and then try to make the assessment. So the best I can do at this stage is that when I look at it, my guesstimate has been something like on a volume basis that we could be, let's say, I just -- can you give an example of the thought at the moment is on the year, maybe 300, 000 or 400,000 wheels down in volume. We will probably pull half of that back by additional penetration of aluminum versus steel, and I'll say another I'll say, programs, we have to increase our share. But net, I'm thinking that a little bit of volume caution in the second half plus with the effect of the aluminum reduction, we'll produce a drawdown of revenue albeit the only effect on EBITDA will be that net drawdown of volume should it occur. And I don't think there's a reason to be optimistic and say, all is great, and it will continue.  I don't think it's going to -- we are going to be affected by the emissions legislation for '24 because there's an inability to build ahead. And so it's all down to that second half assumption of next year or so, which is just to guess on commercial wheels at this stage, nothing -- nobody knows. But the way I put it out there, it's going to be good.  If you -- so if you put that wheeling as a down at the other single digit in commercial, I think you can get to the guidance range of that 8% to 12%. Okay. Well, we're going to pause for the main in Q4 for recruitment, not totally. It will be 2 or 3 or 4 plants that will continue, but out of our complete network we are choosing to pause that at this stage until we know more and let the additional people that we've already recruited during this recovery, which is some, I'll say, 2,500 come up to rate and let that hopefully, productivity improve.  Depending on the job, it can take anywhere from I'm going to say, 3 months to bring in somebody into the plant and to be, I'll say, reasonably effective all the way up to 2 years and beyond for some skilled areas, and we have to move people around to try to balance all that out. So I think there will be a benefit for that stabilization. How much, its difficult to say at this stage. And it obviously depends on the growth next year. We will commence recruitment again in larger numbers in January as we expect the build rate to increase in January. We'll go to the first quarter taking some of it out of inventory, certainly fourth quarter, but we'll continue then to restart and fire up to recruit people again. And so that's headcount availing. I'm not yet ready to give any commentary about margins for 2023 at this point. I think everybody expected continued buoyancy as we did for increases in builds. I think they are occurring. It's only a question of degree. And as I said, if we haven't built as many aircraft has there been thought and there seems to be a case where that's correct, you're just going off the earnings calls last year from the airframe manufacturers. And while there's a notable and real improvement in engine build, it still is in aggregate, I think a little bit lower than people had probably planned for. And so I mean, everybody is trying really hard throughout the whole system. Airlines are doing well and improving, their trying hard and getting people and bringing aircraft back into service. I think the engine manufacturers are trying really hard. Now I think the airframe manufacturers -- yeah, everybody's trying really hard to get up this ramp and deal with all the factors that they've had to cope with in terms of -- which starts with COVID and the supply shortages and freight rates and just training of labor and availability and then other, I'll say, impediments in other materials in the supply chain. So there's been a lot going on. So I think everybody is trying to do the right thing. And I think all we're talking about here for Howmet is that where some of our parts are being brought into line with what they cash for elsewhere and maybe just a little bit of a less ambitious plan in terms of build rates just because I mean we -- I think you can see that probably we haven't built -- or there has not been as many MAX's built or maybe as many narrow-body Airbus's built as visually envisaged, is my guesstimate from trying to assess the information available from what's been said publicly on the earnings calls of all the companies. Okay. No, we treat every customer, their requirements with equal respect. So there's no prioritization, I don't think that would be appropriate. You're either a customer and we make a commitment and when we do that, we deliver to you to the very best of our abilities. No, I don't think so. I think we should, again, respect that there's a requirement our customers have placed on us. I don't think that we have a policy nor a plan nor even the ability. So if you think about our shipping docs, they operate to the MRP schedule, the customer demand and they ship. They don't say I'll stick a few extra boxes of parts to some because they're more profitable. The people who do that, they don't have that information. So no, we supply to that which we've committed and with no instruction to say, please send to this customer because they're more profitable now. Yes. So as a more general note, we go through our own planning routines during the course of the year. And we try to run through in terms of review each of our customers and where those opportunities may lie. And then we have our planning round where we look at, so where is the best place to place resources, both engineering and then capital deployment. And with a view that our job as a set of executives is to basically grow above the market rates. My view is that if we only grow at market rates, then we're not adding the value that we should be because we should be seeking to do more than that. And more than that, just noting in terms of margin performance, but in particular, the opportunity to grow our share or take content into Howmet. So that's the basic stance that we have, Noah. And then once we've got that on the see before us, all of the opportunities, then at that point, we can make our own resource decisions whether we allocate more capital to this area or in that area according to the prospect of returns for it. And clearly, at that point, then we resource allocate. So it isn't a matter of just bottoms up, we just -- there's a process where everybody wants more capital or more resources, everybody gets a fair shake on it. It's not that at all, it's more. These are all the opportunities. And then our job as the leadership of the company is to then determine how we allocate.  So whereas on the last question from Elizabeth, she was asking, do we prioritize in the short term and the immediacy of deliveries, no, we don't. But in the long term, absolutely, we do. So we do resource allocate to those different areas and have a clear process for doing so. And with the objective of meeting the target to be above the rate of normal increase for those end markets we serve. It clearly continues to improve. We've booked more orders in the end in the third quarter into the fourth quarter, and that continues to be a positive for us. But it's still continuing, and we have 1 major manufacturer where we've engaged but still yet to really move in terms of any significant orders essentially because there's a lot of inventory of titanium in the system at the moment with that reduced wide-body build that we talked about. So more to come. I'm hopeful that we'll give you some improved assessment in February. But at the moment, if we just -- just assume that we are on track to achieve that $20 million or slightly better for the fourth quarter, and it will continue to improve in 2023 and 2024. Yes. So our assumption is that Lockheed do produce somewhere in that $1.45 to $1.55 range this year. And if anything, probably let's say, just take the $150 million or a little bit less, is probably the -- our assumption, which will be an increase on the production in last year. We do note that the order intake for F-35 seems particularly strong. And so that 150 plus rates should continue, we think, probably for the rest of the decade. And so that's all good news.  For us specifically, because for the last 2 years of 2020 and 2021, we did produce at a higher rate for the customer sort of schedule requirements anticipating as they did, I think they would make closer to the 150 aircraft. And as we know they produced probably in that 130 to 140 range and therefore, they carry the inventory into this year, which we said we would correct for the most part, during 2022. So in particular, for the airframe and bulkheads part of the aircraft is that we've seen that downdraft, and we've commented on that affecting our structures business, and Ken called it out again in Q3 as the major factor on the impact on defense sales that continued the inventory correction.  Our view is that, that will continue in Q4 and into Q1 next year, and we're hopeful that by the second half of next year, the latest is that we are in balance. And so our production will be coming up on the F-35 to match rate, which will obviously be a significant improvement for us. And if that's combined with the increase in rates for the 787 then we should see some very positive demand requirements for our structures business in particular. And that's also part of my expectation within that range of guidance given to you for 2023? Yes. I'll pass that across to Ken to give you a little bit more color on that. But essentially, as interest rates have moved up, then that provides a downdraft on the liability side significance. Asset returns this year are lighter and lower than last year, and I don't have the exact numbers to hand, that will be a negative for that situation. And then when you put 2 together, is that along with the cash contributions we have made, we have a net liability reduction. And my anticipation is that we'll show further reduction of liability in the fourth quarter to make a meaningful change in the reduction of those legacy liabilities. And I think on a net basis, we're probably down to I mean, I guess, around $700 million-ish plus or minus. So it's a pretty diminish number for the company now, very different than it was 2 or 3 years ago. But let me pass you across to Ken to comment specifically on the expected liabilities and assets. Maybe I'll just add to give you a bit of a broader perspective. So when I think about the environment we're in where interest rates are going up rapidly, and it's possible this week we'll see a further 75 basis points increase in federal funds rate. I mean that generally is bad news for most companies. In the case of ourselves on a net basis is that if I look at our debt then essentially all of our debt is fixed rate. And so it only can impact the refinancing of an exchange of bonds depending on what we've paid down of those bonds as well.  So I'm not anticipating that our interest rate costs go up at all in the next 2 or 3 years. So that's good. Our pension liabilities will go down, and that's good. And when I think about the markets we serve, I think we've already had our recession in the time of 2020, 2021 and the effects of COVID and then overlay that with the specific issues that Boeing had regarding production of C-737 and 787. And so we should be set for -- maybe uniquely as a sector set for growth for the next 2 or 3 years. And that growth should come through and our balance sheet should improve as a result of the interest rate movement. So it's a pretty unique and good set of circumstances. That's my optimism coming through."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Please move to Slide 5 for an overview of the markets. Third quarter revenue was up 12% year-over-year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued in the third quarter, with commercial aerospace revenue up 23% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segment and the narrow body recovery. Commercial aerospace has grown for sixth consecutive quarter and stands at 47% of total revenue but continues to be far short of the pre-COVID level, which was 60% of total revenue. Defense Aerospace was down 4% year-over-year, driven by continued customer inventory corrections for the F-35, which was in line with our expectations. Commercial Transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segment was up 13% year-over-year driven by higher aluminum prices and higher volumes, partially offset by foreign currency. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was down 2% year-over-year. Within the industrial and other markets, oil and gas was up 11%, IGT was down 2% and general industrial was down 9% on a year-over-year basis. Now let's move to Slide 6. As usual, we'll start with the P&L and the focus on enhanced profitability. In the third quarter, revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share were all in line with guidance. Revenue was up 12% year-over-year, including material pass-through of approximately $70 million. EBITDA was $323 million, and EBITDA margin was a healthy 22.5%. If we exclude the $70 million impact of higher material pass-through, EBITDA margin was 120 basis points higher to 23.7%. Adjusting for material pass-through, the flow-through of incremental revenue in the quarter to EBITDA was strong at 39%. During Q3, we continued the recruitment of headcount by approximately 350 employees primarily in engines. Year-to-date, we have increased headcount by approximately 1,575 employees focused in engines and fasteners. In Q4, we do not expect significant headcount additions. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.36, up 33% year-over-year. For the quarter, the impact of foreign currency was minimal. Moving to the balance sheet. Free cash flow year-to-date was $130 million, including an inventory build of approximately $270 million primarily for the commercial aerospace recovery. Cash on hand was healthy at $454 million after buying back $100 million of common stock and funding the quarterly dividend. The average diluted share count improved to a Q3 exit rate of 419 million shares. Year-to-date, net pension and OPEB liabilities were reduced by approximately $85 million and cash contributions were reduced by approximately 45% or $35 million. Discount rates continue to be favorable and will be remeasured at the end of the year, which should further reduce net pension liabilities. We continue to expect annual cash contributions to be approximately $60 million versus expense of $20 million. Finally, net debt to EBITDA remains at 3x, all bond debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of our interest rate expense. Our next bond maturity is in November of 2024. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. Capital expenditures continue to be less than depreciation at approximately 65% in the third quarter. Productivity CapEx continues to focus on automation products, projects in the engines and fasteners business to improve yields, enhance quality, reduce outsourcing and mitigate labor risk. We purchased approximately 2.8 million shares of common stock in the quarter from $100 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 9.7 million shares of common stock for $335 million with an average acquisition price of $34.60 per share. Share buyback authority from the Board of Directors stands at $1 billion. Lastly, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. The quarterly dividend was doubled to $0.04 per share per quarter with the first higher payment to be made in November of 2022. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover segment results. Q3 was another solid quarter for engines. Year-over-year revenue was 14% higher in the third quarter with commercial aerospace up 30%, driven by the narrow body recovery. Defense Aerospace was down 5%, IGT was down 2% and oil and gas was up 11%. EBITDA increased 23% year-over-year and margin improved 200 basis points to 27.2%, despite adding approximately 260 employees in the third quarter. Year-to-date net headcount additions for the engine business was approximately 1,040 employees. While the headcount additions are preparing us for the future commercial aerospace growth, it does unfavorably impact near-term results due to the time and cost required to train new employees, which could take several months depending on the position. Now let's move to Slide 8. Fasting Systems year-over-year revenue was 15% higher in the third quarter. Commercial aerospace was 24% higher driven by the narrow-body recovery, somewhat offset by continued production declines for the Boeing 787. Defense Aerospace was up 16%. Year-over-year segment EBITDA increased 8% despite the addition of employees to support future growth. Year-to-date headcount additions for fasteners was approximately 410 employees. Sequentially, EBITDA margin improved 180 basis points to 22%. Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was down 3% in the quarter. Defense Aerospace was down 14% year-over-year, driven by customer inventory corrections for the F-35 as expected. Commercial aerospace was 5% higher as the narrow-body recovery offset the impact of production declines for the Boeing 787. Segment EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year. EBITDA margin improved 140 basis points to 14.5% despite the inventory burn down of the F-35, continued 0 to low build on the 787 and inflationary cost pressures. Structures Q3 2022 EBITDA margin of 14.5% was greater than the 2019 annual rate of 14.2% and when 2019 revenues were over $1.25 billion. Finally, let's move to Slide 10. As expected, Portsville's year-over-year revenue was 15% higher in the third quarter. The $35 million increase in revenue year-over-year was almost entirely driven by higher aluminum prices. Commercial transportation demand remained strong, but volumes continue to be impacted by customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production.  Segment EBITDA decreased 11% due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, primarily driven by the euro. While the pass-through of the higher aluminum prices did not impact EBITDA dollars, it did unfavorably impact margin by approximately 340 basis points. The impact on EBITDA margin increases to more than 550 basis points if you also include the unfavorable margin impact of passing through higher inflationary costs like the European energy costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Before turning it back over to John, I will remind you that the impact of foreign currency to Howmet in total is minimal as the Aerospace segments provide a natural foreign currency hedge against the Forged Wheels segment. Lastly, in the appendix, we've updated assumptions, including an improvement in the annual operational tax rate to approximately 23.5%, which translates into a Q4 operational tax rate of approximately 22%. Also, we have updated annual assumptions to reflect improvements in our cash tax rate, net pension liabilities, depreciation and amortization, CapEx and diluted share count. Now let me turn that back over to John. Yes. So Matt, we've been doing a lot of work on the pension and OPEB program. So if you compare to where we are today, we've improved around $85 million in terms of net liability. A lot of that's driven by actions we started taking to clip off gross liabilities going back to Q2 of 2020, believe it or not, when we took out some U.K. buyout programs. But from Q2 of 2020 to current, we've taken off about $600 million of actions, right? So that's helping drive the net liability down. But as John mentioned, at the end of the year, we'll snap the line again in terms of where we're at. We get a nice favorability around discount rates because discount rates have moved from around 2.7% at the end of last year to mid-5% right now. So you're going to get a nice good guy on the liability side. To your point, the assets, if you even just track the S&P 500, they will be negative. You pushed the 2 of them together, though, you're going to get a nice reduction in terms of net liability. Also, we've got to get to the end of the year, but we anticipate cash contributions next year will probably be the same, if not less, based on all the work that we've done over the years."

Howmet's second quarter was another strong quarter and witnessed the continuing recovery in commercial aerospace, which was up 34% year-on-year and 7% sequentially. Total revenue was $1.393 billion and was up 17% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, which was at the top end of our guidance range. Revenue increased in each business segment, both year-over-year and sequentially. Similarly, Howmet's Q2 EBITDA grew year-over-year and sequentially to $316 million, including net headcount additions of approximately 740 employees. Moreover, we are particularly pleased with the continuing healthy EBITDA margin performance of 22.8%, which is also at the high end of guidance. Inflationary costs were either recovered from customers or offset with efficiency improvements. Finally, earnings per share was strong at $0.35, an increase of 59% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow was a positive $114 million in the quarter, including an inventory build of approximately $105 million, primarily to accommodate the commercial aerospace recovery. Free cash flow was positive for the first half, and we expect to have positive free cash flow in both Q3 and Q4. The cash balance at the end of Q2 increased to $538 million, including common stock repurchases of $60 million and bond repurchases of $60 million. Share and bond repurchases were with cash on hand and continue to reduce share count and interest expense drag and hence improved free cash flow yield. Legacy pension and OPEB liabilities are trending favorably with a net liability improvement of 60 million year-to-date. Associated cash contributions are down 65% in the first half compared to last year. Lastly, net leverage improved to three times and is expected to accelerate by year-end to move towards 2.5 times EBITDA. Segment details will be covered by Ken. However, I would like to note the small continuing EBITDA margin increase in our engines business and an improvement in structures. This was commendable of structures in the light of both the inventory burn down of F-35 and the continuing low to zero build of the Boeing 787. Now over to Ken.\nKenneth Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Please move to Slide 5 for an overview of the markets. Second quarter revenue was up 17% year-over-year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued in the second quarter, with commercial aerospace revenue up 34% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segments and the narrow-body recovery. Commercial aerospace 45% of total revenue, and although an improvement from 2021, we continue to be far short of the pre-COVID level, which was 60% of total revenue. Defense aerospace was essentially flat year-over-year as well as sequentially, driven by continued customer inventory corrections for the F-35. Commercial transportation, which impacts both Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segment, was up 19% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, driven by higher aluminum prices and higher volumes. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial, was down 4% year-over-year. Going deeper into this market, IGT was essentially flat, oil and gas was up 24% and general industrial was down 20% on a year-over-year basis. Now let's move to Slide 6. So let's start with the P&L with a focus on enhanced profitability. In the second quarter, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were at the high end of guidance as both metrics were up 17% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $317 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was also at the high end of guidance as it increased 10 basis points sequentially to 22.8%. Excluding the $60 million year-over-year revenue impact of higher material pass-through, EBITDA margin was 100 basis points higher at 23.8%. Adjusting for material pass-through, the flow of the incremental revenue to EBITDA was in-line with expectations at approximately 33%. We have been able to maintain our strong margins despite the impact of higher material pass-through and inflation as well as headcount additions to support future growth. During the second quarter, we continued the recruitment of headcount by approximately 740 employees, including net additions of approximately 455 in engines and 245 in fasteners as preparations are made for continued growth in the second half, adding to the growth already experienced in Q2. Year-to-date, we have increased headcount by more than 1,200 employees, and that has been focused in engines and in fasteners. Adjusted earnings per share exceeded the high end of the guidance at $0.35 per share, up 59% year-over-year. For the quarter, the impact of foreign currency on earnings was minimal. Moving to the balance sheet. Free cash flow in the second quarter was a positive 114 million, which excluded 44 million of proceeds generated from the sale and associated leaseback of our corporate headquarters in Pittsburgh. Cash on hand increased to 538 million after buying back 60 million of common stock, repurchasing 60 million of our 2024 bonds and funding the quarterly dividend. The average diluted share count improved to a Q2 exit rate of 421 million shares. Net pension and OPEB liabilities were reduced by approximately $60 million in the first half of 2022, and cash contributions were reduced by approximately 65% to 13 million on a year-over-year basis. Discount rates continue to be favorable, and we will remeasure at the end of the year, which should further reduce the net pension liabilities. Annual cash contributions are estimated to be approximately 60 million versus expense of 20 million. Finally, net debt to EBITDA improved to three times. As John mentioned earlier, we expect net debt to EBITDA to accelerate by year-end and move towards 2.5 times. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. Capital expenditures continued to be less than depreciation at approximately 67% in the second quarter. Productivity CapEx continues to be a focus on automation in both the engines and the fasteners business to improve yields, enhance quality, reduce outsourcing and mitigate labor risk. We purchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock in the quarter for 60 million. In the first half of 2022, we repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares of common stock for 235 million. I would also note that we purchased 0.9 million shares of common stock in July, which increases the July year-to-date repurchases to $265 million for 7.8 million shares with an average acquisition price of $33.76 per share. Board authorization for share repurchases is currently $1,082,000,000. Moving to debt. We repurchased 60 million of our 2024 bonds in the quarter with cash on hand, and this will reduce our annualized interest cost by approximately 3 million. Lastly, we continue to be confident in free cash flow and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segments. Q2 was another solid quarter for the Engine Products segment. Year-over-year revenue was 20% higher in the second quarter, with commercial aerospace up 39%, driven by the narrow-body recovery. Both IGT and defense aerospace were essentially flat year-over-year while oil and gas was up 24%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 38% year-over-year and margin improved 360 basis points to a record 27.5%, despite adding approximately 455 employees in the second quarter. Year-to-date, net headcount additions for Engines was approximately 780 employees. Please move to Slide 8. Fastening System\u2019s year-over-year revenue was 6% higher in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 20% higher, driven by the narrow-body recovery but somewhat offset by continued production declines for the Boeing 787. Industrial was down 26%, driven by a strong Q2 last year. We expect growth in industrial in the second half. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased 11% in the quarter and was impacted by inflationary cost and the addition of approximately 245 employees to support future growth. Year-to-date, headcount additions for Fasteners was approximately 380 employees. Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures' year-over-year revenue was 16% higher in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 37% higher as the narrow-body recovery more than offset the impact of production declines for the Boeing 787. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year despite the inventory burn-down of the F-35 and continued zero to low builds on the Boeing 787 and inflationary cost pressures. The Structures team delivered a Q2 EBITDA margin of 14.1%. I would note that the Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin was equal to the 2019 annual margin despite revenue being down approximately 40% using this quarter's annualized revenue. This was solid performance by the Structures team. Finally, let's move to Slide 10. As expected, Forged Wheels' year-over-year revenue was 22% higher in the second quarter. The $50 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by higher aluminum prices of 36 million and volume increases of 14 million or 7%. Commercial transportation demand remains strong but volumes continue to be impacted by customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased 7% despite the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, driven primarily by the Europe. While the pass-through of higher aluminum prices did not impact adjusted EBITDA dollars, it did unfavorably impact EBITDA margins by approximately 400 basis points. Before I turn it back to John to discuss guidance, you will note that we called out unfavorable foreign currency in the Wheels segment as a good portion of that segment's revenue has production cost and revenue in local currency. For Howmet in total, the aerospace segments provide a natural foreign currency hedge, while the aerospace segments also have a portion of their production costs in local currency, the majority of the revenue is in U.S. dollars. For the quarter, Howmet's overall foreign currency earnings impact was less than $1 million. Now let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken, and let's move to the outlook. But first, let me provide some commentary about state of end markets and the customers that we serve. The narrow-body aircraft production increases will continue and we expect Airbus to continue to lead with second half A320 production rates in the mid-50s per month. Boeing should lift the 737 MAX production to approximately 30 a month in the second half. Wide-body aircraft production is viewed as stable in the second half, and we are beginning to see spares demand increase due to improvements in international travel. Our view is that the build of wide-body aircraft improves as we move through into 2023, especially with the production of the Boeing 787 restarting and combine that with the increases at Airbus of the A330 and A350. The forecast for 787 production in 2022 is cut again from 25 aircraft I talked about in the last quarter's earnings call to 15 as our best estimate, although we are now optimistic about the future, given the clearance by the FAA to restart deliveries. During the second half, we expect the F-35 inventory burn-off to continue, albeit defense revenue should show a modest improvement compared to the first half of the year. IGT is expected to improve, and we are seeing improvements which have signaled in the oil and gas market for the second half. Commercial trucks production is expected to improve as supply chains improve component availability, albeit at a more muted level than we had previously expected. Regarding titanium orders, we expect to execute revenue opportunities as a result of the Ukraine situation, and we have added $20 million of revenue to our fourth quarter sales. Further updates for 2023 and beyond should become more clear and secure during the next quarter or so as we not only assess the order intake but also customer inventory burn-down, especially for wide-body aircraft production. Moving to guidance. The 2022 annual revenue midpoint is increased to $5.68 billion, which reflects the volume recovery commentary noted above and material inflation, which is now expected to be in excess of $200 million. Other inflationary costs such as energy, electricity, transportation, services and other production parts are additive to this number. For the third quarter, revenue is expected to be 1.44 billion, plus or minus 15 million; EBITDA, 326 million, plus 5 million, minus 4 million; EBITDA margin, 22.6%, plus or minus 10 basis points; and earnings per share, $0.36, plus or minus $0.01. For the year, we have also tightened our guidance range and called out revenue at 5.68 billion, plus or minus 35 million, which is an increase of 40 million from the prior midpoint guidance. EBITDA at 1.29 million, plus 9 million, minus 14 million. EBITDA margin of 22.7%; and earnings per share of $1.41, plus or minus $0.02, an increase of $0.02 from prior guidance at the midpoint; and free cash flow, 650 million, plus or minus 25 million, an increase of 25 million from prior guidance. Free cash flow conversion of net income is expected to be approximately 110%. In summary, Howmet's Q2 year-over-year and sequential profit improvement continues. And we have demonstrated Howmet's unique and differentiated assets. We have been making strong and consistent progress against a choppy backlog. Liquidity continues to be strong with Q2 free cash flow at 114 million, including an inventory build in excess of 100 million for the commercial aerospace recovery. In the first half, total inventory build is close to 200 million. Cash on hand has increased to 538 million and that is after the common stock and bond repurchases. Through the first half and July, approximately $343 million has been deployed for common stock and bond repurchases as well as dividends. Capital allocation has been balanced and we have also been improving net leverage as we spoke about and plan to do so again by the end of the year. Regarding guidance, revenue for the year is raised, reflected the inflation recovery but also modest net volume improvements. EBITDA margin continues to be healthy and reflects the benefits of strong cost control, efficiency, material pass-through, inflation recovery and pricing with timely headcount additions to prepare for the future and the future lift into 2023. In the second half, we expect to continue to add headcount in Engines and begin recruitment in our Structures business. Finally, the Howmet annual dividend of $0.08 per share or $0.02 per quarter is planned to be doubled to $0.04 per share per quarter, with the first higher payment made in November of this year. Before moving to your questions, I would like to encourage you to visit our website at howmet.com to look at the Howmet's Technology Day slides. As a brief introduction, I would like to highlight three slides beginning with Slide 14. What I want to note is that Howmet is a trusted brand with differentiated technologies and a rich IP portfolio with deep process know-how. We are mission-critical in growing markets with the ability to supply 90% of structural and rotating aero engine parts - sorry, componentry. Approximately 70% of aerospace revenue is under long-term contracts, which is complemented by strong spares demand. On Slide 15, 85% of revenue is generated from markets where we hold either a number one or number two position, driven by our customer relationships and differentiated assets. Lastly on Slide 16, Howmet's strategy has four pillars: to grow above market rates; the prioritization of differentiated products with discerning allocation of capital and resources; commercial and operational discipline and finally, a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Additional information is available in the full presentation, which is on our website in the Investors section. And now we can move to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: John, maybe I could start with a question on production rates. I mean, Airbus deferred a step-up of the A320neo production rate to 65 per month to early 2024 versus their previous expectation of second half of 2023. We are seeing Boeing face challenges to maintain 31 per month for the MAX as well. So in a period where OEM production lines are changing and your business is in the longer lead time side of the supply chain, how do you balance investing to meet production rate increases and not be an industry bottleneck versus preserving the cost structure and maintaining margins?\nJohn Plant: Well, certainly, it is a tough balance at the moment. And so far, we have tried to invest in adding people and training to get ready for the production increases. And as you have seen from the last quarter, continued to do so in preparing for the second half. But as I noted in my comments, the backlog is pretty choppy. We saw in May, the 737 production halted for maybe 10-days or so, then maybe 20 Airbuses cut from the second half, and now next year, maybe a delay in the ramp of the A320 to, as you say, 2024. So we find ourselves constantly having to readdress the, I will say, the slope of the recovery, albeit you have seen we have been pretty consistent in how we have been able to deliver against that backlog and hope to do so in the future. I still think it is important to consider the fundamental premise of where we are, which is we are in a period of recovery, particularly for commercial aerospace. And defense is solid and hopefully improving for us. And then we have seen the recent buoyancy in the oil and gas sector plus the anticipated recovery, although I did say it, more muted in commercial trucks. So what we are continually doing is balancing between how we see the addition of, in particular, headcount. It is not really affecting our fundamental capital expenditure plans at this point, given we have capacity, latent capacity from previous investments. But we adjust and trying not to get too far ahead but trying to be in-line for our requirements to customers. When I think about one of the fundamental questions in the sector, which is the availability of castings and forgings, which you didn't mention but implied in your question was that point. Again, if you think back to the investments we made in two new engine plants in the 2019 period, then that has largely solved or if not completely solved the issue, which was very significant and present in 2017, 2018 and 2019, which was the capacity available for airfoil castings. And I think one thing we have heard and increasingly heard is that the focus is more on availability of structural castings rather than turbine airfoil castings. And so we have been able to step up to that. At the same time, as I have tried to say on previous calls, we have tens of thousands of parts. Inevitably, we are tight on a few and that would apply to also a few structural casting parts. But nothing that we are aware of that is fundamentally holding engine production or delivery of engines to an airframe manufacturer. So we are trying to balance, be ahead of it, again investing in people, equipment, training to be ready. But I recognize that we do keep readdressing that labor intake as we see our customers' plans do change and then the anticipated slope of recovery. But importantly, we have broadened it out one stage further is that we are clear that 2023 is going to be another growth year for Howmet and we look forward to that. And I will give more, I will say, guide on that towards the end of the year, if not in the early next year. But essentially, what we are playing for is the angle of the increase, not the fundamental principle. Hope that covers it, Kristine.\nKristine Liwag: Great. I will stick to one question. Thank you John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hi good morning everyone. It looks like the updated guidance for the year implies that the EBITDA margins would be relatively flat in the back half versus the first, and I think the business segment margin actually down a little, the way the corporate and D&A shake out. And that would be on higher revenue and I assume you are passing through cost while pricing, you keep. So maybe just if you could walk me through why that would be the case.\nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean, I think the major influence on it has been the fact we have kicked up our assumptions regarding the inflationary costs. And we said, just for the metals element alone, if you remember, we started out at the beginning of the year and calling it somewhere, I think, in the region of 100 million to 150 million. And now we are saying, I just said on the remarks is that we see north of 200 million now, and so significant inflation element. And then that is ignoring, of course, the inflationary elements of utilities, I mean, natural gas in Europe in particular, where I think all of us are familiar with the energy crisis in Europe and the pricing points that energy has reached. And so there is a lot to play for in terms of recovery of that or offsetting it. And as you know, if we cover dollar-for-dollar, which is where we believe we are, is that, that has a dampening effect on margin. And the more we kick up those inflation assumptions, then you see that, Noah. So fundamentally, I believe that if we were to adjust for that, you will see growth of margin year-on-year. But again, that is like saying let's change the assumptions, I choose not to. I think the important thing is we are holding our margin rate through quite extraordinary times of inflationary pressures and also the choppiness that I referred to in answering to Kristine's question. And really, I think that delivery of consistent margins is really important. And we, I will say, quietly are fairly pleased with it.\nKenneth Giacobbe: Yes. Noah, I would add to that as well. We did bring down the 787 guide as well. That is a very profitable program for us. Now we did replace with some titanium. That is sort of lower margin so you have got a bit of a mixed component there. But also, I just wanted to clarify as well. So we said for Q3 EBITDA, 326 million. It is minus 6 million on the down to 320 million, up 5 million for the high side in Q3. That is all on Slide 11. And then the earnings per share, I just want to clarify, we have it on the slide there. $1.41 is the mid or down $0.03 on the low and up $0.01 on the high, but just want to clarify.\nNoah Poponak: Ken, how much titanium did you add into the back end.\nJohn Plant: We added 20 million to revenue for the fourth quarter. I chose not to provide a guide for 2023 at this point because we are still in the process of order acquisition. And also even acquisition and completion of contracts with customers, then the next part is to balance out the inventory against new titanium supplies as that is on stream. So again, we are trying to get a more accurate picture of what inventory is held at customers as they bank security stocks from, say, VSMPO. And so we have got to assess that. And when we provide you with a 2023 number. And if I gave you one today, I wouldn't feel confident in doing so.\nNoah Poponak: We really shouldn't extrapolate anything from that 20 million, it sounds like?\nJohn Plant: No. I mean, the important thing is the fact that we are gaining orders. We are well in the game. And clearly, it will be more than that in 2023, but just want to get all of that sorted before we - and clearly, it is more of a discussion to for the end of the year, early next year.\nNoah Poponak: Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. I have a multipart question, trying to stick with the one. But your comment on -.\nJohn Plant: Those are tricky, those multipart ones, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Yes, I know. It is kind of unfair. But the question is on share gain broadly and the opportunity. So on the forging side, you guys don't seem to be a pinch point. Are you seeing emergent demand there? And did that benefit the quarter or just bookings, given lead times? And secondly, on the titanium share opportunity, the 20 million you referenced, is that just one OEM, is it across several and have you seen any change in urgency for Airbus and Safran to source, given that you sanction was taken off of the VSMPO?\nJohn Plant: Okay. So let me get the latter part first while it is fresh in my mind. It is several OEMs, both engine manufacturers and also an airframe manufacturer. So even though, let's say, European sanctions are not placed upon VSMPO. There, not surprisingly, Airbus choosing to secure a long-term source and security and so we have begun to book orders with them. We are still working elsewhere with other manufacturers, and so still a lot to play for. And it is also, I'm going to call it, urgency of completion is also influenced by the inventories in the system. So I think that disposes of the titanium commentary. In terms of spot, I did say the spot would be a feature - more of a feature in the second half. It is always difficult to call it by the fact it is spot, not on LTA. We are seeing some spot business that is available and coming to us and we have and secured some of it. And some of it is already going in because of long lead times, particularly of metal availability into 2023 as metal lead times go out. And I see those going out nine-months, 12-months. And therefore, for some input orders, it is getting towards 12-months already. In terms of, say, the pinch point in the industry, there is very little that can be done in the short term because, for example, on structural castings, it is all about the tooling and the assets that go with it. And so really, there is limited ability to cross over on those sort of areas. And we have got our hands full just dealing with the orders that we have currently for ourselves. At the same time, I do believe that over the next two or three years, that there will be opportunities to further balance that supply. I think that covers all the points you raised, I think, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Yes, I appreciate it. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much and good afternoon. John, on the metal pass-through, we started to see some of these industrial metal prices come down. How does that flow through to you in terms of timing? And is the mathematical calculation basically the other way around, so you should have a margin expansion as the metal pass-through reduces?\nJohn Plant: We would certainly like that to occur. I mean, you have seen some small improvements in metals and the most notable of which has been aluminum. So as that price has come down, say, peaked at about $4,500 a ton, including Midwest premiums in the U.S. and has probably fallen closer to, let's say, 3,100, 3,150 at the moment. So a significant move down, albeit still significantly above where it started at less than $2,000 a ton 18-months ago. Assuming it stays there and of course, none of us know exactly what is going to happen, but if it stays there, then certainly, when our price resets occur on the first of January, then if it stays where it is, then you will see, for example, our Wheels business gain margin expansion as those prices are reset. And if it comes down across the board elsewhere, where again, it is fairly small at this point, then there would be some other tailwinds to margin as well. But we haven't really called those out on the way up. And so I doubt I will call them on the way down. The most significant has been the aluminum move which is impacted, as Ken talked about, in our Wheels business by over 400 basis points from where we started. And clearly, to go down the other side of that would be very welcome. And so that would impact Howmet overall and you begin to see margin benefit if metals stay where they are or continue to further improve, which we obviously we are hoping for but we don't know if it is a future event.\nRobert Stallard: Yes it makes sense. Thanks John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: So just want to get an update on the Wheels business, how the inventory situation looks there in terms of the semiconductors and the inventory or the backlog starting to deliver out. And how do you feel about the Class 8 truck business overall if we are headed into a macro slowdown recession, whatever you want to call it? Obviously, what we have seen in the past is that despite big backlogs on the Class 8 truck side that business can shrink pretty dramatically. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Yes. I don't think we have been in normal times for Class 8 truck in either the U.S. or Europe and have certainly the last 18-months. And therefore, I'm going to say and I think I would like to believe that this time, it is different. So we don't see the same cyclicality and, of course, that might ring hollow because we don't know. But my view is that the availability of trucks has been so restricted for so long and there is fundamental demand for fleets. And despite low order intake because people have just given up putting orders into the system. But when those order books open for 2023 in September, that we are going to see a significant spike in orders from the larger fleets, where demand is clearly there because of the aging of the fleet and also to improve fuel efficiency with, say, regulations, which are particularly onerous in Europe. So my thought is that the supply chain problems, while they are easing, so a lot of the trucks that have been built called red tags with not a complete part set, have been clear to some degree, there are still significant shortages across a range of commodities, which are restricting build in the second half of this year. We have trimmed -- inside our guidance, we have trimmed our assumption by 5,000 or 10,000 trucks in North America as an example for this year because of a more conservative assumption regarding parts availability. It does mean, I think, that we will see the same sort of percentage increase I talked about before between 2022 and 2023. And given the fact that I don't -- even if we are going to build more next year, or is going to build more next year and will supply more wheels, there won't be the opportunity, again because of parts availability, to draw forward truck build out of 2024 when people try -- have historically try to build and buy ahead of the emissions changes that are coming. So my thought is that those emission changes will occur in 2024. Trucks will be built in the relevant calendar year and maybe even that people are interested in taking the improved fuel emissions from the trucks anyway. So I'm hoping that what we are going to see is an improvement in overall revenues in our Wheels business in 2023 and stability and maybe even improvement into 2024 as well. And that is despite the coming macroeconomic backlog of rising interest rates to fundamentally deplete supply and demand -- the supply situation that we have had, which has been extreme. So it is a long way of saying, I feel inherently optimistic about it, albeit I have calmed down the -- a little bit of the assumptions in 2022.\nDavid Strauss: Alright. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Akers: Hi good morning and thanks. I wanted to ask about F-35 and kind of the defense business more broadly. And I guess, with sort of the lower outlook from Lockheed, just kind of where you are on F-35 stock, destocking. And I guess any other big moving pieces within the defense business. I think you talked about second half improvement over the first half. Yes, just any thoughts there.\nJohn Plant: Yes. So for us, defense is a little bit seasonal, given the relatively large aftermarket component within it. And that is why it gives some confidence to second half solidity. At the same time, talking about the F-35 as a single item, which is about 35%, 40% of our defense sales, then we have been incurring the - I will say, destocking by our customer in the first half and that will continue in the second half. So the whole of this year, we are clear that we are under-supplying Lockheed's build of aircraft. And we do note they have cut that build assumption from 156 down to, I would say, 147, 149 or something as an assumption for this year and next. And therefore, again, it places a little bit more of a burden upon us for inventory takeout, which again, may fall over into the early part of next year. But the fundamental picture is one where our supply situation in 2023, we expect, will be better and improved compared to 2022. And again, what we are playing for is the angle of recovery just as I would commented about commercial aerospace earlier. So again, I just want to keep that big picture in mind the revenue increases and we are just debating the angle at this point in time.\nMatthew Akers: Got it, thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you Matt.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: John, of the $200 million for material pass-through, can you tell us how much of that goes to the Wheels business? And then just for this quarter, of the 40 million increase in revenues, how much of that was from the increase in the material cost?\nJohn Plant: I'm going to say sequentially, this quarter was fairly minimal as a quarter-on-quarter, but I'm going to look to Ken in a second to cover that. I don't think we have broken down the 200 million between segment. But it is sufficient to say that the majority of that 200 million relates to aluminum. And I'm going to look to Ken to see whether he has that level of detail, George, to be able to respond to you. So if you could just hold for a second.\nKenneth Giacobbe: Yes. So sequentially, it is really not a material impact, George. We haven't given - that 200 million, to your question, the breakdown of aluminum. But as you can imagine, aluminum is a big chunk of it. When you look at what we have talked about. So far in this quarter, we said 60 million of material pass-through of that. We had about 36 million, I believe I called out in my prepared comments, was aluminum. So I can kind of give you a guide.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. And then just one quick one, Ken. Can you break out the aerospace increase by how much was OE and look at it, how much was aftermarket?\nJohn Plant: I'm going to say aftermarket, we generally don't call the numbers out, but aftermarket was a small improvement in the first half. We are expecting a bigger improvement in the second half. But you can assume the first half was within a single-digit percentage of what we were supplying in the second half of last year, George. But expecting bigger things to achieve, what we believe will be a 30% plus year-on-year improvement in the spares business for us.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Good morning everyone. Just looking at the Fasteners business, we saw the revenues kind of bottom out in the second half of 2021 and start to inflect higher here in the first half. But there is been some pressure on the EBITDA, I guess, from the second half of last year to the first half of this year. Some of these additional inflationary pressures outside of materials showing up more in the Fasteners or does it have to do with bringing on people now that revenue is growing again and how do we think about the incrementals here going forward?\nJohn Plant: Yes. The inflation and certainly, materials inflation is not the biggest part of it. It is present, of course, across, let's say, titanium and some steel and aluminum for sure, but it is not the biggest part of it. When I stand back and say, is our Fasteners segment underperforming? So it is always a good question to ask yourself. I don't believe so. There are two significant factors which are going on, which go to that margin. One is the reduced build of composite aircraft and so if you look in the sequential margins of the business when 787 was basically taken down to, I will say, one to zero, then I think as we have explained before, the effect of a composite aircraft replacing a metallic aircraft is of significant value accretion for us. And therefore, we always look forward to that. And that is why we were looking forward to the 777X and the composite wings there, albeit obviously, that is pushed a little bit now. But essentially, if you think about mix because of 787, which hopefully, certainly as we turn the year because even though, let's say, I think Boeing will begin to deliver from inventory, and I think they may begin to build at a little bit higher rate in the second half, I don't know. But a lot of that build is going to come from inventory. And there are multiple tiers because of the distributed, I will say, supply base around the world of many of the components and trying to get an accurate picture of all that inventory is difficult. So that is why we have taken the assumption of 787 down to the 15 for the year from the 25. And therefore, that mix effect will continue to weigh on our Fastener business in the second half. And then the second thing is we have taken on a significant amount of people in our Fastener business during the last quarter, preparing for volume improvements as we go forward. And we did see volume pick up in Q2, and we are planning for further volume increases in Q3 and Q4, which basically is embedded in our guidance because we have also, as you see, lifted revenue guidance, the rate of client continues. So when you look at it, you shouldn't look at it compared to whether we beat consensus or beat guide or not, but you need to look at a more consistent track through the last year of consistent quarter-on-quarter, like we put on 100 million in like Q3 of last year, then a slight pause and another 100 million in Q1. Then we have just guided you to like another 100 million sort of average improvement. So it is coming and we are recruiting. And so when you combine both the recruitment costs that we have incurred in Fasteners in Q2, plus that mix effect, that really goes to the heart of the margin issues or not an issue, but the margin change. And then clearly, as those employees become more productive, and it is also going to be influenced by a rate of continued hiring as we prepare for next year, but I'm hoping that begins to improve because of the denominator will get bigger of the employee base. And then as 787 begins to start getting built in the first part of next year, then I do see things beginning to improve for that segment.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Phil Gibbs of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Gibbs: Within the guidance, are there any more buybacks implied in that, meaning from what you have already announced through July?\nJohn Plant: What I would do is to guide you to what we have said by way of approaching 2.5 times net leverage by the end of the year. So you can reverse-engineer it from the cash flow that we have given you and an assumption around any balanced capital allocation between other than maybe reverse or the dividend increase, which I wanted to note, and that shows confidence in our cash flows and I think it is an important thing to do for our shareholders. At the same time, we will also be addressing hopefully some improvement in our debt structure and also hopefully, some continued, say, buyback of stock. But you mustn't assume it is all of one or anything. It is a balanced approach in that second half and you can get it is the -- whatever assumption you make in terms of whatever approaching 2.5 times is, so clearly better than three times. And I'm hopeful that, that will also reflect into the credit ratings of the company and also an approach which the - I will say, our shareholders are also pleased with that as well.\nPhilip Gibbs: Thanks John. You guys have gotten to be a public company now for several quarters. We are clearly on the other side of the demand cycle here for your key markets. The balance sheet looks like it is in good shape. Is there any thoughts to doing M&A? Are there opportunities out there available and the things that you would like to do strategically?\nJohn Plant: Just picking up on your theme is that post separation, we went into the, I will say, COVID pandemic, but within times quarters, we would restored our margins. We have been consistent in performance and cash flow all the way since then. And as you have seen, putting the balance sheet in really great shape approaching eventually probably more of our target leverage, around that two times or better. So everything is progressing very satisfactorily. We are open to considering any M&A moves. But I always say it is more in that bolt-on scale, which we can deal within a quarter or so of cash flow and so no immediate thoughts to doing that. It is got a high hurdle to overcome, which is, does it provide a good return on capital for any such investment. Can we gain not only cost synergy but revenue synergy? And therefore, does it go with the strategic intent of the company? We have aimed it more, if we said if we are going to do it, it is probably more likely in our Engine or our Fastener business rather than elsewhere. But at the same time, again, trying to try and be disciplined about it all, but nothing that immediately would pass any hurdles compared to the relative risk-free I will say, action of buying our own stock back, which we obviously know well, feel confident in and have been consistent in buying back really almost every quarter over the last couple of years but only probably pause for a quarter or so in 2020 just after the, I will say, the onslaught of the pandemic.\nPhilip Gibbs: Solid. Thanks gentlemen.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. Just I guess John or Ken, how should we think about inventory into the second half of 2022 and maybe overall working capital as we really think about 2023? I mean, it seems like there is a number of moving parts with the F-35 burn going on. It sounds like and it seems like 787 is going to be ramping. Not sure if you need much or need to plan much for some of the titanium. And then I guess the truck's a little bit slower than you initially planned. Can you just give us any color on where inventories might go?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean, I will deal with our own inventory first before I comment on anything to do with our customer inventories. And we built a couple of hundred million of inventory in the first half. And we have tried to aim the majority of that towards finished goods. But not exclusively but a lot of it towards finished goods or certainly very advanced stage of work in progress, so that we can and have tried to keep pace and be able to satisfy our customers and have that ability to deliver our stock to meet their needs. And we are only tight in one or two places. Now having put that what I call the stock for hopefully improved supply security in the face of the lift in the demand is that I doubt we will try to replicate that again in the second half. There may be some but nothing at the scale of the first half, and trying to plan a steady level of production throughput improvements from the hiring we have done as we exit this year into 2023. And obviously, we will make those judgments exactly how much inventory we will carry into next year according to what the final shape of the increase in revenues for next year is. So I think all good on that front. So more of, it is less of a build and more of a pause but maybe some selective improvements in inventory in the second half. In terms of our customer inventory, it is difficult to really comment. I said 787, despite meaning we could assume that there will be build of aircraft in the second half. And I have a feeling that maybe you may see a higher increase in build than we thought because it may prove to be a good way of supplying those 787s into clearly, the airline demand, which is there, compared to the inventory we have. But we don't know that. And we have just said there is clearly inventory in the pipeline. There is inventory around, whether it is subsuppliers in Europe or in Japan or elsewhere in the world or in the U.S. And so let's be relatively safe. And therefore, we chose to take down our view of 787 for the second half, given the fact that it has been delayed from last year to Q1 to Q2. But all seems to be set well now. And as I have said in previous calls, the aircraft is a great aircraft. There is clearly demand and need for it there. International travel is coming back. And so I think that plus I have read that Airbus are considering even looking at possibly improving their wide-body rates as we go into next year beyond more than they have already signaled in Skyline. So I have some optimism, but really choose to say the improvement particularly for wide-body will be more of a 2023 feature and also for our commercial truck business. So I think that puts it out, Mike.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Yes, got it. Thanks guys.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, PT, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 call. Howmet's second quarter was another strong quarter and witnessed the continuing recovery in commercial aerospace, which was up 34% year-on-year and 7% sequentially. Total revenue was $1.393 billion and was up 17% year-on-year and 5% sequentially, which was at the top end of our guidance range. Revenue increased in each business segment, both year-over-year and sequentially. Similarly, Howmet's Q2 EBITDA grew year-over-year and sequentially to $316 million, including net headcount additions of approximately 740 employees. Moreover, we are particularly pleased with the continuing healthy EBITDA margin performance of 22.8%, which is also at the high end of guidance. Inflationary costs were either recovered from customers or offset with efficiency improvements. Finally, earnings per share was strong at $0.35, an increase of 59% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. Free cash flow was a positive $114 million in the quarter, including an inventory build of approximately $105 million, primarily to accommodate the commercial aerospace recovery. Free cash flow was positive for the first half, and we expect to have positive free cash flow in both Q3 and Q4. The cash balance at the end of Q2 increased to $538 million, including common stock repurchases of $60 million and bond repurchases of $60 million. Share and bond repurchases were with cash on hand and continue to reduce share count and interest expense drag and hence improved free cash flow yield. Legacy pension and OPEB liabilities are trending favorably with a net liability improvement of 60 million year-to-date. Associated cash contributions are down 65% in the first half compared to last year. Lastly, net leverage improved to three times and is expected to accelerate by year-end to move towards 2.5 times EBITDA. Segment details will be covered by Ken. However, I would like to note the small continuing EBITDA margin increase in our engines business and an improvement in structures. This was commendable of structures in the light of both the inventory burn down of F-35 and the continuing low to zero build of the Boeing 787. Now over to Ken. Thanks, Ken, and let's move to the outlook. But first, let me provide some commentary about state of end markets and the customers that we serve. The narrow-body aircraft production increases will continue and we expect Airbus to continue to lead with second half A320 production rates in the mid-50s per month. Boeing should lift the 737 MAX production to approximately 30 a month in the second half. Wide-body aircraft production is viewed as stable in the second half, and we are beginning to see spares demand increase due to improvements in international travel. Our view is that the build of wide-body aircraft improves as we move through into 2023, especially with the production of the Boeing 787 restarting and combine that with the increases at Airbus of the A330 and A350. The forecast for 787 production in 2022 is cut again from 25 aircraft I talked about in the last quarter's earnings call to 15 as our best estimate, although we are now optimistic about the future, given the clearance by the FAA to restart deliveries. During the second half, we expect the F-35 inventory burn-off to continue, albeit defense revenue should show a modest improvement compared to the first half of the year. IGT is expected to improve, and we are seeing improvements which have signaled in the oil and gas market for the second half. Commercial trucks production is expected to improve as supply chains improve component availability, albeit at a more muted level than we had previously expected. Regarding titanium orders, we expect to execute revenue opportunities as a result of the Ukraine situation, and we have added $20 million of revenue to our fourth quarter sales. Further updates for 2023 and beyond should become more clear and secure during the next quarter or so as we not only assess the order intake but also customer inventory burn-down, especially for wide-body aircraft production. Moving to guidance. The 2022 annual revenue midpoint is increased to $5.68 billion, which reflects the volume recovery commentary noted above and material inflation, which is now expected to be in excess of $200 million. Other inflationary costs such as energy, electricity, transportation, services and other production parts are additive to this number. For the third quarter, revenue is expected to be 1.44 billion, plus or minus 15 million; EBITDA, 326 million, plus 5 million, minus 4 million; EBITDA margin, 22.6%, plus or minus 10 basis points; and earnings per share, $0.36, plus or minus $0.01. For the year, we have also tightened our guidance range and called out revenue at 5.68 billion, plus or minus 35 million, which is an increase of 40 million from the prior midpoint guidance. EBITDA at 1.29 million, plus 9 million, minus 14 million. EBITDA margin of 22.7%; and earnings per share of $1.41, plus or minus $0.02, an increase of $0.02 from prior guidance at the midpoint; and free cash flow, 650 million, plus or minus 25 million, an increase of 25 million from prior guidance. Free cash flow conversion of net income is expected to be approximately 110%. In summary, Howmet's Q2 year-over-year and sequential profit improvement continues. And we have demonstrated Howmet's unique and differentiated assets. We have been making strong and consistent progress against a choppy backlog. Liquidity continues to be strong with Q2 free cash flow at 114 million, including an inventory build in excess of 100 million for the commercial aerospace recovery. In the first half, total inventory build is close to 200 million. Cash on hand has increased to 538 million and that is after the common stock and bond repurchases. Through the first half and July, approximately $343 million has been deployed for common stock and bond repurchases as well as dividends. Capital allocation has been balanced and we have also been improving net leverage as we spoke about and plan to do so again by the end of the year. Regarding guidance, revenue for the year is raised, reflected the inflation recovery but also modest net volume improvements. EBITDA margin continues to be healthy and reflects the benefits of strong cost control, efficiency, material pass-through, inflation recovery and pricing with timely headcount additions to prepare for the future and the future lift into 2023. In the second half, we expect to continue to add headcount in Engines and begin recruitment in our Structures business. Finally, the Howmet annual dividend of $0.08 per share or $0.02 per quarter is planned to be doubled to $0.04 per share per quarter, with the first higher payment made in November of this year. Before moving to your questions, I would like to encourage you to visit our website at howmet.com to look at the Howmet's Technology Day slides. As a brief introduction, I would like to highlight three slides beginning with Slide 14. What I want to note is that Howmet is a trusted brand with differentiated technologies and a rich IP portfolio with deep process know-how. We are mission-critical in growing markets with the ability to supply 90% of structural and rotating aero engine parts - sorry, componentry. Approximately 70% of aerospace revenue is under long-term contracts, which is complemented by strong spares demand. On Slide 15, 85% of revenue is generated from markets where we hold either a number one or number two position, driven by our customer relationships and differentiated assets. Lastly on Slide 16, Howmet's strategy has four pillars: to grow above market rates; the prioritization of differentiated products with discerning allocation of capital and resources; commercial and operational discipline and finally, a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Additional information is available in the full presentation, which is on our website in the Investors section. And now we can move to questions. Well, certainly, it is a tough balance at the moment. And so far, we have tried to invest in adding people and training to get ready for the production increases. And as you have seen from the last quarter, continued to do so in preparing for the second half. But as I noted in my comments, the backlog is pretty choppy. We saw in May, the 737 production halted for maybe 10-days or so, then maybe 20 Airbuses cut from the second half, and now next year, maybe a delay in the ramp of the A320 to, as you say, 2024. So we find ourselves constantly having to readdress the, I will say, the slope of the recovery, albeit you have seen we have been pretty consistent in how we have been able to deliver against that backlog and hope to do so in the future. I still think it is important to consider the fundamental premise of where we are, which is we are in a period of recovery, particularly for commercial aerospace. And defense is solid and hopefully improving for us. And then we have seen the recent buoyancy in the oil and gas sector plus the anticipated recovery, although I did say it, more muted in commercial trucks. So what we are continually doing is balancing between how we see the addition of, in particular, headcount. It is not really affecting our fundamental capital expenditure plans at this point, given we have capacity, latent capacity from previous investments. But we adjust and trying not to get too far ahead but trying to be in-line for our requirements to customers. When I think about one of the fundamental questions in the sector, which is the availability of castings and forgings, which you didn't mention but implied in your question was that point. Again, if you think back to the investments we made in two new engine plants in the 2019 period, then that has largely solved or if not completely solved the issue, which was very significant and present in 2017, 2018 and 2019, which was the capacity available for airfoil castings. And I think one thing we have heard and increasingly heard is that the focus is more on availability of structural castings rather than turbine airfoil castings. And so we have been able to step up to that. At the same time, as I have tried to say on previous calls, we have tens of thousands of parts. Inevitably, we are tight on a few and that would apply to also a few structural casting parts. But nothing that we are aware of that is fundamentally holding engine production or delivery of engines to an airframe manufacturer. So we are trying to balance, be ahead of it, again investing in people, equipment, training to be ready. But I recognize that we do keep readdressing that labor intake as we see our customers' plans do change and then the anticipated slope of recovery. But importantly, we have broadened it out one stage further is that we are clear that 2023 is going to be another growth year for Howmet and we look forward to that. And I will give more, I will say, guide on that towards the end of the year, if not in the early next year. But essentially, what we are playing for is the angle of the increase, not the fundamental principle. Hope that covers it, Kristine. Thank you. Yes. I mean, I think the major influence on it has been the fact we have kicked up our assumptions regarding the inflationary costs. And we said, just for the metals element alone, if you remember, we started out at the beginning of the year and calling it somewhere, I think, in the region of 100 million to 150 million. And now we are saying, I just said on the remarks is that we see north of 200 million now, and so significant inflation element. And then that is ignoring, of course, the inflationary elements of utilities, I mean, natural gas in Europe in particular, where I think all of us are familiar with the energy crisis in Europe and the pricing points that energy has reached. And so there is a lot to play for in terms of recovery of that or offsetting it. And as you know, if we cover dollar-for-dollar, which is where we believe we are, is that, that has a dampening effect on margin. And the more we kick up those inflation assumptions, then you see that, Noah. So fundamentally, I believe that if we were to adjust for that, you will see growth of margin year-on-year. But again, that is like saying let's change the assumptions, I choose not to. I think the important thing is we are holding our margin rate through quite extraordinary times of inflationary pressures and also the choppiness that I referred to in answering to Kristine's question. And really, I think that delivery of consistent margins is really important. And we, I will say, quietly are fairly pleased with it. We added 20 million to revenue for the fourth quarter. I chose not to provide a guide for 2023 at this point because we are still in the process of order acquisition. And also even acquisition and completion of contracts with customers, then the next part is to balance out the inventory against new titanium supplies as that is on stream. So again, we are trying to get a more accurate picture of what inventory is held at customers as they bank security stocks from, say, VSMPO. And so we have got to assess that. And when we provide you with a 2023 number. And if I gave you one today, I wouldn't feel confident in doing so. No. I mean, the important thing is the fact that we are gaining orders. We are well in the game. And clearly, it will be more than that in 2023, but just want to get all of that sorted before we - and clearly, it is more of a discussion to for the end of the year, early next year. Thank you. Those are tricky, those multipart ones, Gautam. Okay. So let me get the latter part first while it is fresh in my mind. It is several OEMs, both engine manufacturers and also an airframe manufacturer. So even though, let's say, European sanctions are not placed upon VSMPO. There, not surprisingly, Airbus choosing to secure a long-term source and security and so we have begun to book orders with them. We are still working elsewhere with other manufacturers, and so still a lot to play for. And it is also, I'm going to call it, urgency of completion is also influenced by the inventories in the system. So I think that disposes of the titanium commentary. In terms of spot, I did say the spot would be a feature - more of a feature in the second half. It is always difficult to call it by the fact it is spot, not on LTA. We are seeing some spot business that is available and coming to us and we have and secured some of it. And some of it is already going in because of long lead times, particularly of metal availability into 2023 as metal lead times go out. And I see those going out nine-months, 12-months. And therefore, for some input orders, it is getting towards 12-months already. In terms of, say, the pinch point in the industry, there is very little that can be done in the short term because, for example, on structural castings, it is all about the tooling and the assets that go with it. And so really, there is limited ability to cross over on those sort of areas. And we have got our hands full just dealing with the orders that we have currently for ourselves. At the same time, I do believe that over the next two or three years, that there will be opportunities to further balance that supply. I think that covers all the points you raised, I think, Gautam. Thank you. We would certainly like that to occur. I mean, you have seen some small improvements in metals and the most notable of which has been aluminum. So as that price has come down, say, peaked at about $4,500 a ton, including Midwest premiums in the U.S. and has probably fallen closer to, let's say, 3,100, 3,150 at the moment. So a significant move down, albeit still significantly above where it started at less than $2,000 a ton 18-months ago. Assuming it stays there and of course, none of us know exactly what is going to happen, but if it stays there, then certainly, when our price resets occur on the first of January, then if it stays where it is, then you will see, for example, our Wheels business gain margin expansion as those prices are reset. And if it comes down across the board elsewhere, where again, it is fairly small at this point, then there would be some other tailwinds to margin as well. But we haven't really called those out on the way up. And so I doubt I will call them on the way down. The most significant has been the aluminum move which is impacted, as Ken talked about, in our Wheels business by over 400 basis points from where we started. And clearly, to go down the other side of that would be very welcome. And so that would impact Howmet overall and you begin to see margin benefit if metals stay where they are or continue to further improve, which we obviously we are hoping for but we don't know if it is a future event. Thank you. Yes. I don't think we have been in normal times for Class 8 truck in either the U.S. or Europe and have certainly the last 18-months. And therefore, I'm going to say and I think I would like to believe that this time, it is different. So we don't see the same cyclicality and, of course, that might ring hollow because we don't know. But my view is that the availability of trucks has been so restricted for so long and there is fundamental demand for fleets. And despite low order intake because people have just given up putting orders into the system. But when those order books open for 2023 in September, that we are going to see a significant spike in orders from the larger fleets, where demand is clearly there because of the aging of the fleet and also to improve fuel efficiency with, say, regulations, which are particularly onerous in Europe. So my thought is that the supply chain problems, while they are easing, so a lot of the trucks that have been built called red tags with not a complete part set, have been clear to some degree, there are still significant shortages across a range of commodities, which are restricting build in the second half of this year. We have trimmed -- inside our guidance, we have trimmed our assumption by 5,000 or 10,000 trucks in North America as an example for this year because of a more conservative assumption regarding parts availability. It does mean, I think, that we will see the same sort of percentage increase I talked about before between 2022 and 2023. And given the fact that I don't -- even if we are going to build more next year, or is going to build more next year and will supply more wheels, there won't be the opportunity, again because of parts availability, to draw forward truck build out of 2024 when people try -- have historically try to build and buy ahead of the emissions changes that are coming. So my thought is that those emission changes will occur in 2024. Trucks will be built in the relevant calendar year and maybe even that people are interested in taking the improved fuel emissions from the trucks anyway. So I'm hoping that what we are going to see is an improvement in overall revenues in our Wheels business in 2023 and stability and maybe even improvement into 2024 as well. And that is despite the coming macroeconomic backlog of rising interest rates to fundamentally deplete supply and demand -- the supply situation that we have had, which has been extreme. So it is a long way of saying, I feel inherently optimistic about it, albeit I have calmed down the -- a little bit of the assumptions in 2022. Thank you. Yes. So for us, defense is a little bit seasonal, given the relatively large aftermarket component within it. And that is why it gives some confidence to second half solidity. At the same time, talking about the F-35 as a single item, which is about 35%, 40% of our defense sales, then we have been incurring the - I will say, destocking by our customer in the first half and that will continue in the second half. So the whole of this year, we are clear that we are under-supplying Lockheed's build of aircraft. And we do note they have cut that build assumption from 156 down to, I would say, 147, 149 or something as an assumption for this year and next. And therefore, again, it places a little bit more of a burden upon us for inventory takeout, which again, may fall over into the early part of next year. But the fundamental picture is one where our supply situation in 2023, we expect, will be better and improved compared to 2022. And again, what we are playing for is the angle of recovery just as I would commented about commercial aerospace earlier. So again, I just want to keep that big picture in mind the revenue increases and we are just debating the angle at this point in time. Thank you Matt. I'm going to say sequentially, this quarter was fairly minimal as a quarter-on-quarter, but I'm going to look to Ken in a second to cover that. I don't think we have broken down the 200 million between segment. But it is sufficient to say that the majority of that 200 million relates to aluminum. And I'm going to look to Ken to see whether he has that level of detail, George, to be able to respond to you. So if you could just hold for a second. I'm going to say aftermarket, we generally don't call the numbers out, but aftermarket was a small improvement in the first half. We are expecting a bigger improvement in the second half. But you can assume the first half was within a single-digit percentage of what we were supplying in the second half of last year, George. But expecting bigger things to achieve, what we believe will be a 30% plus year-on-year improvement in the spares business for us. Thank you. Yes. The inflation and certainly, materials inflation is not the biggest part of it. It is present, of course, across, let's say, titanium and some steel and aluminum for sure, but it is not the biggest part of it. When I stand back and say, is our Fasteners segment underperforming? So it is always a good question to ask yourself. I don't believe so. There are two significant factors which are going on, which go to that margin. One is the reduced build of composite aircraft and so if you look in the sequential margins of the business when 787 was basically taken down to, I will say, one to zero, then I think as we have explained before, the effect of a composite aircraft replacing a metallic aircraft is of significant value accretion for us. And therefore, we always look forward to that. And that is why we were looking forward to the 777X and the composite wings there, albeit obviously, that is pushed a little bit now. But essentially, if you think about mix because of 787, which hopefully, certainly as we turn the year because even though, let's say, I think Boeing will begin to deliver from inventory, and I think they may begin to build at a little bit higher rate in the second half, I don't know. But a lot of that build is going to come from inventory. And there are multiple tiers because of the distributed, I will say, supply base around the world of many of the components and trying to get an accurate picture of all that inventory is difficult. So that is why we have taken the assumption of 787 down to the 15 for the year from the 25. And therefore, that mix effect will continue to weigh on our Fastener business in the second half. And then the second thing is we have taken on a significant amount of people in our Fastener business during the last quarter, preparing for volume improvements as we go forward. And we did see volume pick up in Q2, and we are planning for further volume increases in Q3 and Q4, which basically is embedded in our guidance because we have also, as you see, lifted revenue guidance, the rate of client continues. So when you look at it, you shouldn't look at it compared to whether we beat consensus or beat guide or not, but you need to look at a more consistent track through the last year of consistent quarter-on-quarter, like we put on 100 million in like Q3 of last year, then a slight pause and another 100 million in Q1. Then we have just guided you to like another 100 million sort of average improvement. So it is coming and we are recruiting. And so when you combine both the recruitment costs that we have incurred in Fasteners in Q2, plus that mix effect, that really goes to the heart of the margin issues or not an issue, but the margin change. And then clearly, as those employees become more productive, and it is also going to be influenced by a rate of continued hiring as we prepare for next year, but I'm hoping that begins to improve because of the denominator will get bigger of the employee base. And then as 787 begins to start getting built in the first part of next year, then I do see things beginning to improve for that segment. What I would do is to guide you to what we have said by way of approaching 2.5 times net leverage by the end of the year. So you can reverse-engineer it from the cash flow that we have given you and an assumption around any balanced capital allocation between other than maybe reverse or the dividend increase, which I wanted to note, and that shows confidence in our cash flows and I think it is an important thing to do for our shareholders. At the same time, we will also be addressing hopefully some improvement in our debt structure and also hopefully, some continued, say, buyback of stock. But you mustn't assume it is all of one or anything. It is a balanced approach in that second half and you can get it is the -- whatever assumption you make in terms of whatever approaching 2.5 times is, so clearly better than three times. And I'm hopeful that, that will also reflect into the credit ratings of the company and also an approach which the - I will say, our shareholders are also pleased with that as well. Just picking up on your theme is that post separation, we went into the, I will say, COVID pandemic, but within times quarters, we would restored our margins. We have been consistent in performance and cash flow all the way since then. And as you have seen, putting the balance sheet in really great shape approaching eventually probably more of our target leverage, around that two times or better. So everything is progressing very satisfactorily. We are open to considering any M&A moves. But I always say it is more in that bolt-on scale, which we can deal within a quarter or so of cash flow and so no immediate thoughts to doing that. It is got a high hurdle to overcome, which is, does it provide a good return on capital for any such investment. Can we gain not only cost synergy but revenue synergy? And therefore, does it go with the strategic intent of the company? We have aimed it more, if we said if we are going to do it, it is probably more likely in our Engine or our Fastener business rather than elsewhere. But at the same time, again, trying to try and be disciplined about it all, but nothing that immediately would pass any hurdles compared to the relative risk-free I will say, action of buying our own stock back, which we obviously know well, feel confident in and have been consistent in buying back really almost every quarter over the last couple of years but only probably pause for a quarter or so in 2020 just after the, I will say, the onslaught of the pandemic. Yes. I mean, I will deal with our own inventory first before I comment on anything to do with our customer inventories. And we built a couple of hundred million of inventory in the first half. And we have tried to aim the majority of that towards finished goods. But not exclusively but a lot of it towards finished goods or certainly very advanced stage of work in progress, so that we can and have tried to keep pace and be able to satisfy our customers and have that ability to deliver our stock to meet their needs. And we are only tight in one or two places. Now having put that what I call the stock for hopefully improved supply security in the face of the lift in the demand is that I doubt we will try to replicate that again in the second half. There may be some but nothing at the scale of the first half, and trying to plan a steady level of production throughput improvements from the hiring we have done as we exit this year into 2023. And obviously, we will make those judgments exactly how much inventory we will carry into next year according to what the final shape of the increase in revenues for next year is. So I think all good on that front. So more of, it is less of a build and more of a pause but maybe some selective improvements in inventory in the second half. In terms of our customer inventory, it is difficult to really comment. I said 787, despite meaning we could assume that there will be build of aircraft in the second half. And I have a feeling that maybe you may see a higher increase in build than we thought because it may prove to be a good way of supplying those 787s into clearly, the airline demand, which is there, compared to the inventory we have. But we don't know that. And we have just said there is clearly inventory in the pipeline. There is inventory around, whether it is subsuppliers in Europe or in Japan or elsewhere in the world or in the U.S. And so let's be relatively safe. And therefore, we chose to take down our view of 787 for the second half, given the fact that it has been delayed from last year to Q1 to Q2. But all seems to be set well now. And as I have said in previous calls, the aircraft is a great aircraft. There is clearly demand and need for it there. International travel is coming back. And so I think that plus I have read that Airbus are considering even looking at possibly improving their wide-body rates as we go into next year beyond more than they have already signaled in Skyline. So I have some optimism, but really choose to say the improvement particularly for wide-body will be more of a 2023 feature and also for our commercial truck business. So I think that puts it out, Mike. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Please move to Slide 5 for an overview of the markets. Second quarter revenue was up 17% year-over-year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued in the second quarter, with commercial aerospace revenue up 34% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segments and the narrow-body recovery. Commercial aerospace 45% of total revenue, and although an improvement from 2021, we continue to be far short of the pre-COVID level, which was 60% of total revenue. Defense aerospace was essentially flat year-over-year as well as sequentially, driven by continued customer inventory corrections for the F-35. Commercial transportation, which impacts both Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segment, was up 19% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, driven by higher aluminum prices and higher volumes. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial, was down 4% year-over-year. Going deeper into this market, IGT was essentially flat, oil and gas was up 24% and general industrial was down 20% on a year-over-year basis. Now let's move to Slide 6. So let's start with the P&L with a focus on enhanced profitability. In the second quarter, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were at the high end of guidance as both metrics were up 17% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $317 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was also at the high end of guidance as it increased 10 basis points sequentially to 22.8%. Excluding the $60 million year-over-year revenue impact of higher material pass-through, EBITDA margin was 100 basis points higher at 23.8%. Adjusting for material pass-through, the flow of the incremental revenue to EBITDA was in-line with expectations at approximately 33%. We have been able to maintain our strong margins despite the impact of higher material pass-through and inflation as well as headcount additions to support future growth. During the second quarter, we continued the recruitment of headcount by approximately 740 employees, including net additions of approximately 455 in engines and 245 in fasteners as preparations are made for continued growth in the second half, adding to the growth already experienced in Q2. Year-to-date, we have increased headcount by more than 1,200 employees, and that has been focused in engines and in fasteners. Adjusted earnings per share exceeded the high end of the guidance at $0.35 per share, up 59% year-over-year. For the quarter, the impact of foreign currency on earnings was minimal. Moving to the balance sheet. Free cash flow in the second quarter was a positive 114 million, which excluded 44 million of proceeds generated from the sale and associated leaseback of our corporate headquarters in Pittsburgh. Cash on hand increased to 538 million after buying back 60 million of common stock, repurchasing 60 million of our 2024 bonds and funding the quarterly dividend. The average diluted share count improved to a Q2 exit rate of 421 million shares. Net pension and OPEB liabilities were reduced by approximately $60 million in the first half of 2022, and cash contributions were reduced by approximately 65% to 13 million on a year-over-year basis. Discount rates continue to be favorable, and we will remeasure at the end of the year, which should further reduce the net pension liabilities. Annual cash contributions are estimated to be approximately 60 million versus expense of 20 million. Finally, net debt to EBITDA improved to three times. As John mentioned earlier, we expect net debt to EBITDA to accelerate by year-end and move towards 2.5 times. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. Capital expenditures continued to be less than depreciation at approximately 67% in the second quarter. Productivity CapEx continues to be a focus on automation in both the engines and the fasteners business to improve yields, enhance quality, reduce outsourcing and mitigate labor risk. We purchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock in the quarter for 60 million. In the first half of 2022, we repurchased approximately 6.9 million shares of common stock for 235 million. I would also note that we purchased 0.9 million shares of common stock in July, which increases the July year-to-date repurchases to $265 million for 7.8 million shares with an average acquisition price of $33.76 per share. Board authorization for share repurchases is currently $1,082,000,000. Moving to debt. We repurchased 60 million of our 2024 bonds in the quarter with cash on hand, and this will reduce our annualized interest cost by approximately 3 million. Lastly, we continue to be confident in free cash flow and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segments. Q2 was another solid quarter for the Engine Products segment. Year-over-year revenue was 20% higher in the second quarter, with commercial aerospace up 39%, driven by the narrow-body recovery. Both IGT and defense aerospace were essentially flat year-over-year while oil and gas was up 24%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 38% year-over-year and margin improved 360 basis points to a record 27.5%, despite adding approximately 455 employees in the second quarter. Year-to-date, net headcount additions for Engines was approximately 780 employees. Please move to Slide 8. Fastening System's year-over-year revenue was 6% higher in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 20% higher, driven by the narrow-body recovery but somewhat offset by continued production declines for the Boeing 787. Industrial was down 26%, driven by a strong Q2 last year. We expect growth in industrial in the second half. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased 11% in the quarter and was impacted by inflationary cost and the addition of approximately 245 employees to support future growth. Year-to-date, headcount additions for Fasteners was approximately 380 employees. Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures' year-over-year revenue was 16% higher in the second quarter. Commercial aerospace was 37% higher as the narrow-body recovery more than offset the impact of production declines for the Boeing 787. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year despite the inventory burn-down of the F-35 and continued zero to low builds on the Boeing 787 and inflationary cost pressures. The Structures team delivered a Q2 EBITDA margin of 14.1%. I would note that the Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin was equal to the 2019 annual margin despite revenue being down approximately 40% using this quarter's annualized revenue. This was solid performance by the Structures team. Finally, let's move to Slide 10. As expected, Forged Wheels' year-over-year revenue was 22% higher in the second quarter. The $50 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by higher aluminum prices of 36 million and volume increases of 14 million or 7%. Commercial transportation demand remains strong but volumes continue to be impacted by customer supply chain issues, limiting commercial truck production. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased 7% despite the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, driven primarily by the Europe. While the pass-through of higher aluminum prices did not impact adjusted EBITDA dollars, it did unfavorably impact EBITDA margins by approximately 400 basis points. Before I turn it back to John to discuss guidance, you will note that we called out unfavorable foreign currency in the Wheels segment as a good portion of that segment's revenue has production cost and revenue in local currency. For Howmet in total, the aerospace segments provide a natural foreign currency hedge, while the aerospace segments also have a portion of their production costs in local currency, the majority of the revenue is in U.S. dollars. For the quarter, Howmet's overall foreign currency earnings impact was less than $1 million. Now let me turn it back over to John. Yes. Noah, I would add to that as well. We did bring down the 787 guide as well. That is a very profitable program for us. Now we did replace with some titanium. That is sort of lower margin so you have got a bit of a mixed component there. But also, I just wanted to clarify as well. So we said for Q3 EBITDA, 326 million. It is minus 6 million on the down to 320 million, up 5 million for the high side in Q3. That is all on Slide 11. And then the earnings per share, I just want to clarify, we have it on the slide there. $1.41 is the mid or down $0.03 on the low and up $0.01 on the high, but just want to clarify. Yes. So sequentially, it is really not a material impact, George. We haven't given - that 200 million, to your question, the breakdown of aluminum. But as you can imagine, aluminum is a big chunk of it. When you look at what we have talked about. So far in this quarter, we said 60 million of material pass-through of that. We had about 36 million, I believe I called out in my prepared comments, was aluminum. So I can kind of give you a guide."

My name is Eli, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Eli. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace First Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain Forward-Looking Statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. I would also like to point out that starting this quarter, we are moving our segment profitability measure from segment operating profit to segment adjusted EBITDA. We will use this measure to assess the segment's performance going forward. We will continue to provide depreciation and amortization by segment, giving investors the ability to continue to calculate segment operating profit. EBITDA for previous period segment profitability are included for comparison purposes. You can find these numbers in our earnings press release and on Slides 19 and 20 in today's presentation deck. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Pete. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Please move to Slide Number 4. The first quarter was another strong quarter for Howmet. Revenue was above the high end of guidance and profit was near the high end of guidance, which provided a very healthy start to the year. As expected, revenue was a little higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 with higher sales to commercial aerospace due to narrow body programs. These were partially offset by sales to the Boeing 787 platform and inventory takeout for structures on the F-35 program. Revenue played out as expected, and the good news is that we now have a new Boeing skyline production plan for the 787. The other good news is the improved outlook for COVID, with large reductions in cases and deaths in the western world. This has led to reduced testing for international travel, which is an important precursor to the pickup in wide-body commercial aerospace programs. The tragic Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to further increases in commodity inflation, notably for oil and materials. The effects of this will be outlined in my guidance comments. Moving to specific numbers. Revenue for the quarter was 1.3 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, which includes additional material pass-through of approximately $40 million. Clearly, this pass-through is excellent. However, it does unfavorably reflect in the EBITDA margin percentage by 70 basis points year-over-year. Without this effect, Q1 EBITDA margin was 23.4%, which was well ahead of Q1 of 2021. On a sequential basis, we also had an EBITDA margin improvement of 10 basis points adjusting for material pass-through. Adjusted EBITDA was strong at $300 million and earnings per share at $0.31, both of which were ahead of the midpoint of guidance. Free cash flow in the first quarter was essentially breakeven and resulted in cash on hand of 522 million after buying back $175 million of shares in the quarter. This buyback included an additional $75 million over and above the January buyback of $100 million noted in our February earnings call. The average diluted share count improved to 425 million in Q1 with an exit rate of 423 million shares. Lastly, we reduced pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $200 million year-over-year and reduced cash contributions by approximately 60%. I will now pass the call commentary over to Ken to detail the market dynamics and provide commentary on segment performance.\nKenneth Giacobbe: Great. Thank you, John. Please move to Slide 5 for an update on the end markets. First quarter revenue was up 10% year-over-year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued in the first quarter with commercial aerospace revenue up 29% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segment and the narrow body recovery. Commercial aerospace was 44% of total revenue, and although an improvement from 2021, it continues to be far forth of the pre-COVID level, which was 60% of total revenue. Moving to Defense Aerospace. Revenue was down 16% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially, driven by customer inventory corrections for the F-35. Commercial transportation, which impacts both Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segment was up 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven by higher aluminum prices. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was flat year-over-year. Going deeper within the industrial and other markets sector, IGT continues to be strong and was up 14% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Please move to Slide 6. Let's start with the P&L with a focus on enhanced profitability. In the first quarter, we had a healthy start to the year with adjusted EBITDA of 300 million, which exceeded the guidance midpoint. Margin was 22.7% and in line with guidance. Excluding the year-over-year revenue impact of higher material pass-through, EBITDA margin was 23.4%. Incremental flow-through of the higher revenue was in line with expectations at 33%. Adjusted earnings per share was strong at $0.31, up 41% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first quarter was essentially breakeven while building approximately $85 million of inventory in anticipation of the commercial aerospace recovery. Cash on hand was 522 million after buying back $175 million of common stock. The average diluted share count improved to a Q1 exit rate of 423 million shares. On a year-over-year basis, net pension and OPEB liabilities were reduced by 200 million and cash contributions were reduced by 60% to 13 million. Annual cash contributions are estimated to be approximately 60 million versus expense of $20 million. We continue to focus on reducing pension and OPEB gross and net liabilities. Comparing to the Europe separation in 2020, annual cash contributions were approximately $240 million and are expected to improve to $60 million this year, a substantial improvement. Additionally, expense is expected to be reduced from 35 million in 2020 to $20 million this year. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. Howmet's improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were recently reflected in Moody's April 27 credit rating upgrade from Ba2 to Ba1. Capital expenditures were approximately 94% of depreciation in the first quarter with productivity CapEx focused on automation projects in engines and fastener segments to improve yields and mitigate labor risk. We purchased approximately five million shares of common stock in the quarter for $175 million with an average acquisition price of $34 per share. Lastly, we continue to be confident in our free cash flow and paid the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results. As previously mentioned, starting this quarter we are moving our segment profitability measure from segment operating profit to segment adjusted EBITDA. We will use this measure to assess the segment's performance going forward while continuing to provide segment DNA in the appendix. Moving to Engine Products. Year-over-year revenue was up 18% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was up 45%, driven by the narrow body recovery. IGT was 14% higher as demand for cleaner energy continues. Defense aerospace was down 9% year-over-year. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased 31% year-over-year and margin improved 270 basis points while adding approximately 325 employees in the first quarter, which now brings the total adds to 1275 employees since Q1 of 2021. Now let's move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 3% lower in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was flat as the narrow body recovery was offset by continued production declines for the 787. Defense aerospace was down 24%, while commercial transportation was up 15%. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased 2% year-over-year, while margin improved 20 basis points. The quarter was impacted by inflationary costs and the addition of approximately 135 employees to support future growth. Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 3% higher in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was 36% higher as the narrow body recovery more than offset the impact of the declines of the fourth 787. The defense aerospace market was down 26% year-over-year, driven by customer inventory corrections for the F-35. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased 5% year-over-year, while margin improved 10 basis points. Finally, please move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 9% higher in the first quarter. The $20 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by higher aluminum prices of $29 million, somewhat offset by lower volumes. Pass-through of higher aluminum prices did not impact EBITDA dollars, but unfavorably impacted margin by approximately 360 basis points. Commercial transportation demand remained strong, but volumes continue to be impacted by customer supply chain issues limiting commercial truck production. One final comment on the segments. Consistent with our expected revenue growth, we are now hiring in every segment except for Engineered Structures, which is expected to commence in the second half of the year. Before turning it back over to John to discuss guidance, I would like to point out one additional item related to tax. There is a slide in the appendix that covers the operational tax rate. In 2021, the annual operational tax rate improved to 25%. The rate further improved to 24.6% in the first quarter of 2022. When comparing sequential performance, the Q1 rate of 24.6% compared to 20.7% in Q4 of 2021. The 390 basis point sequential increase in operational tax rate unfavorably impacted first quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.015. Now let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken. Let's move to Slide Number 11. Moving to ESG. I would encourage you to read our sustainability report found at howmet.com in the Investors section. Howmet is committed to improving our environmental footprint, and actions taken in 2021 have reduced Howmet's greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, wastewater use and landfill waste. We have funded approximately 100 projects, which are expected to reduce Howmet's Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 21.5% by 2024 compared to our 2019 baseline. Howmet is also committed to a safe workplace while fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment where all of our employees can thrive. Our safety record is five times better than the industry average. Moreover, Howmet was named one of the best places to work for LGBT equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. Regarding governance, the company was recognized by 50/50 Women and Boards for having 40% of our Board of Directors made up of women. Lastly, 81% of our key suppliers have sustainability programs considered to be leading or active. Howmet's portfolio at advanced energy-efficient projects ban several markets and contribute to substantial reductions in emissions. We will discuss Howmet's IP-rich portfolio and several of our differentiated products at Howmet's Technology Day on Monday, May 23rd, in New York. Let's move to Slide Number 12 and our second quarter guidance. The revenue outlook continues to show improvement. Let me start with commercial aerospace. Airline load factors show improvements in North America and Europe. China is lagging but is expected to show improvements later in 2022. This is leading to solid narrow body build projections for the Airbus A320 and 321 and the Airbus 321-XLR family of aircraft. Moreover, there is a notable order input for the Airbus 220 aircraft, for which Howmet has a very healthy shipset value roughly in line with the A320. We also expect to see further value content improvements later in 2022 when we begin to transition to the improved Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engine having both increased thrust and fuel efficiency. The volumes for the Boeing 737 MAX continued to grow with the rate improving to 31 per month compared to the exit rate in 2021 of 17 per month. As the rate moves towards this 31 per month range, the remaining inventory overhang will be extinguished. We also note by the middle of 2023, the Airbus A320, 321 rate of 65 per month will require Howmet to be at this rate as we transition into 2023, which is another pickup from the mid-50s rate in the middle of 2022. Revenue for the defense sector is solid, and after destocking of the structural buckets for the F-35, driven by lower-than-planned Lockheed build in 2020 and 2021, we expect growth will resume in 2023. We note the selection of the F-35 programs for the Air Forces in Germany, Switzerland, Canada and Finland in recent months, which is going to drive future volume projections. Moving industrial and other markets. Revenue for IGT remain strong, notably with average shipset values increasing with the larger, more sophisticated turbine blades for the aging J class turbines. One good aspect of the oil price increase is the expectation for Howmet - that this will show growth later in the year. Class A truck and trailer manufacturing are also expected to begin to grow as the supply chain constraints begin to ease, especially in the second half, but in fact, beginning in the second quarter. Specifically to address numbers for Q2 and the year. Revenue is expected in Q2 to be 1.37 billion, plus or minus 20 million; EBITDA of 310 million plus or minus eight million; EBITDA margin of 22.6%, plus 30 basis points minus 20 basis points; and earnings per share of $0.32 plus or minus $0.01. For the year, revenue of 5.64 billion, plus or minus 80 million; EBITDA of 1.3 billion, plus or minus 35 million; EBITDA margin of 23%, plus 30 basis points minus 20. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.39, plus or minus $0.06; and free cash flow of 625 million, plus or minus 50 million. Implicit in these numbers is capital expenditure of approximately 235 million and an improved tax rate of approximately 24.5%. In order to provide color on the near-term, revenues reflect the reduction of the Boeing 787 volumes and also increases for commodity inflation recoveries, there is a similar impact on EBITDA and EBITDA margin. You will note that the guidance leads to another very solid year for Howmet with growth and profit improvement and is setting the company up well to address the further growth expected in 2023 across all of our markets and especially the start of growth in the wide-body market. Also, as Ken mentioned, notably, we are now recruiting in three of our four segments. Move to Slide 13. The first quarter was a healthy start to the year. We delivered strong results that met or exceeded guidance. Year-over-year revenue grew 10% and earnings per share grew 41%. Free cash flow was essentially breakeven after approximately 85 million increase in inventory to support the aerospace recovery plus the commensurate increase in AR as a result of the increased sales. Liquidity is strong, and cash generation is expected to be very positive in the remaining quarters of 2022. The Q2 outlook for revenue is expected to be approximately 45 million higher than in Q1, with margins of approximately 22.5% to 23%, setting a platform for a healthy 22. Full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance has also been increased. And now we can move to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Stallard: John, there has obviously been a lot of talk about titanium and the Russian sanctions on VSMPO. It sounds like you are in discussions with a lot of potential customers. But I was wondering if you could give us an idea firstly of the timing on this, when you think these things will be sorted out? And then secondly, do you think you will be needing to spend more CapEx to add additional capacity?\nJohn Plant: Okay. So titanium, let me provide a slightly broader context for everybody on the call. I think everybody knows that Russia has been historically the largest supplier of titanium products in the world, coming from a low-cost country base. The business of VSMPO is contained with their industrial and military complex and clearly, it is pretty tough for companies to support this at this time given the invasion and, I will say, casualties as resulting from that invasion. Specifically regarding inquiries, we have been responsive to many RFQs, of which we expect to update you later in the year. Our thought is it is more likely to be a fourth quarter item and then increasingly a pickup of sales into 2023. Currently, we have not built any sales into our guidance for the year, but expect to update you in August when we provide our Q2 earnings. So zero in the revenue currently, but we do expect to show that when we have got things that we are clear on a guide that we would give you. Currently, our thought is that the aerospace customers, both aircraft builders and engine builders and other industrial markets, they are currently building product living off their inventories, albeit some of those customers do continue to buy from VSMPO just as normal. Regarding capital expenditure, Rob, we have no need to buy capital. Our thought is that we have enough available capacity to provide a very substantial supply to the industry, and not just the aerospace industry, maybe also for some industrial markets as well. It is unlikely that at this point until I knew the full outcome of the trajectory of this conflict, that we place capital. So I don't want to do that and then have people forget the current situation and rush back to sourcing in Russia. So basically, we are treating this as a serious opportunity and should see benefits in the back end of the year going into 2023. And more specifically, I will give you a revenue picture of that on the next call, hopefully.\nRobert Stallard: That is great. Thanks a lot John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning everyone. John, you mentioned I think early on in the call, you talked about 787 production plan, you talked about widebody as a driver into 2023. And I think said relatively shortly that you would be hiring in all of the segments. And so what can you tell us about that 787 outlook? What gives you confidence that this schedule will stick? And also that given the level of inventory at Boeing, that we will be able to see a meaningful increase in production?\nJohn Plant: Okay. Clearly, as each month goes by and each quarter goes by, our assumption is that Boeing are getting that much closer to resolution of this. We follow closely what they say. And I noticed, for example, CNBC interviews held recently at the South Carolina plant showing 787 tails on that. And so I think we can be a little bit more optimistic that things are gaining pace to get resolution. Clearly, certification is not yet there, although we again follow what the FAA say and say they will certify each individual plane delivered to the customers. We have heard that those deliveries are going to commence by the end of the second quarter and so we have revised our guidance and also future outlook in accordance with the Skyline issued by Boeing. And essentially, that has taken down the total number of 787 aircraft produced this year from, I think, 35 down to 24 or 25, something like that, and taking that revenue hit, but as you see, maintained our guide for the year. Clearly, we will feel a lot more comfortable when we see those deliveries actually commence rather than to say they are going to be commenced, because that will be then an absolutely clear sign that those, I will say, retrofitting and correction of their planes and then the current production is in, just call it, an okay condition. So I think we should be optimistic for the future. As I said before, it is a great aircraft. There is clearly a customer need for it. And I think to gain the economics around wide-body, long-haul transportation or passenger transportation for the world, we need that aircraft. And so optimistic that the current skyline is the one that is going to happen.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Myles Walton from UBS. Your line is now open.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. John, you mentioned inflationary effects running through the business. I wonder if you can just delve a little bit deeper on what maybe is not getting covered in your pricing. And then also, I noticed that the metal pass-through outside of the wheels segment, I guess, it is about $11 million and growing, where is that disproportionately falling?\nJohn Plant: Well, we have seen increases in the last year from aluminum, nickel, cobalt and more recently, titanium. And plus you say, rare metal like [rhemium] (Ph), et cetera. So it has been pretty widespread the commodity inflation. And you will have noted the fact halting and nickel trading during the last quarter, although that is now sort of recommenced. Our statements that we have made previously that we pass through 95% of metal holds and has been seen to hold as we have moved through the last few quarters, and so that is to the good. On the labor side, clearly, we seek to offset that in terms of productivity, as we do each year. And then clearly, some of the other costs, we are seeking to pass through as well and indeed have some agreements. But again, I have not really detailed those out and don't plan to do so today. But they do cover things like the cost of natural gas and electricity and freight, et cetera, et cetera. So clearly, the management of inflation is key. And I think the good news is you have seen Howmet maintain its margins, and in fact, without, it would have posted increased margins. So I think the secret or the key to all of this is can you move through this inflationary period, stay whole in terms of your absolute profits and if you can also increment margin or at least not go backwards fundamentally, then that is a huge success in this environment. And that is what we are seeking to do.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And the 125 million placeholder, what is that currently in 2022 for -.\nJohn Plant: You can assume it is probably up 50 million at this stage, give or take, these are very approximate numbers because it will change on a daily basis. But clearly, the 125 million was correct three-months ago or two-months ago. And since then, things have moved on. I think you know that the effects of the war that Russia launched on Ukraine has also had a fundamental effect on commodity prices starting with oil, but also into metals as well. And so it is moving rapidly at the moment again, albeit I'm hoping that some of this volatility begins to quieten down as we move into the second half of the year.\nMyles Walton: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have David Strauss from Barclays. Your line is open.\nDavid Strauss: Hey John, so the headcount increases, it seems like you are hiring back faster maybe than you had initially talked about a quarter or two ago. So could you just talk about kind of what the plan is for headcount now, I guess, where you stand in each of the businesses relative to where you were pre-pandemic in the plan from here? And then Ken, could you just talk about working capital, how you would expect the Q1 build to kind of unwind during the course of the rest of the year? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: So in second quarter of last year, you will recall us stating that we were going to hire, I think it was 400 or 500 people, which we started with and then continue. This is in our Engine Products business. And by the end of the year, we have recruited some 950 net additional people. I think starting early as we did and providing the base level of training, clearly, you can see it pay dividends. And you are looking at our engine margins today, which have shown, I will say, a good outcome in the light of us taking on some of that pain last year. We continue to recruit in Engine Products in the first quarter of this year, and now I'm going to say about another 250 heads, but again it is an approximate number. Wheels, as you know, we already started recruiting even before engine, and that has continued. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we do see the start of some improvements in the commercial truck build in the second quarter as a precursor to a stronger second half in that business and a robust 2023. So again, there is a willingness to recruit the increasing headcount in that business as well. I think the relative surprise to us was the decision that we made mid-Q1 to commence hiring in our fastener business. And that is a little bit ahead of what we thought, because of the demand outlook that we see again starting in Q2 and the balance of the year. So those are the three businesses that are recruiting, albeit better - I will say there could be passes, about 130 heads give or take and so a modest step but an important step, again, preparing the ground as we did to prepare the ground for our engine business a few months ago. The only business so far that we have not taken any recruitment steps on is our structures business as we burn off in the first half of this year some of the overhang, particularly on the titanium and aluminum bulkheads for the F-35 program, but have a view that mid of the second half of the year, so let's call it, end of Q3 or Q4. And obviously, that will be finessed as we get closer to the time, then we expect to commence hiring. And some of that is also tied up in the locking down of the scale of the additional orders for titanium, which we expect to talk to you about in August. So again, in summary, three areas of recruitment and an expectation with stronger sales of our normal structural products, the resumption of the 787 in the second half of production and some improvement in our F-35 outlook plus the titanium should enable us to consider recruitment in the second half. Ken, if you want to just touch on inventory.\nKenneth Giacobbe: Yes. So David, good morning. Your working capital question, so I will start with cash for the quarter was - free cash flow for the quarter was essentially breakeven. Embedded in that number was a working capital burn of around $140 million. The biggest chunk of that was inventory, $85 million of incremental inventory to get ready for the aero build here. So we want to be prepared for our customers, be able to deliver on time and in full. You will see that working capital number improve as we go through the year. As John mentioned, each quarter should generate positive free cash flow Q2 to Q4. As we exit the year, we have projected that we will have midpoint of around $625 million of free cash flow embedded in that number, it is around a $50 million burn associated with working capital. We will make a call as we get through the second part of the year, do we want to even build more inventory. That would be a good problem for us to have. But right now, it is about a $50 million cash burn as we exit the year, $625 million of free cash flow, and that is a free cash flow conversion of net income of over 100%.\nDavid Strauss: Great. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning. John, following up on the titanium question earlier. I mean we have seen Russia turn off gas to Poland and Bulgaria. And when you kind of think of ways, Russia could potentially pressure the West, I mean, VSMPO's annual revenue is only about 1.5% -- sorry, $1.5 billion, and you can't ship 99% of an airplane. That is not a deliverable airplane. When you think about that in that context, how much urgency are you seeing from your customer base to solve the VSMPO problem?\nJohn Plant: Again, we have a bit of a bifurcation of those, I will say, customers, which are continuing to buy on VSMPO and those which have decided to take the step either voluntary or because of sanctions or quality certifications that VSMPO will no longer be part of their supply situation. So where we are at the moment is they placed a lot of inquiries on us. We have been responsive to those inquiries in the last couple of months, laying out our commercial response to those requests. And we are in that decision-making process with the customers over which of the orders that they want to place with us and therefore what we plan to fulfill as we exit this year and going to next. Clearly, there was a buildup of inventories in recent months as people assess that a conflict was potentially about to occur -- and also just before sanctions is that I think a lot of inventory was pulled out of VSMPO that was available in that organization. And so clearly that has given a level of security stocks that will be burned off over the next few months. But clearly, there is going to be a supply situation emerging for us and some of our competitors, I guess, I'm going to call it, Q4 is the expectation and then into 2023. And given the tensions for those customers who have taken the decision that the VSMPO will no longer be part of their supply situation, I just cannot imagine them moving back given what I expect to be ongoing tensions with Russia. And I don't think anybody is going to say it is, \"Maybe the war is now over, we can all go back to normal.\" I don't think that is a realistic scenario for us. Indeed, I note that, for example, in Europe, they are taking steps now to gain increased energy independence given the threats that have been exactly, and as you mentioned, is the cessation of gas supplies into Poland, et cetera, et cetera. And just by way of supplemental information, clearly, the price of natural gas has skyrocket in Europe and may be a factor of 10 and clearly pressurizing industrial companies and including Howmet as we cope with these energy prices.\nKristine Liwag: Great. And John, if I could do a follow-up question. I mean, as you highlighted, VSMPO is a low-cost provider of titanium. So for you to take on incremental work, do you need to see customers change existing economics where maybe they will award you sole-source contracts going forward or have a take-or-pay type contract to make it more attractive?\nJohn Plant: I don't think that sole source needs to be an insistence. I think a long-term contract with guaranteed share as a requirements contract is important. I certainly have no intentions of just picking up a spot business for a moment in time. So the most important thing for myself is to see longevity of contracts through -- into the future, such that any efforts that we make by way of bringing equipment back online and recruitment of people is there for the long haul. I have no intention of recruiting people and then to terminate them just for a moment, a flash of business.\nKristine Liwag: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Gautam Khanna from Cowen. Your line is open.\nGautam Khanna: Wondering if you could -- there has been speculation or discussion about forgings and castings pinch points in the supply chain. Wondering if you guys can talk about whether that is presented opportunity for you guys to pick up share or did you see an increase in past dues this quarter, maybe if your could quantify it. And then as a follow-up, just wanted to get your views on LEAP production next year. So maybe your thoughts on the 737 MAX, where that might go, just because at some point you got to be ahead of that, to your point earlier. And you talked about the A320neo, but what is your view on the MAX and how much and how quickly that rises above 31%? Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Okay. So let's deal with castings and forgings, because there has been commentary from some of our customers, in fact, published in the press, about they see that as a pinch point. And I'm going to repeat what I have said in that it is great now that some of our customers recognize just how difficult and exacting these products are. It is not something you can just turn on or off because of the skill, precision and knowledge that needs to be brought to bear to make these products in volume with the tolerances and, I will say, specifications that are extraordinary. And so I have seen that comment. I know that one of our customers commented this week in their earnings call that they have seen some concerns around the titanium castings and restricted some of their build. I suppose the good news for us is that we don't make titanium castings, so that puts that one to bed. In terms of volume, certainly, volumes are up. You can see that in our engine business and continue to be strong both in the current quarter and outlook. Clearly, there are always going to be pinch points. And when you look across the tens of thousands of different part numbers that we supply, is that it is -- over the next 18-months, two-years, three-years, I have no doubt that we will have pinch points that will occur. I have seen some of the details, because I speaking intimately with some of our plants and those also even anything that gets tight. So I tend to be intimate with what is going on. My sense is that we have been asked because of the changing volumes that - it is a little bit higher than I have seen in terms of engine build. And so I think that - or I suspect that we are being asked to produce a little bit more than our normal share, which I guess is good. But inevitably, as we try to provide commitments against those, some of those commitments are going to get tight and indeed have got tight. But again, for one customer, which is commenting in the press, is that I know at the end of last month there were parts available to be delivered, just required sign off but just left on - clearly were not needed by that customer in terms of picking up for any urgent requirements. So a general sweep through would be we are in a relatively good condition, inevitably some pinch points here or there. And I expect that we will begin to see, and in fact, we are expecting to see some spot business occur in the second half of this year, where the customers haven't scheduled on us, or maybe it will occur because we may have a supply ability whereas others may not given our investments into the two new engine plants that we made during the 2019 year going into early 2020. So a relatively healthy position. You have seen the hiring that we have done now, let's call it, around about 1200 people into our engine business. And it is all been to provide our ability to respond to the industry. And clearly, part of the inventory increase that Ken's talked to, the 85 million that we put into inventory in the first quarter, a significant amount of that is in our engine business such that we can respond to future demand. So I hope that gives you a pretty good picture over castings and forgings and Howmet currently. The second part of your question concerned the MAX. And where is MAX going? I mean, clearly, that is more a question for Boeing than it is for Howmet. We are clear that 31 is the number for this year. Our thoughts about it is that assuming that 737 MAX deliveries do occur into China in the second half, which is an important step that we are still wanting to see, is that when that occurs and the inventories of MAX aircraft reduce the Boeing is that then I will have some confidence in the rate may tick above 31. Boeing have been in contact with us and talked about a higher number, and we know for the engine manufacturers of a potentially higher number. But at the moment, we are not responsive to that given the fact that we have no skyline that states anything greater than 31. And for me, the way I think about it, which, again, may not be correct, but it is the way I think about it, is that the gating item is deliveries of the MAX into China and the fleet for Chinese airlines. And when we see that confidence, we will begin to increase. And I guess that will trigger for us the thoughts around further recruitment to support LEAP engine production as we go forward into the future.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Spingarn: Good morning. John, on these large structural castings that we have heard about and that you just referred to, is there an opportunity to get into that business or move further into that as the competitor may just simply not be able to catch up?\nJohn Plant: In the short-term, only where it is currently dual-sourced would we have the opportunity. If we don't have the current tooling for the required specific dies, then there is no possibility of us being responsive to that. It would take, I will say, some time to prepare tooling and gain quality certification for any increases in that. Clearly, we have an ambition to further increase our share in that segment, but it is not really a short-term issue. Except when there is a dual-source contract.\nRobert Spingarn: Right. I guess the reason I'm bringing it up is for a very long time, the other guys dominated that business, and there is really been no reason for Howmet to try to go there. But I'm wondering if this whole situation creates a window, and maybe as LTAs expire or a new engine comes along, this is something you want to pursue.\nJohn Plant: In 2015, Howmet actually built a second plant in our LaPorte, Indiana facility, which we - I'm not quite sure why, what we call it BC2. It is not very innovative because the first one was called BC1. But basically, at that time, our first plant made relatively smaller structural castings. And I will get this number wrong, but I'm going say you know up to 20 inches in diameter. And we make a virtue of making round castings, structural castings. We have an expertise in that. And BC2, we increased the capacity and capabilities to make larger structural castings and call those out maybe up to 40 inches. But again, that is probably a very approximate number. I need refresh my mind about exactly what size we can. So clearly, we have the capability and capacity to move it further in that segment and take onboard - and indeed have been taking onboard some of the larger structural castings, albeit we are not at the outer extremes of, I'm going to say, 50 or 60 inches currently. So that facility is seeing increased work, we have been recruiting a lot in both our first and second plants at that site and continue to do so in the future. And we expect to see good things come from that and also hope that upon LTA renewal that we will see increased business again coming towards that plant.\nRobert Spingarn: Any timing on that last part?\nJohn Plant: No, nothing that I want to comment on today. But let's say, this is not a one-year thing. It is over the next, I will say, two to four-years.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNoah Poponak: John, could you spend a little bit more time on the Engine Products margin and the Forged Wheels margin just given those had a decent variance versus at least what we were looking for in the quarter and so how sustainable is that engine margin? What does it take to get Forged recovered as you move through the year?\nJohn Plant: Okay. So First of all, as a general rule, we don't guide at a subsegment level and didn't provide that guidance in the first quarter. So not surprisingly, I'm going to say we were pretty much exactly where we thought we would be. First of all, the volume leverage that we are seeing in our engine business. And the reason why we expected that, if you remember, we signaled it, we talked about recruitment, we talked about metal pass-through and the upside benefit relative to volume. And so for us, that segmental strength was, I'm going to say, pretty much in line, if anything, towards the top end of, if not at the top end of what we thought was possible. And clearly, what we would like to see is that maintained during the course of this year. And if we are able to take another step next year all well and good, albeit we are not, again, talking and guiding at the subsegment level. For the wheels, again, we had flagged to you, the increase in metal would have a very significant effect on the margins in that segment. And with the price of aluminum, I'm just going to refresh everybody, is that 18-months, two-years ago, that was about $1,900 a ton. And that peaked in the first quarter -- and hopefully, it is peaked because it was $4,500 a ton. So more than doubling of the metal inputs to that segment. And again, I think I told you that we would be resetting prices in that segment every six-months. It is probably one of the long leg items in terms of, I will say, repricing for base metal. And that takes effect and took effect on the 1st of January as signaled to you. So the reset to the increased metal prices at the second half of last year reflected in the first quarter of this year was exactly in line with what we said, and I think Ken called out like 350, 360 basis points of metal impact. And that reconciles it exactly for you. And so again, as we see it, all is in order for that segment as well. And so it is the one segment that we have, which does have higher metals volatility. But in normal times, I'm going to say that is not really very significant and not significant for the company really at all. But when you have had such extreme movements, I think anybody that is going from below 2,000 to well in the - between 4,000 and 5,000, that we might look at an extreme movement. And we have seen I think, quite extraordinary movements in all sorts of commodities in recent times. And you can start with oil, $40 to $50 a barrel to over $100. We have seen it 125 it is now like 104. I mean, these things are moving at a pace. So at a subsegment level, everything that you saw is something that we had anticipated. I'm not saying that we have got the crystal ball foresight for everything, because we don't. But at the same time, what we have planned out for our engine business occurred what we said was going to happen for margins in our wheels business occurred. And so for us, it was just exactly as planned.\nNoah Poponak: I appreciate all that detail, it is helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Akers: Hi good morning. Thanks for the question. Just on the wheels business, maybe just leaving the metal price aside, like how much is volume there depressed now versus what it would be if some of these supply chain constraints weren't in the way or how much upside is there once those lift? And also, it sounds like you are seeing some positive signs of that into Q2 and maybe in the second half. I wonder if you could elaborate on what you are seeing there.\nJohn Plant: Yes. I have got an exact number for truck build this year. but I'm going to take a swag at it and say I think we are going to see a minimum of a 15% volume lift as we go into next year. And it could be higher than that. I think there is tremendous pent-up demand for trucks. I have read articles recently are saying truck drivers are available, the trucks. And our customers, in fact, have not been taking orders, because they can't deliver. It is not a lack of witness by fleets to order, and the backlog is bigger than it is ever been. So my expectation is -- I will just give like a North American number, I think we are going to see some trucks level, it is like 300,000 trucks maybe as we go into next year or slightly more. But it is going to be governed by the responsiveness to capacity and the willingness to take on orders given the availability of, in particular, silicon for some of the semiconductors. Silicon hasn't been the only issue. It has been one of tires and resins and even windshields as well. But the signs are that this is beginning to ease. It is still very constrained, but we do expect a volume pickup in Q2 and in the second half of the year, building what we hope for but we don't yet know is going to be a very healthy 2023 and 2024. The traditional pull ahead for emissions, which you get from our North American emissions rate change for 2024, I don't believe that can realistically happen in 2023 given the capacity constraints. So that is going to mean a pretty healthy both for markets for 2023 and 2024 for both the North America and for Europe. Maybe when I'm talking about trucks, I think it is probably reasonable to give you like a headline outlook for the future, given the requirements for CO2 reduction in Europe, then the changes which are being brought to bear over the next, say, five to seven-years for commercial trucks in Europe in terms of the different, I will say, power generation or say not from fossil fuel, but maybe from electrification or hydrogen engines or whatever it is, then that is taking a pace. And all of that is really friendly towards us because you are not going to invest in very expensive new powertrains, take onboard some of those costs and the weight that those solutions evolve like heavy battery packs without taking the advantage of the massive reduction in weight coming from aluminum. So my expectation is that those volume changes for those - because of those emissions requirements are going to be very healthy to the share of aluminum wheels and its penetration against steel over the next -- all the years up to 2030 because of these changes. So I just want to give you that as a supplement to just the here and now of volume this year and into next.\nMatthew Akers: Yes. That is a great color. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we have Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your like is open.\nPhilip Gibbs: There was a 26 million sequential pickup in Engine Products revenues and a $23 million pickup in operating income despite further headcount additions, I think you made mention of that. What drove the near dollar-for-dollar conversion for revs into profits, was that a lot of pricing, a lot of mix, timing of costs just trying to think about that.\nJohn Plant: My guess is that all of those things is that we have got volume leverage, we also price healthy, efficiency in our operations as well. So basically, every aspect of that business, whether it is the top line in terms of unit price or just efficiency and then volume leverage to the upside, every one of those things was coming to bear to give us the outcome that we saw, which, as you saw, was above guidance for the whole company, and some of that came from engine. So we were, I would say, quite pleased with it. And our job is can we operate at that level going forward and hold it for the next couple of quarters and to see whether we can take further steps. That remains to be seen yet. I'm not ready to commit that or I have just commented, I have just give you a guidance at the company level, which shows further EBITDA improvements in absolute profit and revenue. So all is good.\nPhilip Gibbs: And John, I just wanted to double check the comment you made earlier. You said anything you may win in titanium from an RFQ standpoint is not embedded in either your revenue or CapEx thoughts for this year?\nJohn Plant: Yes, zero in the revenue line, and I have no CapEx thought at all regarding titanium at this point. And so there will be no change at all for that on the CapEx line. And going to how we -- how successful we are or also it is going to reflect in the robustness and believability of customer schedules as we get into the back half is that -- I will reflect that in guidance when we get to August.\nPhilip Gibbs: Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, Pete. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Please move to Slide Number 4. The first quarter was another strong quarter for Howmet. Revenue was above the high end of guidance and profit was near the high end of guidance, which provided a very healthy start to the year. As expected, revenue was a little higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 with higher sales to commercial aerospace due to narrow body programs. These were partially offset by sales to the Boeing 787 platform and inventory takeout for structures on the F-35 program. Revenue played out as expected, and the good news is that we now have a new Boeing skyline production plan for the 787. The other good news is the improved outlook for COVID, with large reductions in cases and deaths in the western world. This has led to reduced testing for international travel, which is an important precursor to the pickup in wide-body commercial aerospace programs. The tragic Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to further increases in commodity inflation, notably for oil and materials. The effects of this will be outlined in my guidance comments. Moving to specific numbers. Revenue for the quarter was 1.3 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, which includes additional material pass-through of approximately $40 million. Clearly, this pass-through is excellent. However, it does unfavorably reflect in the EBITDA margin percentage by 70 basis points year-over-year. Without this effect, Q1 EBITDA margin was 23.4%, which was well ahead of Q1 of 2021. On a sequential basis, we also had an EBITDA margin improvement of 10 basis points adjusting for material pass-through. Adjusted EBITDA was strong at $300 million and earnings per share at $0.31, both of which were ahead of the midpoint of guidance. Free cash flow in the first quarter was essentially breakeven and resulted in cash on hand of 522 million after buying back $175 million of shares in the quarter. This buyback included an additional $75 million over and above the January buyback of $100 million noted in our February earnings call. The average diluted share count improved to 425 million in Q1 with an exit rate of 423 million shares. Lastly, we reduced pension and OPEB liabilities by approximately $200 million year-over-year and reduced cash contributions by approximately 60%. I will now pass the call commentary over to Ken to detail the market dynamics and provide commentary on segment performance. Thanks, Ken. Let's move to Slide Number 11. Moving to ESG. I would encourage you to read our sustainability report found at howmet.com in the Investors section. Howmet is committed to improving our environmental footprint, and actions taken in 2021 have reduced Howmet's greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, wastewater use and landfill waste. We have funded approximately 100 projects, which are expected to reduce Howmet's Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 21.5% by 2024 compared to our 2019 baseline. Howmet is also committed to a safe workplace while fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment where all of our employees can thrive. Our safety record is five times better than the industry average. Moreover, Howmet was named one of the best places to work for LGBT equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. Regarding governance, the company was recognized by 50/50 Women and Boards for having 40% of our Board of Directors made up of women. Lastly, 81% of our key suppliers have sustainability programs considered to be leading or active. Howmet's portfolio at advanced energy-efficient projects ban several markets and contribute to substantial reductions in emissions. We will discuss Howmet's IP-rich portfolio and several of our differentiated products at Howmet's Technology Day on Monday, May 23rd, in New York. Let's move to Slide Number 12 and our second quarter guidance. The revenue outlook continues to show improvement. Let me start with commercial aerospace. Airline load factors show improvements in North America and Europe. China is lagging but is expected to show improvements later in 2022. This is leading to solid narrow body build projections for the Airbus A320 and 321 and the Airbus 321-XLR family of aircraft. Moreover, there is a notable order input for the Airbus 220 aircraft, for which Howmet has a very healthy shipset value roughly in line with the A320. We also expect to see further value content improvements later in 2022 when we begin to transition to the improved Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engine having both increased thrust and fuel efficiency. The volumes for the Boeing 737 MAX continued to grow with the rate improving to 31 per month compared to the exit rate in 2021 of 17 per month. As the rate moves towards this 31 per month range, the remaining inventory overhang will be extinguished. We also note by the middle of 2023, the Airbus A320, 321 rate of 65 per month will require Howmet to be at this rate as we transition into 2023, which is another pickup from the mid-50s rate in the middle of 2022. Revenue for the defense sector is solid, and after destocking of the structural buckets for the F-35, driven by lower-than-planned Lockheed build in 2020 and 2021, we expect growth will resume in 2023. We note the selection of the F-35 programs for the Air Forces in Germany, Switzerland, Canada and Finland in recent months, which is going to drive future volume projections. Moving industrial and other markets. Revenue for IGT remain strong, notably with average shipset values increasing with the larger, more sophisticated turbine blades for the aging J class turbines. One good aspect of the oil price increase is the expectation for Howmet - that this will show growth later in the year. Class A truck and trailer manufacturing are also expected to begin to grow as the supply chain constraints begin to ease, especially in the second half, but in fact, beginning in the second quarter. Specifically to address numbers for Q2 and the year. Revenue is expected in Q2 to be 1.37 billion, plus or minus 20 million; EBITDA of 310 million plus or minus eight million; EBITDA margin of 22.6%, plus 30 basis points minus 20 basis points; and earnings per share of $0.32 plus or minus $0.01. For the year, revenue of 5.64 billion, plus or minus 80 million; EBITDA of 1.3 billion, plus or minus 35 million; EBITDA margin of 23%, plus 30 basis points minus 20. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.39, plus or minus $0.06; and free cash flow of 625 million, plus or minus 50 million. Implicit in these numbers is capital expenditure of approximately 235 million and an improved tax rate of approximately 24.5%. In order to provide color on the near-term, revenues reflect the reduction of the Boeing 787 volumes and also increases for commodity inflation recoveries, there is a similar impact on EBITDA and EBITDA margin. You will note that the guidance leads to another very solid year for Howmet with growth and profit improvement and is setting the company up well to address the further growth expected in 2023 across all of our markets and especially the start of growth in the wide-body market. Also, as Ken mentioned, notably, we are now recruiting in three of our four segments. Move to Slide 13. The first quarter was a healthy start to the year. We delivered strong results that met or exceeded guidance. Year-over-year revenue grew 10% and earnings per share grew 41%. Free cash flow was essentially breakeven after approximately 85 million increase in inventory to support the aerospace recovery plus the commensurate increase in AR as a result of the increased sales. Liquidity is strong, and cash generation is expected to be very positive in the remaining quarters of 2022. The Q2 outlook for revenue is expected to be approximately 45 million higher than in Q1, with margins of approximately 22.5% to 23%, setting a platform for a healthy 22. Full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance has also been increased. And now we can move to Q&A. Okay. So titanium, let me provide a slightly broader context for everybody on the call. I think everybody knows that Russia has been historically the largest supplier of titanium products in the world, coming from a low-cost country base. The business of VSMPO is contained with their industrial and military complex and clearly, it is pretty tough for companies to support this at this time given the invasion and, I will say, casualties as resulting from that invasion. Specifically regarding inquiries, we have been responsive to many RFQs, of which we expect to update you later in the year. Our thought is it is more likely to be a fourth quarter item and then increasingly a pickup of sales into 2023. Currently, we have not built any sales into our guidance for the year, but expect to update you in August when we provide our Q2 earnings. So zero in the revenue currently, but we do expect to show that when we have got things that we are clear on a guide that we would give you. Currently, our thought is that the aerospace customers, both aircraft builders and engine builders and other industrial markets, they are currently building product living off their inventories, albeit some of those customers do continue to buy from VSMPO just as normal. Regarding capital expenditure, Rob, we have no need to buy capital. Our thought is that we have enough available capacity to provide a very substantial supply to the industry, and not just the aerospace industry, maybe also for some industrial markets as well. It is unlikely that at this point until I knew the full outcome of the trajectory of this conflict, that we place capital. So I don't want to do that and then have people forget the current situation and rush back to sourcing in Russia. So basically, we are treating this as a serious opportunity and should see benefits in the back end of the year going into 2023. And more specifically, I will give you a revenue picture of that on the next call, hopefully. Thank you. Okay. Clearly, as each month goes by and each quarter goes by, our assumption is that Boeing are getting that much closer to resolution of this. We follow closely what they say. And I noticed, for example, CNBC interviews held recently at the South Carolina plant showing 787 tails on that. And so I think we can be a little bit more optimistic that things are gaining pace to get resolution. Clearly, certification is not yet there, although we again follow what the FAA say and say they will certify each individual plane delivered to the customers. We have heard that those deliveries are going to commence by the end of the second quarter and so we have revised our guidance and also future outlook in accordance with the Skyline issued by Boeing. And essentially, that has taken down the total number of 787 aircraft produced this year from, I think, 35 down to 24 or 25, something like that, and taking that revenue hit, but as you see, maintained our guide for the year. Clearly, we will feel a lot more comfortable when we see those deliveries actually commence rather than to say they are going to be commenced, because that will be then an absolutely clear sign that those, I will say, retrofitting and correction of their planes and then the current production is in, just call it, an okay condition. So I think we should be optimistic for the future. As I said before, it is a great aircraft. There is clearly a customer need for it. And I think to gain the economics around wide-body, long-haul transportation or passenger transportation for the world, we need that aircraft. And so optimistic that the current skyline is the one that is going to happen. Thank you. Well, we have seen increases in the last year from aluminum, nickel, cobalt and more recently, titanium. And plus you say, rare metal like [rhemium] (Ph), et cetera. So it has been pretty widespread the commodity inflation. And you will have noted the fact halting and nickel trading during the last quarter, although that is now sort of recommenced. Our statements that we have made previously that we pass through 95% of metal holds and has been seen to hold as we have moved through the last few quarters, and so that is to the good. On the labor side, clearly, we seek to offset that in terms of productivity, as we do each year. And then clearly, some of the other costs, we are seeking to pass through as well and indeed have some agreements. But again, I have not really detailed those out and don't plan to do so today. But they do cover things like the cost of natural gas and electricity and freight, et cetera, et cetera. So clearly, the management of inflation is key. And I think the good news is you have seen Howmet maintain its margins, and in fact, without, it would have posted increased margins. So I think the secret or the key to all of this is can you move through this inflationary period, stay whole in terms of your absolute profits and if you can also increment margin or at least not go backwards fundamentally, then that is a huge success in this environment. And that is what we are seeking to do. You can assume it is probably up 50 million at this stage, give or take, these are very approximate numbers because it will change on a daily basis. But clearly, the 125 million was correct three-months ago or two-months ago. And since then, things have moved on. I think you know that the effects of the war that Russia launched on Ukraine has also had a fundamental effect on commodity prices starting with oil, but also into metals as well. And so it is moving rapidly at the moment again, albeit I'm hoping that some of this volatility begins to quieten down as we move into the second half of the year. So in second quarter of last year, you will recall us stating that we were going to hire, I think it was 400 or 500 people, which we started with and then continue. This is in our Engine Products business. And by the end of the year, we have recruited some 950 net additional people. I think starting early as we did and providing the base level of training, clearly, you can see it pay dividends. And you are looking at our engine margins today, which have shown, I will say, a good outcome in the light of us taking on some of that pain last year. We continue to recruit in Engine Products in the first quarter of this year, and now I'm going to say about another 250 heads, but again it is an approximate number. Wheels, as you know, we already started recruiting even before engine, and that has continued. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we do see the start of some improvements in the commercial truck build in the second quarter as a precursor to a stronger second half in that business and a robust 2023. So again, there is a willingness to recruit the increasing headcount in that business as well. I think the relative surprise to us was the decision that we made mid-Q1 to commence hiring in our fastener business. And that is a little bit ahead of what we thought, because of the demand outlook that we see again starting in Q2 and the balance of the year. So those are the three businesses that are recruiting, albeit better - I will say there could be passes, about 130 heads give or take and so a modest step but an important step, again, preparing the ground as we did to prepare the ground for our engine business a few months ago. The only business so far that we have not taken any recruitment steps on is our structures business as we burn off in the first half of this year some of the overhang, particularly on the titanium and aluminum bulkheads for the F-35 program, but have a view that mid of the second half of the year, so let's call it, end of Q3 or Q4. And obviously, that will be finessed as we get closer to the time, then we expect to commence hiring. And some of that is also tied up in the locking down of the scale of the additional orders for titanium, which we expect to talk to you about in August. So again, in summary, three areas of recruitment and an expectation with stronger sales of our normal structural products, the resumption of the 787 in the second half of production and some improvement in our F-35 outlook plus the titanium should enable us to consider recruitment in the second half. Ken, if you want to just touch on inventory. Thank you. Again, we have a bit of a bifurcation of those, I will say, customers, which are continuing to buy on VSMPO and those which have decided to take the step either voluntary or because of sanctions or quality certifications that VSMPO will no longer be part of their supply situation. So where we are at the moment is they placed a lot of inquiries on us. We have been responsive to those inquiries in the last couple of months, laying out our commercial response to those requests. And we are in that decision-making process with the customers over which of the orders that they want to place with us and therefore what we plan to fulfill as we exit this year and going to next. Clearly, there was a buildup of inventories in recent months as people assess that a conflict was potentially about to occur -- and also just before sanctions is that I think a lot of inventory was pulled out of VSMPO that was available in that organization. And so clearly that has given a level of security stocks that will be burned off over the next few months. But clearly, there is going to be a supply situation emerging for us and some of our competitors, I guess, I'm going to call it, Q4 is the expectation and then into 2023. And given the tensions for those customers who have taken the decision that the VSMPO will no longer be part of their supply situation, I just cannot imagine them moving back given what I expect to be ongoing tensions with Russia. And I don't think anybody is going to say it is, \"Maybe the war is now over, we can all go back to normal.\" I don't think that is a realistic scenario for us. Indeed, I note that, for example, in Europe, they are taking steps now to gain increased energy independence given the threats that have been exactly, and as you mentioned, is the cessation of gas supplies into Poland, et cetera, et cetera. And just by way of supplemental information, clearly, the price of natural gas has skyrocket in Europe and may be a factor of 10 and clearly pressurizing industrial companies and including Howmet as we cope with these energy prices. I don't think that sole source needs to be an insistence. I think a long-term contract with guaranteed share as a requirements contract is important. I certainly have no intentions of just picking up a spot business for a moment in time. So the most important thing for myself is to see longevity of contracts through -- into the future, such that any efforts that we make by way of bringing equipment back online and recruitment of people is there for the long haul. I have no intention of recruiting people and then to terminate them just for a moment, a flash of business. Thank you. Okay. So let's deal with castings and forgings, because there has been commentary from some of our customers, in fact, published in the press, about they see that as a pinch point. And I'm going to repeat what I have said in that it is great now that some of our customers recognize just how difficult and exacting these products are. It is not something you can just turn on or off because of the skill, precision and knowledge that needs to be brought to bear to make these products in volume with the tolerances and, I will say, specifications that are extraordinary. And so I have seen that comment. I know that one of our customers commented this week in their earnings call that they have seen some concerns around the titanium castings and restricted some of their build. I suppose the good news for us is that we don't make titanium castings, so that puts that one to bed. In terms of volume, certainly, volumes are up. You can see that in our engine business and continue to be strong both in the current quarter and outlook. Clearly, there are always going to be pinch points. And when you look across the tens of thousands of different part numbers that we supply, is that it is -- over the next 18-months, two-years, three-years, I have no doubt that we will have pinch points that will occur. I have seen some of the details, because I speaking intimately with some of our plants and those also even anything that gets tight. So I tend to be intimate with what is going on. My sense is that we have been asked because of the changing volumes that - it is a little bit higher than I have seen in terms of engine build. And so I think that - or I suspect that we are being asked to produce a little bit more than our normal share, which I guess is good. But inevitably, as we try to provide commitments against those, some of those commitments are going to get tight and indeed have got tight. But again, for one customer, which is commenting in the press, is that I know at the end of last month there were parts available to be delivered, just required sign off but just left on - clearly were not needed by that customer in terms of picking up for any urgent requirements. So a general sweep through would be we are in a relatively good condition, inevitably some pinch points here or there. And I expect that we will begin to see, and in fact, we are expecting to see some spot business occur in the second half of this year, where the customers haven't scheduled on us, or maybe it will occur because we may have a supply ability whereas others may not given our investments into the two new engine plants that we made during the 2019 year going into early 2020. So a relatively healthy position. You have seen the hiring that we have done now, let's call it, around about 1200 people into our engine business. And it is all been to provide our ability to respond to the industry. And clearly, part of the inventory increase that Ken's talked to, the 85 million that we put into inventory in the first quarter, a significant amount of that is in our engine business such that we can respond to future demand. So I hope that gives you a pretty good picture over castings and forgings and Howmet currently. The second part of your question concerned the MAX. And where is MAX going? I mean, clearly, that is more a question for Boeing than it is for Howmet. We are clear that 31 is the number for this year. Our thoughts about it is that assuming that 737 MAX deliveries do occur into China in the second half, which is an important step that we are still wanting to see, is that when that occurs and the inventories of MAX aircraft reduce the Boeing is that then I will have some confidence in the rate may tick above 31. Boeing have been in contact with us and talked about a higher number, and we know for the engine manufacturers of a potentially higher number. But at the moment, we are not responsive to that given the fact that we have no skyline that states anything greater than 31. And for me, the way I think about it, which, again, may not be correct, but it is the way I think about it, is that the gating item is deliveries of the MAX into China and the fleet for Chinese airlines. And when we see that confidence, we will begin to increase. And I guess that will trigger for us the thoughts around further recruitment to support LEAP engine production as we go forward into the future. Thank you. In the short-term, only where it is currently dual-sourced would we have the opportunity. If we don't have the current tooling for the required specific dies, then there is no possibility of us being responsive to that. It would take, I will say, some time to prepare tooling and gain quality certification for any increases in that. Clearly, we have an ambition to further increase our share in that segment, but it is not really a short-term issue. Except when there is a dual-source contract. In 2015, Howmet actually built a second plant in our LaPorte, Indiana facility, which we - I'm not quite sure why, what we call it BC2. It is not very innovative because the first one was called BC1. But basically, at that time, our first plant made relatively smaller structural castings. And I will get this number wrong, but I'm going say you know up to 20 inches in diameter. And we make a virtue of making round castings, structural castings. We have an expertise in that. And BC2, we increased the capacity and capabilities to make larger structural castings and call those out maybe up to 40 inches. But again, that is probably a very approximate number. I need refresh my mind about exactly what size we can. So clearly, we have the capability and capacity to move it further in that segment and take onboard - and indeed have been taking onboard some of the larger structural castings, albeit we are not at the outer extremes of, I'm going to say, 50 or 60 inches currently. So that facility is seeing increased work, we have been recruiting a lot in both our first and second plants at that site and continue to do so in the future. And we expect to see good things come from that and also hope that upon LTA renewal that we will see increased business again coming towards that plant. No, nothing that I want to comment on today. But let's say, this is not a one-year thing. It is over the next, I will say, two to four-years. Thank you. Okay. So First of all, as a general rule, we don't guide at a subsegment level and didn't provide that guidance in the first quarter. So not surprisingly, I'm going to say we were pretty much exactly where we thought we would be. First of all, the volume leverage that we are seeing in our engine business. And the reason why we expected that, if you remember, we signaled it, we talked about recruitment, we talked about metal pass-through and the upside benefit relative to volume. And so for us, that segmental strength was, I'm going to say, pretty much in line, if anything, towards the top end of, if not at the top end of what we thought was possible. And clearly, what we would like to see is that maintained during the course of this year. And if we are able to take another step next year all well and good, albeit we are not, again, talking and guiding at the subsegment level. For the wheels, again, we had flagged to you, the increase in metal would have a very significant effect on the margins in that segment. And with the price of aluminum, I'm just going to refresh everybody, is that 18-months, two-years ago, that was about $1,900 a ton. And that peaked in the first quarter -- and hopefully, it is peaked because it was $4,500 a ton. So more than doubling of the metal inputs to that segment. And again, I think I told you that we would be resetting prices in that segment every six-months. It is probably one of the long leg items in terms of, I will say, repricing for base metal. And that takes effect and took effect on the 1st of January as signaled to you. So the reset to the increased metal prices at the second half of last year reflected in the first quarter of this year was exactly in line with what we said, and I think Ken called out like 350, 360 basis points of metal impact. And that reconciles it exactly for you. And so again, as we see it, all is in order for that segment as well. And so it is the one segment that we have, which does have higher metals volatility. But in normal times, I'm going to say that is not really very significant and not significant for the company really at all. But when you have had such extreme movements, I think anybody that is going from below 2,000 to well in the - between 4,000 and 5,000, that we might look at an extreme movement. And we have seen I think, quite extraordinary movements in all sorts of commodities in recent times. And you can start with oil, $40 to $50 a barrel to over $100. We have seen it 125 it is now like 104. I mean, these things are moving at a pace. So at a subsegment level, everything that you saw is something that we had anticipated. I'm not saying that we have got the crystal ball foresight for everything, because we don't. But at the same time, what we have planned out for our engine business occurred what we said was going to happen for margins in our wheels business occurred. And so for us, it was just exactly as planned. Thank you. Yes. I have got an exact number for truck build this year. but I'm going to take a swag at it and say I think we are going to see a minimum of a 15% volume lift as we go into next year. And it could be higher than that. I think there is tremendous pent-up demand for trucks. I have read articles recently are saying truck drivers are available, the trucks. And our customers, in fact, have not been taking orders, because they can't deliver. It is not a lack of witness by fleets to order, and the backlog is bigger than it is ever been. So my expectation is -- I will just give like a North American number, I think we are going to see some trucks level, it is like 300,000 trucks maybe as we go into next year or slightly more. But it is going to be governed by the responsiveness to capacity and the willingness to take on orders given the availability of, in particular, silicon for some of the semiconductors. Silicon hasn't been the only issue. It has been one of tires and resins and even windshields as well. But the signs are that this is beginning to ease. It is still very constrained, but we do expect a volume pickup in Q2 and in the second half of the year, building what we hope for but we don't yet know is going to be a very healthy 2023 and 2024. The traditional pull ahead for emissions, which you get from our North American emissions rate change for 2024, I don't believe that can realistically happen in 2023 given the capacity constraints. So that is going to mean a pretty healthy both for markets for 2023 and 2024 for both the North America and for Europe. Maybe when I'm talking about trucks, I think it is probably reasonable to give you like a headline outlook for the future, given the requirements for CO2 reduction in Europe, then the changes which are being brought to bear over the next, say, five to seven-years for commercial trucks in Europe in terms of the different, I will say, power generation or say not from fossil fuel, but maybe from electrification or hydrogen engines or whatever it is, then that is taking a pace. And all of that is really friendly towards us because you are not going to invest in very expensive new powertrains, take onboard some of those costs and the weight that those solutions evolve like heavy battery packs without taking the advantage of the massive reduction in weight coming from aluminum. So my expectation is that those volume changes for those - because of those emissions requirements are going to be very healthy to the share of aluminum wheels and its penetration against steel over the next -- all the years up to 2030 because of these changes. So I just want to give you that as a supplement to just the here and now of volume this year and into next. Thank you. My guess is that all of those things is that we have got volume leverage, we also price healthy, efficiency in our operations as well. So basically, every aspect of that business, whether it is the top line in terms of unit price or just efficiency and then volume leverage to the upside, every one of those things was coming to bear to give us the outcome that we saw, which, as you saw, was above guidance for the whole company, and some of that came from engine. So we were, I would say, quite pleased with it. And our job is can we operate at that level going forward and hold it for the next couple of quarters and to see whether we can take further steps. That remains to be seen yet. I'm not ready to commit that or I have just commented, I have just give you a guidance at the company level, which shows further EBITDA improvements in absolute profit and revenue. So all is good. Yes, zero in the revenue line, and I have no CapEx thought at all regarding titanium at this point. And so there will be no change at all for that on the CapEx line. And going to how we -- how successful we are or also it is going to reflect in the robustness and believability of customer schedules as we get into the back half is that -- I will reflect that in guidance when we get to August. Thank you."

            "name": "Kenneth Giacobbe",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, John. Please move to Slide 5 for an update on the end markets. First quarter revenue was up 10% year-over-year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued in the first quarter with commercial aerospace revenue up 29% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven by the Engine Products segment and the narrow body recovery. Commercial aerospace was 44% of total revenue, and although an improvement from 2021, it continues to be far forth of the pre-COVID level, which was 60% of total revenue. Moving to Defense Aerospace. Revenue was down 16% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially, driven by customer inventory corrections for the F-35. Commercial transportation, which impacts both Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segment was up 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven by higher aluminum prices. Finally, the industrial and other markets, which is composed of IGT, oil and gas and general industrial was flat year-over-year. Going deeper within the industrial and other markets sector, IGT continues to be strong and was up 14% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Please move to Slide 6. Let's start with the P&L with a focus on enhanced profitability. In the first quarter, we had a healthy start to the year with adjusted EBITDA of 300 million, which exceeded the guidance midpoint. Margin was 22.7% and in line with guidance. Excluding the year-over-year revenue impact of higher material pass-through, EBITDA margin was 23.4%. Incremental flow-through of the higher revenue was in line with expectations at 33%. Adjusted earnings per share was strong at $0.31, up 41% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet. Free cash flow for the first quarter was essentially breakeven while building approximately $85 million of inventory in anticipation of the commercial aerospace recovery. Cash on hand was 522 million after buying back $175 million of common stock. The average diluted share count improved to a Q1 exit rate of 423 million shares. On a year-over-year basis, net pension and OPEB liabilities were reduced by 200 million and cash contributions were reduced by 60% to 13 million. Annual cash contributions are estimated to be approximately 60 million versus expense of $20 million. We continue to focus on reducing pension and OPEB gross and net liabilities. Comparing to the Europe separation in 2020, annual cash contributions were approximately $240 million and are expected to improve to $60 million this year, a substantial improvement. Additionally, expense is expected to be reduced from 35 million in 2020 to $20 million this year. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. Howmet's improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were recently reflected in Moody's April 27 credit rating upgrade from Ba2 to Ba1. Capital expenditures were approximately 94% of depreciation in the first quarter with productivity CapEx focused on automation projects in engines and fastener segments to improve yields and mitigate labor risk. We purchased approximately five million shares of common stock in the quarter for $175 million with an average acquisition price of $34 per share. Lastly, we continue to be confident in our free cash flow and paid the quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results. As previously mentioned, starting this quarter we are moving our segment profitability measure from segment operating profit to segment adjusted EBITDA. We will use this measure to assess the segment's performance going forward while continuing to provide segment DNA in the appendix. Moving to Engine Products. Year-over-year revenue was up 18% in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was up 45%, driven by the narrow body recovery. IGT was 14% higher as demand for cleaner energy continues. Defense aerospace was down 9% year-over-year. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased 31% year-over-year and margin improved 270 basis points while adding approximately 325 employees in the first quarter, which now brings the total adds to 1275 employees since Q1 of 2021. Now let's move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue was 3% lower in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was flat as the narrow body recovery was offset by continued production declines for the 787. Defense aerospace was down 24%, while commercial transportation was up 15%. Segment adjusted EBITDA decreased 2% year-over-year, while margin improved 20 basis points. The quarter was impacted by inflationary costs and the addition of approximately 135 employees to support future growth. Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was 3% higher in the first quarter. Commercial aerospace was 36% higher as the narrow body recovery more than offset the impact of the declines of the fourth 787. The defense aerospace market was down 26% year-over-year, driven by customer inventory corrections for the F-35. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased 5% year-over-year, while margin improved 10 basis points. Finally, please move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue was 9% higher in the first quarter. The $20 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by higher aluminum prices of $29 million, somewhat offset by lower volumes. Pass-through of higher aluminum prices did not impact EBITDA dollars, but unfavorably impacted margin by approximately 360 basis points. Commercial transportation demand remained strong, but volumes continue to be impacted by customer supply chain issues limiting commercial truck production. One final comment on the segments. Consistent with our expected revenue growth, we are now hiring in every segment except for Engineered Structures, which is expected to commence in the second half of the year. Before turning it back over to John to discuss guidance, I would like to point out one additional item related to tax. There is a slide in the appendix that covers the operational tax rate. In 2021, the annual operational tax rate improved to 25%. The rate further improved to 24.6% in the first quarter of 2022. When comparing sequential performance, the Q1 rate of 24.6% compared to 20.7% in Q4 of 2021. The 390 basis point sequential increase in operational tax rate unfavorably impacted first quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.015. Now let me turn it back over to John. Yes. So David, good morning. Your working capital question, so I will start with cash for the quarter was - free cash flow for the quarter was essentially breakeven. Embedded in that number was a working capital burn of around $140 million. The biggest chunk of that was inventory, $85 million of incremental inventory to get ready for the aero build here. So we want to be prepared for our customers, be able to deliver on time and in full. You will see that working capital number improve as we go through the year. As John mentioned, each quarter should generate positive free cash flow Q2 to Q4. As we exit the year, we have projected that we will have midpoint of around $625 million of free cash flow embedded in that number, it is around a $50 million burn associated with working capital. We will make a call as we get through the second part of the year, do we want to even build more inventory. That would be a good problem for us to have. But right now, it is about a $50 million cash burn as we exit the year, $625 million of free cash flow, and that is a free cash flow conversion of net income of over 100%."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Luther: Thank you MJ. Good morning and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace fourth year and full year 2023 results conference call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In today's presentation references to EBITDA, operating income, and EPS mean adjusted EBITDA excluding special items, adjusted operating income excluding special items, and adjusted EPS excluding special items. These measures are among the non-GAAP financial measures that we've included in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. With that I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks PT and welcome everyone to the 2023 year-end results call. If you move to slide four, please. And I'll start off by saying Howmet's fourth quarter results were indeed very strong. Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and earnings per share all met or exceeded the high end of guidance. More importantly, we continue to outgrow each of our respective markets. Specifically, revenue was $1.73 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year, and with commercial aerospace up 22%. EBITDA was $398 million, which was an increase of 18% year-on-year, while EBITDA margin was in line with Q3 at a solid 23%. Second half EBITDA margin was 30 basis points greater than the full year average, and Q4 earnings per share increased by a significant 39%. For the full year, revenue was up 17%, driven by commercial aerospace up 24%, and EBITDA was up 18%. Earnings per share continued to improve annually and was a record $1.84 per share, which is an increase of 31% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Free cash flow was a record and above the high end of guidance at $682 million. And in the fourth quarter, Howmet continued with its balanced capital allocation strategy by buying back another $100 million of common stock and repaying another $100 million of debt as part of its reduction of the 2024 bonds. Moreover, we refinanced the $400 million of the 2024 bonds at a reduced interest rate. The combination of these actions further reduces annualized interest expense by $10 million going into 2024. This goes towards continued improvement in free cash flow yield and improved earnings per share. Lastly, net leverage improved to a record 2.1 times, which was in line with expectations. Each segment contributed with Engine Products and Forged Wheels delivering record profits. We were pleased with the pickup in faster margins to adjust in excess of 22% EBITDA margin. Ken's going to detail all of this in his commentary. Having completed a strong 2023, the majority of my comments today will focus on the outlook for 2024 and will be covered in the guidance section after covering the historical results. We look forward to a healthy 2024. And now over to Ken.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Let's move to slide five for an overview of the markets. All markets continue to be healthy and we are well-positioned for future growth. Revenue was up 14% in the fourth quarter and up 17% for the full year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued throughout 2023 with revenue up 22% in the fourth quarter and up 24% for the full year driven by all three aerospace segments. Commercial aerospace has grown for 11 consecutive quarters and stands at just over 50% of total revenue. Growth continues to be robust, supported by the demand for new, more fuel efficient aircraft with reduced carbon emissions and increased spares demand. Defense aerospace was flat for the fourth quarter. However, defense aerospace was up 10% for the full year driven by legacy fighter programs and spares demand. Commercial transportation was up 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 9% for the full year driven by higher volumes. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 21% in the fourth quarter, driven by oil and gas up 34%, IGT up 24%, and industrial up 9%. For the full year, the industrial and other markets were up 17% year-over-year, driven by oil and gas up 38%, IGT up 16%, and general industrial up 7%. In summary, another strong year across all of our end markets. Now let's move to slide six. Consistent with prior calls, we will start with the P&L and focus on enhanced profitability. For the full year, revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and earnings per share all met or exceeded the high end of guidance. For the full year, revenue was $6.64 billion, up 17% year-over-year. EBITDA was $1.5 billion, an outpaced revenue growth by being up 18% year-over-year, while absorbing the addition of approximately 1,850 net new hires. EBITDA margin for the year was strong at 22.7%, with a fourth quarter exit rate of 23%. Adjusting for the year-over-year inflationary costs pass-through, the flow-through of incremental revenue to EBITDA was approximately 31% in the fourth quarter, and approximately 26% for the full year. Earnings per share was a record $1.84, up 31% year-over-year. Additionally, Q4 earnings per share was a record at $0.53 per share versus the prior quarterly record of $0.46 per share. In the quarter, we had two minor benefits impacting earnings per share, $0.01 associated with the Q4 favorable tax rate, and $0.01 related to favorable foreign currency. The fourth quarter represented the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in revenue, EBITDA, and earnings per share. Now let's cover the balance sheet. The balance sheet's never been stronger. Free cash flow for the year was a record $682 million, which exceeded the high end of guidance. As we have done every year since separation, we continue to drive free cash flow conversion of net income to our long-term target of 90%. The year-end cash balance was a healthy $610 million with strong liquidity. For the full year, we reduced the 2024 debt tower by approximately $875 million. $475 million came from the balance sheet, and $400 million was refinanced at a fixed rate with an approximate coupon of 3.9%. Net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 2.1 times. All long-term debt is unsecured, and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of interest rate expense into the future Howmet's improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were reflected in S&P's December rating upgrade to BBB minus. With this upgrade, we are now rated as investment grade by two of the three rating agencies. Finally, moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. For the year, approximately $800 million of cash on hand was deployed to debt paydown, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividends. The previously mentioned debt reduction actions during the year lowers annualized interest expense by approximately $29 million. We also repurchased $250 million of common stock at an average price of $47.76 per share. This was the 11th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. Share buyback authority from the Board of Directors stands at approximately $700 million. The average diluted share count improved to a record low Q4 exit rate of 413 million shares. Finally, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, the quarterly common stock dividend was increased by 25% to $0.05 per share. Now let's move to slide seven to cover the segment results for the fourth quarter. Engine products continued its strong performance. Revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $852 million. Commercial aerospace was up 14%, and defense aerospace was up 18%. Both markets realized higher build rates and spares growth. Oil and gas was up 25%, and IGT was up 24% as demand continues to be strong. EBITDA increased to 22% year-over-year to a record $233 million. EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points year-over-year to 27.3%, while absorbing approximately 180 net new employees in the fourth quarter and approximately 1,030 net new employees for the full year. For the full year, EBITDA was $887 million, and EBITDA margin was 27.2%. Both were records for the engines products teams, a significant accomplishment. 2023 EBITDA margin was up approximately 450 basis points from 2019 when revenue was at a similar level. Now let's move to slide eight. Fastening Systems revenue increased 26% year-over-year to $360 million. Commercial aerospace was 45% higher, including the impact of the wide-body recover. Commercial transportation was up 13%. General industrial was up 8%, and defense aerospace was down 9%. Year-over-year, EBITDA increased 38% to $80 million. EBITDA margin increased 180 basis points year-over-year to 22.2%. We are pleased with the continued performance of the fastening systems team with three consecutive quarters of revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin growth. Now let's move to slide nine. Engineered Structures revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $244 million. Commercial aerospace was up 19% driven by build rates and the wide-body recovery. Russian titanium share gain was flat year-over-year at approximately $20 million due to timing of shipments. Defense aerospace was down 35% year-over-year driven by the F35 and legacy fighter programs. EBITDA was $33 million, down slightly from prior year. EBITDA margin decreased 130 basis points year-over-year to 13.5%, partially due to absorbing net new employees. However, sequentially, revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin increased for the second consecutive quarter. In Q4, sequential revenue increased 7% and EBITDA increased 10%. Although production efficiencies are not yet back to targeted levels, we are making progress and expect continued recovery in 2024. Now let's move to slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue increased 3% to $275 million. The $9 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by an 8% increase in volume, partially offset by lower aluminum prices. Sequentially, volumes were down 3% as we're starting to see signs of the commercial transportation market softening. EBITDA was flat year-over-year. EBITDA margin decreased 90 basis points primarily due to the timing of inflationary costs pass-through. Finally, let's move to slide 11 for more detail on debt actions. In the fourth quarter, we redeemed $500 million of our 2024 bonds. The $500 million redemption at par was funded with approximately $100 million of cash from the balance sheet and approximately $400 million draw from two term loan facilities. Both term loan are prepayable without penalties or premiums and mature in November of 2026. $200 million was drawn from a U.S. dollar-denominated term loan facility and approximately $200 million was drawn from a Japanese yen denominated term loan facility. We entered into interest rate swaps to exchange the floating interest rates of the term loans into fixed interest rates. The weighted average fixed interest rate is approximately 3.9%, which is lower than the 2024 bonds coupon of 5.125% [ph]. The combined impact of these Q4 actions is expected to reduce annualized interest expense by approximately $10 million. Moreover, debt reductions in Q1 through Q3 reduced annualized interest expense by an additional $19 million. We continue to leverage the strength of our balance sheet. Since 2020, we've paid down gross debt by approximately $2.2 billion with cash on hand and lowered our annualized interest cost by more than $130 million. Gross debt now stands at approximately $3.7 billion. All long-term debt continues to be unsecured and at fixed rates and our $1 billion revolver remains undrawn. Lastly, before turning it back to John, let me highlight a couple of additional items. As we continue to focus on improving Howmet's performance and capital allocation, I wanted to highlight our pretax RONA, or return on net assets metric, RONA, which excludes goodwill and special items has improved by approximately 400 basis points on a year-over-year basis from 29% in 2022 to 33% in 2023. You will find reconciliations in the appendix of the presentation.  Lastly, in the appendix on slide 16, we have included 2024 assumptions. Interest expense is expected to improve to approximately $200 million. The guidance includes all debt actions completed to date. The operational tax rate is expected to continue to improve to a range of 21% to 22%. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately a 600 basis point improvement in the operational tax rate since separation in 2020. We continue to be focused on further improvements in our operational tax rate. Pension and OPEB expense as well as contributions are expected to increase modestly by approximately $15 million year-over-year. Finally, we expect miscellaneous other expenses, which are below the line to be in the range of $5 million of income to $15 million of expense for the year, but are very volatile within quarters. So with that, let me turn it back to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks Ken, and let's move to slide 12, please. The commercial aerospace market continues to be strong. Airline load factors are good. International travel continues to strengthen and all this has led to significant orders for new aircraft and higher levels of aircraft backlog at both Airbus and Boeing. Demand for new aircraft is expected to be sustained due to the need for aircraft with substantially improved fuel efficiency and also to the commitments made by airlines of improvement towards carbon neutrality with two stages of 2030 and then 2050. Commercial aerospace spares are also growing not only due to the number of aircraft in service, but also in the case of narrow-body due to the increased service shop visit requirements of the newer fuel efficient engines. This is a long-term trend over the next decade and one which we look forward to. Defense budgets and hence the defense market continues to be strong in fighter aircraft, farmers, drones and helicopters. Tank turbines and Howmet systems are also strong. Specifically, we expect increased F35 engine spare requirements due to the shop visit requirements as the fleet continues to expand globally. Other markets of oil and gas and gas turbines continue to be healthy. We do see natural gas turbines to be the natural accompanying technology to the renewal segment of wind and solar.  The market where we're cautious is that of commercial transportation, where we see potential for up to a 10% reduction in revenue as we move through 2024. We do envisage commercial transportation to resume growth in 2025 and into 2026. This is supported by the view that any potential reduction is mild due in part to the continued secular growth of our improved penetration of aluminum wheels compared to steel wheels for the needs of fuel efficiency or increased payloads. Also as truck engines move to alternate means of propulsion other than fossil fuels, the adoption of aluminum wheels should gradually move towards 100%. Moving now from general market commentary to specific numbers. We expect Q1 revenue to be up 9% year-over-year and EBITDA up approximately 11%. For Q1 of 2024, we expect revenues of $1.74 billion, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA of $400 million, plus or minus $5 million and earnings per share of $0.51 plus or minus $0.1. This is similar to Q4 after excluding the one-off benefits of the tax rate and below the line items, which contributed about $0.02. Regarding the full year 2024, we see revenue at $7.1 billion plus or minus $100 million; EBITDA of $1.635 billion plus or minus $35 million; and earnings per share of $2.15 plus or minus $0.05. Free cash flow, we see a $735 million plus or minus $35 million and CapEx of $290 million plus or minus $15 million. I'd like to comment further on the capital expenditures, seen as these are expected to be above depreciation for the first time in many years. Essentially, this is due to investment opportunities materializing the Engine Products business. We see this as a very good sign to be able to deploy capital with high returns and rapid future growth. In fact, let me expand. In fact, 2023, which was another year of above market growth in each of our segments, in fact, above 5% above market served. This engine investment is viewed as excellent and speaks to the continued market growth in the business with 27%-plus EBITDA margins and a 33%-plus return of capital. And this continued growth is seen as the investments come on stream in approximately 18 months' time. Underpinning all of this is an agreement with one of our engine manufacturer customers for increased business and increased market shares. This does not change our long-term commitment to deliver average free cash flow conversion of 90% of net income. And as you can see from our guide, free cash flow after all cost is approximately 45% of EBITDA which is best-in-class. We based our guidance on Boeing 737 MAX production of 34 aircraft per month and six 787 aircraft per month. Our Airbus assumptions are in line with their plans. As an example, Airbus A320s are at 56 aircraft per month. We are prepared and can be prepared should volumes increase above current customer assumptions. In the case of the A320 we're anticipating the build rate increasing in 2025 to approximately 60 to 65 aircraft a month and that will require us to do some prebuilds or parts in 2024, and that explains the average we've given. Please now move to slide 13. 2023 was another good year for Howmet. Sales increased by 17% and were above each of our segments end markets. EBITDA was up 18% and EBITDA margin increased to 23% in the second half of the year. Earnings per share was up 31%. Cash flow exceeded guidance and was in line with our long-term view of converting 9% of net income into cash flow. The balance sheet was strengthened with significant debt paydown repurchases with cash on hand and record low net leverage of 2.1 times. The outlook for next year or for 2024 has already been outlined in the numbers given. But let me give you some qualitative terms to look at 2024 as it demonstrates the following features. We have further revenue growth, which we expect will be proven to be again in excess of our end markets served. Free cash flow continues to improve with the higher EBITDA margins and we expect further reduced debt and interest expense burden. And we take into 2024 a reduced share count. And you can expect further shareholder friendly actions of increased share buybacks and further dividend growth. And now I'll close my prepared remarks. I now hand over and get ready for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you. Hey, Doug. When you're looking at a situation with very high demand on the Engine Products side. And one thing I'm really interested is how you're seeing pricing. Given your very strong position there, you're looking at catalog spares prices from the engine OEMs up in the teens recently, what do you see for Howmet in terms of pricing over the next couple of years? And can you explain the differences there between what you're getting and what you're seeing is increases on the engine OEM side?\nJohn Plant: Yeah. We've noted that our engine customers have been raising prices into the MRO shops significantly. We don't have that opportunity, Doug, in the short-term. In that our long-term agreements provide for price stability during the duration of those agreements. However, when we get to the long-term agreement renewal, with the sophistication of the analysis we introduced a few years ago, we now split all of the parts into volume and variety and looking at the different trends within that and also when parts go to, let's call it, past model and become service only, but also noting the increased service demand for even current parts. And so at that time, we do differentiate between the increased pricing that we expect to receive at the LTA renewal and certainly look at the service requirements and the pricing and you can expect that as we renew those agreements, and I don't generally comment about when those agreements are renewed, but you can expect to see increased pricing associated with the service parts.\nDouglas Harned: But from your standpoint, when you look at save in the short-term 2024. So, how do you think of your pricing relative to inflation? And is this a positive contributor to margins?\nJohn Plant: No, I don't think you can say that we're going to price per se on an individual service part. But what you can expect is that we will be moving on price once again in 2024. And you'll see when we issue our 10-K, which I believe is this evening, you'll see that trend continued in Q4. So, I expect to see continued positive contributions from pricing as we go forward. And you'll see that '23 was a healthy year and '24 should be an equally healthy year.\nDouglas Harned: Very good. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: Hey, John. On your Boeing 737 rate assumption, are you currently shipping at 34 a month to the 737 line? And if Boeing should actually get to 38, do you have the head count in place to sustain that? Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Okay. So, we received demand signals from two principal sources. One is from, of course, the aircraft manufacturers for our structural products and then on a different sequencing, the demand signals from the engine manufacturers. If you look at 2023, we saw Boeing schedules increase to rate 38. And so, we were in a position and we're able to support them in that rate 38. We were cautious when they were talking about going up to 42, which as you saw was delayed and now that's not going to be the case. Our thoughts around 2024 is that this is going to continue to be choppy. And as the back class, it's not necessarily the stop start that we've experienced in quite the same degree as the last couple of years. But we're also prepared that maybe Boeing will not be building at rate 38 because indeed we don't believe that they have built at that rate, and we've seen various assumptions of what was actually built in Q4 and now we see they are restricted to -- by the FIA in terms of build in 2024. What, of course, we don't know is to what degree of any under-build in one month will be low to overbuild in another month or indeed, is it just going to be capped at the production for that month in terms of issuance of airworthed [ph] certificates. We have no idea. And therefore, we're still thinking that demand could be choppy and indeed given the balance sheet of Boeing, is that are they willing to continue to sustain building out at a higher rate than the actually building. And therefore, we've made some allowance within our working capital such that if they don't take the parts or scheduled is that, that's provided for in the free cash flow guidance that we've given you. And similarly, I mean, I'll get it all out there is that we saw our margin flow-through for 2024 at 28% plus or minus compared to our Q4 of 31%. And this also allowed to provide some allowance for the chop or choppiness that we may see, depending on how things go with Boeing.\nRobert Stallard: That\u2019s great. Thanks John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Thanks. Good morning, John and Ken.\nJohn Plant: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: John, you added, I think, roughly about 1,700 employees in 2023, if I have that correct. I was just wondering what your guidance kind of assumes around headcount growth expectations in '24. And yeah, maybe I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Yeah. We were expecting between 1,000, 1,500 people depending upon what the exit rate should finally be for the year. So, we are continuing to recruit albeit from those numbers, you can see that we're ingesting the labor at a reduced net rate to the last year -- over the last 18 months. And some of that's to do with the bringing now the experience of some of those operators who've been able to retain during that recruitment process and also the improvement in productivity that again we are planning to make. And so, a blend of all of those things plus some of the automation that we've talked about in the past coming on stream. So, let's call it 500 people plus or minus less than we took on last year and while at the same time, trying to improve our recruitment and retention statistics, which is really very important to us to gain that further stability of labor.\nPeter Arment: Thanks for that. Thanks John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Hope to focus on Fastening Systems, if you could, John. The growth there obviously was pretty much on top of the Engine Products growth. Is there a leader in '24? Is it Fastening Systems? And then maybe just could you provide any color as it relates to where distribution sits with Fastening and where your wide-body recovery is versus pre-COVID?\nJohn Plant: Yeah. And one of the things that I've been particularly pleased with has been the improvements in our distribution business inside Fastening Systems. A couple of years ago, maybe three years ago now, we created a separate business within H1 [ph] amalgamated with our OE business. We provided dedicated management to that distribution business. And we've seen it indeed have outsized growth relative to the market, and that continued again in a significant way in 2023. So that's proven to be very good for us. In terms of like where does the final, I'll say, scorecard land for 2024 in terms of relative growth of Engine versus Fasteners, it's difficult to say at the moment, I expect very positive contributions from both. We have to recognize is that we still have to see wide-body demand come back and really be built with a propensity actually to grow higher because that wide-body demand mix should actually show improvements because the relative growth compared to narrow-body, especially given that Boeing is now capped is that, that should be good. At the same time, we note -- for example, take the LEAP range of engines is that the -- I'll say, growth of that segment has been reduced a little bit, both in the actual for 2023 and slightly lower build as the initial demands have dropped from. I'll say, a year ago, we saw a '24 was going to be looking at 2,200 engines then went to 2000 and I know it's in the range of, I think, something like 1,875 to 1,950, something like that. So, we've got to see how all that settles out and indeed, it's a balance of what goes to OE build versus service demand for those engines. So, I mean, the most important thing is both Engine and Fasteners are good. So, I don't want to handicap it at this point, but it will be -- I expect that we'll be having a good year for both.\nMyles Walton: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. Thank you for the time.\nJohn Plant: Hi, Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: I wanted to ask about margins. John, maybe you could talk about 2024 margins, just looking at Q1 and the full year, you're kind of pointing to 23%. And I guess I'm a little surprised that there's no really an improvement from your Q4 exit rate and you're still sub 30% on the incrementals. So, maybe if you could just shape that out for us, how you think about that with aero volumes getting better and maybe else troughing. And also, you mentioned something in the -- in regards to engine pricing and how you're locked into long-term contracts and as well as the F35, obviously, that's a long-term contract, too. So, how do you think about what percentage of your margins are locked in because of LTA?\nJohn Plant: I mean LTA certainly govern the most of our business for the company. And I guess momentarily the number of how much is [indiscernible], but it's -- I'm going to say somewhere up at that. So I'm going to say 75% to 85%, I believe, but can one refine that should need to, as I carry on talking here. Having said that, of course, there are certain agreements which have come up for renewal for 2024 pricing. And indeed, we are probably now 90% agreed for the price structures for 2024. And so, our expectation for the price commentary I've already given you is that you'll see that Q4 was healthy or mutual with 10-K, a very solid year and we expect 2024 to be similar. And within that, you will see some of our Engine Products to indeed be repriced during 2024 and have already been agreed. So that's also the good. In terms of margins, I mean, you never get like quarter-on-quarter straight line, you tend to plateau for a little while and then you move again. And our thought really has been that we stepped up to a 23% level in the second half of '23. And so what should we expect? And I think you're saying, well, let's play it again for Q1 and see how we go is the right assumption. I've already told you that we have assumed a 28% incremental versus what we converted at 31% in Q4. And this also provides some allowance for the choppiness that I've commented on them. So should for example, Boeing not take all the parts that they've scheduled out and those have to go into inventory. Therefore, we won't be taking the profit on them. And so, we've assumed that, I'd say, a 3% lower absolute number of conversion. And therefore, to me, just playing it out seems a very reasonable assumption for the near term. How it flows for the balance of the year? It's difficult to say at this point in time. In terms of up-to-date market commentary, we actually see wheels demand to be probably a little bit stronger than we had imagined in the short term, and that's within the numbers we've already given you. At the same time, what does the back end of the year behold? I don't really know at this point. Orders have been into take for -- truck manufacturers have been a little bit stronger. And therefore, it bodes well, but of course, those are cancelable depending upon how the general economy goes and we'll have to wait and see. For me, the most important thing, it's not like what happens this quarter or next. But indeed, that market of commercial transportation, we expect to resume growth in '25 and '26 and then that continued with, I think, strong continued demand from commercial aerospace and then continuing to defense and for the gas turbine business promises good growth beyond '24 as we going to '25 and '26.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.\nKen Giacobbe: And Sheila, this is Ken. Just to build on your question around long-term agreements, right? John is right, somewhere in the 75% of the revenue is tied to long-term agreements. That could be plus or minus, say 5% depending on where we are in the renewal process. As you can imagine, on the aerospace side, much heavier on long-term agreements. So, on the engines side of the house, you could be up to 90% of that revenue, could be under long-term agreements.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: John, just one clarification on the original equipment side of aerospace. I couldn't quite decipher where you're saying you are now on the MAX rate, if it's possible to quantify that? And then on the aftermarket side, can you baseline us on what percentage of aerospace is aftermarket at this point? And just how much growth can we expect there in the medium term given the work you're doing related to time on wing on the engine and elsewhere that's incremental?\nJohn Plant: Yeah. So, our assumption in terms of our guide -- of course, our guide is quite independent of what Boeing or indeed Airbus may build and what they may schedule, it's our financial assumption and one that I feel appropriate for Howmet. And for the large part, I feel is that we've tended to call the market fairly reasonably in the last few years. So, our assumption very clear was at 34% for the average for Boeing 737 for the year. Now what they actually build, I don't know and what they actually schedule at. I'm going to say at the moment, they say they're going to continue with their rate 38 assumption as best as we can detect from what we see from our demand schedules. So that's those specific numbers. In terms of spares, our exit rate for spares in the commercial aviation market, stepped up again. And so compared to 2019, which is the reference point we've used previously. And if you remember, in 2019 revenue from the spares market for -- on the commercial side is about $400 million, and it was about $400 million on the defense and gas turbine side. On the gas turbine and defense side, that continues to be steady and an increasing and now that increased to a level, we believe we'll see something like $600 million of demand in the defense sector and IGT sector. We're both growing but indeed, the spares for the F35 growing in particular. And in 2025, as an example, we expect the spares business for F35 to be as big as the OE business has been in recent years. So that's been good. We've seen demand increase in '23, we're expecting it in '24 and then '25. We should expect it to be a segment continue to grow as that fleet continues to expand. And the fleet, I think, is about 975 aircraft. And while we originally thought it's going to expand at like the 150 a year, as you know, currently Lockheed is not building or not building nor delivering at that rate. And so, to some degree, you have to be a little bit cautious. But you can expect a 50% increase compared to 2019 levels. In the case of the commercial segment, that did drop at the depths of COVID to half, so something just sub $200 million. And now that's fully grown back to $400 million, but with the run rate -- you see in the third and fourth quarters and then strengthening each quarter is that, that is now at a run rate above $400 million. And then obviously, to that, you also have to bake in the potential for additional schedules as these reported time on wing issues get, I'll say, addressed and serviced. And we do expect demand to be picking up in the second half of 2024 and then further strong demand -- a very strong demand going in '25 and '26. So that we see is very good. And so today, you can assume that our spares business for '23 is getting about, let's say, the $1 billion mark, and we expect it to be -- that is -- therefore, an increased percentage of our revenues and you could expect the percentage, therefore going into the aftermarket to continue to increase as we go into '25, '26 after a healthy year in '24. So, overall, a good picture and indeed, as I said in my commentary, that the thing which is -- it's not demand just to solve the immediacy of a time on wing issue. I mean, there is a structural shift in spares demand, which I don't think it's appreciated yet totally in the newer engines themselves essentially have increased service intervals because as you increase the temperature pressure in engine, the wearing part, so I think the high pressure turbine part of the engine. So, those initial Blade 1, Blade 2, vane one, et cetera, those become a wearable or wearing parts, a bit like brake pads on a car. And so, you can expect to see a structural shift as increased fitment of those engines is in the fleet and it replaces the predecessor CFM56 engine. So, you're seeing temporary strong demand for CFM56 just to running the fleet at existing fleet harder and a fundamental structural increase in replacement costs which is going to be there. And I think you're going to see additional, say, service shops built around the work to service these new engines, but that's seen that will unfold over the next, say, few years.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. That's really interesting. I appreciate all that detail. Just to make sure I have the MAX assumption correct, are you delivering to about 34 right now and you assume you stay there through the year? Are you in the low 30s right now, and you assume you actually click into that stated 38 without any rate breaks above and beyond that.\nJohn Plant: So if I give you, let's say, the fourth quarter, we believe we delivered at rate 38, while Boeing build, let's say, rate 30. So, in Q4, let's assume that 8 aircraft sets per month went into inventory. So, there's 24 sets of parts which are sitting in Boeing inventory for the structural part, that our estimation. I don't think it's just quite the same on the engine side. Because what wasn't built in engines, let's say, the reduced engine build, which you've already had commentary from the engine manufacturers about that then the balance of the majority of the part, certainly on the turbine side, but not necessarily on the structural side, essentially went into service parts delivery into the MRO shops to account for what I already just talked about.\nNoah Poponak: Okay.\nJohn Plant: And so if you think about it, assuming that Boeing taking Q1 at 38, depending on what the final thing is, then there is -- if they build up, my assumption is 34, maybe they'll bill at 38. That's why I've allowed for some choppiness as I already commented on, and allowed for some inventory that we may end up carrying as that gets ironed out and with how many people will recruit or we have already commented on that. And so, it's allowed for that, and it's allowed for some of that choppiness within the margin rate incrementals that I've given, calling out 28 versus 31 in Q4.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Super helpful. Thanks so much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Mikus: Hi. Scott Mikus on for Rob Spingarn. John, I wanted to ask you, the last time you had mentioned this, it was -- I believe you had 1.5 times the relative market share of your closest competitor in the airfoils market. So just with the upgrade to the GTF and then also thinking about the new engine agreement with an engine OEM customer that you referenced, where does your relative market share stand now in the airfoils market?\nJohn Plant: Okay. We have grown about 1% share a year in the turbine airfoils market over the last, let's say, four or five years. And so, it's been a consistent march, and we believe we're just around that 50% mark currently. And we see that continuing to grow commensurate with some of the, I'll say, extraordinary levels of technology that we bring in that segment. And also I've commented here, we would not be considering, let's say, investing further in the scale that I've referred to, without knowledge of that share being there and indeed, I did say very clearly and unequivocally that we've also contracted additional share within that. So, we continue to drive that improve it. And as you did here, hopefully, is that's not changing our free cash flow guide metric, the conversion of net income.\nScott Mikus: Okay. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask, did you see any pickup in spot sales in 2023? And do you have any assumption for spot sales baked into the 2024 guide?\nJohn Plant: Yeah. We did see the spot market pick up further in '23. You can never be sure. So, we've just assumed it's played again in 2024. And we did put in some security stock of material such that we could respond to the spot market and our balance sheet could take it. But we not assume that it's like a further significant step-up because it's also in that unknown area of indeed what hadn't been previously scheduled, what additional demands are there and sometimes the opportunity for an increased share if somebody else is not able to deliver. So, it's not an easy number to say. We assume that we're going to get more. I don't think that's a sensible way to plan.\nScott Mikus: Thanks for taking the questions.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much and good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hi, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: Good morning. If I could ask maybe a two-part question, just about all this 737 and just understanding that dynamic. You spoke, I guess, extensively about Boeing and the production rate there. Can you talk about at the -- on the engine side, and kind of where that level of production is expected to be in 2024? And then on the airframe side, how much -- I assume most of the 737 content on the airframe side is in fasteners? And I guess, so how much of that goes directly to Boeing versus how much would be going to other suppliers like maybe Spirit especially. And so that would imply that your expectation in terms of the demand pull for Howmet would be more -- not even necessarily a demand pull from Boeing directly, but the demand pull from the, let's say, Tier 1 in the Boeing supply chain.\nJohn Plant: Yeah. So, we do supply, I going to say, in terms of commercial -- for Boeing's requirements, we supply the majority directly to Boeing. But we also do supply Spirit as an example and others that are also providing subassemblies to Boeing. And so again, it's never an absolutely clear picture. But we just assume like we've taken an assumption of a number of aircraft sets. It could be that Boeing build at one level. And maybe another supplier might build at a different level, and it's also compared to what they want to hold and also indeed what Boeing have by way of their minimum, maximum inventory holdings as well. So, we operate on a min-max system, just roughly correlated to build, but as times when it breaks that correlation. So, it's never quite straightforward, Seth, I don't want to burden you is, I'll say, unnecessary detail, but the best assumption is just we've based that on 34 and all of the other suppliers of rate 34 and knowing that at some point, that if Boeing have been scheduling at a higher rate and build the inventory has to come out and so there be held because there's going to be -- maybe the rate assumption will go up, maybe it will be 42, maybe be 47 in 2025. And therefore, because it's really important that all the parts are there, so you avoid traveled work, which has been set a lot of commentary recently. So having supply security and all the parts available is really important. And therefore, it could well be that all of that will be held, which we don't know that. And at the same time, there's also the possibility is that given the cash strain that either Boeing or other suppliers may be under is that they will adjust inventory. So, we've just taken that cautious view, prepared that against -- for example, against the conversion of straight 90% of net income, which is a long-term guide. You can see from what we've given you this morning, it's like 85% plus or minus and that provides the allowance for just in case we have not only the growth rate that we expect, but also if we get caught holding the having to hold the bag in terms of a little bit lower take the natural schedules as some of those MAX inventories are adjusted. We don't know that. It's just an assumption. I mean clearly what we hope for is that they build fully and at great quality levels of rate 38. That's what we want. That's what we hope for. We look for great success from our customers. We'd love to see that. And should they build and schedule and then increase schedules for an increase in rate in 2025 then that will be really good for us. And you could expect us to be further increasing our sales should those scenarios play out. But at the moment, we're not prepared to go there because we don't know.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hi, David.\nDavid Strauss: So, John, I guess, following up on that. So, if I take 5% on the free cash flow conversion, it looks like it's about $50 million that you have assumed in working capital or inventory build related to conservatism around what Boeing takes. But even with that, it looks like or I guess on top of that, it looks like you've got maybe $100 million, $150 million of working capital usage in that free cash flow guidance. Is that correct? And if so, what is that? And the other part of the question is capital deployment. I know you don't have anything baked in, but how are you thinking about that given -- I know you have $200 million you've got left to retire this year, but that -- given the cash guide gives you a fair amount of room to use coming on the share repurchase side. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Yeah. So, you can -- it's always these multipart questions, which we get here. So, first of all, of course, given that revenues are increasing, let's call it $0.5 billion in the guide, there is a natural 15% to 20% working capital drag on that. So, let's use the 20% because the math becomes so much easier. There's $100 million of working capital for you to which we added the sort of number that you talked about in terms of that propensity which might happen. So that's where we are on that assumption. And in terms of how we deploy, we haven't actually fixed anything at this point, but it's hardly likely that we're going to enter a refinancing for a couple of hundred million. So, it's quite possible that we may decide just to retire that and take those interest rate savings into, let's say, end of the fourth quarter and into 2025. And therefore, you can assume that's all we're going to do probably. I mean, we could do a bit of a refi around the '25s, that's on a TBD basis, but that's not going to be a big drag either which way a platform any fee structure and breakage cost. But then the majority then you can assume it's going to be share buyback. So position all wise, you can assume that 2024 will be a bigger year for share buybacks compared to 2023 where you can see the majority of the action was further on the debt side to put our balance sheet into the great shape that it's currently in. And so, roughly speaking, you can assume further leverage improvements despite the share buyback thoughts that we have at the moment, which are going to be elevated compared to 2023.\nDavid Strauss: Great. You got both parts. Appreciate it.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nKen Giacobbe: Thanks David.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has now concluded.

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks PT and welcome everyone to the 2023 year-end results call. If you move to slide four, please. And I'll start off by saying Howmet's fourth quarter results were indeed very strong. Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and earnings per share all met or exceeded the high end of guidance. More importantly, we continue to outgrow each of our respective markets. Specifically, revenue was $1.73 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year, and with commercial aerospace up 22%. EBITDA was $398 million, which was an increase of 18% year-on-year, while EBITDA margin was in line with Q3 at a solid 23%. Second half EBITDA margin was 30 basis points greater than the full year average, and Q4 earnings per share increased by a significant 39%. For the full year, revenue was up 17%, driven by commercial aerospace up 24%, and EBITDA was up 18%. Earnings per share continued to improve annually and was a record $1.84 per share, which is an increase of 31% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet and free cash flow. Free cash flow was a record and above the high end of guidance at $682 million. And in the fourth quarter, Howmet continued with its balanced capital allocation strategy by buying back another $100 million of common stock and repaying another $100 million of debt as part of its reduction of the 2024 bonds. Moreover, we refinanced the $400 million of the 2024 bonds at a reduced interest rate. The combination of these actions further reduces annualized interest expense by $10 million going into 2024. This goes towards continued improvement in free cash flow yield and improved earnings per share. Lastly, net leverage improved to a record 2.1 times, which was in line with expectations. Each segment contributed with Engine Products and Forged Wheels delivering record profits. We were pleased with the pickup in faster margins to adjust in excess of 22% EBITDA margin. Ken's going to detail all of this in his commentary. Having completed a strong 2023, the majority of my comments today will focus on the outlook for 2024 and will be covered in the guidance section after covering the historical results. We look forward to a healthy 2024. And now over to Ken. Thanks Ken, and let's move to slide 12, please. The commercial aerospace market continues to be strong. Airline load factors are good. International travel continues to strengthen and all this has led to significant orders for new aircraft and higher levels of aircraft backlog at both Airbus and Boeing. Demand for new aircraft is expected to be sustained due to the need for aircraft with substantially improved fuel efficiency and also to the commitments made by airlines of improvement towards carbon neutrality with two stages of 2030 and then 2050. Commercial aerospace spares are also growing not only due to the number of aircraft in service, but also in the case of narrow-body due to the increased service shop visit requirements of the newer fuel efficient engines. This is a long-term trend over the next decade and one which we look forward to. Defense budgets and hence the defense market continues to be strong in fighter aircraft, farmers, drones and helicopters. Tank turbines and Howmet systems are also strong. Specifically, we expect increased F35 engine spare requirements due to the shop visit requirements as the fleet continues to expand globally. Other markets of oil and gas and gas turbines continue to be healthy. We do see natural gas turbines to be the natural accompanying technology to the renewal segment of wind and solar.  The market where we're cautious is that of commercial transportation, where we see potential for up to a 10% reduction in revenue as we move through 2024. We do envisage commercial transportation to resume growth in 2025 and into 2026. This is supported by the view that any potential reduction is mild due in part to the continued secular growth of our improved penetration of aluminum wheels compared to steel wheels for the needs of fuel efficiency or increased payloads. Also as truck engines move to alternate means of propulsion other than fossil fuels, the adoption of aluminum wheels should gradually move towards 100%. Moving now from general market commentary to specific numbers. We expect Q1 revenue to be up 9% year-over-year and EBITDA up approximately 11%. For Q1 of 2024, we expect revenues of $1.74 billion, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA of $400 million, plus or minus $5 million and earnings per share of $0.51 plus or minus $0.1. This is similar to Q4 after excluding the one-off benefits of the tax rate and below the line items, which contributed about $0.02. Regarding the full year 2024, we see revenue at $7.1 billion plus or minus $100 million; EBITDA of $1.635 billion plus or minus $35 million; and earnings per share of $2.15 plus or minus $0.05. Free cash flow, we see a $735 million plus or minus $35 million and CapEx of $290 million plus or minus $15 million. I'd like to comment further on the capital expenditures, seen as these are expected to be above depreciation for the first time in many years. Essentially, this is due to investment opportunities materializing the Engine Products business. We see this as a very good sign to be able to deploy capital with high returns and rapid future growth. In fact, let me expand. In fact, 2023, which was another year of above market growth in each of our segments, in fact, above 5% above market served. This engine investment is viewed as excellent and speaks to the continued market growth in the business with 27%-plus EBITDA margins and a 33%-plus return of capital. And this continued growth is seen as the investments come on stream in approximately 18 months' time. Underpinning all of this is an agreement with one of our engine manufacturer customers for increased business and increased market shares. This does not change our long-term commitment to deliver average free cash flow conversion of 90% of net income. And as you can see from our guide, free cash flow after all cost is approximately 45% of EBITDA which is best-in-class. We based our guidance on Boeing 737 MAX production of 34 aircraft per month and six 787 aircraft per month. Our Airbus assumptions are in line with their plans. As an example, Airbus A320s are at 56 aircraft per month. We are prepared and can be prepared should volumes increase above current customer assumptions. In the case of the A320 we're anticipating the build rate increasing in 2025 to approximately 60 to 65 aircraft a month and that will require us to do some prebuilds or parts in 2024, and that explains the average we've given. Please now move to slide 13. 2023 was another good year for Howmet. Sales increased by 17% and were above each of our segments end markets. EBITDA was up 18% and EBITDA margin increased to 23% in the second half of the year. Earnings per share was up 31%. Cash flow exceeded guidance and was in line with our long-term view of converting 9% of net income into cash flow. The balance sheet was strengthened with significant debt paydown repurchases with cash on hand and record low net leverage of 2.1 times. The outlook for next year or for 2024 has already been outlined in the numbers given. But let me give you some qualitative terms to look at 2024 as it demonstrates the following features. We have further revenue growth, which we expect will be proven to be again in excess of our end markets served. Free cash flow continues to improve with the higher EBITDA margins and we expect further reduced debt and interest expense burden. And we take into 2024 a reduced share count. And you can expect further shareholder friendly actions of increased share buybacks and further dividend growth. And now I'll close my prepared remarks. I now hand over and get ready for questions. Thank you. Yeah. We've noted that our engine customers have been raising prices into the MRO shops significantly. We don't have that opportunity, Doug, in the short-term. In that our long-term agreements provide for price stability during the duration of those agreements. However, when we get to the long-term agreement renewal, with the sophistication of the analysis we introduced a few years ago, we now split all of the parts into volume and variety and looking at the different trends within that and also when parts go to, let's call it, past model and become service only, but also noting the increased service demand for even current parts. And so at that time, we do differentiate between the increased pricing that we expect to receive at the LTA renewal and certainly look at the service requirements and the pricing and you can expect that as we renew those agreements, and I don't generally comment about when those agreements are renewed, but you can expect to see increased pricing associated with the service parts. No, I don't think you can say that we're going to price per se on an individual service part. But what you can expect is that we will be moving on price once again in 2024. And you'll see when we issue our 10-K, which I believe is this evening, you'll see that trend continued in Q4. So, I expect to see continued positive contributions from pricing as we go forward. And you'll see that '23 was a healthy year and '24 should be an equally healthy year. Thank you. Hey, Rob. Okay. So, we received demand signals from two principal sources. One is from, of course, the aircraft manufacturers for our structural products and then on a different sequencing, the demand signals from the engine manufacturers. If you look at 2023, we saw Boeing schedules increase to rate 38. And so, we were in a position and we're able to support them in that rate 38. We were cautious when they were talking about going up to 42, which as you saw was delayed and now that's not going to be the case. Our thoughts around 2024 is that this is going to continue to be choppy. And as the back class, it's not necessarily the stop start that we've experienced in quite the same degree as the last couple of years. But we're also prepared that maybe Boeing will not be building at rate 38 because indeed we don't believe that they have built at that rate, and we've seen various assumptions of what was actually built in Q4 and now we see they are restricted to -- by the FIA in terms of build in 2024. What, of course, we don't know is to what degree of any under-build in one month will be low to overbuild in another month or indeed, is it just going to be capped at the production for that month in terms of issuance of airworthed [ph] certificates. We have no idea. And therefore, we're still thinking that demand could be choppy and indeed given the balance sheet of Boeing, is that are they willing to continue to sustain building out at a higher rate than the actually building. And therefore, we've made some allowance within our working capital such that if they don't take the parts or scheduled is that, that's provided for in the free cash flow guidance that we've given you. And similarly, I mean, I'll get it all out there is that we saw our margin flow-through for 2024 at 28% plus or minus compared to our Q4 of 31%. And this also allowed to provide some allowance for the chop or choppiness that we may see, depending on how things go with Boeing. Thank you. Good morning. Yeah. We were expecting between 1,000, 1,500 people depending upon what the exit rate should finally be for the year. So, we are continuing to recruit albeit from those numbers, you can see that we're ingesting the labor at a reduced net rate to the last year -- over the last 18 months. And some of that's to do with the bringing now the experience of some of those operators who've been able to retain during that recruitment process and also the improvement in productivity that again we are planning to make. And so, a blend of all of those things plus some of the automation that we've talked about in the past coming on stream. So, let's call it 500 people plus or minus less than we took on last year and while at the same time, trying to improve our recruitment and retention statistics, which is really very important to us to gain that further stability of labor. Thank you. Yeah. And one of the things that I've been particularly pleased with has been the improvements in our distribution business inside Fastening Systems. A couple of years ago, maybe three years ago now, we created a separate business within H1 [ph] amalgamated with our OE business. We provided dedicated management to that distribution business. And we've seen it indeed have outsized growth relative to the market, and that continued again in a significant way in 2023. So that's proven to be very good for us. In terms of like where does the final, I'll say, scorecard land for 2024 in terms of relative growth of Engine versus Fasteners, it's difficult to say at the moment, I expect very positive contributions from both. We have to recognize is that we still have to see wide-body demand come back and really be built with a propensity actually to grow higher because that wide-body demand mix should actually show improvements because the relative growth compared to narrow-body, especially given that Boeing is now capped is that, that should be good. At the same time, we note -- for example, take the LEAP range of engines is that the -- I'll say, growth of that segment has been reduced a little bit, both in the actual for 2023 and slightly lower build as the initial demands have dropped from. I'll say, a year ago, we saw a '24 was going to be looking at 2,200 engines then went to 2000 and I know it's in the range of, I think, something like 1,875 to 1,950, something like that. So, we've got to see how all that settles out and indeed, it's a balance of what goes to OE build versus service demand for those engines. So, I mean, the most important thing is both Engine and Fasteners are good. So, I don't want to handicap it at this point, but it will be -- I expect that we'll be having a good year for both. Thank you. Hi, Sheila. I mean LTA certainly govern the most of our business for the company. And I guess momentarily the number of how much is [indiscernible], but it's -- I'm going to say somewhere up at that. So I'm going to say 75% to 85%, I believe, but can one refine that should need to, as I carry on talking here. Having said that, of course, there are certain agreements which have come up for renewal for 2024 pricing. And indeed, we are probably now 90% agreed for the price structures for 2024. And so, our expectation for the price commentary I've already given you is that you'll see that Q4 was healthy or mutual with 10-K, a very solid year and we expect 2024 to be similar. And within that, you will see some of our Engine Products to indeed be repriced during 2024 and have already been agreed. So that's also the good. In terms of margins, I mean, you never get like quarter-on-quarter straight line, you tend to plateau for a little while and then you move again. And our thought really has been that we stepped up to a 23% level in the second half of '23. And so what should we expect? And I think you're saying, well, let's play it again for Q1 and see how we go is the right assumption. I've already told you that we have assumed a 28% incremental versus what we converted at 31% in Q4. And this also provides some allowance for the choppiness that I've commented on them. So should for example, Boeing not take all the parts that they've scheduled out and those have to go into inventory. Therefore, we won't be taking the profit on them. And so, we've assumed that, I'd say, a 3% lower absolute number of conversion. And therefore, to me, just playing it out seems a very reasonable assumption for the near term. How it flows for the balance of the year? It's difficult to say at this point in time. In terms of up-to-date market commentary, we actually see wheels demand to be probably a little bit stronger than we had imagined in the short term, and that's within the numbers we've already given you. At the same time, what does the back end of the year behold? I don't really know at this point. Orders have been into take for -- truck manufacturers have been a little bit stronger. And therefore, it bodes well, but of course, those are cancelable depending upon how the general economy goes and we'll have to wait and see. For me, the most important thing, it's not like what happens this quarter or next. But indeed, that market of commercial transportation, we expect to resume growth in '25 and '26 and then that continued with, I think, strong continued demand from commercial aerospace and then continuing to defense and for the gas turbine business promises good growth beyond '24 as we going to '25 and '26. Hey, Noah. Yeah. So, our assumption in terms of our guide -- of course, our guide is quite independent of what Boeing or indeed Airbus may build and what they may schedule, it's our financial assumption and one that I feel appropriate for Howmet. And for the large part, I feel is that we've tended to call the market fairly reasonably in the last few years. So, our assumption very clear was at 34% for the average for Boeing 737 for the year. Now what they actually build, I don't know and what they actually schedule at. I'm going to say at the moment, they say they're going to continue with their rate 38 assumption as best as we can detect from what we see from our demand schedules. So that's those specific numbers. In terms of spares, our exit rate for spares in the commercial aviation market, stepped up again. And so compared to 2019, which is the reference point we've used previously. And if you remember, in 2019 revenue from the spares market for -- on the commercial side is about $400 million, and it was about $400 million on the defense and gas turbine side. On the gas turbine and defense side, that continues to be steady and an increasing and now that increased to a level, we believe we'll see something like $600 million of demand in the defense sector and IGT sector. We're both growing but indeed, the spares for the F35 growing in particular. And in 2025, as an example, we expect the spares business for F35 to be as big as the OE business has been in recent years. So that's been good. We've seen demand increase in '23, we're expecting it in '24 and then '25. We should expect it to be a segment continue to grow as that fleet continues to expand. And the fleet, I think, is about 975 aircraft. And while we originally thought it's going to expand at like the 150 a year, as you know, currently Lockheed is not building or not building nor delivering at that rate. And so, to some degree, you have to be a little bit cautious. But you can expect a 50% increase compared to 2019 levels. In the case of the commercial segment, that did drop at the depths of COVID to half, so something just sub $200 million. And now that's fully grown back to $400 million, but with the run rate -- you see in the third and fourth quarters and then strengthening each quarter is that, that is now at a run rate above $400 million. And then obviously, to that, you also have to bake in the potential for additional schedules as these reported time on wing issues get, I'll say, addressed and serviced. And we do expect demand to be picking up in the second half of 2024 and then further strong demand -- a very strong demand going in '25 and '26. So that we see is very good. And so today, you can assume that our spares business for '23 is getting about, let's say, the $1 billion mark, and we expect it to be -- that is -- therefore, an increased percentage of our revenues and you could expect the percentage, therefore going into the aftermarket to continue to increase as we go into '25, '26 after a healthy year in '24. So, overall, a good picture and indeed, as I said in my commentary, that the thing which is -- it's not demand just to solve the immediacy of a time on wing issue. I mean, there is a structural shift in spares demand, which I don't think it's appreciated yet totally in the newer engines themselves essentially have increased service intervals because as you increase the temperature pressure in engine, the wearing part, so I think the high pressure turbine part of the engine. So, those initial Blade 1, Blade 2, vane one, et cetera, those become a wearable or wearing parts, a bit like brake pads on a car. And so, you can expect to see a structural shift as increased fitment of those engines is in the fleet and it replaces the predecessor CFM56 engine. So, you're seeing temporary strong demand for CFM56 just to running the fleet at existing fleet harder and a fundamental structural increase in replacement costs which is going to be there. And I think you're going to see additional, say, service shops built around the work to service these new engines, but that's seen that will unfold over the next, say, few years. So if I give you, let's say, the fourth quarter, we believe we delivered at rate 38, while Boeing build, let's say, rate 30. So, in Q4, let's assume that 8 aircraft sets per month went into inventory. So, there's 24 sets of parts which are sitting in Boeing inventory for the structural part, that our estimation. I don't think it's just quite the same on the engine side. Because what wasn't built in engines, let's say, the reduced engine build, which you've already had commentary from the engine manufacturers about that then the balance of the majority of the part, certainly on the turbine side, but not necessarily on the structural side, essentially went into service parts delivery into the MRO shops to account for what I already just talked about. And so if you think about it, assuming that Boeing taking Q1 at 38, depending on what the final thing is, then there is -- if they build up, my assumption is 34, maybe they'll bill at 38. That's why I've allowed for some choppiness as I already commented on, and allowed for some inventory that we may end up carrying as that gets ironed out and with how many people will recruit or we have already commented on that. And so, it's allowed for that, and it's allowed for some of that choppiness within the margin rate incrementals that I've given, calling out 28 versus 31 in Q4. Thank you. Okay. We have grown about 1% share a year in the turbine airfoils market over the last, let's say, four or five years. And so, it's been a consistent march, and we believe we're just around that 50% mark currently. And we see that continuing to grow commensurate with some of the, I'll say, extraordinary levels of technology that we bring in that segment. And also I've commented here, we would not be considering, let's say, investing further in the scale that I've referred to, without knowledge of that share being there and indeed, I did say very clearly and unequivocally that we've also contracted additional share within that. So, we continue to drive that improve it. And as you did here, hopefully, is that's not changing our free cash flow guide metric, the conversion of net income. Yeah. We did see the spot market pick up further in '23. You can never be sure. So, we've just assumed it's played again in 2024. And we did put in some security stock of material such that we could respond to the spot market and our balance sheet could take it. But we not assume that it's like a further significant step-up because it's also in that unknown area of indeed what hadn't been previously scheduled, what additional demands are there and sometimes the opportunity for an increased share if somebody else is not able to deliver. So, it's not an easy number to say. We assume that we're going to get more. I don't think that's a sensible way to plan. Thank you. Hi, Seth. Yeah. So, we do supply, I going to say, in terms of commercial -- for Boeing's requirements, we supply the majority directly to Boeing. But we also do supply Spirit as an example and others that are also providing subassemblies to Boeing. And so again, it's never an absolutely clear picture. But we just assume like we've taken an assumption of a number of aircraft sets. It could be that Boeing build at one level. And maybe another supplier might build at a different level, and it's also compared to what they want to hold and also indeed what Boeing have by way of their minimum, maximum inventory holdings as well. So, we operate on a min-max system, just roughly correlated to build, but as times when it breaks that correlation. So, it's never quite straightforward, Seth, I don't want to burden you is, I'll say, unnecessary detail, but the best assumption is just we've based that on 34 and all of the other suppliers of rate 34 and knowing that at some point, that if Boeing have been scheduling at a higher rate and build the inventory has to come out and so there be held because there's going to be -- maybe the rate assumption will go up, maybe it will be 42, maybe be 47 in 2025. And therefore, because it's really important that all the parts are there, so you avoid traveled work, which has been set a lot of commentary recently. So having supply security and all the parts available is really important. And therefore, it could well be that all of that will be held, which we don't know that. And at the same time, there's also the possibility is that given the cash strain that either Boeing or other suppliers may be under is that they will adjust inventory. So, we've just taken that cautious view, prepared that against -- for example, against the conversion of straight 90% of net income, which is a long-term guide. You can see from what we've given you this morning, it's like 85% plus or minus and that provides the allowance for just in case we have not only the growth rate that we expect, but also if we get caught holding the having to hold the bag in terms of a little bit lower take the natural schedules as some of those MAX inventories are adjusted. We don't know that. It's just an assumption. I mean clearly what we hope for is that they build fully and at great quality levels of rate 38. That's what we want. That's what we hope for. We look for great success from our customers. We'd love to see that. And should they build and schedule and then increase schedules for an increase in rate in 2025 then that will be really good for us. And you could expect us to be further increasing our sales should those scenarios play out. But at the moment, we're not prepared to go there because we don't know. Thank you. Hi, David. Yeah. So, you can -- it's always these multipart questions, which we get here. So, first of all, of course, given that revenues are increasing, let's call it $0.5 billion in the guide, there is a natural 15% to 20% working capital drag on that. So, let's use the 20% because the math becomes so much easier. There's $100 million of working capital for you to which we added the sort of number that you talked about in terms of that propensity which might happen. So that's where we are on that assumption. And in terms of how we deploy, we haven't actually fixed anything at this point, but it's hardly likely that we're going to enter a refinancing for a couple of hundred million. So, it's quite possible that we may decide just to retire that and take those interest rate savings into, let's say, end of the fourth quarter and into 2025. And therefore, you can assume that's all we're going to do probably. I mean, we could do a bit of a refi around the '25s, that's on a TBD basis, but that's not going to be a big drag either which way a platform any fee structure and breakage cost. But then the majority then you can assume it's going to be share buyback. So position all wise, you can assume that 2024 will be a bigger year for share buybacks compared to 2023 where you can see the majority of the action was further on the debt side to put our balance sheet into the great shape that it's currently in. And so, roughly speaking, you can assume further leverage improvements despite the share buyback thoughts that we have at the moment, which are going to be elevated compared to 2023. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Let's move to slide five for an overview of the markets. All markets continue to be healthy and we are well-positioned for future growth. Revenue was up 14% in the fourth quarter and up 17% for the full year. The commercial aerospace recovery continued throughout 2023 with revenue up 22% in the fourth quarter and up 24% for the full year driven by all three aerospace segments. Commercial aerospace has grown for 11 consecutive quarters and stands at just over 50% of total revenue. Growth continues to be robust, supported by the demand for new, more fuel efficient aircraft with reduced carbon emissions and increased spares demand. Defense aerospace was flat for the fourth quarter. However, defense aerospace was up 10% for the full year driven by legacy fighter programs and spares demand. Commercial transportation was up 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 9% for the full year driven by higher volumes. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 21% in the fourth quarter, driven by oil and gas up 34%, IGT up 24%, and industrial up 9%. For the full year, the industrial and other markets were up 17% year-over-year, driven by oil and gas up 38%, IGT up 16%, and general industrial up 7%. In summary, another strong year across all of our end markets. Now let's move to slide six. Consistent with prior calls, we will start with the P&L and focus on enhanced profitability. For the full year, revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and earnings per share all met or exceeded the high end of guidance. For the full year, revenue was $6.64 billion, up 17% year-over-year. EBITDA was $1.5 billion, an outpaced revenue growth by being up 18% year-over-year, while absorbing the addition of approximately 1,850 net new hires. EBITDA margin for the year was strong at 22.7%, with a fourth quarter exit rate of 23%. Adjusting for the year-over-year inflationary costs pass-through, the flow-through of incremental revenue to EBITDA was approximately 31% in the fourth quarter, and approximately 26% for the full year. Earnings per share was a record $1.84, up 31% year-over-year. Additionally, Q4 earnings per share was a record at $0.53 per share versus the prior quarterly record of $0.46 per share. In the quarter, we had two minor benefits impacting earnings per share, $0.01 associated with the Q4 favorable tax rate, and $0.01 related to favorable foreign currency. The fourth quarter represented the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in revenue, EBITDA, and earnings per share. Now let's cover the balance sheet. The balance sheet's never been stronger. Free cash flow for the year was a record $682 million, which exceeded the high end of guidance. As we have done every year since separation, we continue to drive free cash flow conversion of net income to our long-term target of 90%. The year-end cash balance was a healthy $610 million with strong liquidity. For the full year, we reduced the 2024 debt tower by approximately $875 million. $475 million came from the balance sheet, and $400 million was refinanced at a fixed rate with an approximate coupon of 3.9%. Net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 2.1 times. All long-term debt is unsecured, and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of interest rate expense into the future Howmet's improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were reflected in S&P's December rating upgrade to BBB minus. With this upgrade, we are now rated as investment grade by two of the three rating agencies. Finally, moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. For the year, approximately $800 million of cash on hand was deployed to debt paydown, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividends. The previously mentioned debt reduction actions during the year lowers annualized interest expense by approximately $29 million. We also repurchased $250 million of common stock at an average price of $47.76 per share. This was the 11th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. Share buyback authority from the Board of Directors stands at approximately $700 million. The average diluted share count improved to a record low Q4 exit rate of 413 million shares. Finally, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, the quarterly common stock dividend was increased by 25% to $0.05 per share. Now let's move to slide seven to cover the segment results for the fourth quarter. Engine products continued its strong performance. Revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $852 million. Commercial aerospace was up 14%, and defense aerospace was up 18%. Both markets realized higher build rates and spares growth. Oil and gas was up 25%, and IGT was up 24% as demand continues to be strong. EBITDA increased to 22% year-over-year to a record $233 million. EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points year-over-year to 27.3%, while absorbing approximately 180 net new employees in the fourth quarter and approximately 1,030 net new employees for the full year. For the full year, EBITDA was $887 million, and EBITDA margin was 27.2%. Both were records for the engines products teams, a significant accomplishment. 2023 EBITDA margin was up approximately 450 basis points from 2019 when revenue was at a similar level. Now let's move to slide eight. Fastening Systems revenue increased 26% year-over-year to $360 million. Commercial aerospace was 45% higher, including the impact of the wide-body recover. Commercial transportation was up 13%. General industrial was up 8%, and defense aerospace was down 9%. Year-over-year, EBITDA increased 38% to $80 million. EBITDA margin increased 180 basis points year-over-year to 22.2%. We are pleased with the continued performance of the fastening systems team with three consecutive quarters of revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin growth. Now let's move to slide nine. Engineered Structures revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $244 million. Commercial aerospace was up 19% driven by build rates and the wide-body recovery. Russian titanium share gain was flat year-over-year at approximately $20 million due to timing of shipments. Defense aerospace was down 35% year-over-year driven by the F35 and legacy fighter programs. EBITDA was $33 million, down slightly from prior year. EBITDA margin decreased 130 basis points year-over-year to 13.5%, partially due to absorbing net new employees. However, sequentially, revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin increased for the second consecutive quarter. In Q4, sequential revenue increased 7% and EBITDA increased 10%. Although production efficiencies are not yet back to targeted levels, we are making progress and expect continued recovery in 2024. Now let's move to slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue increased 3% to $275 million. The $9 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by an 8% increase in volume, partially offset by lower aluminum prices. Sequentially, volumes were down 3% as we're starting to see signs of the commercial transportation market softening. EBITDA was flat year-over-year. EBITDA margin decreased 90 basis points primarily due to the timing of inflationary costs pass-through. Finally, let's move to slide 11 for more detail on debt actions. In the fourth quarter, we redeemed $500 million of our 2024 bonds. The $500 million redemption at par was funded with approximately $100 million of cash from the balance sheet and approximately $400 million draw from two term loan facilities. Both term loan are prepayable without penalties or premiums and mature in November of 2026. $200 million was drawn from a U.S. dollar-denominated term loan facility and approximately $200 million was drawn from a Japanese yen denominated term loan facility. We entered into interest rate swaps to exchange the floating interest rates of the term loans into fixed interest rates. The weighted average fixed interest rate is approximately 3.9%, which is lower than the 2024 bonds coupon of 5.125% [ph]. The combined impact of these Q4 actions is expected to reduce annualized interest expense by approximately $10 million. Moreover, debt reductions in Q1 through Q3 reduced annualized interest expense by an additional $19 million. We continue to leverage the strength of our balance sheet. Since 2020, we've paid down gross debt by approximately $2.2 billion with cash on hand and lowered our annualized interest cost by more than $130 million. Gross debt now stands at approximately $3.7 billion. All long-term debt continues to be unsecured and at fixed rates and our $1 billion revolver remains undrawn. Lastly, before turning it back to John, let me highlight a couple of additional items. As we continue to focus on improving Howmet's performance and capital allocation, I wanted to highlight our pretax RONA, or return on net assets metric, RONA, which excludes goodwill and special items has improved by approximately 400 basis points on a year-over-year basis from 29% in 2022 to 33% in 2023. You will find reconciliations in the appendix of the presentation.  Lastly, in the appendix on slide 16, we have included 2024 assumptions. Interest expense is expected to improve to approximately $200 million. The guidance includes all debt actions completed to date. The operational tax rate is expected to continue to improve to a range of 21% to 22%. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately a 600 basis point improvement in the operational tax rate since separation in 2020. We continue to be focused on further improvements in our operational tax rate. Pension and OPEB expense as well as contributions are expected to increase modestly by approximately $15 million year-over-year. Finally, we expect miscellaneous other expenses, which are below the line to be in the range of $5 million of income to $15 million of expense for the year, but are very volatile within quarters. So with that, let me turn it back to John. And Sheila, this is Ken. Just to build on your question around long-term agreements, right? John is right, somewhere in the 75% of the revenue is tied to long-term agreements. That could be plus or minus, say 5% depending on where we are in the renewal process. As you can imagine, on the aerospace side, much heavier on long-term agreements. So, on the engines side of the house, you could be up to 90% of that revenue, could be under long-term agreements. Thanks David."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Betsy. Good morning and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace third quarter 2023 results conference call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In today's presentation references to EBITDA, operating income, and EPS mean adjusted EBITDA excluding special items, adjusted operating income excluding special items, and adjusted EPS excluding special items. These measures are among the non-GAAP financial measures that we've included in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. With that I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks P.T. and welcome everybody to the Q3 earnings call. The results for the third quarter were solid in all respects and exceeded the guidance given in August, which itself was a further increase on that provided in May and February. Sales of $1.658 billion, increase of 16% year-over-year. EBITDA was $382 million, an increase of 18%. EBITDA margin increased to a headline rate of 23%. Margin rate improvements reflect the continuing good work in all segments. I would like to note fasteners with not a sequential quarterly improvement of 230 basis points and additionally, the structure segment had a 320 basis points recovery from the Q2 rate. Howmet's year-over-year revenue increase flowed through to incremental EBITDA margin at a rate of 28%, which was in line with the guidance. Operating income increased by 22% year-over-year and operating income margin was 19%. Continued topline growth and healthy margins generated an earnings per share increase of 28%. Free cash flow was healthy at $132 million and help drive shareholder-friendly actions including gross debt retirement of $200 million share buyback of $25 million. Lastly, we also announced a 25% increase in the dividend on top of last year's 50% increase. Having provided this top-level summary, I'll pass the call to Ken to provide further details of revenue by end market and the results by business segments.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Let's move to Slide 5. All markets continue to be healthy with revenue in the third quarter, up 16% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. As expected sequential revenue growth was impacted by normal third quarter seasonality. Commercial aerospace increased 23% year-over-year, driven by all three aerospace segments. Commercial Aerospace has grown for 10 consecutive quarters and stands at 49% of total revenue. Commercial Aerospace growth continues to be robust supported by demand for new more fuel-efficient aircraft as well as increased spares demand. Defense Aerospace was up 13% year-over-year driven by the F-35 and Legacy Fighter programs. Commercial Transportation which impacts both forged wheels in the Fastening Systems segment was up 7% year-over-year driven by higher volumes. Commercial Transportation remains resilient, despite normal seasonality. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 10% year-over-year driven by oil and gas up 29%, General Industrial up 8% and IGT up 4%, in summary, another very strong quarter across all of our end markets. Now let's move to Slide 6, for more details on the third quarter results. Starting with the P&L and enhanced profitability revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share all exceeded the high-end of guidance. Revenue was $1.658 billion up 16% year-over-year. EBITDA was $382 million up 18% year-over-year, while absorbing near-term costs associated with net headcount conditions of approximately 645 employees. The Engine segment drove a majority of the increase by adding approximately 500 employees. Year-to-date net debt count additions are just over 1500 employees. We continue to increase headcount for the expected revenue ramp. EBITDA margin was strong at 23%, despite absorbing the headcount additions. Adjusting for year-over-year inflationary cost pass-through of approximately $15 million EBITDA margin was 23.3% in the flow-through of segment incremental revenue to EBITDA was at approximately 28% year-over-year which is right in line with our guidance. Earnings per share, was strong at $0.46 per share, up 28% year-over-year. The third quarter reason represents the ninth consecutive quarter with growth in revenue EBITDA and earnings per share. Next is the balance sheet. The balance sheet continues to strengthen, while returning cash to key stakeholders. The ending cash balance was $425 million after generating $132 million of free cash flow. In the quarter, $242 million of cash on hand was allocated to debt reduction, common stock repurchases and dividends. Net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low, of 2.3 times. All bond debt is unsecured and at fixed rates which will provide stability of interest rate expense in the future. Our next bond maturity of $705 million is due in October of 2024. Howmet's improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were reflected in Fitch's August credit upgrade from BBB- to BBB, two notches into investment grade. Moreover Moody's upgraded Howmet's outlook from stable to positive in September. The balance sheet continues to strengthen and is recognized with the rating agency upgrades. Finally, moving to capital allocation, we continue to be balanced in our approach. In the quarter capital expenditures were $59 million which continues to be less than depreciation and amortization. In the third quarter we reduced debt by another $200 million. Year-to-date, we have reduced debt by approximately $376 million, which will lower annualized interest expense by approximately $19 million. We also repurchased $25 million of common stock in the third quarter at an average price of $49.32 per share. This was the 10th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. Share buyback authority from the Board stands at $797 million. Since separation in 2020, we have repurchased more than $1 billion of common stock. We exited the third quarter with a diluted share count of 414 million shares. Finally, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the third quarter, the quarterly stock dividend was $0.04 per share. The quarterly stock dividend will be increased by 25% in the fourth quarter to $0.05 per share. Now let's move to slide 7 to go through the segment results for the third quarter. The Engine Products segment continued its strong performance. Revenue was $798 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Commercial aerospace was up 15% and Defense Aerospace is up 33% with both markets driven by higher build rates and spares growth. Oil and gas was up 33% and IGP was up 4% as demand continues to be strong. As expected, Q3 sequential revenue was down 3% driven by seasonal vacations. EBITDA increased 18% year-over-year to $219 million. The EBITDA margin increased 20 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially to 27.4%, while absorbing approximately 500 net new employees. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of the engines team. Now let's move to slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue increased 20%. Commercial aerospace was up 34%, including the impact of the emerging wide-body recovery. Commercial Transportation was up 6%. General Industrial was up 7% and Defense Aerospace was down 5%. Year-over-year segment EBITDA increased 19% EBITDA margin was 21.8% and is improved 320 basis points over the last two quarters. Please move to slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was up 18% with commercial aerospace up 33%, driven by build rates and approximately $30 million of Russian titanium share gain. Defense Aerospace was down 20% year-over-year. Sequentially, Engineered Structures improved production rates and revenue was up 14%, which was in line with our expectation of 10% to 15%. Segment EBITDA increased 7% year-over-year. Sequentially EBITDA margin improved 320 basis points to 13.2% despite absorbing approximately 145 net new employees in the third quarter. Q3 was good recovery by the structures team and we continue to expect further improvement in margins. Let's move to slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue increased 7%. The $19 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by a 13% increase in volume, partially offset by lower aluminum prices. Segment EBITDA increased 20% year-over-year driven by the higher volumes. EBITDA margin increased 290 basis points primarily due to the impact of higher volumes and lower aluminum prices. Finally, let's move to slide 11. Our balance sheet continues to be a source of strength with healthy cash flow supporting a $200 million debt reduction in Q3. The $1.25 billion October 2024 debt tower was inherited from Alcoa Inc. and has been reduced to $705 million with cash on hand. Since the separation in 2020, we have paid down gross debt by approximately $2.15 billion with cash on hand and have lowered annualized interest costs by more than $120 million. Gross debt now stands at $3.8 billion. All long-term debt continues to be unsecured and at fixed rates. We will continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. Lastly, before turning it back to John, let me highlight one item. In the appendix slide 18 covers our operational tax rate which was approximately 22.8% year-to-date. The midpoint of our guidance represents a 500 basis point improvement in the operational tax rate since the separation in 2020. Strong performance by the tax [Indiscernible] and we continue to be focused on further improvements in our operational tax rate. Now, let me turn it back to John for the outlook and summary.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken. So let's move to slide 12 and talk about the outlook for the next quarter and year-end. So first of all regarding commercial aerospace, airline load factors continued to show improvement in resilience. Factory improvement for international travel notably in Asia also continues to increase. Domestic airline activity continues to be above 2019 levels in the Western countries. Given these load factors and the continued restriction of aircraft builds, the fleet of existing aircraft are having to work much harder. This is leading to robustness in the engine spares market which is further increased by the fact that the deployment in recent years of new engine technologies which are currently operating with increased replacement parts due to lower time on wing. You look worried about this and you can be assured that Howmet is playing its path and supporting both the technology upgrades and the high-pressure turbine and through providing additional service parts. This will continue over the next two to three years and probably beyond. Moving on commercial aerospace to the defense market. This market is also showing strength with the start of the gradual buildup of engine spares over the next two to three years to support the F-35 program for which the fleet now stands at 975 aircraft and growing. These increases more than offset the continued lockhead inventory correction in our structures business. Other markets of IGT and oil and gas continue to be very healthy. In commercial truck and trailer builds and order intake continued to be good despite the lower freight rates and increased price of diesel fuel. We continue to be cautious though as we look forward until we see several months of data for new 2024 orders, which the order books have only been opened for a month. The initial month was good. But we also know that orders can be canceled depending upon how the broader economy moves in recent months. In aggregate, we see limited risk of aircraft demand from both the commercial aircraft market and defense markets. The two markets aggregate to approximately 65% of our revenue and that moves up to 80% excluding the commercial transportation business. Beyond the fundamental demand from airlines, clearly we rely upon aircraft manufacturers being able to produce and build up the stated and scheduled quality of aircraft, particularly narrow-body aircraft. Looking forward into 2024, we envisage growth to be in the 7% range plus or minus a percentage point. The headline sales number for 2024 is likely to be approximately $7 billion. This will be further refined when we see the achieved Q4 build rates from Boeing and Airbus with the confirmed plans going into 2024. All of this will be provided in further detail in February, along with the assumed build rates. Our standard is normally one of caution. Moving specifically to the fourth quarter of 2023. We see revenue about $1.635 billion plus or minus $15 million, EBITDA $375 million plus or minus $5 million, earnings per share at $0.45 plus or minus $0.01. Regarding the full year 2023, revenues increased by about $100 million from $6.44 billion to $6.54 billion plus or minus $15 million. EBITDA has increased by a further $40 million to $1.485 billion plus or minus $5 million. Earnings per share has increased by $0.07 to $1.77 plus or minus $0.01. Free cash flow is at $635 million plus or minus $35 million. In summary, we see strong performance with healthy liquidity and an increased guide for the remainder of the year. We consider the year-to-date progress to be very good, despite the continued choppy build conditions in commercial aerospace. We are comforted by the fact that any build misses by aircraft manufacturers who have moved into backlog, given the very strong underlying demand for travel and in particular the absolute requirements for fuel efficient engines and fuel efficient aircraft with an overarching mandate of reduced carbon emissions. Our full year guide of $1.77 earnings per share is an increase of 26% year-over-year. This builds on the 2022 versus 2021 increase of 39%. Currently in 2023, we repurchased $376 million of debt and brought back $150 million of common stock. Our net leverage has further improved in Q3 and is heading towards approximately two times net debt to EBITDA by year-end. All of the debt actions help accomplish our goal of reduced interest rate burden in both 2023 and also going into 2024 with further improved cash flow yield, despite the increase generally of interest rates. Thanks everybody. And now let's move to your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Kristine Liwag: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nJohn Plant: Hi, Kristine.\nQ \u2013 Kristine Liwag: John, Ken or PT I guess with the 7% revenue increase for your 2024 initial outlook, what does it imply for aircraft production rates for the Boeing 737, 787 and the Airbus A320 and A350. And also when you talk to your customers, how much visibility are you getting for the ramp?\nJohn Plant: Okay. I guess that's the big one Kristine. So let me just talk generally about the 7%, first of all. Within that, assumption is a mid-teens assumed increase in commercial aero. And more like single-digit increases in industrial, things like AGT oil and gas and general and other, while an assumed high single-digit decrease in commercial transportation. So basically, in our client solid defense solid general industrial markets healthy increase in commercial aerospace that reduced by a high single-digit assumption on commercial or transportation. That's roughly now applying. I'm going to say, we see assumed build rates in let's say forecasting agencies. For the most part, we can see that they're going to increase both wide-body and body fractional increase in mix next year. At the moment, specifically, for Boeing 737 is what you assumed. You asked a question about our assumption is that it's somewhere between the mid-30s and 40 somewhere in that region. We don't want to pit it specifically at this point, you can assume that's within the range plus or minus I gave. It's really important that we see Boeing achieved the rate 38, which we know is going to be prior to now it hasn't really happened that doesn't seem to be happening just yet, but we know it's going to be very soon. But we're not yet ready to believe and input into our guidance even though we can supply a rate 42 should Boeing be in a position to build at that rate.\nQ \u2013 Kristine Liwag: Great. Thanks for the color.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Mikus: Hi. Scott Mikus on for Rob Spingarn. John or Ken, I wanted to ask you a little bit about pension contributions for next year. And also, just given the work you've done there, are you considering any sort of risk transfer to get rid of the pension liability and improve free cash conversion?\nJohn Plant: We've been working at pension liabilities for several years now and we've indeed taken over the last five years from where we started several billion out of that net liability of gross liabilities rather and we've always been focused on taking ROS and net debt together. Otherwise, you just leave yourself open to interest rate risk and mortality risk and we've managed it down now to I think about $750 million for pension and healthcare certainly in that region. And so it's now, let's say tiny traction of our market cap and therefore essentially is not relevant. At the same time, while I've noted one of the company maybe a couple have continued in prioritizing this. I'm not yet at that point willing to consider that. It's not that, it's off the table because I think it would be something which would be useful to do. But at the same time, I think at this current time there's other better uses of our cash and also I'm not willing to leverage to enable that to occur. So essentially, we are aware of it. We continue to work at our plans. I can see us potentially picking off one or two and do partial initiation either within a plant or in a total of a plan but you shouldn't expect to see that liability extend. We wish to not to pay the premiums to insurance companies to enable that at this point in time. I think that may come over the next say three to five years at some point but not yet. And the assumption we have for next year is that the cash contributions will be a little bit higher than this year but at this point not material.\nScott Mikus: Okay. Thanks. I'll stick with one question.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. \nJohn Plant: Hey, David.\nDavid Strauss: John, you mentioned your work on upgraded blades. I wanted to see if you could give a little more color there around the timing of when you when you think you'll be producing upgrading -- producing and delivering upgraded blades to both GE and Pratt?\nJohn Plant: So both for the GTF advantage engine upgrade and for the LEAP 1B upgrades. Those have been something that we've been working on for several years now. And the -- and if anything let's say a little bit later into production than originally envisaged although that is pushed back and timing have not been a result of Howmet not being ready. So we're in good shape. I commented in the past that increased performance in the high-pressure turbine leads to increased complexity and with that is value. And we certainly have been intimate with the engine manufacturers to improve the performance as the engine temperatures have seemed to be higher than originally envisaged and therefore to help improve timeline wing. I feel there's though specific timing for both what was really called -- now that has a different code name for GE. And I think for the advantage for Pratt & Whitney you're best asking them for pipeline disclosure rather than myself because we have an agreed plan but that can and has been varied according to the specific needs of those engine manufacturers at this point in time?\nDavid Strauss: Okay. Fair enough. I'll ask them.\nJohn Plant: Thank you. It's far better David.\nDavid Strauss: And then Ken I guess a two-parter for you. Just quick comments on working capital through the end of this year. It looks like you're kind of a pretty big reversal benefit in Q4 and thoughts on that into 2024? And then pension expense you brought down a little bit for 2023 but what are you looking at for 2024? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: I'm going to comment on the working capital first, and then let Ken amplify and then Ken can totally deal with the pension side. And the reason why, I want to talk about the working capital because it's also tied up with the specific operations and status of they have met different business units are. So first of all, in terms of working capital I mean AR or account receivable and accounts payable they just move on the days assumption. So, if revenue goes up David, as it has then clearly, we have more dollars tied up in receivables than we had but that's a good answer, because it's whatever day it is and I don't know, if we've ever disclosed it we can back engineer it. But our days are pretty constant. And so because revenue went up a few more dollars went on, but the days in receivables exactly the same payment payables. The big wildcard on what gap is always inventory. And so far inventory is still elevated more elevated than I would like but just because our flight [ph] hasn't been taken up where it should be at this point in time. So it moves with the, I will say status within each business of where we are operationally and in terms of start from let's say, volume recovery. So if you take our Wheels segment, which was the first division to show volume increase manning and then moving through towards stability and now smoothness of production. Our days of inventory are in really good shape. And indeed, I believe we're at close to low-class level. If I look at our engine business, which is our second division out of the gate in terms of building of revenue, increasing manning and that's continuing to increase. We have gradually been smoothing out production albeit, we're not in the same level yet, as we are in Wheels. And so what we see is gradual improvements in efficiency of our inventory holding days is on hand. And I think that will continuing to improve again in the fourth quarter and into next year. So I'm pleased, with the trajectory but we're not yet at where we need to be on our engine business. In terms of fasteners and structures those are very different points. Fasteners has been later in the cycle in terms of volume pickup. As you know, we've been recruiting this year building it up. And you've seen first of all the margin begin to respond to that and also mix and production efficiency. And also you've seen a little bit of a calming of recruitment, in that business in the last few months ultimate still in that we say recruitment mode and replacement mode for employees, but trying to improve efficiency. Where the moment the date on hand is well out of order in terms of, where it needs to be and is not yet improving at all, but we'll begin to improve I believe as we go through 2024. In the case of Structures, that's probably our worst business in terms of days on hand. And if you remember last quarter, wasn't particularly a great quarter in terms of the throughput of the business. And so, I elaborate -- business not to focus on inventory, but just to use inventory as the buffer to help stabilize the manufacturing operations, and therefore, improve the margin, which is what you saw occur in the 300 basis points improvement in the structures business. At this point, I don't think it goes anywhere at all in the fourth quarter. And that's a combination of still needs to stabilize its operations. But also at the moment I see customers laying in additional demand particularly laying in additional urgent demand on the titanium side. I'm not yet prepared to add heads, nor working capital in inventory, nor input materials until I'm satisfied with the economics to pay those premium costs. And so if anything I'm going to hold back on that because I've got better places to deploy capital, which is what I told you last quarter and generally in the business of analysts is that I'm very disciplined on where we allocate capital. And so at the moment, I'm not trying to drive working capital particularly in that business, but that will come next year as that business begins to smooth out and improve its production and gain more responsiveness in terms of I'll say people paying for the premiums or if they want the demand and drop in then they pay for it. Otherwise they don't get it. It's that simple. So that deals with working capital be it can't preemptively, David and I'll pass to Ken.\nKen Giacobbe: Yeah. Thanks David. So as John articulated their days are really the key on working capital. And then also depending on where we are in the cycle -- business segment. So as we exit this year, I think we've given everybody the walk in the assumptions tab of the deck to kind of walk through it. But that would indicate a working capital burn this year roughly about $190 million plus or minus. And it's really driven by -- we've increased the revenue guide once again so you have more AR that goes with that plus we're keeping inventory in the business to make sure that we're not the bottleneck for our customers, delivering on time in full at the right spec is really important for us. So we've got a little bit more inventory. Next year we've got another growth projection here. So I anticipate there'll be working capital burn again next year in 2024, probably be better than this year as we work down inventory in the business but it's again going to be dependent on where we are in the cycle. So I believe it's in really good order here driven by the growth of the business. On the pension expense side, as John mentioned I'll start at the top of the house. We've taken gross liabilities down by 45% since separation. That's a pretty big decline. Big significant part of that is the actions that we've taken to reduce gross liabilities. So as we get a bit of a help from the increase in discount rates but there's a lot of action around that gross liability. John mentioned cash, it will be up next year. We remeasure it at the end of the year. So that's pretty much of a volatile line. So we'll give you more guidance on the next call in terms of what the cash contributions would be. The expense side -- that's a little bit more visible right now. Again we strike it at the end of the year. If you look at our pension and OPEB expense right now it's $35 million on an annual basis. So next year based on asset returns, the market has been a little tougher. I'd say probably another $15 million plus or minus $5 million on either side of that. It's really not material. But I think that's all in good order as well.\nDavid Strauss: Great. Thanks for all the detail.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Duco with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nScott Deuschle: Hi. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hi, Scott. \nScott Deuschle: Two very quick questions both for John. First did price realizations accelerate again in the third quarter. I think they had accelerated last quarter. And then on Fasteners, can you say whether you're shipping at five a month on 787 at this point? Or are you still tracking a bit below that? Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Okay. I don't think we've given the third quarter detail on the commercial side. I think that would be in our 10-Q later when we file it, whilst I'd say that it's in good order and in line with what we previously said both for the quarter for the year. And I stand behind my comments regarding 2024 we made them on the last call. 787 at the moment we're a little bit below rate and fully expecting that to move up to grade seven next year. And as I've commented before we see very strong underlying demand for that aircraft. And I can see the need to go above rate seven as well. It's only a question of when.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nScott Deuschle: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nMyles Walton: Thanks. John I was hoping you could dig a little bit deeper into the fastening margin performance and obviously, sort of, troughed at the beginning of the year and has been showing some signs of resiliency and improvement. I think at the beginning of the year you told me to not expect much for a couple of years. Are we at a point where new management plus the rate increases on the wide-bodies we should start to think about getting back to 2018, 2019 Fastener performance?\nJohn Plant: Well, I think, it's a bit premature to get back there because I mean the conditions there and the wide-body market in particular is quite different to what they are now. So basically in the first quarter, which is probably a low points in base margins reflected essentially a total metallic build of aircraft and you can call it zero in terms of any real volume on the composite side. So that's one factor. Of course that's begun to change. The business itself has also begun to improve. And I see very much improved signs of operating efficiency improvements, but with a ways to go. I see additional discipline in the business commercially and there's still a ways to go. And going forward into next year what I see is a volume increase for commercial aircraft production also fractional improvement in mix because of the wide-body going to next year in particular in your assumptions on what the final wide-body production will be in composite aircraft essentially on wide-body transitioning from metal to composite aircraft through the course of the year. Hopefully with some delivery of 777X parts as well which has got a composite wing. And so I'll say general improvement in conditions for the business, but still with a big thrust on improving its productivity and throughput efficiency which needs to occur. So, basically, some ways to go yes optimism will continue good trend over the last couple of quarters but too soon to call out any specifics on it. And I don't think we have a guide by segment anyway. But I haven't guided or have that margin for next year just given you like the revenue increases. So that gives you a picture of our business.\nMyles Walton: Thanks John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRonald Epstein: Hey John, how are you?\nJohn Plant: Hey Ron.\nRonald Epstein: Yes. The topic that doesn't tend to come up much is the forged wheels. And it appears that it's been running ahead of expectations. I mean how should we think about that? And what are your expectations around it? And when we think about modeling it what would be a prudent way to do so?\nJohn Plant: Well essentially the play on forged wheels for aluminum is that you start off with what's the big picture in terms of truck and trailer production essentially in North America and Europe, albeit we do play in some of the Asian markets so it's a significant share position as well. And then you factor in basically some -- so whatever percentage change that is in a new factor in as a positive against what I think will be a worse macro position next year. There'll be some penetration achieved against steel wheels particularly as fuel efficiency requirements that step up, a fractional contribution but nothing in a great node in terms of adoption of different I'll say powertrain hinting out there is move towards electrification or whatever but no big moves next year but that's a positive venture as well. And the manufactural share improvement on top of that. So, basically we see secular growth in the segment offsetting some macro decline in the assumed markets and that's why I guided as commented an idea about high single-digit reduction for the business is our assumption trying to be fairly cautious at this point in time until we've got a better read on what's the general economy going to do although I did see freight rates begin to stabilize and improve recently. So, there's a lot of factors yet to bring to bear in terms of what the final outlook for next year is I want to take a fairly cautious assumption. This year I don't really commented -- a more difficult second half as it is we've still been able to burn off backlog. And let's say even despite today we have -- is it Mac truck which is subject to the UAW strike. Our arrears are such that that's not going to affect us in the fourth quarter. And our assumption is that by Q1 next year by another couple of months at UAW dispute the Mac truck will be resolved and therefore they'll be back. So that's about it really. It's been pretty strong this year. I give you the general is into next year.\nRonald Epstein: And then maybe just one follow-on if I may just a little change subject. When we think about the Pratt & Whitney situation with the GTF and all the tests that need to be reworked, is that good bad neutral for you guys? I mean how should we think about the impact on you? I mean the company vis-a-vis the GTF situation?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I'll start off with having to separate two issues I think on the GTF, because I think while it gets all and mashed together, I see them as quite separate and then the catalysts intertwining for convenience. So this contamination issue clearly that requires inspection that might take, I don't know, so many days, let's call it, 20, 30, 40 days or an off wing to achieve that inspection. And then, I guess longer if those risks turn out they required to be replaced or not. And I guess it is a small fraction of those that will require to be replaced. That's one item or separate item. Over, let's say, previously incentive field but I'll call it, left field there is the discussion about the time on wing issues that have been publicized by everybody regarding the GTF we're particularly in harsh climate countries or pollution countries the time working is a fraction of the predecessor engine and also what we originally thought for the GTF. So, the question then becomes for the problems around the combustor the filling of holes the higher temperature and then those temperatures and pollutants hitting the two blades in the high-pressure turbine those clearly require replacement. And the question is, what is the replacement interval for them? And so that stands alone as an issue. Pratt & Whitney will determine what frequency they want to replace those blades, again, more of a question for perhaps than for myself. We're able to stand behind them and supply what needs to be supplied within degrees. The question is, what's the requirement? Then, of course, you can intertwine them together. So maybe where those engines are off wing for the powder metal contamination issue maybe the opportunity will be taken to replace some of those high-pressure turbine laser and other components on the engine or maybe it won't. That's a practice issue. And the question I have in my mind is, do they go for full replacements for them as they really look at inspect and take the engines off the wing for the first time or do they stick them back on just because the lines will want the engines back on wing and only seek to replace those in harsh climates at that time. And so maybe that's the more of the while I read from MTU of the 300 days turnaround time. So I just don't know Ron, but it will finally turn out to be, because it's a choice by ratio [ph] or Pratt & Whitney to determine to what extent do they make improvements for the time on wing issue including the high-pressure turbine parts as they take those into serve. So why it's written about us almost one issue of power of metal, I think there are two distinct issues which may come together but just depending upon the pressure to get those engines back on wing and we are still in discussions with Pratt & Whitney regarding all of that. And they determined how many of our parts go to OE production and how many go to the spares market. And that's up to them and the aircraft manufacturers to decide that.\nRonald Epstein: Got it. Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak : Hey, good morning everyone. John I was hoping to get a little more color from you on your perspective on the broader aerospace new-build ramp-up. You've had good perspective. And as you mentioned you've been cautious and that it's been correct. It felt like in the middle of the year and kind of around the air show and into the summer you sounded more optimistic and sounded like the supply chain was kind of finally ready to go. And then we've had these incremental engine and aerostructures issues. Did Boeing especially -- and I guess Boeing and Airbus keep the underlying broader supply chain going towards the planned higher rates? And is everything kind of ready to ramp once after fuselage and the like are fixed. And you mentioned them giving you plans for next year. Are they incrementally more firm on that now with the master schedule than they've been recovery to date are things firmer? Or is that wishful thing?\nJohn Plant : I mean, I think Boeing in particular I have had firm plans throughout the year, it's been the realization of those plants, which has been more of the issues. And I guess it's from a combination of reasons, there's always going to be somewhere in the supply chain amongst all the parts of difficulties. There's always going to be the degree of experience in Boeing on plants with all of the change of people in and out or out and in regarding post-COVID. And then of course, we read in the press about the difficulties of, I'd say was it strike at Spirit Aerospace and then some other production issues of some failed parts and holes and all the rest of it. And yet there seems to have been some management change there, which may proved to be positive because that's a TBD. And hopefully, I guess, you listen carefully to the commentary from Spirit yesterday. We're optimistic that those fuselage and other component problems to get resolved it's not sitting in our control. But should those begin to improve, I think, that's a major step forward in Boeing realizing its own plans for production rate increases and also getting behind it the retrofit of those sales, which were subject to pass those only or holes billed too big and bigger fasteners. So I think they're hoping Herculean efforts to try to achieve all of that. But as you know circulate events by themselves don't sort of produce the output, and we've still got to see that improve. So, hopefully, during October, November, December, we'll begin to see rate pick up, it's spirit other suppliers and then obviously, boring itself to get to their required or stated rate four to next year. In terms of then on the engine side, you've read commentary or I think anyone, I've seen was the GE commentary instead of let's say 1,700 engine 1,600 engines, isn't really impactful for us at this point in time? Because for us it's just us meeting their rate requirements and then there's a choice as I said rather than the previous question, what goes to OE compared to what goes to search requirements. We're dealing with very robust demand on both sides. We see that demand increasing again next year plus some blended in changes potentially for the technology change yet to come.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi John and hi Ken. Thank you, guys.\nJohn Plant: Hi Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: So hey, I have two questions if that's okay. So John don't [indiscernible].\nJohn Plant: Well, I am completely leaning today announce it is two-parts, three-parts so yeah sure. Go for it.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: You are. You are. But I want some good nuggets here. So the OEs that are calling out castings and forgings in terms of supply chain kind of slowing down the supply chain. I know you've been clear that Howmet isn't a bottleneck and you aren't in the large structural casting business anyway. So maybe could you characterize your output today? And what you're capable of in terms of demand? And then, this is more of like a larger opportunity in terms of pricing and volume. How do you think about that trade-off going forward?\nJohn Plant: Generally forgings and castings have been a bit of a whipping below for a couple of years. With commentary I think maybe even before, it was any basis for it albeit, subsequently I think there has been a basis for a commentary where to replace the skill levels to produce some of these in particular the casting is really at a very high order. So the trade the recruitment and then trading lines to produce effective production workers in some of this certainly strain. I think all of the companies in that regard including Howmet. We did choose to start recruitment a bit earlier. And I know that I've cost the company probably 20 basis points of margin by being slightly ahead of the curve -- recruitment. But at the same time I think has paid dividends for us and the fact that we've been in a vision to produce generally on time, at rate and generally good quality. So I think it's been a good trade-off for us. I want to correct you on the structural casting side we're probably the number two in the market behind precision cast parts, but they are still, the big dog on the block in terms of production of structural castings. We do produce them and we're at a good rate for let's say, 98% of all of our structural castings. I mean early on we had a few moments things like fairings and is like shelling pieces and coming off at good rates and no cost [Ph] or whatsoever. And so should there be increased demand for structural castings obviously where we tool and if not the availabilities that to us for the next few years should engine manufacturers want to is that we're in a position to supply because we still have some available capacity and indeed are willing to invest commensurate with it being a good return of capital. And generally I've been quite positive about investing in our engine business and contrasting that to -- the our structures business is based upon returns. So it's one way of saying we're in a good state, restructure casting we are the significant supply to the industry on turbine blades. And I hope that gives you enough nuggets.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: How's do you think about pricing and your contract structures going forward given the constraints in the supply chain and you're hiring ahead of the curve.\nJohn Plant: Pricing has been positive for us. And I think it reflects the value that we bring. When I look at some of the requirements for the increased temperature performance in the, let's say, narrow-body engines. We are bringing to bear some of the not all, but some of the technologies that we've deployed for the F-35 engine in terms of ability to manage both pressure thermal performance in the high-pressure turbine. And we're able to produce parts. We obviously work with the customers to engine into specification. But if they're specified at 2,500 degrees and operate higher we can take it higher because as you know for the F-35 we're up at 3,500 degrees and indeed the only company that well that can provide the turbine parts with that performance in that environment. We've already commented previously that we are working on the improvements for the currently 2028 upgrade to that engine to improve its thrust and time and air. And so again, we are able to take the temperature performance of those parts and elevate it further. And we've talked a little bit, but only a little bit in our Technology Day about some of the technologies that we'd be able to deploy for that. And so we're in a position to bring a degree of performance and capability at scale, which I think needs to reflect in value because in truth the turbine blade is a pretty small part of the value of the engine and to achieve the requirements for let's say lower carbon footprint continually taking up the pressure inside the engine to improve the optimization that you have fuel and therefore its burn characteristics for lower dilution and the whole say fuel efficiencies and carbon footprint presents great value to the industry.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The last question today comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much. Good morning everyone. So John I know you said you wouldn't say this or haven't said this and so I'm not necessarily expecting a number in terms of the margin outlook for next year, but if we think about that sort of baseline incremental of 30% plus or minus 5%. How do we think about the puts and takes for where next year can come in relative to that 30%. Does the addition of headcount and the need for the learning to develop among your employees? Does that keep things sort of below that 30% range as it's been in recent years? Or are there other opportunities to be above it? What's the best way to think about that at this point?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean, we were able to step up the last quarter to 19% operating profit and 23% EBITDA rate. I don't have any commentary regarding margin rates for next year. What I still see at the moment is potentially, I don't know this, but potentially a few more months of choppy production particularly on the free manufacturing side, it's just an assumption. Maybe we get lucky towards the second half of next year or the back end of next year and we see things get smooth out, we have seen some things begin to move in our favor and smooth that as I commented on the inventory side, we also think about our engine business. But in terms of -- at what point do we reach what I previously have referred to the state of Grace where things move out margins become stable and better and cash just use that as the industry and hopefully out of Howmet. I've always said that's a year away and I still think you see year away could be the back end of '24, but more likely getting to '25 and that hopefully combines with if the '25 external debuts of what the aircraft production will be including its wide-body mix then that begins to get I'd say into a good state. So, I have generally medium to long-term optimism and feel we are in a really great place with great backlog and good things to come, albeit still having to face up to shorter-term challenges of all the things we've talked about in terms of broad rate changes and the assumptions change in many parts of the market, in particular the commercial aerospace part of the market. I think it's a better best I can give.\nSeth Seifman: Excellent. Thanks very much. Helpful.\nJohn Plant: Thank you, very much.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and concludes the conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks P.T. and welcome everybody to the Q3 earnings call. The results for the third quarter were solid in all respects and exceeded the guidance given in August, which itself was a further increase on that provided in May and February. Sales of $1.658 billion, increase of 16% year-over-year. EBITDA was $382 million, an increase of 18%. EBITDA margin increased to a headline rate of 23%. Margin rate improvements reflect the continuing good work in all segments. I would like to note fasteners with not a sequential quarterly improvement of 230 basis points and additionally, the structure segment had a 320 basis points recovery from the Q2 rate. Howmet's year-over-year revenue increase flowed through to incremental EBITDA margin at a rate of 28%, which was in line with the guidance. Operating income increased by 22% year-over-year and operating income margin was 19%. Continued topline growth and healthy margins generated an earnings per share increase of 28%. Free cash flow was healthy at $132 million and help drive shareholder-friendly actions including gross debt retirement of $200 million share buyback of $25 million. Lastly, we also announced a 25% increase in the dividend on top of last year's 50% increase. Having provided this top-level summary, I'll pass the call to Ken to provide further details of revenue by end market and the results by business segments. Thanks, Ken. So let's move to slide 12 and talk about the outlook for the next quarter and year-end. So first of all regarding commercial aerospace, airline load factors continued to show improvement in resilience. Factory improvement for international travel notably in Asia also continues to increase. Domestic airline activity continues to be above 2019 levels in the Western countries. Given these load factors and the continued restriction of aircraft builds, the fleet of existing aircraft are having to work much harder. This is leading to robustness in the engine spares market which is further increased by the fact that the deployment in recent years of new engine technologies which are currently operating with increased replacement parts due to lower time on wing. You look worried about this and you can be assured that Howmet is playing its path and supporting both the technology upgrades and the high-pressure turbine and through providing additional service parts. This will continue over the next two to three years and probably beyond. Moving on commercial aerospace to the defense market. This market is also showing strength with the start of the gradual buildup of engine spares over the next two to three years to support the F-35 program for which the fleet now stands at 975 aircraft and growing. These increases more than offset the continued lockhead inventory correction in our structures business. Other markets of IGT and oil and gas continue to be very healthy. In commercial truck and trailer builds and order intake continued to be good despite the lower freight rates and increased price of diesel fuel. We continue to be cautious though as we look forward until we see several months of data for new 2024 orders, which the order books have only been opened for a month. The initial month was good. But we also know that orders can be canceled depending upon how the broader economy moves in recent months. In aggregate, we see limited risk of aircraft demand from both the commercial aircraft market and defense markets. The two markets aggregate to approximately 65% of our revenue and that moves up to 80% excluding the commercial transportation business. Beyond the fundamental demand from airlines, clearly we rely upon aircraft manufacturers being able to produce and build up the stated and scheduled quality of aircraft, particularly narrow-body aircraft. Looking forward into 2024, we envisage growth to be in the 7% range plus or minus a percentage point. The headline sales number for 2024 is likely to be approximately $7 billion. This will be further refined when we see the achieved Q4 build rates from Boeing and Airbus with the confirmed plans going into 2024. All of this will be provided in further detail in February, along with the assumed build rates. Our standard is normally one of caution. Moving specifically to the fourth quarter of 2023. We see revenue about $1.635 billion plus or minus $15 million, EBITDA $375 million plus or minus $5 million, earnings per share at $0.45 plus or minus $0.01. Regarding the full year 2023, revenues increased by about $100 million from $6.44 billion to $6.54 billion plus or minus $15 million. EBITDA has increased by a further $40 million to $1.485 billion plus or minus $5 million. Earnings per share has increased by $0.07 to $1.77 plus or minus $0.01. Free cash flow is at $635 million plus or minus $35 million. In summary, we see strong performance with healthy liquidity and an increased guide for the remainder of the year. We consider the year-to-date progress to be very good, despite the continued choppy build conditions in commercial aerospace. We are comforted by the fact that any build misses by aircraft manufacturers who have moved into backlog, given the very strong underlying demand for travel and in particular the absolute requirements for fuel efficient engines and fuel efficient aircraft with an overarching mandate of reduced carbon emissions. Our full year guide of $1.77 earnings per share is an increase of 26% year-over-year. This builds on the 2022 versus 2021 increase of 39%. Currently in 2023, we repurchased $376 million of debt and brought back $150 million of common stock. Our net leverage has further improved in Q3 and is heading towards approximately two times net debt to EBITDA by year-end. All of the debt actions help accomplish our goal of reduced interest rate burden in both 2023 and also going into 2024 with further improved cash flow yield, despite the increase generally of interest rates. Thanks everybody. And now let's move to your questions. Hi, Kristine.\nQ \u2013 Kristine Liwag: John, Ken or PT I guess with the 7% revenue increase for your 2024 initial outlook, what does it imply for aircraft production rates for the Boeing 737, 787 and the Airbus A320 and A350. And also when you talk to your customers, how much visibility are you getting for the ramp? Okay. I guess that's the big one Kristine. So let me just talk generally about the 7%, first of all. Within that, assumption is a mid-teens assumed increase in commercial aero. And more like single-digit increases in industrial, things like AGT oil and gas and general and other, while an assumed high single-digit decrease in commercial transportation. So basically, in our client solid defense solid general industrial markets healthy increase in commercial aerospace that reduced by a high single-digit assumption on commercial or transportation. That's roughly now applying. I'm going to say, we see assumed build rates in let's say forecasting agencies. For the most part, we can see that they're going to increase both wide-body and body fractional increase in mix next year. At the moment, specifically, for Boeing 737 is what you assumed. You asked a question about our assumption is that it's somewhere between the mid-30s and 40 somewhere in that region. We don't want to pit it specifically at this point, you can assume that's within the range plus or minus I gave. It's really important that we see Boeing achieved the rate 38, which we know is going to be prior to now it hasn't really happened that doesn't seem to be happening just yet, but we know it's going to be very soon. But we're not yet ready to believe and input into our guidance even though we can supply a rate 42 should Boeing be in a position to build at that rate.\nQ \u2013 Kristine Liwag: Great. Thanks for the color. Thank you. We've been working at pension liabilities for several years now and we've indeed taken over the last five years from where we started several billion out of that net liability of gross liabilities rather and we've always been focused on taking ROS and net debt together. Otherwise, you just leave yourself open to interest rate risk and mortality risk and we've managed it down now to I think about $750 million for pension and healthcare certainly in that region. And so it's now, let's say tiny traction of our market cap and therefore essentially is not relevant. At the same time, while I've noted one of the company maybe a couple have continued in prioritizing this. I'm not yet at that point willing to consider that. It's not that, it's off the table because I think it would be something which would be useful to do. But at the same time, I think at this current time there's other better uses of our cash and also I'm not willing to leverage to enable that to occur. So essentially, we are aware of it. We continue to work at our plans. I can see us potentially picking off one or two and do partial initiation either within a plant or in a total of a plan but you shouldn't expect to see that liability extend. We wish to not to pay the premiums to insurance companies to enable that at this point in time. I think that may come over the next say three to five years at some point but not yet. And the assumption we have for next year is that the cash contributions will be a little bit higher than this year but at this point not material. Thank you. Hey, David. So both for the GTF advantage engine upgrade and for the LEAP 1B upgrades. Those have been something that we've been working on for several years now. And the -- and if anything let's say a little bit later into production than originally envisaged although that is pushed back and timing have not been a result of Howmet not being ready. So we're in good shape. I commented in the past that increased performance in the high-pressure turbine leads to increased complexity and with that is value. And we certainly have been intimate with the engine manufacturers to improve the performance as the engine temperatures have seemed to be higher than originally envisaged and therefore to help improve timeline wing. I feel there's though specific timing for both what was really called -- now that has a different code name for GE. And I think for the advantage for Pratt & Whitney you're best asking them for pipeline disclosure rather than myself because we have an agreed plan but that can and has been varied according to the specific needs of those engine manufacturers at this point in time? Thank you. It's far better David. I'm going to comment on the working capital first, and then let Ken amplify and then Ken can totally deal with the pension side. And the reason why, I want to talk about the working capital because it's also tied up with the specific operations and status of they have met different business units are. So first of all, in terms of working capital I mean AR or account receivable and accounts payable they just move on the days assumption. So, if revenue goes up David, as it has then clearly, we have more dollars tied up in receivables than we had but that's a good answer, because it's whatever day it is and I don't know, if we've ever disclosed it we can back engineer it. But our days are pretty constant. And so because revenue went up a few more dollars went on, but the days in receivables exactly the same payment payables. The big wildcard on what gap is always inventory. And so far inventory is still elevated more elevated than I would like but just because our flight [ph] hasn't been taken up where it should be at this point in time. So it moves with the, I will say status within each business of where we are operationally and in terms of start from let's say, volume recovery. So if you take our Wheels segment, which was the first division to show volume increase manning and then moving through towards stability and now smoothness of production. Our days of inventory are in really good shape. And indeed, I believe we're at close to low-class level. If I look at our engine business, which is our second division out of the gate in terms of building of revenue, increasing manning and that's continuing to increase. We have gradually been smoothing out production albeit, we're not in the same level yet, as we are in Wheels. And so what we see is gradual improvements in efficiency of our inventory holding days is on hand. And I think that will continuing to improve again in the fourth quarter and into next year. So I'm pleased, with the trajectory but we're not yet at where we need to be on our engine business. In terms of fasteners and structures those are very different points. Fasteners has been later in the cycle in terms of volume pickup. As you know, we've been recruiting this year building it up. And you've seen first of all the margin begin to respond to that and also mix and production efficiency. And also you've seen a little bit of a calming of recruitment, in that business in the last few months ultimate still in that we say recruitment mode and replacement mode for employees, but trying to improve efficiency. Where the moment the date on hand is well out of order in terms of, where it needs to be and is not yet improving at all, but we'll begin to improve I believe as we go through 2024. In the case of Structures, that's probably our worst business in terms of days on hand. And if you remember last quarter, wasn't particularly a great quarter in terms of the throughput of the business. And so, I elaborate -- business not to focus on inventory, but just to use inventory as the buffer to help stabilize the manufacturing operations, and therefore, improve the margin, which is what you saw occur in the 300 basis points improvement in the structures business. At this point, I don't think it goes anywhere at all in the fourth quarter. And that's a combination of still needs to stabilize its operations. But also at the moment I see customers laying in additional demand particularly laying in additional urgent demand on the titanium side. I'm not yet prepared to add heads, nor working capital in inventory, nor input materials until I'm satisfied with the economics to pay those premium costs. And so if anything I'm going to hold back on that because I've got better places to deploy capital, which is what I told you last quarter and generally in the business of analysts is that I'm very disciplined on where we allocate capital. And so at the moment, I'm not trying to drive working capital particularly in that business, but that will come next year as that business begins to smooth out and improve its production and gain more responsiveness in terms of I'll say people paying for the premiums or if they want the demand and drop in then they pay for it. Otherwise they don't get it. It's that simple. So that deals with working capital be it can't preemptively, David and I'll pass to Ken. Hi, Scott. Okay. I don't think we've given the third quarter detail on the commercial side. I think that would be in our 10-Q later when we file it, whilst I'd say that it's in good order and in line with what we previously said both for the quarter for the year. And I stand behind my comments regarding 2024 we made them on the last call. 787 at the moment we're a little bit below rate and fully expecting that to move up to grade seven next year. And as I've commented before we see very strong underlying demand for that aircraft. And I can see the need to go above rate seven as well. It's only a question of when. Well, I think, it's a bit premature to get back there because I mean the conditions there and the wide-body market in particular is quite different to what they are now. So basically in the first quarter, which is probably a low points in base margins reflected essentially a total metallic build of aircraft and you can call it zero in terms of any real volume on the composite side. So that's one factor. Of course that's begun to change. The business itself has also begun to improve. And I see very much improved signs of operating efficiency improvements, but with a ways to go. I see additional discipline in the business commercially and there's still a ways to go. And going forward into next year what I see is a volume increase for commercial aircraft production also fractional improvement in mix because of the wide-body going to next year in particular in your assumptions on what the final wide-body production will be in composite aircraft essentially on wide-body transitioning from metal to composite aircraft through the course of the year. Hopefully with some delivery of 777X parts as well which has got a composite wing. And so I'll say general improvement in conditions for the business, but still with a big thrust on improving its productivity and throughput efficiency which needs to occur. So, basically, some ways to go yes optimism will continue good trend over the last couple of quarters but too soon to call out any specifics on it. And I don't think we have a guide by segment anyway. But I haven't guided or have that margin for next year just given you like the revenue increases. So that gives you a picture of our business. Thank you. Hey Ron. Well essentially the play on forged wheels for aluminum is that you start off with what's the big picture in terms of truck and trailer production essentially in North America and Europe, albeit we do play in some of the Asian markets so it's a significant share position as well. And then you factor in basically some -- so whatever percentage change that is in a new factor in as a positive against what I think will be a worse macro position next year. There'll be some penetration achieved against steel wheels particularly as fuel efficiency requirements that step up, a fractional contribution but nothing in a great node in terms of adoption of different I'll say powertrain hinting out there is move towards electrification or whatever but no big moves next year but that's a positive venture as well. And the manufactural share improvement on top of that. So, basically we see secular growth in the segment offsetting some macro decline in the assumed markets and that's why I guided as commented an idea about high single-digit reduction for the business is our assumption trying to be fairly cautious at this point in time until we've got a better read on what's the general economy going to do although I did see freight rates begin to stabilize and improve recently. So, there's a lot of factors yet to bring to bear in terms of what the final outlook for next year is I want to take a fairly cautious assumption. This year I don't really commented -- a more difficult second half as it is we've still been able to burn off backlog. And let's say even despite today we have -- is it Mac truck which is subject to the UAW strike. Our arrears are such that that's not going to affect us in the fourth quarter. And our assumption is that by Q1 next year by another couple of months at UAW dispute the Mac truck will be resolved and therefore they'll be back. So that's about it really. It's been pretty strong this year. I give you the general is into next year. Yes. I'll start off with having to separate two issues I think on the GTF, because I think while it gets all and mashed together, I see them as quite separate and then the catalysts intertwining for convenience. So this contamination issue clearly that requires inspection that might take, I don't know, so many days, let's call it, 20, 30, 40 days or an off wing to achieve that inspection. And then, I guess longer if those risks turn out they required to be replaced or not. And I guess it is a small fraction of those that will require to be replaced. That's one item or separate item. Over, let's say, previously incentive field but I'll call it, left field there is the discussion about the time on wing issues that have been publicized by everybody regarding the GTF we're particularly in harsh climate countries or pollution countries the time working is a fraction of the predecessor engine and also what we originally thought for the GTF. So, the question then becomes for the problems around the combustor the filling of holes the higher temperature and then those temperatures and pollutants hitting the two blades in the high-pressure turbine those clearly require replacement. And the question is, what is the replacement interval for them? And so that stands alone as an issue. Pratt & Whitney will determine what frequency they want to replace those blades, again, more of a question for perhaps than for myself. We're able to stand behind them and supply what needs to be supplied within degrees. The question is, what's the requirement? Then, of course, you can intertwine them together. So maybe where those engines are off wing for the powder metal contamination issue maybe the opportunity will be taken to replace some of those high-pressure turbine laser and other components on the engine or maybe it won't. That's a practice issue. And the question I have in my mind is, do they go for full replacements for them as they really look at inspect and take the engines off the wing for the first time or do they stick them back on just because the lines will want the engines back on wing and only seek to replace those in harsh climates at that time. And so maybe that's the more of the while I read from MTU of the 300 days turnaround time. So I just don't know Ron, but it will finally turn out to be, because it's a choice by ratio [ph] or Pratt & Whitney to determine to what extent do they make improvements for the time on wing issue including the high-pressure turbine parts as they take those into serve. So why it's written about us almost one issue of power of metal, I think there are two distinct issues which may come together but just depending upon the pressure to get those engines back on wing and we are still in discussions with Pratt & Whitney regarding all of that. And they determined how many of our parts go to OE production and how many go to the spares market. And that's up to them and the aircraft manufacturers to decide that. Thank you. I mean, I think Boeing in particular I have had firm plans throughout the year, it's been the realization of those plants, which has been more of the issues. And I guess it's from a combination of reasons, there's always going to be somewhere in the supply chain amongst all the parts of difficulties. There's always going to be the degree of experience in Boeing on plants with all of the change of people in and out or out and in regarding post-COVID. And then of course, we read in the press about the difficulties of, I'd say was it strike at Spirit Aerospace and then some other production issues of some failed parts and holes and all the rest of it. And yet there seems to have been some management change there, which may proved to be positive because that's a TBD. And hopefully, I guess, you listen carefully to the commentary from Spirit yesterday. We're optimistic that those fuselage and other component problems to get resolved it's not sitting in our control. But should those begin to improve, I think, that's a major step forward in Boeing realizing its own plans for production rate increases and also getting behind it the retrofit of those sales, which were subject to pass those only or holes billed too big and bigger fasteners. So I think they're hoping Herculean efforts to try to achieve all of that. But as you know circulate events by themselves don't sort of produce the output, and we've still got to see that improve. So, hopefully, during October, November, December, we'll begin to see rate pick up, it's spirit other suppliers and then obviously, boring itself to get to their required or stated rate four to next year. In terms of then on the engine side, you've read commentary or I think anyone, I've seen was the GE commentary instead of let's say 1,700 engine 1,600 engines, isn't really impactful for us at this point in time? Because for us it's just us meeting their rate requirements and then there's a choice as I said rather than the previous question, what goes to OE compared to what goes to search requirements. We're dealing with very robust demand on both sides. We see that demand increasing again next year plus some blended in changes potentially for the technology change yet to come. Thank you. Hi Sheila. Well, I am completely leaning today announce it is two-parts, three-parts so yeah sure. Go for it. Generally forgings and castings have been a bit of a whipping below for a couple of years. With commentary I think maybe even before, it was any basis for it albeit, subsequently I think there has been a basis for a commentary where to replace the skill levels to produce some of these in particular the casting is really at a very high order. So the trade the recruitment and then trading lines to produce effective production workers in some of this certainly strain. I think all of the companies in that regard including Howmet. We did choose to start recruitment a bit earlier. And I know that I've cost the company probably 20 basis points of margin by being slightly ahead of the curve -- recruitment. But at the same time I think has paid dividends for us and the fact that we've been in a vision to produce generally on time, at rate and generally good quality. So I think it's been a good trade-off for us. I want to correct you on the structural casting side we're probably the number two in the market behind precision cast parts, but they are still, the big dog on the block in terms of production of structural castings. We do produce them and we're at a good rate for let's say, 98% of all of our structural castings. I mean early on we had a few moments things like fairings and is like shelling pieces and coming off at good rates and no cost [Ph] or whatsoever. And so should there be increased demand for structural castings obviously where we tool and if not the availabilities that to us for the next few years should engine manufacturers want to is that we're in a position to supply because we still have some available capacity and indeed are willing to invest commensurate with it being a good return of capital. And generally I've been quite positive about investing in our engine business and contrasting that to -- the our structures business is based upon returns. So it's one way of saying we're in a good state, restructure casting we are the significant supply to the industry on turbine blades. And I hope that gives you enough nuggets. Pricing has been positive for us. And I think it reflects the value that we bring. When I look at some of the requirements for the increased temperature performance in the, let's say, narrow-body engines. We are bringing to bear some of the not all, but some of the technologies that we've deployed for the F-35 engine in terms of ability to manage both pressure thermal performance in the high-pressure turbine. And we're able to produce parts. We obviously work with the customers to engine into specification. But if they're specified at 2,500 degrees and operate higher we can take it higher because as you know for the F-35 we're up at 3,500 degrees and indeed the only company that well that can provide the turbine parts with that performance in that environment. We've already commented previously that we are working on the improvements for the currently 2028 upgrade to that engine to improve its thrust and time and air. And so again, we are able to take the temperature performance of those parts and elevate it further. And we've talked a little bit, but only a little bit in our Technology Day about some of the technologies that we'd be able to deploy for that. And so we're in a position to bring a degree of performance and capability at scale, which I think needs to reflect in value because in truth the turbine blade is a pretty small part of the value of the engine and to achieve the requirements for let's say lower carbon footprint continually taking up the pressure inside the engine to improve the optimization that you have fuel and therefore its burn characteristics for lower dilution and the whole say fuel efficiencies and carbon footprint presents great value to the industry. Thank you. Yes. I mean, we were able to step up the last quarter to 19% operating profit and 23% EBITDA rate. I don't have any commentary regarding margin rates for next year. What I still see at the moment is potentially, I don't know this, but potentially a few more months of choppy production particularly on the free manufacturing side, it's just an assumption. Maybe we get lucky towards the second half of next year or the back end of next year and we see things get smooth out, we have seen some things begin to move in our favor and smooth that as I commented on the inventory side, we also think about our engine business. But in terms of -- at what point do we reach what I previously have referred to the state of Grace where things move out margins become stable and better and cash just use that as the industry and hopefully out of Howmet. I've always said that's a year away and I still think you see year away could be the back end of '24, but more likely getting to '25 and that hopefully combines with if the '25 external debuts of what the aircraft production will be including its wide-body mix then that begins to get I'd say into a good state. So, I have generally medium to long-term optimism and feel we are in a really great place with great backlog and good things to come, albeit still having to face up to shorter-term challenges of all the things we've talked about in terms of broad rate changes and the assumptions change in many parts of the market, in particular the commercial aerospace part of the market. I think it's a better best I can give. Thank you, very much."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Let's move to Slide 5. All markets continue to be healthy with revenue in the third quarter, up 16% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. As expected sequential revenue growth was impacted by normal third quarter seasonality. Commercial aerospace increased 23% year-over-year, driven by all three aerospace segments. Commercial Aerospace has grown for 10 consecutive quarters and stands at 49% of total revenue. Commercial Aerospace growth continues to be robust supported by demand for new more fuel-efficient aircraft as well as increased spares demand. Defense Aerospace was up 13% year-over-year driven by the F-35 and Legacy Fighter programs. Commercial Transportation which impacts both forged wheels in the Fastening Systems segment was up 7% year-over-year driven by higher volumes. Commercial Transportation remains resilient, despite normal seasonality. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 10% year-over-year driven by oil and gas up 29%, General Industrial up 8% and IGT up 4%, in summary, another very strong quarter across all of our end markets. Now let's move to Slide 6, for more details on the third quarter results. Starting with the P&L and enhanced profitability revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share all exceeded the high-end of guidance. Revenue was $1.658 billion up 16% year-over-year. EBITDA was $382 million up 18% year-over-year, while absorbing near-term costs associated with net headcount conditions of approximately 645 employees. The Engine segment drove a majority of the increase by adding approximately 500 employees. Year-to-date net debt count additions are just over 1500 employees. We continue to increase headcount for the expected revenue ramp. EBITDA margin was strong at 23%, despite absorbing the headcount additions. Adjusting for year-over-year inflationary cost pass-through of approximately $15 million EBITDA margin was 23.3% in the flow-through of segment incremental revenue to EBITDA was at approximately 28% year-over-year which is right in line with our guidance. Earnings per share, was strong at $0.46 per share, up 28% year-over-year. The third quarter reason represents the ninth consecutive quarter with growth in revenue EBITDA and earnings per share. Next is the balance sheet. The balance sheet continues to strengthen, while returning cash to key stakeholders. The ending cash balance was $425 million after generating $132 million of free cash flow. In the quarter, $242 million of cash on hand was allocated to debt reduction, common stock repurchases and dividends. Net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low, of 2.3 times. All bond debt is unsecured and at fixed rates which will provide stability of interest rate expense in the future. Our next bond maturity of $705 million is due in October of 2024. Howmet's improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were reflected in Fitch's August credit upgrade from BBB- to BBB, two notches into investment grade. Moreover Moody's upgraded Howmet's outlook from stable to positive in September. The balance sheet continues to strengthen and is recognized with the rating agency upgrades. Finally, moving to capital allocation, we continue to be balanced in our approach. In the quarter capital expenditures were $59 million which continues to be less than depreciation and amortization. In the third quarter we reduced debt by another $200 million. Year-to-date, we have reduced debt by approximately $376 million, which will lower annualized interest expense by approximately $19 million. We also repurchased $25 million of common stock in the third quarter at an average price of $49.32 per share. This was the 10th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. Share buyback authority from the Board stands at $797 million. Since separation in 2020, we have repurchased more than $1 billion of common stock. We exited the third quarter with a diluted share count of 414 million shares. Finally, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the third quarter, the quarterly stock dividend was $0.04 per share. The quarterly stock dividend will be increased by 25% in the fourth quarter to $0.05 per share. Now let's move to slide 7 to go through the segment results for the third quarter. The Engine Products segment continued its strong performance. Revenue was $798 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Commercial aerospace was up 15% and Defense Aerospace is up 33% with both markets driven by higher build rates and spares growth. Oil and gas was up 33% and IGP was up 4% as demand continues to be strong. As expected, Q3 sequential revenue was down 3% driven by seasonal vacations. EBITDA increased 18% year-over-year to $219 million. The EBITDA margin increased 20 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially to 27.4%, while absorbing approximately 500 net new employees. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of the engines team. Now let's move to slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue increased 20%. Commercial aerospace was up 34%, including the impact of the emerging wide-body recovery. Commercial Transportation was up 6%. General Industrial was up 7% and Defense Aerospace was down 5%. Year-over-year segment EBITDA increased 19% EBITDA margin was 21.8% and is improved 320 basis points over the last two quarters. Please move to slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was up 18% with commercial aerospace up 33%, driven by build rates and approximately $30 million of Russian titanium share gain. Defense Aerospace was down 20% year-over-year. Sequentially, Engineered Structures improved production rates and revenue was up 14%, which was in line with our expectation of 10% to 15%. Segment EBITDA increased 7% year-over-year. Sequentially EBITDA margin improved 320 basis points to 13.2% despite absorbing approximately 145 net new employees in the third quarter. Q3 was good recovery by the structures team and we continue to expect further improvement in margins. Let's move to slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue increased 7%. The $19 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by a 13% increase in volume, partially offset by lower aluminum prices. Segment EBITDA increased 20% year-over-year driven by the higher volumes. EBITDA margin increased 290 basis points primarily due to the impact of higher volumes and lower aluminum prices. Finally, let's move to slide 11. Our balance sheet continues to be a source of strength with healthy cash flow supporting a $200 million debt reduction in Q3. The $1.25 billion October 2024 debt tower was inherited from Alcoa Inc. and has been reduced to $705 million with cash on hand. Since the separation in 2020, we have paid down gross debt by approximately $2.15 billion with cash on hand and have lowered annualized interest costs by more than $120 million. Gross debt now stands at $3.8 billion. All long-term debt continues to be unsecured and at fixed rates. We will continue to focus on improving our capital structure and liquidity. Lastly, before turning it back to John, let me highlight one item. In the appendix slide 18 covers our operational tax rate which was approximately 22.8% year-to-date. The midpoint of our guidance represents a 500 basis point improvement in the operational tax rate since the separation in 2020. Strong performance by the tax [Indiscernible] and we continue to be focused on further improvements in our operational tax rate. Now, let me turn it back to John for the outlook and summary. Yeah. Thanks David. So as John articulated their days are really the key on working capital. And then also depending on where we are in the cycle -- business segment. So as we exit this year, I think we've given everybody the walk in the assumptions tab of the deck to kind of walk through it. But that would indicate a working capital burn this year roughly about $190 million plus or minus. And it's really driven by -- we've increased the revenue guide once again so you have more AR that goes with that plus we're keeping inventory in the business to make sure that we're not the bottleneck for our customers, delivering on time in full at the right spec is really important for us. So we've got a little bit more inventory. Next year we've got another growth projection here. So I anticipate there'll be working capital burn again next year in 2024, probably be better than this year as we work down inventory in the business but it's again going to be dependent on where we are in the cycle. So I believe it's in really good order here driven by the growth of the business. On the pension expense side, as John mentioned I'll start at the top of the house. We've taken gross liabilities down by 45% since separation. That's a pretty big decline. Big significant part of that is the actions that we've taken to reduce gross liabilities. So as we get a bit of a help from the increase in discount rates but there's a lot of action around that gross liability. John mentioned cash, it will be up next year. We remeasure it at the end of the year. So that's pretty much of a volatile line. So we'll give you more guidance on the next call in terms of what the cash contributions would be. The expense side -- that's a little bit more visible right now. Again we strike it at the end of the year. If you look at our pension and OPEB expense right now it's $35 million on an annual basis. So next year based on asset returns, the market has been a little tougher. I'd say probably another $15 million plus or minus $5 million on either side of that. It's really not material. But I think that's all in good order as well."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Luther, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Kate. Good morning and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace second quarter 2023 results conference call. I\u2019m joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today\u2019s presentation and earnings press release, and in our most recent SEC filings. In today\u2019s presentation, references to EBITDA and EPS mean adjusted EBITDA excluding special items and adjusted EPS excluding special items. These measures are among the non-GAAP financial measures that we\u2019ve included in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the appendix in today\u2019s presentation. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, PT, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for Howmet. Revenues were up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, albeit, Q2 is traditionally a stronger quarter seasonally than Q1 due to more effective production and sales days. Commercial aerospace increased by 23% year-over-year and continues to be the highlight of the quarter and reflects some of the scheduled increases for the anticipated Boeing 737 build rates, which are slated to increase very soon. Defense sales were also strong at plus 17%. EBITDA was up 16% year-over-year and up sequentially. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 per share and exceeded the high end of guidance. This was an increase of 26% year-over-year. The cash balance was a healthy $536 million, and free cash flow was strong at $188 million, which started at consecutive quarters of cash generation. $100 million of cash flow was used to buy back shares at an average price of $45 per share. Net debt to EBITDA further improved to 2.5 times leverage and all bond debt is at a fixed rate, which provide predictable interest rate expenses into the future. Howmet has negligible exposure to floating interest rates. Regarding our revolver, we amended and extended our $1 billion undrawn credit facility to 2028, while realizing lower fees and a more favorable net debt to EBITDA covenant. Lastly, another notable item was the commercial settlement of Lehman claim, $40 million, which is $25 million less than previously reserved, with a cash settlement we paid in July 2023 and a further settlement in July 2024. This litigation was the most significant of all residual claims for Howmet, namely RemainCo, and dates back to 2008. Before turning it over to Ken, I want to cover three additional items. Firstly, in Q2, Howmet was impacted by approximately 5 days of production stoppage at our Wheels [ph] plant in Hungary due to a 9-day strike at Arconic Corporation, which is now resolved. The interruption of suppliers of aluminum billet had an unfavorable effect of about $5 million to profitability for which a claim has been lodged with Arconic under the terms of the supply agreement, and we expect to gain resolution shortly. Additionally, Howmet is assessing its significant reliance upon this source of supply. Secondly, while segment commentaries including the finance portion of our call, let me address structures. The margin rate fell back for the first time in several quarters. The profit miss was essentially the result of adding costs or production rate increases, which we did not achieve. The cost of additional people, furnace preparation and other rolling mill facilities preparation were unrecovered due to the production rate increases not being achieved. The main issue was bottlenecks in production at one plant. The backlog did increase since it was not a demand issue. Naturally, our plan is to achieve production rate increases and burn down the increased backlog as we move into the second half. This reduced production combined with F-35 bulk and inventory burn down was also not helpful. But it was, in aggregate, not material in the context of the Howmet overall results, which were again up, as I commented earlier. Finally, the Paris Airshow was held in June with the largest significant orders ever at an airshow for commercial aircraft, which adds to the backlog of orders fulfilled -- to be fulfilled once production rates are able to be further increased. The show was very successful for Howmet with a combination of production meetings with both customers and investors all reflecting the huge optimism for both the industry generally and for Howmet, in particular. I'll now turn the call over to Ken, who will provide further market and segment commentary.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Let's move to Slide 5. All markets continue to be healthy with revenue in the quarter up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Commercial aerospace continued to lead the growth with an increase of 23% year-over-year, driven by all 3 aerospace segments. Commercial aerospace has grown for 9 consecutive quarters and stands at 47% of total revenue. Commercial aerospace portion of total revenue is expected to increase due to the developing widebody recovery, strong backlog of commercial aircraft orders and spares growth. Spares for commercial aerospace continued to increase sequentially and are now trending to be approximately 95% of 2019 levels at year-end. Defense aerospace was up 17% year-over-year, driven by the F-35 in legacy fighter programs. Sequentially, defense aerospace was up 4% year-over-year, driven by engine products. Commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segments, was up 8% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially driven by higher volumes. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 20% year-over-year, driven by oil and gas, up 36%; IGT, up 20%; and general industrial, up 11%. Sequentially, these markets were up 4% with general industrial up 9%; oil and gas up 4%; and IGT flat. In summary, another very strong quarter across all of our end markets. Now let's move to Slide 6. Starting with the P&L and enhanced profitability, revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share, all exceeded the high end of the guidance in the second quarter. Revenue was $1.65 billion, up 18% year-over-year. EBITDA was $368 million, up 16% year-over-year, including net head count additions in Q2 of approximately 380 employees, which builds on additions made in Q1. Year-to-date, net head count additions are approximately 865, which are in line with our targets. EBITDA margin was 22.3%. Adjusting for the year-over-year inflationary cost pass-through of approximately $25 million. EBITDA margin was 22.7% and the flow-through of incremental revenue to EBITDA was approximately 22%, while absorbing near-term recruiting, training and production costs. Earnings per share was $0.44 which was up 26% year-over-year. The second quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of growth in revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share. Moving to the balance sheet. The ending cash balance was healthy at $536 million after generating $188 million of free cash flow which was our best Q2 of free cash flow generation. We continue to expect strong positive free cash flow in the second half of 2023. $118 million of free cash flow generation was allocated to common stock repurchases and dividends. Net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 2.5 times, while bond debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of interest rate expense into the future. Our next bond maturity is in October of 2024. Finally, we amended our $1 billion revolver through 2028, while realizing lower fees and a more favorable financial covenant. The revolver remains undrawn. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. In the quarter, capital expenditures were $41 million with a focus on automation. Capital installed prior to COVID-19 puts us in a good position to support continued commercial aerospace recovery. In the second quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock at an average price of $44.52 per share, retiring approximately 2.2 million shares. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. Share buyback authority from the Board of Directors stands at approximately $822 million. Since separation in 2020, we have repurchased more than $1 billion of common stock. We continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the second quarter, the quarterly stock dividend was $0.04 per share after it was doubled in the fourth quarter of last year. Finally, we issued a note to redeem $200 million of our 2024 debt tower with cash on hand. The redemption is expected to be complete at the end of September and will lower our annualized interest cost by approximately $10 million. As you will recall, we repurchased approximately $176 million of bonds last quarter, which will lower annualized interest costs by an additional $9 million. Therefore, year-to-date, bond repurchases are expected to decrease annualized interest costs by approximately $19 million. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the second quarter. Engine Products continued its strong performance since the second quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in revenue and EBITDA. Revenue was $821 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Commercial aerospace was up 23%, Defense/aerospace was up 41%, and both markets were driven by higher build rates and spares growth. IGT was up 20%, and oil and gas was up 36%, as demand continues to be strong. EBITDA increased 25% year-over-year to a record for the segment of $223 million. EBITDA margin was 27.2%, despite the addition of approximately 350 net new employees year-to-date and approximately 90 net additions in Q2. Across all of the aerospace segments, net headcount additions are needed for the continued revenue ramp, but do carry near-term recruiting, training and production costs. Finally, in the second quarter, the Engine's team finalized a new five-year collective bargaining agreement in our Whitehall, Michigan facility. Let's move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue increased 19%. Commercial aerospace was 19% higher as the widebody recovery starts to take effect. Defense aerospace was up 24%, commercial aerospace was up 17% and general industrial was up 16%. Year-over-year segment EBITDA increased 14% as volume increases were partially offset by the addition of 430 net new employees year-to-date and approximately 215 net additions in Q2. Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was up 8% with commercial aerospace up 31%, driven by higher build rates in approximately $25 million of Russian titanium share gain. Defense aerospace was down 33% year-over-year, driven by customer inventory corrections. Segment EBITDA decreased 23% year-over-year, while margins declined 410 basis points. The lower EBITDA was driven by higher costs associated with additional headcount as well as operational costs for planned production rate increases, which were unrecovered due to production bottlenecks in one plant. Net head count additions in the quarter were approximately 50 employees. Finally, in the third quarter, the Structures' team finalized a new four-year collective bargaining agreement at our Niles, Ohio facility, which was ahead of schedule. Now let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels revenue year-over-year increased 7%. The $19 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by a 6% increase in volume. Segment EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year, despite the interruption of raw material for our Wheels plant in Hungary due to a nine-day strike at our Arconic Corporation supplier, which has now been resolved. Margin increased 30 basis points due to the impact of lower aluminum prices and inflationary cost pass-through. Finally, let's move to Slide 11. We continue to be focused on improving our capital structure and liquidity. In July, we issued a notice to redeem $200 million of our 2024 debt tower with cash on hand, which is expected to be completed by the end of September. The October 2024 debt tower would be approximately $705 million after the redemption. Since the separation in 2020, including the redemption just announced in July, we will have paid down approximately $2.15 billion of debt with cash on hand and lowered our annualized interest costs by more than $120 million. Gross debt is expected to be less than $3.8 billion after the redemption in September, while long-term debt continues to be unsecured in it fixed rates. Finally, we amended our $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility through 2028. The amendment provides lower fees and more favorable covenants. Details can be found in the 10-Q, which is expected to be filed later today. The revolver remains undrawn. Lastly, before turning it back to John, let me highlight one item in the appendix on slide 18. It covers our operational tax rate, which was approximately 22.6% for the quarter. The second quarter rate represents approximately a 500 basis point improvement in the operational tax rate since the separation in 2020. Now, let me turn it back to John for the outlook and summary.\nJohn Plant: Thanks Ken and let's move to slide number 12. The outlook for Howmet continues to be very strong and supported, in particular, by the extraordinary backlog of commercial aircraft orders at both Boeing and Airbus. Demand increases have moved further to the right, constrained by current aircraft production, would all go well for revenue increases to come in 2024, 2025, and beyond. This growth in absolute aircraft quantity is further enhanced by the increased sophistication of engine technology upgrades being brought to market by both GE and Pratt & Whitney to the narrow-body markets. These turbine improvements address fuel efficiency and time on wing issues, which enhance the value of Howmet's differentiated products. This combines well with the upcoming improvement in widebody production, which increasingly features composite technology, which again increases the value of how much differentiated products of titanium structures and fasteners. Wide-body aircraft also feature improved aerospace engine content for the company. Defense markets continue to be robust, and we envisage increased revenue going into 2024 as the destocking for bulkheads is completed and engine spares continue to increase significantly as shop visits increase. The F-35 backlog continues to increase to approximately 420 aircraft with recent orders of 126 aircraft for the US government joint Kroger office, plus 25% for Israel, and a further 25 aircraft for the Czech Republic. Industrial revenue continues to grow for both IGT and oil and gas, in particular. The outlook for Wheels is also healthy for the current quarter. And in Q3, underlying demand continues to be strong, albeit Q3 is notably the weakest quarter for revenue due to European vacations, which are also a feature of our aerospace plants in Europe in both France, Germany, and Hungary, in particular. This seasonal effect -- the seasonal offset it seemed to be approximately $50 million of revenue between Q2 and Q3. My final markets comment is regarding spares, where we see spares of commercial aircraft closing in on 95% of the 2019 levels by year-end and approximately 130% of the defense and IGT market at 2019 levels. This puts aggregate spares for this year in excess of 2019 levels with higher rates to come as we see the rates increasing as we close out the year. The cautious stance has been taken relative to Q4 until the demand is more clear for commercial trucks in the quarter and aircraft parts for the first half of 2024. While the backlog is there, we find difficulty in planning for rate increases and the inventory impact, if that's not achieved. Specifically, we are raising guidance once again for the year by another significant step. To give you an example of guidance assumptions, we have lifted our 737 MAX assumption from 30 per month and nudged it into the 30s, but not anywhere near the rate 38 for the second half. This number is intentionally given the -- all the moving parts of the business and also the lack of clarity over very soon. And when we plan for the second half, we are increasing people recruitment further, but at a reduced rate in the first half as we hope to use the productivity improvements to come. Regarding Q3, revenue is expected to be $1.9 billion, plus or minus $10 million; EBITDA, $360 million, plus or minus $5 million; earnings per share of $0.42 plus or minus $0.01. Regarding the year, revenues increased from $6.25 billion to $6.44 billion, a significant increase. And let's say, plus or minus $30 million, $40 million around that range. And then EBITDA has increased to $1.45 billion, plus or minus $10 million. Earnings per share is increased to $1.70, plus or minus $0.01, and free cash flow is held at $635 million, having absorbed the settlement for the Lehman Brothers claim. In conclusion to my outlook commentary, we're pleased to demonstrate both excellent Q2 achievements, supplemented by further optimistic outlooks with very solid increases to come in the future. Let's move to the summary on slide 13. Q2 was another strong quarter for Howmet. Revenue was up 18%, EBITDA 16% and earnings per share 26%. And EBITDA margin for material pass-through was strong at 22.7% and servicing continues to be heading in a healthy direction. Liquidity is healthy with very positive free cash flow with more to come in the second half, and we've continued to deploy that cash both to share repurchase in the second quarter. And as you can see, we've turned to debt repayment in the third quarter. Guidance has been increased and we expect year-over-year improvement in annual revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share as stated. Also, we expect very positive free cash flow generation in the third and fourth quarters. Regarding debt, what we mentioned the $200 million. And as we complete that with the EBITDA improvements, then we'll be improving our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage from the two and half times record that we talked about in Q2, and we'll see improvements in Q3 and Q4 and heading towards two times levered by the end of the year. And then finally, we expect to increase the quarterly common dividend by 25% from $0.04 a share to $0.05 a share in the fourth quarter of 2023. Thank you all very much. Let's move across to question-and-answer.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning guys, and thank you. John, maybe first one for you here. Just on the incrementals as we go forward, obviously, 22% in the quarter, given structures after 25% in Q1. And you commented last quarter about how difficult it is to convert at a 30%-plus rate, just given where aerospace build rates are and you'll be climbing through at least the middle of the decade here. How do you think about when you put cost into the system, when it converts into higher profitability? Do you have to wait to build rates peak for that to convert to a higher operating profit than revenue?\nJohn Plant: Okay. Thank you, Sheila. First of all, we don't have to wait, but the extraordinary levels of recruitment during the last couple of years have certainly weighed upon us. And probably of all the things that we've been doing, driving labor productivity has been amongst the most difficult. And it's certainly been more difficult than what we believe we've overcome by way of scrap and yield and also driving through on the volume. If you look at our midpoint of guidance, we believe we're going to raise the incremental to about 28% in Q3. And we are hopeful at about 34% in Q4. And that takes account of what we believe to be hopefully, a slowing of recruitment and an improved retention ratios and as the denominators got bigger of the employees we've taken on. And so, we're optimistic that the incremental drop-through begins to improve and then hopefully improve again in '24 with the combined volume, the pull-through from the automation programs, the -- I'd say, the bigger denominator of recently recruited employees and the mix effective widebody. So, it's a future statement. We're hopeful we're optimistic. We're planning for it, but I'll be very disappointed if we had to wait until we had stability for improvements in that drop-through.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you for the color. Just a follow-up. In terms of the structures margins in the quarter, how do we think about that bumping up in the second half? How quickly does it improve?\nJohn Plant: So, I mean -- -- when I think about Howmet is more like a relentless machine. I was trying to bring color to my commentary. So the last time I tried to wet paper tissue and that didn\u2019t work so well, as you know. But at this time, I think itself fairly relentless machine rolling forward and delivering results. We're not that flash bang and full of jumping noise like Chinese firecrackers. But within Q2, there is one thing we overcame, which I'm proud in the way we overcame it, which is the consequences of the strike in one of our suppliers of aluminum billet, that nine-day stoppage costs us heavy and yet we marked straight through and delivered really solid margins in our wheels business. So, I think that has really great performance by Howmet in that regard. Conversely, when I think of structures, we took a much bigger hit than the strike in the margin rate and the lack of achievement of the volume. And so I put that more in the, let's say, almost like a $10 million complete face plans by the business. And I just think myself, if you want to use the play on the taglines, I think, Howmet planted in our structures business. And I'm not proud of what we really didn't achieve there. We thought we'd prepped well. We thought we'd begun to put labor in place. We thought we'd got the, I'll say, improvements made to improve throughput in our furnaces and then rolling mills and basically completely bottlenecked in one area, and it didn't work well. So -- but despite all of that, so let's call it, if you want to -- and I never like, like the, excuse me, but a combination of structure space planting and a supplier strike, we out-delivered the guide on EBITDA. And when all said and done any one of those is multiples. So like when we talk about margin rate of 20 basis points difference, that's worth $3 million. We felt like it's hardly worth commenting on. And so it's a bit like me saying, yeah, we did really good apart from that. So I generally choose not to. But I'm trying to be responsive to your question. And I'll say, wheels did great and structures was a big face plant.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: It's like you read my mind. I'm going to go with a relentless march rather than base plan. So thanks for that.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: John, it sound like I cut you off there. Is there something else you wanted to add?\nJohn Plant: Obviously, probably on a role and I was getting carried away. So no, I'm done.\nRobert Stallard: You can carry out how many firecrackers if you want.\nJohn Plant: Yes, I don\u2019t like asking questions so, no, please start over and dish down this.\nRobert Stallard: Okay. Thanks for the update you noted on the 737 MAX rate assumptions. But I was wondering if you made any further changes on either Boeing or Airbus build rates within your guidance? And whether this -- in relation to that, what Airbus said about direct and indirect risk from this latest GTF issue could have any flow through to Howmet? Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Yeah. First of all, no rate assumption changes for elsewhere. I mean, Airbus has been, I'll say, plowing ahead, but struggling to get to their production numbers. But getting close, certainly, the Q2 delivery was much healthier. And so I think things are getting better generally, and I think everybody is believing that we're going to see higher rate increases. And really, it's a question of when trying to get ready for it. We think we've prepped or it. We have built capability and capacity and labor terms. We had, say, machine capacity. But as you know, on 737, originally, it's going to be Jan 1st, then May 1st and July 1st. And we just want to be cautious. That's why I say all we've done is just nudging into the early 30s and see where it goes and be ready, capable of supplying, but not willing to be clear we're not going to put rate 38 until it's achieved.\nRobert Stallard: And just to follow-up, anything to say on the GTF issues?\nJohn Plant: Well, certainly, this powder metal issue that we read about it seems to be historical. I'm sure that we have got a good plan about taking those engines down out of from aircraft wing and looking at them in detail because I think don't work for that sort of level of crack. I think the bigger impact for high Howmet is, I might say, impact, I mean, positive, not because the impact -- the word impact has negative is the time on wing issue, which is present for both current narrowbodies engines of the ETF and the LEAP where -- while each of them, I think, are doing better for that relative point in their life cycle compared to the predecessor engines, I'll say, V2500 and the CFM56 is that they're still well below the exit point of the previous engine. And so that in itself is leading to what we believe will become increased demand for replacement parts. And also, it's combining with what I referred to maybe not in sufficient detail, which was the improvements that we have worked on to help resolve the issues. So the high-pressure turbine blades have been seeing elevated temperatures from, let's say, combustors that don't have sufficient holes left after to block them up and then causing degradation issues. And I'd say another issue particularly in, I'll say, Far East and Middle East climates for LEAP is that we are -- I describe intimate with those improvements. We have worked on them. We are prepping for their introduction and commensurate with our customers' needs. And then we are now assessing how that demand combined with the increased demand for wide-body is moving to the 2024, the increased wide-body is moving to 2024. And so it's all setting up well. In terms of what I think is good demand is clearly where aircraft production increases, less good demand. You could put a if you want to, is where it's a replacement part for a period of time. And then we are rather more cautious on that. And where we need to increase capacity rapidly to achieve that in the, say, coming months into 2024 and maybe into 2025 is that we certainly don't want to take capacity up and then take it back down. And therefore, we're in -- I'll say deep into commercial discussions with our customers to ensure that doesn't happen. So a long way of saying GTF powder metal, no issue for us. Nothing to do with us. And powder metal wing, it's leading to the sort of content improvement growth that we talk about as we make improvements to the -- to those turbine blades and introduce some sophisticated technology as certainly indicated looking at things we've done elsewhere on those engines or the more advanced engines and seeking to deploy that, which is great for the future robustness of the engine. It's fuel efficiency and also good for Howmet.\nRobert Stallard: That's great. Thanks a lot John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, David.\nDavid Strauss: Hey, John. So I just wanted to clarify on the MAX. So while you've upped the guidance from 30 into the 30s, are you actually at 38 a month in terms of what you're shipping the Boeing today?\nJohn Plant: It depends upon the parts. We supply some different parts. But while I recognize that we received schedule rate \u2013 schedules for parts increasing to rate 38 is that my -- I'd say my scenario, which I don't like is where should they not achieve that rate, then that the parts we've supplied, I think because that will be bloated inventories, they will then take them out just in the same way as they would -- parts were taken out September, October, November, December of 2022 is that I'm blending it all together and saying, my average assumption is -- I mean the 30 is, but being deliberately loose about it, but I'm very clear that our guidance is not based upon full rate increase of 38 from the 1st of July. That's not the case. I mean to say that I don't believe that Boeing can do it. I'd love them to do it, but do it and then I'll feel more comfortable about our guidance to -- because I mean our guidance, I tried to describe in the past, tends to be something that you can rely upon. And I want to see aircraft reduced. And then at that point, I feel confident that we're not going to be on the wrong side of inventory takeout during the remaining few months of the year.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. I got it. It sounds like after what you went through in Q4 of last year, you're just erring on the cautious side, I got it.\nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean, Q4 last year was pretty good. The year was really good. And so it's not worrying. It's just -- I'm not putting it all out there. Why would I?\nDavid Strauss: Okay. As a follow-up, can you dig in a little on what's going on at Fasteners? I mean we've seen a pretty good revenue pickup here on the -- within the business on the aero side. I know 787 rates are still low, but kind of the drop through that we've seen there or the lack thereof in terms of the margin drop through in Fasteners?\nJohn Plant: Yes. Well, don't really like using the so-called Chinese partners, but I don't really know where it's Chinese about. But the -- it begins with small steps. Our margin rate did increase in Q2, despite the large ingestation of labor for the balance of the year. It's always a bit of a hostage to fortune, but I'm feeling confident that we're going to see both revenue and margin accretion in the second half beyond Q2. So in that sense, I'm really pleased with the rate and direction of the business, I wouldn't have been able to say that six months ago. And so I'm feeling increasingly confident that, I mean, there's be saying to you publicly, our margin rate is going to increase. So that's pretty good.\nDavid Strauss: I got it. I\u2019ll take the hand. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, John, Ken.\nA \u2013 John Plant: Hi, Pete.\nQ \u2013 Peter Arment: Hi, John. Just within Engineered Structures, the $45 million year-to-date gain on the Russian titanium share, it seems like it's tracking right towards your expectations. So just maybe any of your updated thoughts on that? And how should we think about that as we go into next year? Thanks.\nA \u2013 John Plant: In terms of demand, the previous metric I've given was $20 million for Q4 last year, multiply it by four for 2023 and then add on, I think, 25%. So that took you to around about $100 million mark. And therefore, implicit, if you did $45 million in H1, it's $55 million in H2. Right now, I'm actually feeling a little bit more confident than that. And so instead of about a 25% lift, I can see us potentially getting to a 40% lift. Certainly, I think the demand is there. So it's going to be above $100 million, well above $100 million. And the thing that I've got to see is the structure standing up and making the stuff. And then I think we're going to realize the market share we've -- and the business we've obtained and won commercially. So at the moment, demand and, I'll say, our commercial win position is healthy with that -- trying to repeat myself, we had say, a hiccup in Q2, of which neither the structures team or myself are proud of what we did or what they didn't do.\nQ \u2013 Peter Arment: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nA \u2013 John Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Robert Spingarn of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Robert Spingarn: Hey, good morning.\nA \u2013 John Plant: Hi, Rob.\nQ \u2013 Robert Spingarn: Two follow-up things on what you just discussed. First, on the question of the improvements to GTF and LEAP, how are these affecting or impacting your Shipset content and how do those changes factor into your LTAs? That's the first question. And then just on the titanium. As we move further ahead, you talked about 40% uplift, But as the wide-body rates rise, let's talk about maybe 2025 when Boeing and Airbus are targeting these higher rates, I would imagine even greater uplift. Can you talk about that?\nA \u2013 John Plant: Yeah, I'll do it in reverse order. So you're absolutely correct, as wide-body moves up, then that is highly beneficial for us, both for our Structures business and for our Fastener business, both in terms of the value delivered. And I'm going to say in the case of Fasteners, the value proposition of what's delivered where the -- I'll say the value set is substantially higher just from the additional sophistication of the personal sets that go with combining composite skins and titanium structures. So assuming that Boeing had a from rate 3% to 4% to 4% to 5% and then I think, higher than that in 2024 and assuming they get close to the 10 or maybe by then, we'll be feeling a lot more optimistic because I think fundamental demand is above rate 10. And similarly for the A350, that's going to go up to at least 9 a month, I think, to meet market demand. All that is really healthy for our titanium business. And I'm expecting not just the more, I'll say, straightforward sheet and plate, but also some of the forgings, which we are able to bring to bear for that. And so it's an optimism for that. And again, if everything that we see as potentially could happen by way of volume, wide-body mix, then our structures margins, and I have commented that I do see moving towards the high teens the -- as you move to the middle or second part of the decade, everything is there for us to do. And now just got to make it, the demand is not the issue, neither for what we've won from the titanium opportunity because of the VSMPO and tariff and restriction issues, but also the increasing demand from wide-body. In terms of the increased, I'll say, sophistication that I referred to, yeah, that goes to shipset value. So as we move forward, the engine value for Howmet will increase as we move to supply the products for the changes required for the -- I'll say, the solution for the GTF issues for which we are -- the part we are playing in it, which is on the advantage engine and we'll see shipset value increase there. And similarly, for the improvements we're making on the LEAP. As you know, normally in engines, while very long run items, we normally do upgrade about every five to six years. And so we had an upgrade plans with our customer, but the upgrades are, I'll say, a little bit more given the issues in terms of durability that have been found on, let's call it, the generation one parts of the turbine, not necessarily issues with our part per se, but because of basically as you drive the temperatures up because of -- and then shop last with particulates that got through. And those are problems which require even enhanced solutions to be able to improve time on wing.\nRobert Spingarn: Thanks, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Hey, John.\nJohn Plant: Hi, Myles.\nMyles Walton: I know the guidance raise on sales, you gave some color, but I was hoping you'd put a finer point on it. The $190 million did you imply as maybe $40 million or $50 million add back on wheels, a little bit on industrial and the bulk from aero, is that the way to think about the $190 million?\nJohn Plant: I didn't really break it down. I think my aggregate feeling is we see commercial and the move the 737 rates, that's a positive assumption. Defense is proving quite robust and strong. I mean, that 17% on top of what we printed in Q1 is really strong. And we are beginning to see the early stages of the defense spares increases, in particular, I think as we go through into 2024 and 2025, we'll begin to see spares increases for F-35 as an example. So defense has been really good for us. And I think we continue to see that. Wheels, we think, again, stronger than prior assumptions in Q3. Order books for 2023 are now closed. And so we're getting a much clearer picture for the final outcomes for the 2023 order book close out. And the truck manufacturers have not even opened the order book yet for 2024. So we haven't got a read on that. We're hoping that they're robust. But my guesstimated picture is there'll be in the coming, let's say, 12 months, there'll be some weakness in the trailer market, some distribution and relative strength in the European truck market and possibly some weakness in the North American truck market. But in aggregate, slightly better than I previously anticipated.\nMyles Walton: And just a quick one on the structures bottleneck. It's good to have the assumptions that are conservative and not counting on the OEMs coming through the purchase orders. But was the bottleneck in any way a result of some hesitation to go up in rates and having to quickly than.\nA \u2013 John Plant : No.\nMyles Walton: Okay.\nA \u2013 John Plant : No, we added people. We're adding more people. So we're optimistic that the -- everything we got a wish for by way of, I'll say, volume requirements for our customers are there. We added the people. We spent money to increase furnace capacity as an example, moving to triple sticks and double stick furnaces. We added some additional automation in what we thought we're improving our, I'll say, rolling mill capacity and throughputs. And as I said, it didn't work out. And so I just accept that sometimes in life, things don't go exactly as planned. I said, yes, we face planted. But at least we know it and don't pretend we didn't do it, and now it's for us to stand up and do it. It's not a volume issue. It's not a demand issue. It's just -- we've got to make the stuff. And we're expecting to do so in Q3. But I guess every management says that we think we're going to do better. I mean it's always better in the future than the past. But Q2 for that business, we cannot be proud. That's for sure.\nMyles Walton: Thanks for the color.\nA \u2013 John Plant: Thank you. Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nA \u2013 John Plant: Hey, Kristine.\nKristine Liwag: John, on the issue that you called out on Engineered Structures, can you just provide more specific details on what caused the plant bottleneck? And then how do we think about recovery? And the other part to that would be depending on what the problem actually is, is there a risk that we could see this spread to the other segments? Like how do we think about all that?\nA \u2013 John Plant: Well, first of all, absolutely no risk spreading to other segments. It was totally inside 1 segment, inside 1 plant. It's not like a disease, it's not contagious. It's just ease for that thing at a plant. I've sort of done my best to dance around every question on this topic. And as I think it's probably getting excessive airtime for what is like irrelevant in the total results of Howmet and what we achieved, which we already exceeded everything that we said we're going to achieve. But it does come down to -- there's a huge sequencing process within -- to make titanium and in one of the early stages of that, of that process, our work in progress, buffers broke down and we ended up with the labor. We recruited I'll say standing idle. The equipment wasn't working. And then subsequently we starved every subsequent process during the course of the three months. And so we believe we've got things back on track. I just detailed, there's like an analysis going into recently, again, we rereviewing it once again last week, which is my scrutiny of every work in progress, a buffer of every important production stage for that particular product. And so in terms of daylight being the bestest infectant and a high degree of engagement by the plant management, the head of operations, the business unit leadership -- and then for me to be scrutinizing, I'll say, work-in-progress buffers for each of their production stages, that's a pretty high level of scrutiny for something, which, again, while it's worthy of comment if that were to get too carried away about. So, I'm hopeful it's going to respond. If it's brute force alone, it will respond. and hopefully, with a bit of sophistication as well, we might make some improvements this quarter.\nKristine Liwag: Thanks John. That's really helpful color. I mean it sounds like a very isolated issue for that specific segment. In terms of the recovery pace, like how long does this issue like this usually get resolved, like by 4Q? Is this largely resolved in your back to where you were for margins like last quarter, it was 400 to 500 basis points higher. How should we think about that pace of recovery?\nJohn Plant: Yes, I don't want to give segment commentary. But I'd be upset if we're not doing at least 10% to 15% improved volume in Q3 in that business. And assuming we do that, then we'll see a large restoration of margin because we'd work long and hard to establish that 14% as the -- let's call it, the line for that business and held it no matter what was thrown at us by way of F-35 bulkheads, 787 drop into nothing and through thick and thin, we've done it. And then as soon as we got the volume to do what we did was not good. But at least I just think it's best to be straightforward about it and say, we didn't do good. We know what we've got to do. Everybody knows what they're going to do. And we've tracked long and hard to make sure that we succeed and make substantial improvement in Q3 and then we play it again and more in Q4.\nKristine Liwag: I really appreciate the detail you provided John. Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Gautam Khanna of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Hey good morning. Thanks guys.\nJohn Plant: Hey Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: I wanted to follow-up, I think it was Sheila's question. Just directionally, looking at next year, in the past, you've opined on incremental margin potential, given you've already done a lot of hiring and incrementally, that's not as big of a headwind as those people get more productive and the like. And then the crosscurrents of Forged Wheels and what have you, do you have the same confidence in the 30% to 40% incrementals next year that you did kind of heading into this year? One that you opined on that?\nJohn Plant: It's pretty, I'll say, soon to be imagining 2024 and so we don't make comment much on 2024. I suspect that I'll give you some sort of demand outlook when we get to November time and give Q3 results. We've done that the last couple of years. And I think the most interesting question for, I'll say, when we deliver our Q3 results and decide about giving some color for 2024 is like do we achieve of 2019 levels of revenue? That's the most interesting question. And bear in mind, as we all know, is that there's a significant mix drag because it's not all things being equal, it's going to be all things being unequal where wide-body will be, let's say, I don't know, a couple of hundred planes down and narrow-body might be a couple of hundred planes up, and that's probably getting towards $0.5 billion revenue drag. But can we overcome all of that with all the stuff we've been talking about in terms of, I'll say, content, price, just driving through and improving our shares and all the rest of it? And so that, for me, is the most interesting question about 2024 is that do we get there. And therefore, it will be like a whole year early, I'll say, fascinating. Of course, I'm asking the question. I'm not giving you the answer because it's too early. In terms of margins, 35% plus or minus 5% was appropriate for when we were talking that clearly in -- I think it was in 2021 to 2022. And I'll say heading that way, maybe it's more like a 30% plus or minus for 2023. Again, too early to say and it's going to depend upon hopefully seeing positive volume, combine that with productivity coming through from a more stable workforce and having really I'll say bore down on that problem, which for me turning like 25% of the problem belongs in the whole recruitment retention and the rest is just in fundamental productivity of the workforce as some of our parts are so sophisticated that the trading times are elevated, and therefore, we should start to see some of the benefits come through on that add together with the wide-body demand. So, a lot of moving parts, Gautam. But at the moment, I think it's more like a 30% plus or minus range around it, but I don't know that yet. I mean that's no more than me thinking directionally where are we, without any benefit of any detailed financial analysis, and therefore, it's just talking with you.\nGautam Khanna: I appreciate that. And just as part of that, how do you think pricing changes year-to-year, just\nJohn Plant: We haven't told you Q2 yet. Nobody's asked the question, but Q2, everything was in line with what we've said before and the year is in line with what we said before in our Q will be published this afternoon, and you'll be able to see it. And so everything is in order on that front. 2023 now is essentially completed for negotiations. So, again, all in order, and 2024 is coming rapidly into focus and commensurate with what I said on the last call is that 2024 is going to be similar and good, it's similar and good.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you, John. Appreciate it.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRonald Epstein: Hey, good morning guys. So, I think pretty much everything has been asked. So maybe just a quick follow-on here. When rates actually get to 38 or maybe way down the road, they get to 50 or higher on 737s, how should we think about the evolution of incrementals then? Because I think that's on the top of a lot of investors' minds because it can help draw out the trajectory of where earnings and cash flow for the company could ultimately go as the ramp goes?\nJohn Plant: Yes. I think the most difficult thing that we've -- ultimately, if you look through all the issues we faced of stop start, stop start, supply chain, labor, COVID -- all post-COVID and all those things that have -- if they tested us over the last, let's say, two or three years, then I think when I bring it right down to how do we now see it as we've grappled each one of them that fundamental labor productivity has probably been the most difficult for us in what's -- parts of our business have extremely high learning curves and to stabilize that, deliver good quality to our customers, which is paramount we're trying very hard on that front. And to meet schedule. And I think that we've heard very little from the industry about any inability to Howmet not to meet customers' needs. So thing that labor productivity into place, seeing everything smooth out. And I'm hopeful that as Boeing moves towards achieving the 737 at rate 50, as Airbus move from the, let's call it, early 50s through to something towards rate 75 is that that's going to help smooth out things and will be in a much improved condition to deliver at a higher productive level. Similarly with the wide-body increases. So I've used a phrase which I'm not sure how apt it really is, but call it state of Grace. I do see that maybe as we move into the second half of 2024. We get close to that state of grace where productivity is smoothed out, production volumes increasing, content increasing, pricing in the right shape. And so then we begin to print optimal margins and cash flow and hopefully just continue to then improve as a further rate increase in 2025 and 2026. So everything tells me we should be fundamentally optimistic. At the same time, we've currently got issues to overcome, of which I think that labor is used -- is the most -- been the most protracted.\nRonald Epstein: Got it. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, PT, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for Howmet. Revenues were up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, albeit, Q2 is traditionally a stronger quarter seasonally than Q1 due to more effective production and sales days. Commercial aerospace increased by 23% year-over-year and continues to be the highlight of the quarter and reflects some of the scheduled increases for the anticipated Boeing 737 build rates, which are slated to increase very soon. Defense sales were also strong at plus 17%. EBITDA was up 16% year-over-year and up sequentially. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 per share and exceeded the high end of guidance. This was an increase of 26% year-over-year. The cash balance was a healthy $536 million, and free cash flow was strong at $188 million, which started at consecutive quarters of cash generation. $100 million of cash flow was used to buy back shares at an average price of $45 per share. Net debt to EBITDA further improved to 2.5 times leverage and all bond debt is at a fixed rate, which provide predictable interest rate expenses into the future. Howmet has negligible exposure to floating interest rates. Regarding our revolver, we amended and extended our $1 billion undrawn credit facility to 2028, while realizing lower fees and a more favorable net debt to EBITDA covenant. Lastly, another notable item was the commercial settlement of Lehman claim, $40 million, which is $25 million less than previously reserved, with a cash settlement we paid in July 2023 and a further settlement in July 2024. This litigation was the most significant of all residual claims for Howmet, namely RemainCo, and dates back to 2008. Before turning it over to Ken, I want to cover three additional items. Firstly, in Q2, Howmet was impacted by approximately 5 days of production stoppage at our Wheels [ph] plant in Hungary due to a 9-day strike at Arconic Corporation, which is now resolved. The interruption of suppliers of aluminum billet had an unfavorable effect of about $5 million to profitability for which a claim has been lodged with Arconic under the terms of the supply agreement, and we expect to gain resolution shortly. Additionally, Howmet is assessing its significant reliance upon this source of supply. Secondly, while segment commentaries including the finance portion of our call, let me address structures. The margin rate fell back for the first time in several quarters. The profit miss was essentially the result of adding costs or production rate increases, which we did not achieve. The cost of additional people, furnace preparation and other rolling mill facilities preparation were unrecovered due to the production rate increases not being achieved. The main issue was bottlenecks in production at one plant. The backlog did increase since it was not a demand issue. Naturally, our plan is to achieve production rate increases and burn down the increased backlog as we move into the second half. This reduced production combined with F-35 bulk and inventory burn down was also not helpful. But it was, in aggregate, not material in the context of the Howmet overall results, which were again up, as I commented earlier. Finally, the Paris Airshow was held in June with the largest significant orders ever at an airshow for commercial aircraft, which adds to the backlog of orders fulfilled -- to be fulfilled once production rates are able to be further increased. The show was very successful for Howmet with a combination of production meetings with both customers and investors all reflecting the huge optimism for both the industry generally and for Howmet, in particular. I'll now turn the call over to Ken, who will provide further market and segment commentary. Thanks Ken and let's move to slide number 12. The outlook for Howmet continues to be very strong and supported, in particular, by the extraordinary backlog of commercial aircraft orders at both Boeing and Airbus. Demand increases have moved further to the right, constrained by current aircraft production, would all go well for revenue increases to come in 2024, 2025, and beyond. This growth in absolute aircraft quantity is further enhanced by the increased sophistication of engine technology upgrades being brought to market by both GE and Pratt & Whitney to the narrow-body markets. These turbine improvements address fuel efficiency and time on wing issues, which enhance the value of Howmet's differentiated products. This combines well with the upcoming improvement in widebody production, which increasingly features composite technology, which again increases the value of how much differentiated products of titanium structures and fasteners. Wide-body aircraft also feature improved aerospace engine content for the company. Defense markets continue to be robust, and we envisage increased revenue going into 2024 as the destocking for bulkheads is completed and engine spares continue to increase significantly as shop visits increase. The F-35 backlog continues to increase to approximately 420 aircraft with recent orders of 126 aircraft for the US government joint Kroger office, plus 25% for Israel, and a further 25 aircraft for the Czech Republic. Industrial revenue continues to grow for both IGT and oil and gas, in particular. The outlook for Wheels is also healthy for the current quarter. And in Q3, underlying demand continues to be strong, albeit Q3 is notably the weakest quarter for revenue due to European vacations, which are also a feature of our aerospace plants in Europe in both France, Germany, and Hungary, in particular. This seasonal effect -- the seasonal offset it seemed to be approximately $50 million of revenue between Q2 and Q3. My final markets comment is regarding spares, where we see spares of commercial aircraft closing in on 95% of the 2019 levels by year-end and approximately 130% of the defense and IGT market at 2019 levels. This puts aggregate spares for this year in excess of 2019 levels with higher rates to come as we see the rates increasing as we close out the year. The cautious stance has been taken relative to Q4 until the demand is more clear for commercial trucks in the quarter and aircraft parts for the first half of 2024. While the backlog is there, we find difficulty in planning for rate increases and the inventory impact, if that's not achieved. Specifically, we are raising guidance once again for the year by another significant step. To give you an example of guidance assumptions, we have lifted our 737 MAX assumption from 30 per month and nudged it into the 30s, but not anywhere near the rate 38 for the second half. This number is intentionally given the -- all the moving parts of the business and also the lack of clarity over very soon. And when we plan for the second half, we are increasing people recruitment further, but at a reduced rate in the first half as we hope to use the productivity improvements to come. Regarding Q3, revenue is expected to be $1.9 billion, plus or minus $10 million; EBITDA, $360 million, plus or minus $5 million; earnings per share of $0.42 plus or minus $0.01. Regarding the year, revenues increased from $6.25 billion to $6.44 billion, a significant increase. And let's say, plus or minus $30 million, $40 million around that range. And then EBITDA has increased to $1.45 billion, plus or minus $10 million. Earnings per share is increased to $1.70, plus or minus $0.01, and free cash flow is held at $635 million, having absorbed the settlement for the Lehman Brothers claim. In conclusion to my outlook commentary, we're pleased to demonstrate both excellent Q2 achievements, supplemented by further optimistic outlooks with very solid increases to come in the future. Let's move to the summary on slide 13. Q2 was another strong quarter for Howmet. Revenue was up 18%, EBITDA 16% and earnings per share 26%. And EBITDA margin for material pass-through was strong at 22.7% and servicing continues to be heading in a healthy direction. Liquidity is healthy with very positive free cash flow with more to come in the second half, and we've continued to deploy that cash both to share repurchase in the second quarter. And as you can see, we've turned to debt repayment in the third quarter. Guidance has been increased and we expect year-over-year improvement in annual revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share as stated. Also, we expect very positive free cash flow generation in the third and fourth quarters. Regarding debt, what we mentioned the $200 million. And as we complete that with the EBITDA improvements, then we'll be improving our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage from the two and half times record that we talked about in Q2, and we'll see improvements in Q3 and Q4 and heading towards two times levered by the end of the year. And then finally, we expect to increase the quarterly common dividend by 25% from $0.04 a share to $0.05 a share in the fourth quarter of 2023. Thank you all very much. Let's move across to question-and-answer. Okay. Thank you, Sheila. First of all, we don't have to wait, but the extraordinary levels of recruitment during the last couple of years have certainly weighed upon us. And probably of all the things that we've been doing, driving labor productivity has been amongst the most difficult. And it's certainly been more difficult than what we believe we've overcome by way of scrap and yield and also driving through on the volume. If you look at our midpoint of guidance, we believe we're going to raise the incremental to about 28% in Q3. And we are hopeful at about 34% in Q4. And that takes account of what we believe to be hopefully, a slowing of recruitment and an improved retention ratios and as the denominators got bigger of the employees we've taken on. And so, we're optimistic that the incremental drop-through begins to improve and then hopefully improve again in '24 with the combined volume, the pull-through from the automation programs, the -- I'd say, the bigger denominator of recently recruited employees and the mix effective widebody. So, it's a future statement. We're hopeful we're optimistic. We're planning for it, but I'll be very disappointed if we had to wait until we had stability for improvements in that drop-through. So, I mean -- -- when I think about Howmet is more like a relentless machine. I was trying to bring color to my commentary. So the last time I tried to wet paper tissue and that didn't work so well, as you know. But at this time, I think itself fairly relentless machine rolling forward and delivering results. We're not that flash bang and full of jumping noise like Chinese firecrackers. But within Q2, there is one thing we overcame, which I'm proud in the way we overcame it, which is the consequences of the strike in one of our suppliers of aluminum billet, that nine-day stoppage costs us heavy and yet we marked straight through and delivered really solid margins in our wheels business. So, I think that has really great performance by Howmet in that regard. Conversely, when I think of structures, we took a much bigger hit than the strike in the margin rate and the lack of achievement of the volume. And so I put that more in the, let's say, almost like a $10 million complete face plans by the business. And I just think myself, if you want to use the play on the taglines, I think, Howmet planted in our structures business. And I'm not proud of what we really didn't achieve there. We thought we'd prepped well. We thought we'd begun to put labor in place. We thought we'd got the, I'll say, improvements made to improve throughput in our furnaces and then rolling mills and basically completely bottlenecked in one area, and it didn't work well. So -- but despite all of that, so let's call it, if you want to -- and I never like, like the, excuse me, but a combination of structure space planting and a supplier strike, we out-delivered the guide on EBITDA. And when all said and done any one of those is multiples. So like when we talk about margin rate of 20 basis points difference, that's worth $3 million. We felt like it's hardly worth commenting on. And so it's a bit like me saying, yeah, we did really good apart from that. So I generally choose not to. But I'm trying to be responsive to your question. And I'll say, wheels did great and structures was a big face plant. Thank you. Hey, Rob. Obviously, probably on a role and I was getting carried away. So no, I'm done. Yes, I don't like asking questions so, no, please start over and dish down this. Yeah. First of all, no rate assumption changes for elsewhere. I mean, Airbus has been, I'll say, plowing ahead, but struggling to get to their production numbers. But getting close, certainly, the Q2 delivery was much healthier. And so I think things are getting better generally, and I think everybody is believing that we're going to see higher rate increases. And really, it's a question of when trying to get ready for it. We think we've prepped or it. We have built capability and capacity and labor terms. We had, say, machine capacity. But as you know, on 737, originally, it's going to be Jan 1st, then May 1st and July 1st. And we just want to be cautious. That's why I say all we've done is just nudging into the early 30s and see where it goes and be ready, capable of supplying, but not willing to be clear we're not going to put rate 38 until it's achieved. Well, certainly, this powder metal issue that we read about it seems to be historical. I'm sure that we have got a good plan about taking those engines down out of from aircraft wing and looking at them in detail because I think don't work for that sort of level of crack. I think the bigger impact for high Howmet is, I might say, impact, I mean, positive, not because the impact -- the word impact has negative is the time on wing issue, which is present for both current narrowbodies engines of the ETF and the LEAP where -- while each of them, I think, are doing better for that relative point in their life cycle compared to the predecessor engines, I'll say, V2500 and the CFM56 is that they're still well below the exit point of the previous engine. And so that in itself is leading to what we believe will become increased demand for replacement parts. And also, it's combining with what I referred to maybe not in sufficient detail, which was the improvements that we have worked on to help resolve the issues. So the high-pressure turbine blades have been seeing elevated temperatures from, let's say, combustors that don't have sufficient holes left after to block them up and then causing degradation issues. And I'd say another issue particularly in, I'll say, Far East and Middle East climates for LEAP is that we are -- I describe intimate with those improvements. We have worked on them. We are prepping for their introduction and commensurate with our customers' needs. And then we are now assessing how that demand combined with the increased demand for wide-body is moving to the 2024, the increased wide-body is moving to 2024. And so it's all setting up well. In terms of what I think is good demand is clearly where aircraft production increases, less good demand. You could put a if you want to, is where it's a replacement part for a period of time. And then we are rather more cautious on that. And where we need to increase capacity rapidly to achieve that in the, say, coming months into 2024 and maybe into 2025 is that we certainly don't want to take capacity up and then take it back down. And therefore, we're in -- I'll say deep into commercial discussions with our customers to ensure that doesn't happen. So a long way of saying GTF powder metal, no issue for us. Nothing to do with us. And powder metal wing, it's leading to the sort of content improvement growth that we talk about as we make improvements to the -- to those turbine blades and introduce some sophisticated technology as certainly indicated looking at things we've done elsewhere on those engines or the more advanced engines and seeking to deploy that, which is great for the future robustness of the engine. It's fuel efficiency and also good for Howmet. Thank you. Hey, David. It depends upon the parts. We supply some different parts. But while I recognize that we received schedule rate \u2013 schedules for parts increasing to rate 38 is that my -- I'd say my scenario, which I don't like is where should they not achieve that rate, then that the parts we've supplied, I think because that will be bloated inventories, they will then take them out just in the same way as they would -- parts were taken out September, October, November, December of 2022 is that I'm blending it all together and saying, my average assumption is -- I mean the 30 is, but being deliberately loose about it, but I'm very clear that our guidance is not based upon full rate increase of 38 from the 1st of July. That's not the case. I mean to say that I don't believe that Boeing can do it. I'd love them to do it, but do it and then I'll feel more comfortable about our guidance to -- because I mean our guidance, I tried to describe in the past, tends to be something that you can rely upon. And I want to see aircraft reduced. And then at that point, I feel confident that we're not going to be on the wrong side of inventory takeout during the remaining few months of the year. Yes. I mean, Q4 last year was pretty good. The year was really good. And so it's not worrying. It's just -- I'm not putting it all out there. Why would I? Yes. Well, don't really like using the so-called Chinese partners, but I don't really know where it's Chinese about. But the -- it begins with small steps. Our margin rate did increase in Q2, despite the large ingestation of labor for the balance of the year. It's always a bit of a hostage to fortune, but I'm feeling confident that we're going to see both revenue and margin accretion in the second half beyond Q2. So in that sense, I'm really pleased with the rate and direction of the business, I wouldn't have been able to say that six months ago. And so I'm feeling increasingly confident that, I mean, there's be saying to you publicly, our margin rate is going to increase. So that's pretty good. Thank you. Hi, Myles. I didn't really break it down. I think my aggregate feeling is we see commercial and the move the 737 rates, that's a positive assumption. Defense is proving quite robust and strong. I mean, that 17% on top of what we printed in Q1 is really strong. And we are beginning to see the early stages of the defense spares increases, in particular, I think as we go through into 2024 and 2025, we'll begin to see spares increases for F-35 as an example. So defense has been really good for us. And I think we continue to see that. Wheels, we think, again, stronger than prior assumptions in Q3. Order books for 2023 are now closed. And so we're getting a much clearer picture for the final outcomes for the 2023 order book close out. And the truck manufacturers have not even opened the order book yet for 2024. So we haven't got a read on that. We're hoping that they're robust. But my guesstimated picture is there'll be in the coming, let's say, 12 months, there'll be some weakness in the trailer market, some distribution and relative strength in the European truck market and possibly some weakness in the North American truck market. But in aggregate, slightly better than I previously anticipated. Yes, I don't want to give segment commentary. But I'd be upset if we're not doing at least 10% to 15% improved volume in Q3 in that business. And assuming we do that, then we'll see a large restoration of margin because we'd work long and hard to establish that 14% as the -- let's call it, the line for that business and held it no matter what was thrown at us by way of F-35 bulkheads, 787 drop into nothing and through thick and thin, we've done it. And then as soon as we got the volume to do what we did was not good. But at least I just think it's best to be straightforward about it and say, we didn't do good. We know what we've got to do. Everybody knows what they're going to do. And we've tracked long and hard to make sure that we succeed and make substantial improvement in Q3 and then we play it again and more in Q4. Thank you. Hey Gautam. It's pretty, I'll say, soon to be imagining 2024 and so we don't make comment much on 2024. I suspect that I'll give you some sort of demand outlook when we get to November time and give Q3 results. We've done that the last couple of years. And I think the most interesting question for, I'll say, when we deliver our Q3 results and decide about giving some color for 2024 is like do we achieve of 2019 levels of revenue? That's the most interesting question. And bear in mind, as we all know, is that there's a significant mix drag because it's not all things being equal, it's going to be all things being unequal where wide-body will be, let's say, I don't know, a couple of hundred planes down and narrow-body might be a couple of hundred planes up, and that's probably getting towards $0.5 billion revenue drag. But can we overcome all of that with all the stuff we've been talking about in terms of, I'll say, content, price, just driving through and improving our shares and all the rest of it? And so that, for me, is the most interesting question about 2024 is that do we get there. And therefore, it will be like a whole year early, I'll say, fascinating. Of course, I'm asking the question. I'm not giving you the answer because it's too early. In terms of margins, 35% plus or minus 5% was appropriate for when we were talking that clearly in -- I think it was in 2021 to 2022. And I'll say heading that way, maybe it's more like a 30% plus or minus for 2023. Again, too early to say and it's going to depend upon hopefully seeing positive volume, combine that with productivity coming through from a more stable workforce and having really I'll say bore down on that problem, which for me turning like 25% of the problem belongs in the whole recruitment retention and the rest is just in fundamental productivity of the workforce as some of our parts are so sophisticated that the trading times are elevated, and therefore, we should start to see some of the benefits come through on that add together with the wide-body demand. So, a lot of moving parts, Gautam. But at the moment, I think it's more like a 30% plus or minus range around it, but I don't know that yet. I mean that's no more than me thinking directionally where are we, without any benefit of any detailed financial analysis, and therefore, it's just talking with you. We haven't told you Q2 yet. Nobody's asked the question, but Q2, everything was in line with what we've said before and the year is in line with what we said before in our Q will be published this afternoon, and you'll be able to see it. And so everything is in order on that front. 2023 now is essentially completed for negotiations. So, again, all in order, and 2024 is coming rapidly into focus and commensurate with what I said on the last call is that 2024 is going to be similar and good, it's similar and good. Thank you. Yes. I think the most difficult thing that we've -- ultimately, if you look through all the issues we faced of stop start, stop start, supply chain, labor, COVID -- all post-COVID and all those things that have -- if they tested us over the last, let's say, two or three years, then I think when I bring it right down to how do we now see it as we've grappled each one of them that fundamental labor productivity has probably been the most difficult for us in what's -- parts of our business have extremely high learning curves and to stabilize that, deliver good quality to our customers, which is paramount we're trying very hard on that front. And to meet schedule. And I think that we've heard very little from the industry about any inability to Howmet not to meet customers' needs. So thing that labor productivity into place, seeing everything smooth out. And I'm hopeful that as Boeing moves towards achieving the 737 at rate 50, as Airbus move from the, let's call it, early 50s through to something towards rate 75 is that that's going to help smooth out things and will be in a much improved condition to deliver at a higher productive level. Similarly with the wide-body increases. So I've used a phrase which I'm not sure how apt it really is, but call it state of Grace. I do see that maybe as we move into the second half of 2024. We get close to that state of grace where productivity is smoothed out, production volumes increasing, content increasing, pricing in the right shape. And so then we begin to print optimal margins and cash flow and hopefully just continue to then improve as a further rate increase in 2025 and 2026. So everything tells me we should be fundamentally optimistic. At the same time, we've currently got issues to overcome, of which I think that labor is used -- is the most -- been the most protracted. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Let's move to Slide 5. All markets continue to be healthy with revenue in the quarter up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Commercial aerospace continued to lead the growth with an increase of 23% year-over-year, driven by all 3 aerospace segments. Commercial aerospace has grown for 9 consecutive quarters and stands at 47% of total revenue. Commercial aerospace portion of total revenue is expected to increase due to the developing widebody recovery, strong backlog of commercial aircraft orders and spares growth. Spares for commercial aerospace continued to increase sequentially and are now trending to be approximately 95% of 2019 levels at year-end. Defense aerospace was up 17% year-over-year, driven by the F-35 in legacy fighter programs. Sequentially, defense aerospace was up 4% year-over-year, driven by engine products. Commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segments, was up 8% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially driven by higher volumes. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 20% year-over-year, driven by oil and gas, up 36%; IGT, up 20%; and general industrial, up 11%. Sequentially, these markets were up 4% with general industrial up 9%; oil and gas up 4%; and IGT flat. In summary, another very strong quarter across all of our end markets. Now let's move to Slide 6. Starting with the P&L and enhanced profitability, revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share, all exceeded the high end of the guidance in the second quarter. Revenue was $1.65 billion, up 18% year-over-year. EBITDA was $368 million, up 16% year-over-year, including net head count additions in Q2 of approximately 380 employees, which builds on additions made in Q1. Year-to-date, net head count additions are approximately 865, which are in line with our targets. EBITDA margin was 22.3%. Adjusting for the year-over-year inflationary cost pass-through of approximately $25 million. EBITDA margin was 22.7% and the flow-through of incremental revenue to EBITDA was approximately 22%, while absorbing near-term recruiting, training and production costs. Earnings per share was $0.44 which was up 26% year-over-year. The second quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of growth in revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share. Moving to the balance sheet. The ending cash balance was healthy at $536 million after generating $188 million of free cash flow which was our best Q2 of free cash flow generation. We continue to expect strong positive free cash flow in the second half of 2023. $118 million of free cash flow generation was allocated to common stock repurchases and dividends. Net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 2.5 times, while bond debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of interest rate expense into the future. Our next bond maturity is in October of 2024. Finally, we amended our $1 billion revolver through 2028, while realizing lower fees and a more favorable financial covenant. The revolver remains undrawn. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. In the quarter, capital expenditures were $41 million with a focus on automation. Capital installed prior to COVID-19 puts us in a good position to support continued commercial aerospace recovery. In the second quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock at an average price of $44.52 per share, retiring approximately 2.2 million shares. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. Share buyback authority from the Board of Directors stands at approximately $822 million. Since separation in 2020, we have repurchased more than $1 billion of common stock. We continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the second quarter, the quarterly stock dividend was $0.04 per share after it was doubled in the fourth quarter of last year. Finally, we issued a note to redeem $200 million of our 2024 debt tower with cash on hand. The redemption is expected to be complete at the end of September and will lower our annualized interest cost by approximately $10 million. As you will recall, we repurchased approximately $176 million of bonds last quarter, which will lower annualized interest costs by an additional $9 million. Therefore, year-to-date, bond repurchases are expected to decrease annualized interest costs by approximately $19 million. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the second quarter. Engine Products continued its strong performance since the second quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in revenue and EBITDA. Revenue was $821 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Commercial aerospace was up 23%, Defense/aerospace was up 41%, and both markets were driven by higher build rates and spares growth. IGT was up 20%, and oil and gas was up 36%, as demand continues to be strong. EBITDA increased 25% year-over-year to a record for the segment of $223 million. EBITDA margin was 27.2%, despite the addition of approximately 350 net new employees year-to-date and approximately 90 net additions in Q2. Across all of the aerospace segments, net headcount additions are needed for the continued revenue ramp, but do carry near-term recruiting, training and production costs. Finally, in the second quarter, the Engine's team finalized a new five-year collective bargaining agreement in our Whitehall, Michigan facility. Let's move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue increased 19%. Commercial aerospace was 19% higher as the widebody recovery starts to take effect. Defense aerospace was up 24%, commercial aerospace was up 17% and general industrial was up 16%. Year-over-year segment EBITDA increased 14% as volume increases were partially offset by the addition of 430 net new employees year-to-date and approximately 215 net additions in Q2. Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was up 8% with commercial aerospace up 31%, driven by higher build rates in approximately $25 million of Russian titanium share gain. Defense aerospace was down 33% year-over-year, driven by customer inventory corrections. Segment EBITDA decreased 23% year-over-year, while margins declined 410 basis points. The lower EBITDA was driven by higher costs associated with additional headcount as well as operational costs for planned production rate increases, which were unrecovered due to production bottlenecks in one plant. Net head count additions in the quarter were approximately 50 employees. Finally, in the third quarter, the Structures' team finalized a new four-year collective bargaining agreement at our Niles, Ohio facility, which was ahead of schedule. Now let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels revenue year-over-year increased 7%. The $19 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by a 6% increase in volume. Segment EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year, despite the interruption of raw material for our Wheels plant in Hungary due to a nine-day strike at our Arconic Corporation supplier, which has now been resolved. Margin increased 30 basis points due to the impact of lower aluminum prices and inflationary cost pass-through. Finally, let's move to Slide 11. We continue to be focused on improving our capital structure and liquidity. In July, we issued a notice to redeem $200 million of our 2024 debt tower with cash on hand, which is expected to be completed by the end of September. The October 2024 debt tower would be approximately $705 million after the redemption. Since the separation in 2020, including the redemption just announced in July, we will have paid down approximately $2.15 billion of debt with cash on hand and lowered our annualized interest costs by more than $120 million. Gross debt is expected to be less than $3.8 billion after the redemption in September, while long-term debt continues to be unsecured in it fixed rates. Finally, we amended our $1 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility through 2028. The amendment provides lower fees and more favorable covenants. Details can be found in the 10-Q, which is expected to be filed later today. The revolver remains undrawn. Lastly, before turning it back to John, let me highlight one item in the appendix on slide 18. It covers our operational tax rate, which was approximately 22.6% for the quarter. The second quarter rate represents approximately a 500 basis point improvement in the operational tax rate since the separation in 2020. Now, let me turn it back to John for the outlook and summary."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Luther, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Luther : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace first quarter 2023 results conference call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session.  I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings.  In today's presentation, references to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA excluding special items and adjusted EPS excluding special items. These measures are among the non-GAAP financial measures that we've included in our discussion.

So, with that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant : Thanks P.T. and good morning, everyone. Howmet's Q1 results speak louder for themselves. Revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year and an increase of 6% sequentially. Commercial Aerospace increased 29% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Revenue was above guidance by significant demand, which was in itself an increase quarter-over-quarter and naturally increased revenues require some working capital. EBITDA was $360 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year and an increase of 7% sequentially.  EBITDA margin was healthy at 22.5%, again, an increase sequentially. Earnings per share were up 35% year-over-year. Free cash flow was negative $41 million, driven by the higher revenues and will now be followed by three successive quarters of substantial cash inflow.  During the quarter that was reduced by $176 million from the 2024 bonds with cash on hand. And this will further reduce future interest payments by $9 million annually, and hence increasing free cash flow yield.  In addition, $25 million of common stocks were repurchased. During the balance of 2023, shareholders can expect further steps regarding the application of cash flows, and thereby creating shareholder value. All of the above growth, margin rate, free cash flow and the application to create value all speak to the business and financial model of the company. I will comment further on the outlook after Ken has outlined the growth by markets and performance by business segments.\nKen Giacobbe : Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of the markets for the first quarter. Revenue was up 21% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Commercial Aerospace continue to lead year-over-year revenue growth with an increase of 29% driven by engine products, engineered structures and fastening systems. Sequentially, Commercial Aerospace was up 4%.  Commercial Aerospace has grown for eighth consecutive quarters and expanded 47% of total revenue, and although growing continues to be short of the pre-pandemic level of 60% of total revenue.  Defense Aerospace was up 11% year-over-year, driven by the F-35 program and growth in legacy spares. Sequentially, Defense Aerospace was flat due to strong year-end seasonality.  Commercial Transportation which impacts both the forged wheels and fastening system segments was up 17% year-over-year, and up 9% sequentially driven by higher volumes.  Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 16% year-over-year, driven by oil and gas which was 53%, IGT up 14% and General Industrial up 1%. Sequentially, these markets were up 15% with oil and gas up 25%, IGT up 15%, and General Industrial of 10%. In summary, strong growth across all of our end markets.  Now let's move to Slide 6. We will start with the P&L and the focus on enhanced profitability for the first quarter. Revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share all exceeding the high end of guidance. Revenue was $1.6 billion or up 21% year-over-year. EBITDA was up 20% year-over-year and EBITDA margin was 22.5%. Adjusting for the year-over-year, inflationary costs pass through of approximately $35 million, EBITDA margin was 23% and the flow through of incremental revenue to EBITDA was approximately 25%, while absorbing near term recruiting, training, and production costs for approximately 500 net headcount additions.  Earnings per share was $0.42, which was 35% year-over-year. The first quarter represented the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share.  Moving through the balance sheet, the ending cash balance was $538 million, after approximately $218 million of capital allocation, debt reduction of $176 million, common stock repurchases of $25 million and quarterly dividends of $17 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $41 million, driven by higher revenues in the first quarter.  Finally, net debt-to-EBITDA remained at a record low of 2.6 times. All bond debt is unsecured and its fixed rates which will provide stability of interest rate expense into the future. Our next bond maturity is in October 2024 and the $1 billion revolver remains undrawn.  Moving to capital allocation, we continue to be balanced in our approach. Capital expenditures were $64 million in the quarter and continue to be less than depreciation. Capital installed prior to COVID-19 puts us in a very strong position to support the continued commercial aerospace recovery. Regarding debt, we reduced the 2024 debt tower in the first quarter by approximately $176 million with cash on hand. These repurchases will lower our annualized interest cost by approximately $9 million. The October 2024 debt tower now stands at approximately $900 million, which is below our revolver. Our continued progress on debt reduction, EBITDA growth and healthy liquidity has resulted in an upgrade to our outlook from S&P last week from stable to positive. You can find our remaining debt towers in the appendix. Moving to share repurchases. The first quarter was the eighth consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. Since the separation in 2020, we have repurchased approximately $928 million of common stock with an average acquisition price of $31.79 per share. Share buyback authority from the board of the directors stands at $922 million. Lastly, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the first quarter, the quarterly common stock dividend remained at $0.04 per share after it was doubled in the fourth quarter of last year. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the first quarter. Engine Products continued its strong performance. Revenue was $795 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year and an increase of 9% sequentials. Year-over-year, commercial aerospace was up 31% and Defense Aerospace was up 19% with both markets driven by higher build rates and spares growth. IGT was up 14% and oil and gas was up 57%.  EBITDA increased 23% year-over-year to a record for the segment of $212 million. EBITDA margin was 26.7% despite the addition of approximately 260 net new employees and the associated near-term recruiting, training and production costs. Please move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue increased 18%. Commercial Aerospace was up 15% driven by the narrow-body recovery. Defense Aerospace was up 38% and Commercial Transportation was up 19%. The year-over-year segment EBITDA increased 4% as volume increases were partially offset by inflationary costs and the addition of approximately 215 net new employees and the associated near-term recruiting, training and production costs. Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was up 14% with Commercial Aerospace up 39%, driven by higher build rates and approximately $20 million of Russian titanium share gain. Defense Aerospace was down 23% year-over-year driven by some legacy programs. Segment EBITDA increased 30% year-over-year, while margin improved 190 basis points. Finally, let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue increased 17%. The $42 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by 18% increase in volume. Segment EBITDA increased 18% year-over-year, in line with the higher volumes. Margin increased 20 basis points as the impact of lower aluminum prices was mostly offset by inflationary cost pass-through and unfavorable foreign currency. Lastly, before turning it back over to John, one item of note, in the appendix, we've added Slide 16 and have updated the improved interest rate expense assumption for 2023 from $227 million to $222 million. This change reflects the 2023 impact of reducing debt by $150 million late in the first quarter.  As you may recall, we had already included the impact of reducing debt by approximately $26 million in January before we published our original 2023 guidance. Now let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken, and let's move to Page 11. Moving to ESG, we continue to leverage our differentiated technologies to help our customers manufacture lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft and commercial trucks with lower carbon footprints.  Within our own operations, Howmet remains committed to managing our energy consumption and environmental impacts as we increase production. In 2022, our actions have reduced the intensity of Howmet's greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, water use and hazardous waste. We progressed against our 2024 greenhouse gas emission goal by achieving a 20% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions through 2022 from the 2019 baseline approaching already the 2024 goal of a 21.5% reduction. Howmet is also committed to a safe workplace while fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment where all our employees can thrive. Our safety record continues to improve and is 7 times better than the industry average. Moreover, Howmet was named one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.  We also increased our workforce by 1,500 people and invested nearly $200 million in 2022 to support the significant production growth. Regarding governance, the company was recognized by 50-50 women on boards having 40% of our board of directors made up of women. Lastly, 75% of our key suppliers have sustainability programs considered to be leading proactive. I'd encourage you to read our sustainability report found at howmet.com in the Investors section. Let's move to Slide 12 and talk about our updated outlook. Firstly, demand for aircraft is very high and aircraft manufacturers' backlogs are in very good order, both for narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. Spares volume and the business jet market also continues to show strength. Airline load factors continue to be very high and robust in the west with rapid growth now seen in both short-haul and long-haul flights in Asia.  This travel-led demand stimulus is further augmented by the need for modern, fully-efficient aircraft, given the current cost of jet-fuel and the very high cost of SAF substitute fuel. This is further driven by the commitment of airlines to meet carbon emission targets for today, 2030 and 2050, which can only be achieved by using the new fuel-efficient engines and aircraft. Current new engines fit to narrow-body jets are all looking at steps to further increase efficiency, which also helps Howmet given our capabilities in complex casting shapes to provide improved their management and hence, fuel efficiency. The other divisions of Howmet are also benefiting by the increased use of titanium and sophisticated fastener suites required by composite wings and fuselages, notably, but not exclusively for wide-body aircraft. The defense market outlook is also healthy with increased budgets and strong demand for F-35s, drones, rocket motor parts and Howmet part. The last part of the F-35 injury inventory correction regarding bulkheads that resulted from the prior underbuild of the F-35 fighters in 2020 and 2021 should be dissipated over the next two to three quarters. IGT turbine blade demand continues to be steady and turbine demand from the oil and gas sector is very high. The year started well in commercial truck. Given the backlog and steady truck ordering in both North America and Europe, it should mean that any demand drop indicated after spring is now pushed out for at least one quarter or so, albeit the normal Q3 seasonality regarding Europe will obviously apply.  The required emissions performance targets for trucks in 2024, especially in the U.S., will apply with no ability to have a stimulated prebuild. In reassessing all of the above, plus robust engine demand was seen in Q1, the outlook for the year has increased. We remain cautious about commercial aircraft build in the second half until we see clear evidence of consistent production rate increases, which will be controlled by the efficiency of both the aircraft assembly lines and the supplier parts, which leads to the final production being set by the weakest link in all of the supply chain. We, as you know, saw this the effect of this phenomenon in late Q3 of 2022 and also in Q4 when Howmet delivery requirements were curtailed to balance customer inventories. More specifically and turning to guidance for the second quarter. We now see revenue of $1.61 billion, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA of $362 million, plus or minus $3 million and earnings per share of $0.42 plus or minus $0.01. For the year, we see revenue of $6.25 billion, plus $75 million minus $50 million, EBITDA of 1.415 [ph], plus 20 minus $15 million. Earnings per share of $1.67 at midpoint, plus $0.03 minus $0.02. And free cash flow increased by $20 million to $635 million, plus or minus $35 million. Please move to Slide 13. In summary, Q1 performance was healthy and a great start to 2023, and the outlook as seen by Howmet is improving. The balance sheet was improved with debt reductions of $176 million and net leverage will now continue towards the 2 times net debt to EBITDA in the balance of 2023, given both the reduction in debt and the improved EBITDA. The balance sheet is strong. Continuing share repurchases can be expected as cash is generated and the current authority is sufficient to continue this program. Annual cash to service legacy Penton and OPEB liabilities is modest at approximately $56 million.  We look forward to updating you again in August. And thank you very much. Let's move to your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak : Hey, good morning. John, the -- if I take the 1Q actual on the revenue and then the 2Q guide, the full year guide in order to get into that range, 3Q and 4Q, it looks like it would need to be closer to $1.5 billion. Recognizing everything you've been saying and the posture you've been taking with conservatism around the end markets. Just in general, how do we get there? And I guess, last quarter was helpful to describe what you were assuming on the major aircraft production rates in the guide, if you could just update us there?\nJohn Plant: Yeah. Before I comment specifically on any aircraft build guide. Let me just back up. And we talk how we thought about the balance of the year. And I think this is really important in setting the tone because managing through an upturn has many more dimensions, especially when you have one major segment, which is commercial aerospace having such significant potential volume increases. And as you know, volumes for aircraft builds have been taken up, down, delayed with some regularity over the last year, two years. And so how we thought about is that we see essentially Q2 playing out very similar to Q1 and preparing for, I say, the improvement in build. And in doing so, we need to add to our costs.  And so in Q1, as you saw from Ken's commentary, we recruited some 500 people. And we're heading probably to a similar sort of run-rate of employee addition in Q2 and all expecting that we are receiving and will be receiving the schedules to meet these potential lifted second half volumes. And of course, you will know, as everybody else knows, is that Boeing has announced that for the 737 that they will take their production rate up to 38 at some time later in the year without specifying exactly when that is. And the cost of these headcounts are clearly are not matched by revenues in the second quarter. So we're prepared to support our customers where they may go in volume. And so we're confident that those parts are going to be scheduled, both by the engine manufacturers and the airframe manufacturers. But as I said in my prepared remarks, is that we're also cognizant of what happened in the last four months of last year when cutbacks occurred because people did not achieve or our customers were unable to achieve some of their more ambitious increases that they had thought about.  And I did say about all marching to the place of the weakest link and whether that's in the supply base or in the final assembly of aircraft, it doesn't really matter. So we set ourselves up. We want to be cautious about the second half and we'll maintain that stance until we see actual increases in production. And when we see those increases, I think we're going to have a lot more confidence that we're not going to get cut back. And hopefully, that might produce a good outcome and possibly even better than we currently see. But say, who knows and we are one of the few almost the not quite one, but say the handful of aerospace suppliers, who are actually increased guidance.  So in summary, what -- our thinking is whether it's commercial aero, whether it's strength in the oil and gas, increased strength in our commercial truck and pushing back some of the potential for any cutbacks there and also the strength in defense. It's a guide up across many of those sectors, which also have to be taken into account while still maintaining that for the year, we need to be suitably cautious because we're only one quarter in. And we're going to see how this plays out, even though we are optimistic that everybody achieves their plans. At the same time, I don't want to put ourselves in and give you a sense of robustness, which may not occur in the end. So hopefully, that gives you the way we thought about it, Noah. And I've also referenced the only public change in production rate, which is for the 737 later in the year. And essentially, we are not calling out any changes in any other specific numbers because we don't know of any.\nNoah Poponak : [Indiscernible] on your framework. \nJohn Plant: Okay. Thank you. \nNoah Poponak : Thanks. \nOperator: The next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton : Thanks, good morning. John or Ken or the profile of margins at Fastening Systems, I was hoping you could touch on those. Obviously, there the EBITDA margin is a couple of hundred basis points below the last year or so. It doesn't really look like mix. I know you're hiring and there's a recruiting, training production costs associated with that. Can you just give us some color on the margin trajectory from here? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Yeah. So passing Systems margin is not where I'd like it to be. And at the same time, we also need to recognize exactly where we are in terms of the production mix, which is still very much metallic focused of narrow bodies for the main. And we've seen really no demand change for -- or no -- essentially no demand change for our widebody business currently-- except for something on Airbus say, A350.  We do expect that, that mix will change and improve in the balance of the year. And preparing ourselves, if you look at the net recruitment, I think we called out like 250-260 net people in Engine, which, of course, is 2.5 times larger our faster business, say we were at 215-220 people. So we recruited disproportionately in fasteners preparing for that improvement.  So essentially, when I think about the year and margin rate is that I don't see much change, a little bit of change positively, maybe in Q2, but essentially, having absorbed the costs of raising production and stabilizing the workforce, plus the increase in volume plus the improvement in mix, I do think that we will see some margin rate improvement in the second half of the year. So basically, don't expect much in Q2, and we've been positioning ourselves optimistically for improvement in the back end of the year, Myles.\nMyles Walton : Should the incremental margins of that segment in '24-'25 more approximate the whole company at that point?\nJohn Plant: Company. Well, I'm hopeful that they're going to go up. But then you can say, well, everybody hopes for that sort of thing. But generally, our hopes for Howmet tend to come to reality. But I have no comments specifically about saying does it match this segment as well on average. What I know is that I'll be somewhat disappointed if we're not earning a margin rate in 2024 above our current Q1 level and we don't expect it to be like that.\nMyles Walton : Thank you. \nJohn Plant: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn : Hi, good morning. \nJohn Plant: Hey, Rob. \nRobert Spingarn : John, you had this very strong sequential growth in industrial, but some peers have suggested that that's just a matter of a lot of inventory that was available to ship in this first quarter. So how does that trend as we go through the year?\nJohn Plant: So if I pick apart if you agree, let's call it, our wider industrial business. We saw really strong demand in terms of the oil and gas sector, which is really for derivative turbines. And that was quite extraordinary at 50% plus. And we don't see anything that being positive for the next, say, few quarters and have you thought about 34 at this point, but -- so oil and gas has been quite strong. And then that's backed up by our gas turbine business at 14%. So those are the two. But beyond that, the wider industrial business was really low-single-digits. So nothing exceptional there at all. But for the two specific sectors, which make a difference to us, which is oil and gas and IGT, we don't think we pulled anything forward or there any concerns or whatsoever.\nRobert Spingarn : So just to tie the loop on this, should we expect sequential growth in industrial throughout the year?\nJohn Plant: Well, I did say Q2, we see very similar to Q1. So I don't think you should be expecting anything given what has been a really, really great first quarter, maybe I shouldn't say it myself, but it was good. So I think you should think about Q2 being pretty similar and us taking on cost per pair for the second half.  And then we're going to wait and see how our customers' volumes pan out. We think we've tried to give you a balanced view of the way forward. And I think that -- so I don't think you should expect any sequential growth over and above what's been quite exceptional growth already.\nRobert Spingarn : Okay. Thanks so much, John. \nJohn Plant: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag : Hey, John. Following up on your salient point on marching to the weakest link, I mean having to invest ahead of time with volumes being uncertain, it seems kind of productive for the supply chain. First, where do you see the weakest link industry? What do you think is keeping Boeing from actually getting to 38 sooner?  And then also, what do you think for the 737 MAX? And what do you think the OEMs could do better to make it easier for the supply chain to meet these volume increases?\nJohn Plant: Well, really, I don't have any comments regarding any specific knowledge about Boeing's production. And it's up or down except that I'm very supportive and I know that we can support them, whether it's directed for airframe parts or through parts supplied by the engine manufacturer. And I don't have any specific information if there are supply challenges in any specific suppliers. Obviously, we've all read about the tail plane tail section issues and it's passing to the fuselage. And obviously, my guess and as I guess is the finite amount of parts that they can get and how many of those parts are directed to original equipment build for the 737 and how much are for retrofit of the aircraft, which are out with airlines or even the inventory they've got, we don't know and we don't control any of that.  So we're just hopeful that our customers keep to their statements and their plans. And as I said, I think they will absolutely will schedule the parts of the partners. And then should they build at that rate, they'll have a pass. But if they fail to build at those rates, then of course, there is the potential to be cut back as they rebate their inventories for parts they've had, which they didn't use. And so -- it's a very difficult question for us to answer. And so I think the takeaway really is we are ready, we're committed to support our customers. At the same time, we're not willing to get ahead of ourselves. We are willing to do the recruitment necessary, but I hope that we don't end up with what we did last year and in the fourth quarter, where we shed some employees because we were a little bit too far ahead of where our customers were.  And so that's how we think about it. But I can't call out anything specific of there is this issue if that was fixed, that would solve the problem. And I guess it's all wrapped up in the statement later in the year. And I guess you can ask Boeing specifically which month that is.\nKristine Liwag : Great. Thanks, John, and if I could follow up on Myles' question earlier. If you exclude inflationary pass through costs, incremental margins were 25% for the whole business. So at some point, as the supply chain issue alleviates for Boeing and Airbus, we could get these higher volumes materialize. And at that point, you might have CapEx and labor already in place.  So when we kind of look out to 2024-2025, where could incremental margins be for the aero businesses. Is this something that could be in the 30% or 40%?\nJohn Plant: When we talked about this a year or so ago, we did say we'd probably see a couple of years at 35% incrementals, plus or minus 5%. And you've seen all of that play out in terms of being in the low-30s to the high-30s in Spain, might have been dependent upon the change of volume by quarter.  And when we're prepared -- and I'll say it's a reasonable growth. We convert really well. When it's been excessive growth, we've struggled because we had to ingest more labor it's untrained for the -- and going to all that gross cost and real cost and scrap, et cetera. So that's how it play out the last couple of years. In the first quarter of this year, here we are again, we're preparing for volume and taking people on. And all of that is good because we know at some point, it's going to happen because the demand is so strong. And adjusting for them is a metal and non-metal inflation flow-through, it's 25%. And if you reverse engineer from our guide for the year, you'll see that it's around about 29%. And so if you got a 29% for the year and you start off at 25%, that then implies just by the math is that the second half, we anticipate to be over 30%. And again, you can reverse engineer that from the numbers already given without recalling a specific percentage of. So should that continue? And then obviously, it depends on the growth rate going into 2024 as to what the incrementals will be, but it should be in a good zone. And at the moment, I'm voting for the higher volume and because ultimately, having those higher volumes with our leverage of applying our margin rate to the higher volumes clearly overcomes the working capital drag and the capital expenditure drag. And so it all ends up improving free cash flow, Kristine.\nKristine Liwag : Great, thank you, John. \nJohn Plant: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning, John and Ken and PT, thank you. Hi, just the 23% EBITDA margin. You guys had a nice base at the midpoint 10 bps, but down 10% on the high end. So maybe if you could just update us on your working assumptions for the margin mix and the $70 million to $100 million of incremental inflation that you had previously called out. Any progress there and changes given commodity prices have come in a little bit. Thank you. \nJohn Plant : Yeah. I mean we've seen some commodities come in, but also quite a few have moved out against, example, you take half team amenia, those have become very expensive in the last few months. In fact, we've been laying in some security stocks of certain of those metals to make sure that we have adequate coverage to be able to support our customers in the quest for increased volumes. At the same time, well, I think generally we see it as a big positive that inflation is beginning to come down. It's still pretty high, let's call it, 6%-7% in that zone. And those non-metal inflation is where the big action is today in trying to look at that control it, at the same time, recover it.  So for me, the major story of margin rate is volume and then do we see those flow-throughs that we anticipate. And obviously, it would be great if the -- if everybody built what they say they're going to build then and with this increased spares demand both for domestic and international, and secure some of these time on wing issues and that spares demand is also quite robust for us at the moment. So hoping that the revenue turns out to be that or better. But I mean calling out a 0.1 or 0.2 on the margin rate is difficult. You're talking frac like a million or two here or there. So I'd say it doesn't really matter, Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. Thank you very much. \nJohn Plant : Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman : Hey, thanks. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. During the prepared remarks, I think Ken mentioned the $20 million of share gain on -- from Russia and titanium and engineered structures. I think that's the wrap around on the share gain that you made last year.  So can you talk a little bit about the state of opportunity there? And maybe specifically with some of the more refined forgings, where Howmet might be in the running to do that and there aren't many others, and whether the OEMs have moved forward there with the alternative sources or not yet?\nJohn Plant : Okay. So you're absolutely correct. The $20 million was the increase in the fourth quarter '22 volume. And the way to think about 2023 is you take that $20 million multiply by 4 and then add on to that, about a 25% plus or minus growth for 2023.  And currently, I think you just take that '23 number and you probably add another 25% to 30% in for 2024. That's the way I'm thinking about it. And we've taken a lot of very positive steps with the order intake notably from Airbus but also from Embraer and also more recently, our first orders with Boeing and that's both for meal product and some forgings. And we continue to work actively on quotations particularly with Boeing who are getting, I'd say, more engaged given the fact that they've known they've had a very large inventory of titanium given the restricted build of the 787 and other wide-bodies.  But we see them preparing for ordering and release of gradually increasing those requirements to win the back end of this year and into 2024. So it's all playing out as expected and see the titanium opportunity is very positive. It's only blemish at the moment by reverts. It'll be very tough to get hold of. It's expensive. So we've laid in for additional sponge requirements and are seeking really to ramp up our production in our titanium furnaces during the balance of 2023. That's nothing important to us.\nSeth Seifman : Great. Thank you very much. \nJohn Plant : Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard : Thanks, John. Good morning. \nJohn Plant : Hey, Rob. \nRobert Stallard : I'd like to ask you about lead times. If Boeing does move ahead with this move to 38 per month on the 737, wouldn't you have to start producing these parts considerably in advance? And more importantly, for you, I suppose, wouldn't you have to start ordering the metal sooner as well, almost like now if you're going to hit that by the end of the year?\nJohn Plant : Yes. Yes. You're right. And so we are recognizing that we are increasing rates and some of that is occurring now. It's only balanced by the amount of inventory that we have. And as you know, we carried, let's call it, $100 million- plus of inventory from '22 into '23. And because of the volume that we saw, we chose not to reduce inventories in the first quarter. We wanted to keep everything healthy. And we've tried to input materials such that we can respond to both the production requirements are scheduled and also what we think is going to be some spot by purchases, which will be required in the balance of the year. So we are ready and poised to be able to respond, I think, hopefully in a good and efficient manner. But as I said before, we don't know that exactly what all of the issues are in terms of the -- that gave the final production rate. But we're prepared.\nRobert Stallard : Okay, just -- sorry, just to follow up on that. So how much lead time would you need from an OEM customer to, say, theoretically move your production or deliveries from where you are at the moment, low-30 to 38.\nJohn Plant : They much depends upon the path. And so where we are accessing base metal, it will be, let's say, more in that let's say, six to nine months. But if it's alloy metal, you're now talking about really 15 to 20 months of laying in order requirements to anticipate. So we're already having to anticipate what 2024 might look like for our material ordering and laying those requirements on our supply base. And it's all, again, predicated on how many are built this year? Do you build in excess? Or are anything pushed? And what the growth rate will be next year?  So I said in my prepared remarks, managing an upturn has far more and many dimensions than managing a downturn, whether it's labor, materials, production facilities, capital et cetera. And so it's quite fascinating and I say it's really -- I'll say, in 1 sense, a really high-class problem to have. So here we are debating what the angle of the growth rate and we worry excessively about some of the minute -- at the same time, we've got to keep our mind focused on the main goal, which is these are really good conditions to be anywhere.  We look at the growth rates that we're talking about. And we know that we're going to grow again in 2024, and we know we're going to grow again in 2025. And so in my book, all of that's pretty good well.\nRobert Stallard : Yeah, thanks a lot, John. \nJohn Plant : Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss : Thanks for taking the question. \nJohn Plant : Hey, David. \nDavid Strauss : Hey, John. So two things. If you can update us on the status of the UAW in Whitehall, what's going on there? And then any color you want to give around the recent change in leadership at Fasteners? Thanks.\nJohn Plant : Okay. So in Whitehall, we continue to be in negotiations with the UAW and have extended the agreement with no work interruptions. So that's just going on as normal. And in fact, we've been discussing that again in the last few days. So I'd say normal sort of negotiations around that topic.  Just remind me, David, your second one, got focused on the ---\nDavid Strauss : Yeah, thanks. The change in leadership that you announced.\nJohn Plant : Change in leadership, yeah, we made a -- we actually changed out the leadership of the Fastener Group at the fourth quarter of 2022, and have been managing through, let's say, a temporary solution there with an acting, let's say, President of Fasteners. And it's also given me the opportunity of even being a more intimate with that business, and now appointed what we think is going to be a great leader for that business. And you've started -- the person has started. They were engaged with us the week before starting that quarterly business operating reviews. And so that -- I think that was a good learning and information exchange.  And so I'm optimistic that with the changes that we've made and the increased focus on performance orientation of the business that the things that I see possible become not just possible, but probable. And you heard me talk already in response to a question, I think it's for Myles about the faster margin rate, which I'm optimistic for the second half of this year, especially if we carry on recruiting in the second quarter and taking those costs aren't getting ready. And the improvement in volume and then the improvements in mix with wide-body coming more to the fore in particular we are beginning to see stirrings of life in the I'll call the subtiers of the 787 suppliers around the world, which will require the fastest from us to be able to produce their parts, which they then ship to Boeing. So it's a long supply chain, and we do see that wide-body mix beginning to improve in the second half and then improve again in 2024, both for the requirements of Airbus for the A350 anticipated increases and further increases in 787 because those are quite dramatic, the change, which you get from those wide-body aircraft and the degree of composites they can plan.\nDavid Strauss : Do you anticipate having to make additional hires in the second half, John, to hit the stated production rates that are out there? Or will that all be in place with the additional hires that you talked about in the second quarter?\nJohn Plant : If it is as we think, we should be at rates in the first half be there's always some attrition. And so there is a replacement. And the case for hiring in the second half will be, I will say, basically predicated on two factors is, one, what is the actual rate of production required in the second half? And secondly, particularly when we get to the fourth quarter, we'll have to be anticipating to some degree, the rate of growth into 2024, which, as I said, we expect '24 to be another very positive year for particularly on the commercial aerospace side. And so it's difficult to be precise until I know more about the final requirements for the second half and then what's the angle of increase for '24?\nDavid Strauss : Thank you. \nJohn Plant : Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna : Hey, guys. Good morning. \nJohn Plant : Hey, Gautam. \nGautam Khanna : I promise I'll keep it to one this time.\nJohn Plant : I know you a bit of brief of your one three-part question last time. I think it was---\nGautam Khanna : I deserved it. Just wanted to get your pricing expectations over the next couple of years? And if you could specify price opportunities, I should say. And then if you could specify where -- at which segments the pricing opportunity is greatest. Thank you. \nJohn Plant : Okay. I think when I talked in February, I indicated too that we were about 80%-85% done in terms of moving through the long-term agreements for 2023. And now we're up at the 95%-98%. So essentially, 2023 is complete, and everything is in line with what I've previously said in terms of a similar order of magnitude in terms of further pricing that we talked about for '22. And that, as you know, is over and above any recoveries for either metals or nonmetals inflation. That's quite separate. This is just pricing. We don't normally talk about 2024 at this point. We've been studying that recently. And it's -- while it's a little bit early is that my guess it's a similar order of magnitude heading in that direction for 2024, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna : Okay. Any segment that stands out with the greatest pricing opportunity over the next couple of years?\nJohn Plant : Yeah. Price is positive for four segments, inevitably for engine has to be greater because it's the largest segment. And -- but it also carries with it some of the more exceptional technologies where we're now pushing the boundaries once again of what's possible to enable really the mission of, let's say, further, let's say, lower fuel usage and improved carbon footprint. And I see that those impact not only for the fact that you've got the flight engine developments, which are being made by our customers. Those are really going to assist that whole achievement of lower greenhouse gas emissions for the aerospace and airlines in particular.  So I think it's still a good news on the Howmet are intimate to helping to achieve that in the stage of that particularly after the combustor.\nGautam Khanna : Thank you, guys. \nJohn Plant : Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMatt Akers : Yeah, hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. John, I was wondering if you could talk about kind of your latest thoughts on the Nashville facility that Pratt is ramping up. And is that -- I think that's supposed to ramp up production a little bit this year. Have they given you any indication of kind of what the volumes are there and maybe what kind of time frame you think that could -- is there any risk to kind of your oil volumes?\nJohn Plant : Well, I don't think anything in terms of the narrative of change from all the words that I've expanded on this topic over the last two or three years, starting with Pratt & Whitney deciding to sell oil castings business, which is in Poland in 2016. And then deciding in '17 that they would re-enter, but with using new core technologies from a company they bought and they've been obviously did continue to develop that.  And I think it's like because most of our -- I mean, you take both GE and I think we've coexisted with them for many, many years with them having their own development and collection capabilities. But in terms of when you get to, I would say, real production of high volume of very complex parts. And I'd say Howmet did really good job. And I'm not going to use the word leg of its own. But I mean in terms of the achievement of the complexity with the yield rates, that's really important to the whole economics of the casting business. The information I have is that the $650 million that's still being applied to machining, coating, hole drilling and testing. The only inflation I got is that I read or heard from an earnings call that they were on the machining side that they were now 63% completed in terms of that investment. As you know, the machining investments are very expensive for machining turbine parts and they're expecting first pass off some qualification for those machine parts in May of this year. And so I guess it's proceeding to plan. At the same time, I've also noted with you the extension of our long-term agreements with Pratt. And I've also shared with you conceptually without giving you detail of the further technology improvements we are making both for the Block 4 Joint Strike Fighter with 28 improvements in the requirements for efficiency and trust in that program and also on the advantage engine. So there's a lot going on and we're intimate with those developments with our customer.\nMatt Akers : Great. Thank you. \nJohn Plant : Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nPhil Gibbs : Hey, good morning. \nJohn Plant : Hey, Phil. \nPhil Gibbs : Hey. You pointed to strength in spares demand in engine products in both commercial aero and defense. Can you give us an idea about where that business is relative to pre-pandemic levels and whether or not you'd expect that to continue?\nJohn Plant : We're seeing a nice improvement in our spares business. So if you go back to the reference point that we gave you of 2019, we were about $800 million. And the time is roughly half of it was defense in industrial. And now it's probably closer 475, maybe 500 misses continue to grow. And commercial aerospace dropped quite dramatically to well below $100 million.  And this year, we see that commercial aero segment, which used to be $400 million, probably back to at least 75% of its pre-COVID pandemic levels. And so not that part of the -- or that half of the spares is not yet back to where it was, but growing rapidly with 30% and 40% compounding, and I expect that 25% depending we won't say how to turn it but 75% could be 80% of the 19 level by the end of the year that what was $400 million.\nPhil Gibbs : Thanks, John. \nJohn Plant : Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the Howmet Aerospace First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you.",

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks P.T. and good morning, everyone. Howmet's Q1 results speak louder for themselves. Revenue was $1.6 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year and an increase of 6% sequentially. Commercial Aerospace increased 29% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Revenue was above guidance by significant demand, which was in itself an increase quarter-over-quarter and naturally increased revenues require some working capital. EBITDA was $360 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year and an increase of 7% sequentially.  EBITDA margin was healthy at 22.5%, again, an increase sequentially. Earnings per share were up 35% year-over-year. Free cash flow was negative $41 million, driven by the higher revenues and will now be followed by three successive quarters of substantial cash inflow.  During the quarter that was reduced by $176 million from the 2024 bonds with cash on hand. And this will further reduce future interest payments by $9 million annually, and hence increasing free cash flow yield.  In addition, $25 million of common stocks were repurchased. During the balance of 2023, shareholders can expect further steps regarding the application of cash flows, and thereby creating shareholder value. All of the above growth, margin rate, free cash flow and the application to create value all speak to the business and financial model of the company. I will comment further on the outlook after Ken has outlined the growth by markets and performance by business segments. Thanks, Ken, and let's move to Page 11. Moving to ESG, we continue to leverage our differentiated technologies to help our customers manufacture lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft and commercial trucks with lower carbon footprints.  Within our own operations, Howmet remains committed to managing our energy consumption and environmental impacts as we increase production. In 2022, our actions have reduced the intensity of Howmet's greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, water use and hazardous waste. We progressed against our 2024 greenhouse gas emission goal by achieving a 20% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions through 2022 from the 2019 baseline approaching already the 2024 goal of a 21.5% reduction. Howmet is also committed to a safe workplace while fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment where all our employees can thrive. Our safety record continues to improve and is 7 times better than the industry average. Moreover, Howmet was named one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation.  We also increased our workforce by 1,500 people and invested nearly $200 million in 2022 to support the significant production growth. Regarding governance, the company was recognized by 50-50 women on boards having 40% of our board of directors made up of women. Lastly, 75% of our key suppliers have sustainability programs considered to be leading proactive. I'd encourage you to read our sustainability report found at howmet.com in the Investors section. Let's move to Slide 12 and talk about our updated outlook. Firstly, demand for aircraft is very high and aircraft manufacturers' backlogs are in very good order, both for narrow-body and wide-body aircraft. Spares volume and the business jet market also continues to show strength. Airline load factors continue to be very high and robust in the west with rapid growth now seen in both short-haul and long-haul flights in Asia.  This travel-led demand stimulus is further augmented by the need for modern, fully-efficient aircraft, given the current cost of jet-fuel and the very high cost of SAF substitute fuel. This is further driven by the commitment of airlines to meet carbon emission targets for today, 2030 and 2050, which can only be achieved by using the new fuel-efficient engines and aircraft. Current new engines fit to narrow-body jets are all looking at steps to further increase efficiency, which also helps Howmet given our capabilities in complex casting shapes to provide improved their management and hence, fuel efficiency. The other divisions of Howmet are also benefiting by the increased use of titanium and sophisticated fastener suites required by composite wings and fuselages, notably, but not exclusively for wide-body aircraft. The defense market outlook is also healthy with increased budgets and strong demand for F-35s, drones, rocket motor parts and Howmet part. The last part of the F-35 injury inventory correction regarding bulkheads that resulted from the prior underbuild of the F-35 fighters in 2020 and 2021 should be dissipated over the next two to three quarters. IGT turbine blade demand continues to be steady and turbine demand from the oil and gas sector is very high. The year started well in commercial truck. Given the backlog and steady truck ordering in both North America and Europe, it should mean that any demand drop indicated after spring is now pushed out for at least one quarter or so, albeit the normal Q3 seasonality regarding Europe will obviously apply.  The required emissions performance targets for trucks in 2024, especially in the U.S., will apply with no ability to have a stimulated prebuild. In reassessing all of the above, plus robust engine demand was seen in Q1, the outlook for the year has increased. We remain cautious about commercial aircraft build in the second half until we see clear evidence of consistent production rate increases, which will be controlled by the efficiency of both the aircraft assembly lines and the supplier parts, which leads to the final production being set by the weakest link in all of the supply chain. We, as you know, saw this the effect of this phenomenon in late Q3 of 2022 and also in Q4 when Howmet delivery requirements were curtailed to balance customer inventories. More specifically and turning to guidance for the second quarter. We now see revenue of $1.61 billion, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA of $362 million, plus or minus $3 million and earnings per share of $0.42 plus or minus $0.01. For the year, we see revenue of $6.25 billion, plus $75 million minus $50 million, EBITDA of 1.415 [ph], plus 20 minus $15 million. Earnings per share of $1.67 at midpoint, plus $0.03 minus $0.02. And free cash flow increased by $20 million to $635 million, plus or minus $35 million. Please move to Slide 13. In summary, Q1 performance was healthy and a great start to 2023, and the outlook as seen by Howmet is improving. The balance sheet was improved with debt reductions of $176 million and net leverage will now continue towards the 2 times net debt to EBITDA in the balance of 2023, given both the reduction in debt and the improved EBITDA. The balance sheet is strong. Continuing share repurchases can be expected as cash is generated and the current authority is sufficient to continue this program. Annual cash to service legacy Penton and OPEB liabilities is modest at approximately $56 million.  We look forward to updating you again in August. And thank you very much. Let's move to your questions. Yeah. Before I comment specifically on any aircraft build guide. Let me just back up. And we talk how we thought about the balance of the year. And I think this is really important in setting the tone because managing through an upturn has many more dimensions, especially when you have one major segment, which is commercial aerospace having such significant potential volume increases. And as you know, volumes for aircraft builds have been taken up, down, delayed with some regularity over the last year, two years. And so how we thought about is that we see essentially Q2 playing out very similar to Q1 and preparing for, I say, the improvement in build. And in doing so, we need to add to our costs.  And so in Q1, as you saw from Ken's commentary, we recruited some 500 people. And we're heading probably to a similar sort of run-rate of employee addition in Q2 and all expecting that we are receiving and will be receiving the schedules to meet these potential lifted second half volumes. And of course, you will know, as everybody else knows, is that Boeing has announced that for the 737 that they will take their production rate up to 38 at some time later in the year without specifying exactly when that is. And the cost of these headcounts are clearly are not matched by revenues in the second quarter. So we're prepared to support our customers where they may go in volume. And so we're confident that those parts are going to be scheduled, both by the engine manufacturers and the airframe manufacturers. But as I said in my prepared remarks, is that we're also cognizant of what happened in the last four months of last year when cutbacks occurred because people did not achieve or our customers were unable to achieve some of their more ambitious increases that they had thought about.  And I did say about all marching to the place of the weakest link and whether that's in the supply base or in the final assembly of aircraft, it doesn't really matter. So we set ourselves up. We want to be cautious about the second half and we'll maintain that stance until we see actual increases in production. And when we see those increases, I think we're going to have a lot more confidence that we're not going to get cut back. And hopefully, that might produce a good outcome and possibly even better than we currently see. But say, who knows and we are one of the few almost the not quite one, but say the handful of aerospace suppliers, who are actually increased guidance.  So in summary, what -- our thinking is whether it's commercial aero, whether it's strength in the oil and gas, increased strength in our commercial truck and pushing back some of the potential for any cutbacks there and also the strength in defense. It's a guide up across many of those sectors, which also have to be taken into account while still maintaining that for the year, we need to be suitably cautious because we're only one quarter in. And we're going to see how this plays out, even though we are optimistic that everybody achieves their plans. At the same time, I don't want to put ourselves in and give you a sense of robustness, which may not occur in the end. So hopefully, that gives you the way we thought about it, Noah. And I've also referenced the only public change in production rate, which is for the 737 later in the year. And essentially, we are not calling out any changes in any other specific numbers because we don't know of any. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. So passing Systems margin is not where I'd like it to be. And at the same time, we also need to recognize exactly where we are in terms of the production mix, which is still very much metallic focused of narrow bodies for the main. And we've seen really no demand change for -- or no -- essentially no demand change for our widebody business currently-- except for something on Airbus say, A350.  We do expect that, that mix will change and improve in the balance of the year. And preparing ourselves, if you look at the net recruitment, I think we called out like 250-260 net people in Engine, which, of course, is 2.5 times larger our faster business, say we were at 215-220 people. So we recruited disproportionately in fasteners preparing for that improvement.  So essentially, when I think about the year and margin rate is that I don't see much change, a little bit of change positively, maybe in Q2, but essentially, having absorbed the costs of raising production and stabilizing the workforce, plus the increase in volume plus the improvement in mix, I do think that we will see some margin rate improvement in the second half of the year. So basically, don't expect much in Q2, and we've been positioning ourselves optimistically for improvement in the back end of the year, Myles. Company. Well, I'm hopeful that they're going to go up. But then you can say, well, everybody hopes for that sort of thing. But generally, our hopes for Howmet tend to come to reality. But I have no comments specifically about saying does it match this segment as well on average. What I know is that I'll be somewhat disappointed if we're not earning a margin rate in 2024 above our current Q1 level and we don't expect it to be like that. Thank you. Hey, Rob. So if I pick apart if you agree, let's call it, our wider industrial business. We saw really strong demand in terms of the oil and gas sector, which is really for derivative turbines. And that was quite extraordinary at 50% plus. And we don't see anything that being positive for the next, say, few quarters and have you thought about 34 at this point, but -- so oil and gas has been quite strong. And then that's backed up by our gas turbine business at 14%. So those are the two. But beyond that, the wider industrial business was really low-single-digits. So nothing exceptional there at all. But for the two specific sectors, which make a difference to us, which is oil and gas and IGT, we don't think we pulled anything forward or there any concerns or whatsoever. Well, I did say Q2, we see very similar to Q1. So I don't think you should be expecting anything given what has been a really, really great first quarter, maybe I shouldn't say it myself, but it was good. So I think you should think about Q2 being pretty similar and us taking on cost per pair for the second half.  And then we're going to wait and see how our customers' volumes pan out. We think we've tried to give you a balanced view of the way forward. And I think that -- so I don't think you should expect any sequential growth over and above what's been quite exceptional growth already. Thank you. Well, really, I don't have any comments regarding any specific knowledge about Boeing's production. And it's up or down except that I'm very supportive and I know that we can support them, whether it's directed for airframe parts or through parts supplied by the engine manufacturer. And I don't have any specific information if there are supply challenges in any specific suppliers. Obviously, we've all read about the tail plane tail section issues and it's passing to the fuselage. And obviously, my guess and as I guess is the finite amount of parts that they can get and how many of those parts are directed to original equipment build for the 737 and how much are for retrofit of the aircraft, which are out with airlines or even the inventory they've got, we don't know and we don't control any of that.  So we're just hopeful that our customers keep to their statements and their plans. And as I said, I think they will absolutely will schedule the parts of the partners. And then should they build at that rate, they'll have a pass. But if they fail to build at those rates, then of course, there is the potential to be cut back as they rebate their inventories for parts they've had, which they didn't use. And so -- it's a very difficult question for us to answer. And so I think the takeaway really is we are ready, we're committed to support our customers. At the same time, we're not willing to get ahead of ourselves. We are willing to do the recruitment necessary, but I hope that we don't end up with what we did last year and in the fourth quarter, where we shed some employees because we were a little bit too far ahead of where our customers were.  And so that's how we think about it. But I can't call out anything specific of there is this issue if that was fixed, that would solve the problem. And I guess it's all wrapped up in the statement later in the year. And I guess you can ask Boeing specifically which month that is. When we talked about this a year or so ago, we did say we'd probably see a couple of years at 35% incrementals, plus or minus 5%. And you've seen all of that play out in terms of being in the low-30s to the high-30s in Spain, might have been dependent upon the change of volume by quarter.  And when we're prepared -- and I'll say it's a reasonable growth. We convert really well. When it's been excessive growth, we've struggled because we had to ingest more labor it's untrained for the -- and going to all that gross cost and real cost and scrap, et cetera. So that's how it play out the last couple of years. In the first quarter of this year, here we are again, we're preparing for volume and taking people on. And all of that is good because we know at some point, it's going to happen because the demand is so strong. And adjusting for them is a metal and non-metal inflation flow-through, it's 25%. And if you reverse engineer from our guide for the year, you'll see that it's around about 29%. And so if you got a 29% for the year and you start off at 25%, that then implies just by the math is that the second half, we anticipate to be over 30%. And again, you can reverse engineer that from the numbers already given without recalling a specific percentage of. So should that continue? And then obviously, it depends on the growth rate going into 2024 as to what the incrementals will be, but it should be in a good zone. And at the moment, I'm voting for the higher volume and because ultimately, having those higher volumes with our leverage of applying our margin rate to the higher volumes clearly overcomes the working capital drag and the capital expenditure drag. And so it all ends up improving free cash flow, Kristine. Thank you. Yeah. I mean we've seen some commodities come in, but also quite a few have moved out against, example, you take half team amenia, those have become very expensive in the last few months. In fact, we've been laying in some security stocks of certain of those metals to make sure that we have adequate coverage to be able to support our customers in the quest for increased volumes. At the same time, well, I think generally we see it as a big positive that inflation is beginning to come down. It's still pretty high, let's call it, 6%-7% in that zone. And those non-metal inflation is where the big action is today in trying to look at that control it, at the same time, recover it.  So for me, the major story of margin rate is volume and then do we see those flow-throughs that we anticipate. And obviously, it would be great if the -- if everybody built what they say they're going to build then and with this increased spares demand both for domestic and international, and secure some of these time on wing issues and that spares demand is also quite robust for us at the moment. So hoping that the revenue turns out to be that or better. But I mean calling out a 0.1 or 0.2 on the margin rate is difficult. You're talking frac like a million or two here or there. So I'd say it doesn't really matter, Sheila. Thank you. Okay. So you're absolutely correct. The $20 million was the increase in the fourth quarter '22 volume. And the way to think about 2023 is you take that $20 million multiply by 4 and then add on to that, about a 25% plus or minus growth for 2023.  And currently, I think you just take that '23 number and you probably add another 25% to 30% in for 2024. That's the way I'm thinking about it. And we've taken a lot of very positive steps with the order intake notably from Airbus but also from Embraer and also more recently, our first orders with Boeing and that's both for meal product and some forgings. And we continue to work actively on quotations particularly with Boeing who are getting, I'd say, more engaged given the fact that they've known they've had a very large inventory of titanium given the restricted build of the 787 and other wide-bodies.  But we see them preparing for ordering and release of gradually increasing those requirements to win the back end of this year and into 2024. So it's all playing out as expected and see the titanium opportunity is very positive. It's only blemish at the moment by reverts. It'll be very tough to get hold of. It's expensive. So we've laid in for additional sponge requirements and are seeking really to ramp up our production in our titanium furnaces during the balance of 2023. That's nothing important to us. Thank you. Hey, Rob. Yes. Yes. You're right. And so we are recognizing that we are increasing rates and some of that is occurring now. It's only balanced by the amount of inventory that we have. And as you know, we carried, let's call it, $100 million- plus of inventory from '22 into '23. And because of the volume that we saw, we chose not to reduce inventories in the first quarter. We wanted to keep everything healthy. And we've tried to input materials such that we can respond to both the production requirements are scheduled and also what we think is going to be some spot by purchases, which will be required in the balance of the year. So we are ready and poised to be able to respond, I think, hopefully in a good and efficient manner. But as I said before, we don't know that exactly what all of the issues are in terms of the -- that gave the final production rate. But we're prepared. They much depends upon the path. And so where we are accessing base metal, it will be, let's say, more in that let's say, six to nine months. But if it's alloy metal, you're now talking about really 15 to 20 months of laying in order requirements to anticipate. So we're already having to anticipate what 2024 might look like for our material ordering and laying those requirements on our supply base. And it's all, again, predicated on how many are built this year? Do you build in excess? Or are anything pushed? And what the growth rate will be next year?  So I said in my prepared remarks, managing an upturn has far more and many dimensions than managing a downturn, whether it's labor, materials, production facilities, capital et cetera. And so it's quite fascinating and I say it's really -- I'll say, in 1 sense, a really high-class problem to have. So here we are debating what the angle of the growth rate and we worry excessively about some of the minute -- at the same time, we've got to keep our mind focused on the main goal, which is these are really good conditions to be anywhere.  We look at the growth rates that we're talking about. And we know that we're going to grow again in 2024, and we know we're going to grow again in 2025. And so in my book, all of that's pretty good well. Thank you. Hey, David. Okay. So in Whitehall, we continue to be in negotiations with the UAW and have extended the agreement with no work interruptions. So that's just going on as normal. And in fact, we've been discussing that again in the last few days. So I'd say normal sort of negotiations around that topic.  Just remind me, David, your second one, got focused on the --- Change in leadership, yeah, we made a -- we actually changed out the leadership of the Fastener Group at the fourth quarter of 2022, and have been managing through, let's say, a temporary solution there with an acting, let's say, President of Fasteners. And it's also given me the opportunity of even being a more intimate with that business, and now appointed what we think is going to be a great leader for that business. And you've started -- the person has started. They were engaged with us the week before starting that quarterly business operating reviews. And so that -- I think that was a good learning and information exchange.  And so I'm optimistic that with the changes that we've made and the increased focus on performance orientation of the business that the things that I see possible become not just possible, but probable. And you heard me talk already in response to a question, I think it's for Myles about the faster margin rate, which I'm optimistic for the second half of this year, especially if we carry on recruiting in the second quarter and taking those costs aren't getting ready. And the improvement in volume and then the improvements in mix with wide-body coming more to the fore in particular we are beginning to see stirrings of life in the I'll call the subtiers of the 787 suppliers around the world, which will require the fastest from us to be able to produce their parts, which they then ship to Boeing. So it's a long supply chain, and we do see that wide-body mix beginning to improve in the second half and then improve again in 2024, both for the requirements of Airbus for the A350 anticipated increases and further increases in 787 because those are quite dramatic, the change, which you get from those wide-body aircraft and the degree of composites they can plan. If it is as we think, we should be at rates in the first half be there's always some attrition. And so there is a replacement. And the case for hiring in the second half will be, I will say, basically predicated on two factors is, one, what is the actual rate of production required in the second half? And secondly, particularly when we get to the fourth quarter, we'll have to be anticipating to some degree, the rate of growth into 2024, which, as I said, we expect '24 to be another very positive year for particularly on the commercial aerospace side. And so it's difficult to be precise until I know more about the final requirements for the second half and then what's the angle of increase for '24? Thank you. Hey, Gautam. I know you a bit of brief of your one three-part question last time. I think it was--- Okay. I think when I talked in February, I indicated too that we were about 80%-85% done in terms of moving through the long-term agreements for 2023. And now we're up at the 95%-98%. So essentially, 2023 is complete, and everything is in line with what I've previously said in terms of a similar order of magnitude in terms of further pricing that we talked about for '22. And that, as you know, is over and above any recoveries for either metals or nonmetals inflation. That's quite separate. This is just pricing. We don't normally talk about 2024 at this point. We've been studying that recently. And it's -- while it's a little bit early is that my guess it's a similar order of magnitude heading in that direction for 2024, Gautam. Yeah. Price is positive for four segments, inevitably for engine has to be greater because it's the largest segment. And -- but it also carries with it some of the more exceptional technologies where we're now pushing the boundaries once again of what's possible to enable really the mission of, let's say, further, let's say, lower fuel usage and improved carbon footprint. And I see that those impact not only for the fact that you've got the flight engine developments, which are being made by our customers. Those are really going to assist that whole achievement of lower greenhouse gas emissions for the aerospace and airlines in particular.  So I think it's still a good news on the Howmet are intimate to helping to achieve that in the stage of that particularly after the combustor. Thank you. Well, I don't think anything in terms of the narrative of change from all the words that I've expanded on this topic over the last two or three years, starting with Pratt & Whitney deciding to sell oil castings business, which is in Poland in 2016. And then deciding in '17 that they would re-enter, but with using new core technologies from a company they bought and they've been obviously did continue to develop that.  And I think it's like because most of our -- I mean, you take both GE and I think we've coexisted with them for many, many years with them having their own development and collection capabilities. But in terms of when you get to, I would say, real production of high volume of very complex parts. And I'd say Howmet did really good job. And I'm not going to use the word leg of its own. But I mean in terms of the achievement of the complexity with the yield rates, that's really important to the whole economics of the casting business. The information I have is that the $650 million that's still being applied to machining, coating, hole drilling and testing. The only inflation I got is that I read or heard from an earnings call that they were on the machining side that they were now 63% completed in terms of that investment. As you know, the machining investments are very expensive for machining turbine parts and they're expecting first pass off some qualification for those machine parts in May of this year. And so I guess it's proceeding to plan. At the same time, I've also noted with you the extension of our long-term agreements with Pratt. And I've also shared with you conceptually without giving you detail of the further technology improvements we are making both for the Block 4 Joint Strike Fighter with 28 improvements in the requirements for efficiency and trust in that program and also on the advantage engine. So there's a lot going on and we're intimate with those developments with our customer. Thank you. Hey, Phil. We're seeing a nice improvement in our spares business. So if you go back to the reference point that we gave you of 2019, we were about $800 million. And the time is roughly half of it was defense in industrial. And now it's probably closer 475, maybe 500 misses continue to grow. And commercial aerospace dropped quite dramatically to well below $100 million.  And this year, we see that commercial aero segment, which used to be $400 million, probably back to at least 75% of its pre-COVID pandemic levels. And so not that part of the -- or that half of the spares is not yet back to where it was, but growing rapidly with 30% and 40% compounding, and I expect that 25% depending we won't say how to turn it but 75% could be 80% of the 19 level by the end of the year that what was $400 million. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of the markets for the first quarter. Revenue was up 21% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Commercial Aerospace continue to lead year-over-year revenue growth with an increase of 29% driven by engine products, engineered structures and fastening systems. Sequentially, Commercial Aerospace was up 4%.  Commercial Aerospace has grown for eighth consecutive quarters and expanded 47% of total revenue, and although growing continues to be short of the pre-pandemic level of 60% of total revenue.  Defense Aerospace was up 11% year-over-year, driven by the F-35 program and growth in legacy spares. Sequentially, Defense Aerospace was flat due to strong year-end seasonality.  Commercial Transportation which impacts both the forged wheels and fastening system segments was up 17% year-over-year, and up 9% sequentially driven by higher volumes.  Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 16% year-over-year, driven by oil and gas which was 53%, IGT up 14% and General Industrial up 1%. Sequentially, these markets were up 15% with oil and gas up 25%, IGT up 15%, and General Industrial of 10%. In summary, strong growth across all of our end markets.  Now let's move to Slide 6. We will start with the P&L and the focus on enhanced profitability for the first quarter. Revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share all exceeding the high end of guidance. Revenue was $1.6 billion or up 21% year-over-year. EBITDA was up 20% year-over-year and EBITDA margin was 22.5%. Adjusting for the year-over-year, inflationary costs pass through of approximately $35 million, EBITDA margin was 23% and the flow through of incremental revenue to EBITDA was approximately 25%, while absorbing near term recruiting, training, and production costs for approximately 500 net headcount additions.  Earnings per share was $0.42, which was 35% year-over-year. The first quarter represented the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share.  Moving through the balance sheet, the ending cash balance was $538 million, after approximately $218 million of capital allocation, debt reduction of $176 million, common stock repurchases of $25 million and quarterly dividends of $17 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $41 million, driven by higher revenues in the first quarter.  Finally, net debt-to-EBITDA remained at a record low of 2.6 times. All bond debt is unsecured and its fixed rates which will provide stability of interest rate expense into the future. Our next bond maturity is in October 2024 and the $1 billion revolver remains undrawn.  Moving to capital allocation, we continue to be balanced in our approach. Capital expenditures were $64 million in the quarter and continue to be less than depreciation. Capital installed prior to COVID-19 puts us in a very strong position to support the continued commercial aerospace recovery. Regarding debt, we reduced the 2024 debt tower in the first quarter by approximately $176 million with cash on hand. These repurchases will lower our annualized interest cost by approximately $9 million. The October 2024 debt tower now stands at approximately $900 million, which is below our revolver. Our continued progress on debt reduction, EBITDA growth and healthy liquidity has resulted in an upgrade to our outlook from S&P last week from stable to positive. You can find our remaining debt towers in the appendix. Moving to share repurchases. The first quarter was the eighth consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. Since the separation in 2020, we have repurchased approximately $928 million of common stock with an average acquisition price of $31.79 per share. Share buyback authority from the board of the directors stands at $922 million. Lastly, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the first quarter, the quarterly common stock dividend remained at $0.04 per share after it was doubled in the fourth quarter of last year. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the first quarter. Engine Products continued its strong performance. Revenue was $795 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year and an increase of 9% sequentials. Year-over-year, commercial aerospace was up 31% and Defense Aerospace was up 19% with both markets driven by higher build rates and spares growth. IGT was up 14% and oil and gas was up 57%.  EBITDA increased 23% year-over-year to a record for the segment of $212 million. EBITDA margin was 26.7% despite the addition of approximately 260 net new employees and the associated near-term recruiting, training and production costs. Please move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue increased 18%. Commercial Aerospace was up 15% driven by the narrow-body recovery. Defense Aerospace was up 38% and Commercial Transportation was up 19%. The year-over-year segment EBITDA increased 4% as volume increases were partially offset by inflationary costs and the addition of approximately 215 net new employees and the associated near-term recruiting, training and production costs. Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was up 14% with Commercial Aerospace up 39%, driven by higher build rates and approximately $20 million of Russian titanium share gain. Defense Aerospace was down 23% year-over-year driven by some legacy programs. Segment EBITDA increased 30% year-over-year, while margin improved 190 basis points. Finally, let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels year-over-year revenue increased 17%. The $42 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by 18% increase in volume. Segment EBITDA increased 18% year-over-year, in line with the higher volumes. Margin increased 20 basis points as the impact of lower aluminum prices was mostly offset by inflationary cost pass-through and unfavorable foreign currency. Lastly, before turning it back over to John, one item of note, in the appendix, we've added Slide 16 and have updated the improved interest rate expense assumption for 2023 from $227 million to $222 million. This change reflects the 2023 impact of reducing debt by $150 million late in the first quarter.  As you may recall, we had already included the impact of reducing debt by approximately $26 million in January before we published our original 2023 guidance. Now let me turn it back over to John."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] On today's call, we ask that you please limit yourself to only one question. Also, please be aware that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Please go ahead.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Joe. Good morning and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace third quarter 2024 results conference call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In today's presentation references to EBITDA, operating income, and EPS mean adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, adjusted operating income, excluding special items and adjusted EPS, excluding special items. These measures are among the non-GAAP financial measures that we've included in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you, PT, and welcome, everyone to the Howmet third quarter earnings call. Q3 was another strong quarter for the company. Year-over-year revenue growth was 11%, building on the 14% growth in the first half. Within this number, commercial aerospace growth was 17% continuing a strong trend, including engine spares growth. Other markets will be covered later in the call. EBITDA was a record $487 million, along with a margin of 26.5%, while operating income was $419 million with a margin of 22.8%. Operating income was up 33% year-over-year and increased 390 basis points, with engines and fasteners performing at high levels, supported by an increasingly strong results in structures. Wheels revenue was down, driven by market declines, especially in Europe, which reduced double-digits with extended summer vacations. However, wheels continued to deliver a healthy EBITDA margin of 26%. Earnings per share was $0.71, an increase of 54% year-over-year. Free cash flow was also strong at $162 million, improving year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $600 million. The quarter end cash balance of $475 million is after deploying $282 million to debt pay down, $100 million to share buybacks, and $34 million to dividends. Overall, Howmet had a healthy set of results with EBITDA, EBITDA margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow above expectations. Let me comment on revenue, which is fractionally light of our guide. In September, we restricted our aerospace parts supplied to Boeing, pending further understanding about the duration of the strike. Naturally, we are pleased that the Boeing strike is now over and the business can gradually return to normal. The other notable shortfall was in our wheels business. Wheels revenue was approximately $30 million below Q2, principally due to notably weaker European market conditions, resulting in an 18% decrease in revenue. North America revenues were down by 10%. I'll now pass the call to Ken to provide additional details by end market and business segments before I return to cover the outlook for the company.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. Let's move to Slide 5. So, market growth continued to be healthy in the third quarter with total revenue up 11% year-over-year, building on the first half revenue growth of 14%. Commercial aerospace growth remained strong despite our decision to restrict supply to Boeing due to the strike. Commercial aerospace revenue was up 17%, which built on the 25% commercial aerospace growth in the first half. Defense Aerospace was also strong, up 15% driven by fighter programs and fighter engine spares demand. As expected, the commercial transportation market weakened with revenue down 12% led by the slowdown in Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up a healthy 17%, driven by oil and gas, up 26%, IGT up 20%, and general industrial up 5%. In summary, continued strong performance in commercial aerospace, defense aerospace and industrial, partially offset by commercial transportation. Now, let's move to Slide 6, starting with the P&L. For the third consecutive quarter, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and earnings per share were all records and exceeded the high end of guidance. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was up 11% and EBITDA outpaced revenue growth by being up 27% as total headcount remained flat in the quarter despite adding approximately 235 headcount in the Engine segment. Incremental flow-through of revenue to EBITDA was a healthy 59%. Moreover, the team delivered records for both EBITDA margin at 26.5% and earnings per share of $0.71, which was up a healthy 54% year-over-year. Now, let's cover the balance sheet and cash flow. The balance sheet continues to strengthen. Cash at the end of the quarter was $475 million, and free cash flow was a record for Q3 at $162 million. Year-to-date free cash flow was approximately $600 million. Net debt to EBITDA continues to improve and was at a record low of 1.6 times. All long-term debt is unsecured and at fixed rates. Howmet improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were reflected in Moody's 2-notch rating upgrade to Baa1. Additionally, Fitch upgraded Howmet's outlook to positive. Liquidity remains strong with a healthy cash balance in a $1 billion undrawn revolver complemented by the flexibility of a $1 billion commercial paper program. Regarding capital deployment, we deployed approximately $416 million of cash in the quarter to debt paydown, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividends. For the quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $282 million through the following three actions. First, we redeemed the remaining $205 million balance of the 2024 bonds with cash on hand. Payment was at par. Second, we issued $500 million of new bonds due in October 2031, the fixed interest rate is 3.72%. Third, we redeemed the remaining $577 million balance on the May 2025 bonds. We used $77 million of cash on hand plus the proceeds from the October 2031 bond issuance, which has a substantially lower fixed interest rate. All combined debt actions year-to-date through the third quarter 2024 will reduce annualized interest expense by approximately $33 million. The company's next debt maturity is in November of 2026. Moving to share repurchases. In the third quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $94 per share. Year-to-date through September, we repurchased $310 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $77 per share. Q3 was the 14th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. The average diluted share count improved to a record low Q3 exit rate of 409 million shares. Moreover, in October of 2024, the company repurchased an additional $90 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $103 per share. Year-to-date through October 31st, the company has repurchased $400 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $81 per share, retiring approximately 4.9 million shares. Remaining authorization from the Board of Directors for share repurchases is approximately $2.3 billion as of the end of October. Finally, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the third quarter, we paid $34 million in dividends as we increased the common stock dividend 60% from $0.05 per share to $0.08 per share. Now, let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the third quarter. Engine Products delivered another record performance. Revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $945 million. Commercial aerospace was up 20% and defense aerospace was up 15%, driven by engine spares growth. Oil and gas was up 26% and IGT was up 20%. Demand continues to be strong across all of our engines markets with strong engine spares volumes, which are expected to reach a record with $1.25 billion of revenue in 2024. EBITDA outpaced revenue growth with an increase of 40% year-over-year to a record $307 million. EBITDA margin increased 510 basis points year-over-year to a record 32.5%, while absorbing approximately 235 net new employees in the quarter to support growth. The Engine's team once again delivered a record quarter for revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Now, let's move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems also had another strong quarter. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $392 million. Commercial aerospace was 17% higher, including the impact of the wide-body recovery and the Boeing strike. General industrial was up 26%, defense/aerospace was up 5%, and commercial transportation, which represents 16% of fasteners revenue was down 3%. Year-over-year revenue outpaced revenue growth -- excuse me, year-over-year EBITDA outpaced revenue growth with an increase of 34% to $102 million. EBITDA margin increased 420 basis points year-over-year to a healthy 26%. The team continues to expand margins through commercial and operational performance. Now, let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures performance continues to improve. Revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $253 million. Commercial aerospace was up 11% and defense aerospace was up 27% year-over-year, driven primarily by the F-35 program. Year-over-year segment EBITDA outpaced revenue growth and was up 27% to $38 million. EBITDA margin increased 180 basis points to 15%. Sequentially, revenue decreased 8% as we continue to optimize the Structures' manufacturing footprint and rationalize the product mix to maximize profitability. The team continues to make progress and we expect continued improvements heading into 2025. Finally, let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels revenue was down 14% year-over-year as the long expected slowdown takes hold of the commercial transportation market. EBITDA decreased 17% as the team flexed cost to minimize the margin decline. EBITDA margin continues to be healthy at 26.1%. Lastly, before turning it back over to John, I wanted to highlight a special item on Page 18 in the appendix. In the third quarter, we completed a study that resulted in a favorable R&D tax credit of approximately $44 million, which was approved by the IRS. The credit was for prior period expenses associated with R&D investments. The favorable credit was excluded from our results and was noted as a special item. The favorable R&D tax credit reflects Howmet's continued investment in innovation and technology. Now, let me turn it back over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thanks Ken and let's move to Page 11. First, let me start with an overview of the markets for 2025 before moving to the specific guidance for the balance of 2024. Starting with commercial aerospace. Demand for air travel continues to be robust, this applies to both passengers and freight traffic. Air traffic growth rates have eased compared to the recent past as we moved into the second half of 2024 as we expect with normal seasonality, albeit the growth of Asia-Pacific continues to be strong at, I think, about 7%. However, given the recent years of underproduction of aircraft, demand for additional spares and the record backlogs of new orders, the order book outlook for aircraft production, and our products continue to look very healthy and should lead to higher growth for several years compared to historic norms. And this is supported by future passenger growth of approximately 4% to 5% a year. In 2025, we envisioned commercial aerospace growth to be about 12%, plus or minus and leading to the total revenue growth for the company of about 7.5%, plus or minus. It should be noted that at the start of 2024, we envisioned a similar growth to the managed -- but we managed to exceed this. However, we need to see sustained and consistent narrow-body aircraft production to be confident. For 2025, defense aerospace growth continues to be solid and is forecasted at mid-single-digits with both F-35 spares and legacy aircraft production, all contributing. IGT to grow at mid-single-digits, with oil and gas a little bit higher. The outlook for commercial truck wheels continues to be muted in the fourth quarter of this year and the first two quarters of 2025, with the prospect of some pickup in the second half of the year. The second half of 2025 potential is principally due to North America, where it is envisioned that the early stages of truck pre-buying will occur in response to the new environmental regulations, which become effective in 2027. Let me now turn to the topic of future IGT demand, which I referred to in our August call when I use the words of AI for the first time. Firstly, let me address AI. Of course, we are keeping current with AI developments and using our offices and manufacturing plants. However, what I would like to address is the effect on future revenues for Howmet as we address the increased demand for electricity over the next few years. AI, data center builds, and cryptocurrency mining all impact positively the future energy demand. Examples are AI computer capacity, which has grown over 50% per quarter since the start of 2023. Data center per consumption which was 19 gigawatts in 2023 is expected to increase to 50 gigawatts in 2030. Much of the demand is from cloud hyperscalers that is Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Oracle, and AI query results in 10x the electricity usage of a Google search. Data center build-outs are expected to be approximately $600 billion by 2028 and they require uninterruptible electricity supply. This is likely to be fulfilled by a combination of possibly nuclear and certainly IGT power generation in some percentage combination. While we are unsure about the exact demand, what we see are new plans forecast gas generation. For example, Duke, AEP, and Dominion have announced plans for an additional 18 gigawatts of new gas generation over the next 10 years. We see this as not just a U.S. phenomenon, but a worldwide one and consider Howmet well-positioned in the supply chain given our IGT turbine blades since we support GE Vernova, Siemens, Mitsubishi Heavy, and Salto given our global network where we are the number one supplier of turbine blades for each customer. While this will have limited effects in 2025, growth will begin in earnest in 2026. Beyond that, we have optimism for the addressable market over the next several years. In summary, 2025 is expected to be strong for Howmet. Let me turn to commercial aerospace since this impact is significant. External forecasting agencies envision aircraft production increases significantly ahead of our view. We have considered the gradual restart of the Boeing 737 assembly lines now that the strike has settled, plus the supply chain impacts on Airbus mentioned by themselves. We have tempered the builds accordingly and further adjusted for the 2024 under builds by Boeing compared to their planned build rates due to inventory considerations. In doing so, we envision commercial aerospace growth to be about 12% with total growth to be in the 7.5%, plus or minus 1%, with stronger growth in the second half of the year versus the first half. Naturally, we will adjust the revenue outlook as we move through 2025, especially as we come to understand more about specific Boeing production. Now, let's move to the near-term and the Q4 and full year guidance. The one additional comment I would like to make for Q4 is that any weakness from Boeing and commercial truck wheels is offset by sales of additional engine spares. The specific numbers are as follows; revenue of $1.87 billion, plus or minus $20 million; EBITDA of $488 million, plus or minus $10 million; earnings per share of $0.71, plus or minus $0.01. And for the year, revenue of $7.41 billion, plus or minus $20 million; EBITDA of $1.895 billion, plus or minus $10 million; earnings per share of $2.66, plus or minus $0.01; and free cash flow of $920 million, plus $20 million, minus $30 million. One final comment is regards to future dividends. The plan is to increase the common stock dividend in 2025 by 25% from $0.08 to $0.10 with the first payment in 2025, subject to final Board approval. And the only other comment I'd make is that in aggregate, our net headcount for the third quarter was a 0 increase. Thank you very much, and we'll now move to Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: That's close enough, it's not as easy as planned. Thanks John, thanks Ken and PT. Maybe if we could start off, obviously, you've given your 2025 guide, and you've talked about Q4 any weakness from Boeing being offset by spares. But in 2025, you gave -- you've given a guide that's pretty in line with the Street, how are you thinking about commercial build rates, if you could talk about that?\nJohn Plant: It's tough to get to specific build rates at the moment. And if you start with this time Boeing rather than Airbus, I don't think it's clear to anyone yet the rate at which Boeing will build in the balance of November or December or indeed exactly what the rate will be in 2025. What I've done is to look at the external forecasting agencies for total aircraft production next year by platform and by customer and consider the increase from what I expect the 2024 actual is that, that increase is rather unrealistic given your stance at approximately 30% at this point. And so I think we need to reevaluate that and consider what is the art of the possible way of builds of aircraft, starting with Boeing and the 737, all the way through their aircraft platforms. And then, of course, Airbus themselves as well, given their commentary regarding several types of parts and supply chain constraints. So, we've just taken our best guess and I get -- we will give more color on that in our February call, Sheila. But we've just said let's think of a more realistic number and feel as though a 12% increase year-on-year is quite doable. And certainly, it has to be better than 2024, which has really been a pretty miserable year for aircraft build and indeed, engine build. And so we are looking forward to better things but taking a fairly cautious view at this stage until we know more.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Good morning Rob.\nRobert Stallard: Hey John. Just a follow-up really on Sheila's question in relation to the 2025 revenue forecast. I was wondering if you could give us some idea of what your thoughts might be on aerospace aftermarket revenues in whatever form for next year? And also whether you've included any risk of destocking on the back of this OEM production rate uncertainty? Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Yes. So, when we start talking about spares and future rates of revenue and increases, I'd probably like to deal with the topic in a fairly broad fashion because I think it comes to the heart of several questions, which may be asked during the course of this call. And I'm going to start off with, first of all, in press release this morning, I think we indicated that we expect our spares revenue this year to be about $1.25 billion now, which is a further increase on the last quoting number, which is about $1.1 billion that we gave, I think on our August call. And I think the first point, I'd like to make, which I think is the fundamental and most important one for investors is the strategic positioning of the company. And what I mean by that is that in 2019, when our revenues were about $7 billion, our spares or our aftermarket exposure was about 11% of those revenues and obviously, a higher percentage of the Engine Products business. And 2024, given the outlook for the year and our revenues close to $7.5 billion is that spares or aftermarket exposure has risen to 17% and that is a very significant increase, especially given the growth in the OE builds as well in aggregates. And going forward, my thought, is over the next two, three, or four years, that that level of aftermarket content of our revenues will go to be in excess of 20%. And so I think that what that means for the company and therefore, the owners of the company is that it implies less volatility and with less volatility given the exposure for the OE production. That's really good for shareholders. So, I think that's the most important point, which I think should resonate. And then I'd like to deal with spares in the more topical framework of supply chain constraints because you've heard and seen and reported in the press quite a lot of commentary around the availability of engine spares and turbine blades in particular, and its impact on engine production. So, again, I'm going to repeat one data point that we provided in the last call to say that specifically on LEAP engines and the type of blade, which is currently used is that -- our output is up from 2023 by 40%. And for top 10 turbine blades for the company across all engine manufacturers, our output is up by over 50%. And of course, when the casting leaves Howmet, we don't designate which part of the end market it goes to whether it goes to a spares, builds and specific OE engine build. Given the commentary by Airbus about having gliders and lack of engines is that we had -- and asked for a joint meeting of every interested party at Howmet to go through the production data, so we could demonstrate and show specific production. And what they could see is that plus 40% or 50% overall, and also the production of the new engine blade, we're just awaiting the final approvals by the FAA and EASA. And what is remarkable, I think, is that we've increased production by the specific blades that I've talked about, while also producing many tens of thousands, and in fact, 500 engine sets of blades for the new type pending approval. And those castings have left Howmet and been delivered to the customer. So, I've covered specifically what's been going on in terms of our production and also much more generally the strategic positioning for the company, which I think is much more fundamental than, I'll say, any specific commentary about production in 2024, which is, let's say, just moves into transitory situation. And of course, given the output of both the current and the future engine sets is that, that puts, I think, everybody in a really good position going forward. And of course, we're working really well with our customers to try to drive further increases in output, which ideally would be required. And so we expect both the increase in engine production next year to be robust and also the increase in spares requirements, which are also going to be robust. And even more importantly, leading to that longer-term trend of increasing engine, spares and total spares for the company as a percent of our revenues. And so the other thing which I think is really good for us is that what we want, of course, is more aircraft production and more engine production, both of the more robust LEAP engines, the more robust GTF Advantage Engine. And of course, then we'll be able to sell all of the other parts that we make for those engines, which are structural castings, low-pressure turbine parts for that part of the turbine and indeed fan blades as well. So, that's given you a pretty comprehensive answer to your specific question, but broaden it out, and I think in all of that, the most important thing is the strategic positioning with fundamental less volatility for our revenues given very significant increase in the aftermarket as a percentage content of the company.\nRobert Stallard: That\u2019s great. Thanks John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. John, I wanted to continue on what you were just describing because you've got rising airfoil production for the current blades on the LEAP-1A, the LEAP-1B over time. And then you're also now in new lines doing the new blades and we're going to see the LEAP-1B presumably the new blades for that next year. How do you think about your planning for production capacity for both sets of blades over time? And I'm trying to understand kind of where you are today in terms of that that capacity, automation and so forth to understand what the investment profile is likely to be?\nJohn Plant: So, I think that everybody has heard that we are increasing our investment in the engine business. And I'm not quite sure exactly what has been said regarding the exact aims of that investment. But essentially, given the robust demand overall for engine production increases, aircraft production increases, but also, in particular, the increased requirement for spares, given not only the temporary effect of the time on wing issue, Doug, which you've certainly commented and written about. But even more significant, I think, is the increase in requirement for spares over time given the fact that the more modern engines with the higher operating temperatures and increased pressures means that the shop visit frequency is increased. And therefore, we see, and indeed, we've been having very detailed conversations with our customers what that demand looks like over the next, not just one year and two years, but over the next five years, and looking to increase our capacities along with the right agreements to invest for that capacity. And so I believe we're in the best position that we've been in for many years in terms of understanding what that future demand pattern is and have really, I'll say, signed up to increase our production to meet that demand, which we see is going to increase for both the OE production over the next few years, commensurate with both narrow-body aircraft production and wide-body aircraft production, but also through the increase in spares as well. And while I think the rate of change of the spares will change over the next -- it will even accelerate further with the time on wing issues to be addressed in the next two or three years. I just think we'll see increased demand overall for those spares with uninterrupted increases, albeit at different percentages between the years, let's say, certainly for the next five, seven years, I'm not willing to comment much further beyond that. And I think you see that our engine customers also building out additional MRO shops to take care of those that increased frequency of engine visits.\nDoug Harned: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Scott Deutsche with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nScott Deuschle: Hey good morning.\nJohn Plant: Good morning Scott.\nScott Deuschle: John, can you talk a bit about what's driving this reacceleration in incremental margins in the fourth quarter? And I was curious if there's anything you'd be willing to offer at this point just to level set us on how to think about what this recent strength in incremental margins means for the trend going into next year? Thank you.\nJohn Plant: I certainly don't want to get into any margin commentary for next year because I think as you appreciate, nothing's ever linear. You can't just extrapolate a line, certainly not for margins because things occur at different times and the rates. I think that when -- one of the determinants of your margin rate is also the rate of change for your top line. And then that rate of change is not just down to the top line, but your ability to convert at a higher level of efficiency. And so given I think the significant uncertainty and given the expectation that as we build out this capacity, we're going to have to take our increased labor next year. It's one of those things where, while I think we're going to see the benefits of the leverage to volume, we're also going to have the impact of the getting a lot of people trained in the company to meet those future production requirements going forward. So, we've probably hit a pretty good patch over the last two or three quarters in terms of productivity increases within the company. So, you've seen maybe a net 600 people recruited in the first quarter, maybe 400 in the second quarter. And while we've increased in our engine business in Q3 and net zero for the company and really trying to hold that for the balance of year, while expecting that we're going to need to reaccelerate our hiring as we go into 2025 such that when we commence production, much of the new equipment we've been talking about is that the workforce will be trained so that we can keep our levels of quality and our levels of delivery performance in the -- I think, in the really good zone that they've been and able to respond to the customers' demand. So, I think we've seen the benefits of that. But at this point, I don't have any margin comments regarding next year. And indeed, I don't think you can extrapolate anything from this at this point in time, apart from acknowledging that we've got the volume increase of the 7.5% I've talked about plus or minus. And then the net effect of the additional hiring as we go into next year, which puts us in a position, hopefully, of continued, really excellent supply that I've also talked about picking on that spares question. then going into 2026 where we see the requirements, again, increase for both OE production on the commercial aerospace side and indeed spares again.\nScott Deuschle: All right. Thank you, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. good morning everyone.\nJohn Plant: Hi David.\nDavid Strauss: Hey John. So, I know there are a lot of things kind of that go into this potentially. But just at a high level, given the market share gains on the engine side that you've hinted at that will start to come in a bit, I guess, in 2025, but more so in 2026. If aero revenue growth does turn out to be 12% in 2025, would you expect that your aero revenue growth would accelerate off that level in 2026 based on the market share pick up?\nJohn Plant: Yes, I keep thinking about what's the trajectory of aircraft production. And we've heard a lot of commentary about supply chain and supply chain constraints over the last two, three, four years now to a point where almost the first response is always supply chain. I think those constraints have to begin to ease and time is a great healer. And I think as each one is mentioned, I see the potential for further improvements in the wider supply chain performance. And so what I still think that 2025 as a year of flux given the targets to increase the Airbus A320, 321 and the introducing of new XLR and obviously, the really first for increasing A350 if those supply chain constraints can be solved. But similarly, Boeing, I mean, the additional overlay there is that you have to gain confidence in the restart of production while under FAA oversight to be able to increase their production. But certainly, the demand for new aircraft is there going back to the fundamentals for airlines, which is not just for fuel efficiency, but even more importantly, for emissions, which I think are here and will continue and particularly in other parts of the world as well, where the carbon footprint is really important. And so those requirements for aircraft are there, and you've seen aircraft held in service, probably longer than the ideally would have been wanted given the lack of production. So, maybe while 2025 is still another year of flux and sorting out, which I don't think is going to be totally smooth is that surely by 2026, we're going to be in a better position than the aircraft and the backlogs are there. And so I get really optimistic that aircraft production is going to improve. And that combined with the vectors of demand that I talked about on the call for electricity, and therefore, what I expect to be an increasing demand certainly for our IGT business, and see no diminution of demand by countries around the world for, for example, the F-35 or even legacy fighters like the F-15 and the F-16. I just think all of that as positive as we go forward. And so that plus the additional spares demand and the capacity we're putting in, I think we can get pretty optimistic that 2026 should be a further step up on 2025.\nDavid Strauss: Perfect. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I think, John, one of the biggest areas of growth from your guidance initially over the last couple of years has been on the defense side. And so I'm just curious, the mid-single-digit placeholder you have, do you think that's as conservative for the last couple of years? And given the F-35 is kicking back in, in terms of deliveries within structures and obviously, I'm sure the airfoils business is going gangbusters, why is it only mid-single-digit growth? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: At the moment, if you take Lockheed's stated production, let's say, 150 aircraft, I think it was 152, but as we all know, they've struggled to produce that each year, and deliveries have been somewhat less than that given the software issues that are being or have been resolved. And so I think we're going to see higher deliveries than production over the next two or three years. And production still maybe incrementing up a little bit maybe for the 152 to 156 level. And so I mean, that's only four aircraft, so it's like 2% to 3%. I'm more optimistic that we see spares demand increase because the engine and aircraft fleet is now over 1,000 worldwide. And indeed, in Europe over the next few years, it's going to increase to 600 by the end of the decade. And so that additional OE demand bodes well for engine spares demand over the next few years. So, I'm optimistic about that. And also on the bulkhead side, particularly, on the titanium bulkhead side, that should also begin to improve, given that, I think this quarter, I'm hopeful it's this quarter doesn't continue into 2025, then the excess inventory, which was at our customer from, let's say, builds, which have been anticipated, but didn't not occur. Is it that inventories cleared out and the last part of it's cleared out in 2024, but with some possibility, there's still a little bit left over, but hopefully not into 2025. So, at this point, I think that, I'll say, mid-single digits is the right call. And of course, should, I'll say, Boeing find themselves able to increase their legacy fighter production, which they struggle with because of labor. And I don't know that's going to change this quarter, next quarter or the first half of next year. But should it improve, then I think we could become a little bit more optimistic, but not yet.\nMyles Walton: Okay. Thanks. And just a clarification, the $1.25 billion of spares, is that about split even between commercial and defense/IGT at this point?\nJohn Plant: Yes, I mean the rate of growth on the commercial side has been higher in the last, let's say, 12 months. But the absolute level of the, I'll say, defense and IGT, and oil and gas has been higher in absolute terms because that didn't see the very significant interruption that we had with COVID and post-COVID, and then because of the builds and all of that. And so at this point, the way I'm thinking about it is the -- roughly used to be 50/50. And I'm going to guess at and Ken can correct me because I struggle to keep every single number in the front of the mind, but I'm thinking that we're 55% to 60% currently on the, let's say, non-commercial aero side, but with the commercial aero growing faster.\nKen Giacobbe: And a lot of numbers there, Myles. But I'd look at it as commercial aero probably around $550 million plus or minus this year. And then on the defense and IGT, right around $700 million, plus or minus, right? But the key is, the numbers are up year-over-year, great performance compared to 2019, but accelerating as we exit the year. So it's more all good.\nMyles Walton: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.\nJohn Plant: Good morning Seth.\nSeth Seifman: Morning. I wanted to ask just in terms of the spares demand you're seeing, and it sounds like the answer is no, but a lot of -- we think about older planes staying in service longer as a driver of aftermarket demand. It sounds like the aftermarket demand here is very much driven by the newer engines. And so to the extent that we were to see increased retirements at some point that doesn't really interfere at all with your expectations for spares growth over that kind of two to four-year period that you outlined?\nJohn Plant: Several parts to pick apart in that question there, Seth. So the fact that the legacy aircraft and engines, let's think about the V2500 and the CFM56, I don't think their shop visits have peaked yet. And that's probably been pushed out further by the fact of lack of retirement. So, previously, if you've gone back three or four years, I think everybody expected 2025 to be the peak demand for CFM56 and V2500, I think that was the expectation. But I think that, that peak is now going to be pushed out to 2026, 2027. It's probably more likely possibly even beyond 2027. But I don't think you then expect a significant dip after that peak. It's sustained and a very gradual decline. Meanwhile, your assumption or statement that there are more spares requirements for the new engines. Well, that's absolutely true given the well-documented time on wing issues driven by, I'll say, the earlier-than-expected shop visits for those engines and that applies to both the GTF and to the LEAP engines, and improvements coming with the increased robustness of the suite of products, which is being introduced of which the early-stage turbine blades is only got one of those improvements. So, we are part of much bigger packages of improvements reliability, but the way it stacks up is, I've talked about time on wing, which is creating higher and excessive demand now. But there has been a long-term trend with growth every year for the next many years because of the cycle of shop visits which we anticipate as those new aircraft are adopted even with the robustness improvements that we've talked about. So, I think I've covered all of it that's in your question. So, the only thing I'm saying is that the legacy engines will also continue to peak yet.\nSeth Seifman: Excellent. Thanks very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRonald Epstein: Hey, good morning guys. We've covered a lot of turf, but one area we haven't talked too much about is just kind of your continued capital deployment focus. Is there any M&A to do out there or not? How are you thinking about that? I mean can you expand the business out into maybe some adjacencies in kind of your core skill set?\nJohn Plant: Yes. So, we certainly are in a position of choice, and have the ability to look at potential acquisitions and to study those things which come to the market even though the majority have really been companies coming out of private equity hands in the more recent past. It's possible given the change of administration, given the election is that deals which we thought may run some hurdles in the past may have less hurdle constraints in the future. I don't know yet. It's too early to -- apart from just speculative commentary there. So, we are in a position to consider. We do -- but also want to be disciplined enough to say we'll do small ones, if they're a technology play and you possibly saw that we did buy a company in the last quarter, fairly small, but important for us to enable us to take our engine capability to another level and tuck that one in. But we're also willing to, say, if we're going to do others, then they need to be of some decent size given the market cap of the company. So, we're willing to look. We also have to compare that to the cash-on-cash returns of buying our own stock back, and again, looking at it on a risk-adjusted basis. And so we want to be very disciplined in terms of the returns for that money for shareholders. And so we still see that buying our stock back is healthy and positive in terms of well above our cost of capital, but also willing to look at the returns from any M&A move as well, albeit there's nothing that we have currently on the stocks to go out in the next quarter or two that we can see. But we'll continue to look and examine it as appropriate. And, obviously, we'll keep you informed.\nRonald Epstein: Got it. Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question here will come from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Hey good morning and great results guys.\nJohn Plant: Thanks Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Great results, guys. John, I wanted to ask on the high-pressure turbine blade that you guys are working on the 1A. Two things. Does it confer higher pricing to Howmet because it's more or less an aftermarket type product? And second of all, relatedly, GE mentioned it might be easier to manufacture. And do you view that as true? And therefore, is there a good opportunity to get throughput up quickly on this?\nJohn Plant: I think the comment about it going mainly for aftermarket and is I'll say, I don't understand that comment because every new engine, of the LEAP-1A variant, when that package of change is approved, is going to go to the new configuration and new turbine blade. So, we'll see that fitted both for OE production and full spares production going forward. And the -- in anything where additional performance is obtained, then it goes to that whole question of content, et cetera. So, I think that deals with that part of the question. And as to producibility, we have some optimism that it may be. And we have, as I said, provided some several hundred engine sets this year in addition to manufacturing all of the increase in production to the existing type of turbine blade. So, I'm pleased with that, but I still think it's early days yet in terms of absolutely giving clarity over what the long-term yields will be in production. But I see nothing at this point, which lead us to have concerns, so we're well into it and looking forward to very -- hopefully, a very near-term cutover to the new type of blade. And then several months or a year or so later then also on the LEAP-1B for Boeing as well. But that's going to be, I'll say, another several quarters from now in terms of timing for that, but again, subject to the FAA and EASA oversight.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session in addition to today's conference.

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thank you, PT, and welcome, everyone to the Howmet third quarter earnings call. Q3 was another strong quarter for the company. Year-over-year revenue growth was 11%, building on the 14% growth in the first half. Within this number, commercial aerospace growth was 17% continuing a strong trend, including engine spares growth. Other markets will be covered later in the call. EBITDA was a record $487 million, along with a margin of 26.5%, while operating income was $419 million with a margin of 22.8%. Operating income was up 33% year-over-year and increased 390 basis points, with engines and fasteners performing at high levels, supported by an increasingly strong results in structures. Wheels revenue was down, driven by market declines, especially in Europe, which reduced double-digits with extended summer vacations. However, wheels continued to deliver a healthy EBITDA margin of 26%. Earnings per share was $0.71, an increase of 54% year-over-year. Free cash flow was also strong at $162 million, improving year-to-date free cash flow to approximately $600 million. The quarter end cash balance of $475 million is after deploying $282 million to debt pay down, $100 million to share buybacks, and $34 million to dividends. Overall, Howmet had a healthy set of results with EBITDA, EBITDA margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow above expectations. Let me comment on revenue, which is fractionally light of our guide. In September, we restricted our aerospace parts supplied to Boeing, pending further understanding about the duration of the strike. Naturally, we are pleased that the Boeing strike is now over and the business can gradually return to normal. The other notable shortfall was in our wheels business. Wheels revenue was approximately $30 million below Q2, principally due to notably weaker European market conditions, resulting in an 18% decrease in revenue. North America revenues were down by 10%. I'll now pass the call to Ken to provide additional details by end market and business segments before I return to cover the outlook for the company. Thanks Ken and let's move to Page 11. First, let me start with an overview of the markets for 2025 before moving to the specific guidance for the balance of 2024. Starting with commercial aerospace. Demand for air travel continues to be robust, this applies to both passengers and freight traffic. Air traffic growth rates have eased compared to the recent past as we moved into the second half of 2024 as we expect with normal seasonality, albeit the growth of Asia-Pacific continues to be strong at, I think, about 7%. However, given the recent years of underproduction of aircraft, demand for additional spares and the record backlogs of new orders, the order book outlook for aircraft production, and our products continue to look very healthy and should lead to higher growth for several years compared to historic norms. And this is supported by future passenger growth of approximately 4% to 5% a year. In 2025, we envisioned commercial aerospace growth to be about 12%, plus or minus and leading to the total revenue growth for the company of about 7.5%, plus or minus. It should be noted that at the start of 2024, we envisioned a similar growth to the managed -- but we managed to exceed this. However, we need to see sustained and consistent narrow-body aircraft production to be confident. For 2025, defense aerospace growth continues to be solid and is forecasted at mid-single-digits with both F-35 spares and legacy aircraft production, all contributing. IGT to grow at mid-single-digits, with oil and gas a little bit higher. The outlook for commercial truck wheels continues to be muted in the fourth quarter of this year and the first two quarters of 2025, with the prospect of some pickup in the second half of the year. The second half of 2025 potential is principally due to North America, where it is envisioned that the early stages of truck pre-buying will occur in response to the new environmental regulations, which become effective in 2027. Let me now turn to the topic of future IGT demand, which I referred to in our August call when I use the words of AI for the first time. Firstly, let me address AI. Of course, we are keeping current with AI developments and using our offices and manufacturing plants. However, what I would like to address is the effect on future revenues for Howmet as we address the increased demand for electricity over the next few years. AI, data center builds, and cryptocurrency mining all impact positively the future energy demand. Examples are AI computer capacity, which has grown over 50% per quarter since the start of 2023. Data center per consumption which was 19 gigawatts in 2023 is expected to increase to 50 gigawatts in 2030. Much of the demand is from cloud hyperscalers that is Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Oracle, and AI query results in 10x the electricity usage of a Google search. Data center build-outs are expected to be approximately $600 billion by 2028 and they require uninterruptible electricity supply. This is likely to be fulfilled by a combination of possibly nuclear and certainly IGT power generation in some percentage combination. While we are unsure about the exact demand, what we see are new plans forecast gas generation. For example, Duke, AEP, and Dominion have announced plans for an additional 18 gigawatts of new gas generation over the next 10 years. We see this as not just a U.S. phenomenon, but a worldwide one and consider Howmet well-positioned in the supply chain given our IGT turbine blades since we support GE Vernova, Siemens, Mitsubishi Heavy, and Salto given our global network where we are the number one supplier of turbine blades for each customer. While this will have limited effects in 2025, growth will begin in earnest in 2026. Beyond that, we have optimism for the addressable market over the next several years. In summary, 2025 is expected to be strong for Howmet. Let me turn to commercial aerospace since this impact is significant. External forecasting agencies envision aircraft production increases significantly ahead of our view. We have considered the gradual restart of the Boeing 737 assembly lines now that the strike has settled, plus the supply chain impacts on Airbus mentioned by themselves. We have tempered the builds accordingly and further adjusted for the 2024 under builds by Boeing compared to their planned build rates due to inventory considerations. In doing so, we envision commercial aerospace growth to be about 12% with total growth to be in the 7.5%, plus or minus 1%, with stronger growth in the second half of the year versus the first half. Naturally, we will adjust the revenue outlook as we move through 2025, especially as we come to understand more about specific Boeing production. Now, let's move to the near-term and the Q4 and full year guidance. The one additional comment I would like to make for Q4 is that any weakness from Boeing and commercial truck wheels is offset by sales of additional engine spares. The specific numbers are as follows; revenue of $1.87 billion, plus or minus $20 million; EBITDA of $488 million, plus or minus $10 million; earnings per share of $0.71, plus or minus $0.01. And for the year, revenue of $7.41 billion, plus or minus $20 million; EBITDA of $1.895 billion, plus or minus $10 million; earnings per share of $2.66, plus or minus $0.01; and free cash flow of $920 million, plus $20 million, minus $30 million. One final comment is regards to future dividends. The plan is to increase the common stock dividend in 2025 by 25% from $0.08 to $0.10 with the first payment in 2025, subject to final Board approval. And the only other comment I'd make is that in aggregate, our net headcount for the third quarter was a 0 increase. Thank you very much, and we'll now move to Q&A. It's tough to get to specific build rates at the moment. And if you start with this time Boeing rather than Airbus, I don't think it's clear to anyone yet the rate at which Boeing will build in the balance of November or December or indeed exactly what the rate will be in 2025. What I've done is to look at the external forecasting agencies for total aircraft production next year by platform and by customer and consider the increase from what I expect the 2024 actual is that, that increase is rather unrealistic given your stance at approximately 30% at this point. And so I think we need to reevaluate that and consider what is the art of the possible way of builds of aircraft, starting with Boeing and the 737, all the way through their aircraft platforms. And then, of course, Airbus themselves as well, given their commentary regarding several types of parts and supply chain constraints. So, we've just taken our best guess and I get -- we will give more color on that in our February call, Sheila. But we've just said let's think of a more realistic number and feel as though a 12% increase year-on-year is quite doable. And certainly, it has to be better than 2024, which has really been a pretty miserable year for aircraft build and indeed, engine build. And so we are looking forward to better things but taking a fairly cautious view at this stage until we know more. Thank you. Good morning Rob. Yes. So, when we start talking about spares and future rates of revenue and increases, I'd probably like to deal with the topic in a fairly broad fashion because I think it comes to the heart of several questions, which may be asked during the course of this call. And I'm going to start off with, first of all, in press release this morning, I think we indicated that we expect our spares revenue this year to be about $1.25 billion now, which is a further increase on the last quoting number, which is about $1.1 billion that we gave, I think on our August call. And I think the first point, I'd like to make, which I think is the fundamental and most important one for investors is the strategic positioning of the company. And what I mean by that is that in 2019, when our revenues were about $7 billion, our spares or our aftermarket exposure was about 11% of those revenues and obviously, a higher percentage of the Engine Products business. And 2024, given the outlook for the year and our revenues close to $7.5 billion is that spares or aftermarket exposure has risen to 17% and that is a very significant increase, especially given the growth in the OE builds as well in aggregates. And going forward, my thought, is over the next two, three, or four years, that that level of aftermarket content of our revenues will go to be in excess of 20%. And so I think that what that means for the company and therefore, the owners of the company is that it implies less volatility and with less volatility given the exposure for the OE production. That's really good for shareholders. So, I think that's the most important point, which I think should resonate. And then I'd like to deal with spares in the more topical framework of supply chain constraints because you've heard and seen and reported in the press quite a lot of commentary around the availability of engine spares and turbine blades in particular, and its impact on engine production. So, again, I'm going to repeat one data point that we provided in the last call to say that specifically on LEAP engines and the type of blade, which is currently used is that -- our output is up from 2023 by 40%. And for top 10 turbine blades for the company across all engine manufacturers, our output is up by over 50%. And of course, when the casting leaves Howmet, we don't designate which part of the end market it goes to whether it goes to a spares, builds and specific OE engine build. Given the commentary by Airbus about having gliders and lack of engines is that we had -- and asked for a joint meeting of every interested party at Howmet to go through the production data, so we could demonstrate and show specific production. And what they could see is that plus 40% or 50% overall, and also the production of the new engine blade, we're just awaiting the final approvals by the FAA and EASA. And what is remarkable, I think, is that we've increased production by the specific blades that I've talked about, while also producing many tens of thousands, and in fact, 500 engine sets of blades for the new type pending approval. And those castings have left Howmet and been delivered to the customer. So, I've covered specifically what's been going on in terms of our production and also much more generally the strategic positioning for the company, which I think is much more fundamental than, I'll say, any specific commentary about production in 2024, which is, let's say, just moves into transitory situation. And of course, given the output of both the current and the future engine sets is that, that puts, I think, everybody in a really good position going forward. And of course, we're working really well with our customers to try to drive further increases in output, which ideally would be required. And so we expect both the increase in engine production next year to be robust and also the increase in spares requirements, which are also going to be robust. And even more importantly, leading to that longer-term trend of increasing engine, spares and total spares for the company as a percent of our revenues. And so the other thing which I think is really good for us is that what we want, of course, is more aircraft production and more engine production, both of the more robust LEAP engines, the more robust GTF Advantage Engine. And of course, then we'll be able to sell all of the other parts that we make for those engines, which are structural castings, low-pressure turbine parts for that part of the turbine and indeed fan blades as well. So, that's given you a pretty comprehensive answer to your specific question, but broaden it out, and I think in all of that, the most important thing is the strategic positioning with fundamental less volatility for our revenues given very significant increase in the aftermarket as a percentage content of the company. Thank you. So, I think that everybody has heard that we are increasing our investment in the engine business. And I'm not quite sure exactly what has been said regarding the exact aims of that investment. But essentially, given the robust demand overall for engine production increases, aircraft production increases, but also, in particular, the increased requirement for spares, given not only the temporary effect of the time on wing issue, Doug, which you've certainly commented and written about. But even more significant, I think, is the increase in requirement for spares over time given the fact that the more modern engines with the higher operating temperatures and increased pressures means that the shop visit frequency is increased. And therefore, we see, and indeed, we've been having very detailed conversations with our customers what that demand looks like over the next, not just one year and two years, but over the next five years, and looking to increase our capacities along with the right agreements to invest for that capacity. And so I believe we're in the best position that we've been in for many years in terms of understanding what that future demand pattern is and have really, I'll say, signed up to increase our production to meet that demand, which we see is going to increase for both the OE production over the next few years, commensurate with both narrow-body aircraft production and wide-body aircraft production, but also through the increase in spares as well. And while I think the rate of change of the spares will change over the next -- it will even accelerate further with the time on wing issues to be addressed in the next two or three years. I just think we'll see increased demand overall for those spares with uninterrupted increases, albeit at different percentages between the years, let's say, certainly for the next five, seven years, I'm not willing to comment much further beyond that. And I think you see that our engine customers also building out additional MRO shops to take care of those that increased frequency of engine visits. Good morning Scott. I certainly don't want to get into any margin commentary for next year because I think as you appreciate, nothing's ever linear. You can't just extrapolate a line, certainly not for margins because things occur at different times and the rates. I think that when -- one of the determinants of your margin rate is also the rate of change for your top line. And then that rate of change is not just down to the top line, but your ability to convert at a higher level of efficiency. And so given I think the significant uncertainty and given the expectation that as we build out this capacity, we're going to have to take our increased labor next year. It's one of those things where, while I think we're going to see the benefits of the leverage to volume, we're also going to have the impact of the getting a lot of people trained in the company to meet those future production requirements going forward. So, we've probably hit a pretty good patch over the last two or three quarters in terms of productivity increases within the company. So, you've seen maybe a net 600 people recruited in the first quarter, maybe 400 in the second quarter. And while we've increased in our engine business in Q3 and net zero for the company and really trying to hold that for the balance of year, while expecting that we're going to need to reaccelerate our hiring as we go into 2025 such that when we commence production, much of the new equipment we've been talking about is that the workforce will be trained so that we can keep our levels of quality and our levels of delivery performance in the -- I think, in the really good zone that they've been and able to respond to the customers' demand. So, I think we've seen the benefits of that. But at this point, I don't have any margin comments regarding next year. And indeed, I don't think you can extrapolate anything from this at this point in time, apart from acknowledging that we've got the volume increase of the 7.5% I've talked about plus or minus. And then the net effect of the additional hiring as we go into next year, which puts us in a position, hopefully, of continued, really excellent supply that I've also talked about picking on that spares question. then going into 2026 where we see the requirements, again, increase for both OE production on the commercial aerospace side and indeed spares again. Thank you. Hi David. Yes, I keep thinking about what's the trajectory of aircraft production. And we've heard a lot of commentary about supply chain and supply chain constraints over the last two, three, four years now to a point where almost the first response is always supply chain. I think those constraints have to begin to ease and time is a great healer. And I think as each one is mentioned, I see the potential for further improvements in the wider supply chain performance. And so what I still think that 2025 as a year of flux given the targets to increase the Airbus A320, 321 and the introducing of new XLR and obviously, the really first for increasing A350 if those supply chain constraints can be solved. But similarly, Boeing, I mean, the additional overlay there is that you have to gain confidence in the restart of production while under FAA oversight to be able to increase their production. But certainly, the demand for new aircraft is there going back to the fundamentals for airlines, which is not just for fuel efficiency, but even more importantly, for emissions, which I think are here and will continue and particularly in other parts of the world as well, where the carbon footprint is really important. And so those requirements for aircraft are there, and you've seen aircraft held in service, probably longer than the ideally would have been wanted given the lack of production. So, maybe while 2025 is still another year of flux and sorting out, which I don't think is going to be totally smooth is that surely by 2026, we're going to be in a better position than the aircraft and the backlogs are there. And so I get really optimistic that aircraft production is going to improve. And that combined with the vectors of demand that I talked about on the call for electricity, and therefore, what I expect to be an increasing demand certainly for our IGT business, and see no diminution of demand by countries around the world for, for example, the F-35 or even legacy fighters like the F-15 and the F-16. I just think all of that as positive as we go forward. And so that plus the additional spares demand and the capacity we're putting in, I think we can get pretty optimistic that 2026 should be a further step up on 2025. Thank you. At the moment, if you take Lockheed's stated production, let's say, 150 aircraft, I think it was 152, but as we all know, they've struggled to produce that each year, and deliveries have been somewhat less than that given the software issues that are being or have been resolved. And so I think we're going to see higher deliveries than production over the next two or three years. And production still maybe incrementing up a little bit maybe for the 152 to 156 level. And so I mean, that's only four aircraft, so it's like 2% to 3%. I'm more optimistic that we see spares demand increase because the engine and aircraft fleet is now over 1,000 worldwide. And indeed, in Europe over the next few years, it's going to increase to 600 by the end of the decade. And so that additional OE demand bodes well for engine spares demand over the next few years. So, I'm optimistic about that. And also on the bulkhead side, particularly, on the titanium bulkhead side, that should also begin to improve, given that, I think this quarter, I'm hopeful it's this quarter doesn't continue into 2025, then the excess inventory, which was at our customer from, let's say, builds, which have been anticipated, but didn't not occur. Is it that inventories cleared out and the last part of it's cleared out in 2024, but with some possibility, there's still a little bit left over, but hopefully not into 2025. So, at this point, I think that, I'll say, mid-single digits is the right call. And of course, should, I'll say, Boeing find themselves able to increase their legacy fighter production, which they struggle with because of labor. And I don't know that's going to change this quarter, next quarter or the first half of next year. But should it improve, then I think we could become a little bit more optimistic, but not yet. Yes, I mean the rate of growth on the commercial side has been higher in the last, let's say, 12 months. But the absolute level of the, I'll say, defense and IGT, and oil and gas has been higher in absolute terms because that didn't see the very significant interruption that we had with COVID and post-COVID, and then because of the builds and all of that. And so at this point, the way I'm thinking about it is the -- roughly used to be 50/50. And I'm going to guess at and Ken can correct me because I struggle to keep every single number in the front of the mind, but I'm thinking that we're 55% to 60% currently on the, let's say, non-commercial aero side, but with the commercial aero growing faster. Good morning Seth. Several parts to pick apart in that question there, Seth. So the fact that the legacy aircraft and engines, let's think about the V2500 and the CFM56, I don't think their shop visits have peaked yet. And that's probably been pushed out further by the fact of lack of retirement. So, previously, if you've gone back three or four years, I think everybody expected 2025 to be the peak demand for CFM56 and V2500, I think that was the expectation. But I think that, that peak is now going to be pushed out to 2026, 2027. It's probably more likely possibly even beyond 2027. But I don't think you then expect a significant dip after that peak. It's sustained and a very gradual decline. Meanwhile, your assumption or statement that there are more spares requirements for the new engines. Well, that's absolutely true given the well-documented time on wing issues driven by, I'll say, the earlier-than-expected shop visits for those engines and that applies to both the GTF and to the LEAP engines, and improvements coming with the increased robustness of the suite of products, which is being introduced of which the early-stage turbine blades is only got one of those improvements. So, we are part of much bigger packages of improvements reliability, but the way it stacks up is, I've talked about time on wing, which is creating higher and excessive demand now. But there has been a long-term trend with growth every year for the next many years because of the cycle of shop visits which we anticipate as those new aircraft are adopted even with the robustness improvements that we've talked about. So, I think I've covered all of it that's in your question. So, the only thing I'm saying is that the legacy engines will also continue to peak yet. Thank you. Yes. So, we certainly are in a position of choice, and have the ability to look at potential acquisitions and to study those things which come to the market even though the majority have really been companies coming out of private equity hands in the more recent past. It's possible given the change of administration, given the election is that deals which we thought may run some hurdles in the past may have less hurdle constraints in the future. I don't know yet. It's too early to -- apart from just speculative commentary there. So, we are in a position to consider. We do -- but also want to be disciplined enough to say we'll do small ones, if they're a technology play and you possibly saw that we did buy a company in the last quarter, fairly small, but important for us to enable us to take our engine capability to another level and tuck that one in. But we're also willing to, say, if we're going to do others, then they need to be of some decent size given the market cap of the company. So, we're willing to look. We also have to compare that to the cash-on-cash returns of buying our own stock back, and again, looking at it on a risk-adjusted basis. And so we want to be very disciplined in terms of the returns for that money for shareholders. And so we still see that buying our stock back is healthy and positive in terms of well above our cost of capital, but also willing to look at the returns from any M&A move as well, albeit there's nothing that we have currently on the stocks to go out in the next quarter or two that we can see. But we'll continue to look and examine it as appropriate. And, obviously, we'll keep you informed. Thank you. Thanks Gautam. I think the comment about it going mainly for aftermarket and is I'll say, I don't understand that comment because every new engine, of the LEAP-1A variant, when that package of change is approved, is going to go to the new configuration and new turbine blade. So, we'll see that fitted both for OE production and full spares production going forward. And the -- in anything where additional performance is obtained, then it goes to that whole question of content, et cetera. So, I think that deals with that part of the question. And as to producibility, we have some optimism that it may be. And we have, as I said, provided some several hundred engine sets this year in addition to manufacturing all of the increase in production to the existing type of turbine blade. So, I'm pleased with that, but I still think it's early days yet in terms of absolutely giving clarity over what the long-term yields will be in production. But I see nothing at this point, which lead us to have concerns, so we're well into it and looking forward to very -- hopefully, a very near-term cutover to the new type of blade. And then several months or a year or so later then also on the LEAP-1B for Boeing as well. But that's going to be, I'll say, another several quarters from now in terms of timing for that, but again, subject to the FAA and EASA oversight."

            "name": "Ken Giacobbe",
            "content": "Thank you, John. Good morning everyone. Let's move to Slide 5. So, market growth continued to be healthy in the third quarter with total revenue up 11% year-over-year, building on the first half revenue growth of 14%. Commercial aerospace growth remained strong despite our decision to restrict supply to Boeing due to the strike. Commercial aerospace revenue was up 17%, which built on the 25% commercial aerospace growth in the first half. Defense Aerospace was also strong, up 15% driven by fighter programs and fighter engine spares demand. As expected, the commercial transportation market weakened with revenue down 12% led by the slowdown in Europe and to a lesser extent, North America. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up a healthy 17%, driven by oil and gas, up 26%, IGT up 20%, and general industrial up 5%. In summary, continued strong performance in commercial aerospace, defense aerospace and industrial, partially offset by commercial transportation. Now, let's move to Slide 6, starting with the P&L. For the third consecutive quarter, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, and earnings per share were all records and exceeded the high end of guidance. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was up 11% and EBITDA outpaced revenue growth by being up 27% as total headcount remained flat in the quarter despite adding approximately 235 headcount in the Engine segment. Incremental flow-through of revenue to EBITDA was a healthy 59%. Moreover, the team delivered records for both EBITDA margin at 26.5% and earnings per share of $0.71, which was up a healthy 54% year-over-year. Now, let's cover the balance sheet and cash flow. The balance sheet continues to strengthen. Cash at the end of the quarter was $475 million, and free cash flow was a record for Q3 at $162 million. Year-to-date free cash flow was approximately $600 million. Net debt to EBITDA continues to improve and was at a record low of 1.6 times. All long-term debt is unsecured and at fixed rates. Howmet improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were reflected in Moody's 2-notch rating upgrade to Baa1. Additionally, Fitch upgraded Howmet's outlook to positive. Liquidity remains strong with a healthy cash balance in a $1 billion undrawn revolver complemented by the flexibility of a $1 billion commercial paper program. Regarding capital deployment, we deployed approximately $416 million of cash in the quarter to debt paydown, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividends. For the quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $282 million through the following three actions. First, we redeemed the remaining $205 million balance of the 2024 bonds with cash on hand. Payment was at par. Second, we issued $500 million of new bonds due in October 2031, the fixed interest rate is 3.72%. Third, we redeemed the remaining $577 million balance on the May 2025 bonds. We used $77 million of cash on hand plus the proceeds from the October 2031 bond issuance, which has a substantially lower fixed interest rate. All combined debt actions year-to-date through the third quarter 2024 will reduce annualized interest expense by approximately $33 million. The company's next debt maturity is in November of 2026. Moving to share repurchases. In the third quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $94 per share. Year-to-date through September, we repurchased $310 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $77 per share. Q3 was the 14th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. The average diluted share count improved to a record low Q3 exit rate of 409 million shares. Moreover, in October of 2024, the company repurchased an additional $90 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $103 per share. Year-to-date through October 31st, the company has repurchased $400 million of common stock at an average price of approximately $81 per share, retiring approximately 4.9 million shares. Remaining authorization from the Board of Directors for share repurchases is approximately $2.3 billion as of the end of October. Finally, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the third quarter, we paid $34 million in dividends as we increased the common stock dividend 60% from $0.05 per share to $0.08 per share. Now, let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the third quarter. Engine Products delivered another record performance. Revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $945 million. Commercial aerospace was up 20% and defense aerospace was up 15%, driven by engine spares growth. Oil and gas was up 26% and IGT was up 20%. Demand continues to be strong across all of our engines markets with strong engine spares volumes, which are expected to reach a record with $1.25 billion of revenue in 2024. EBITDA outpaced revenue growth with an increase of 40% year-over-year to a record $307 million. EBITDA margin increased 510 basis points year-over-year to a record 32.5%, while absorbing approximately 235 net new employees in the quarter to support growth. The Engine's team once again delivered a record quarter for revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Now, let's move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems also had another strong quarter. Revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $392 million. Commercial aerospace was 17% higher, including the impact of the wide-body recovery and the Boeing strike. General industrial was up 26%, defense/aerospace was up 5%, and commercial transportation, which represents 16% of fasteners revenue was down 3%. Year-over-year revenue outpaced revenue growth -- excuse me, year-over-year EBITDA outpaced revenue growth with an increase of 34% to $102 million. EBITDA margin increased 420 basis points year-over-year to a healthy 26%. The team continues to expand margins through commercial and operational performance. Now, let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures performance continues to improve. Revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $253 million. Commercial aerospace was up 11% and defense aerospace was up 27% year-over-year, driven primarily by the F-35 program. Year-over-year segment EBITDA outpaced revenue growth and was up 27% to $38 million. EBITDA margin increased 180 basis points to 15%. Sequentially, revenue decreased 8% as we continue to optimize the Structures' manufacturing footprint and rationalize the product mix to maximize profitability. The team continues to make progress and we expect continued improvements heading into 2025. Finally, let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels revenue was down 14% year-over-year as the long expected slowdown takes hold of the commercial transportation market. EBITDA decreased 17% as the team flexed cost to minimize the margin decline. EBITDA margin continues to be healthy at 26.1%. Lastly, before turning it back over to John, I wanted to highlight a special item on Page 18 in the appendix. In the third quarter, we completed a study that resulted in a favorable R&D tax credit of approximately $44 million, which was approved by the IRS. The credit was for prior period expenses associated with R&D investments. The favorable credit was excluded from our results and was noted as a special item. The favorable R&D tax credit reflects Howmet's continued investment in innovation and technology. Now, let me turn it back over to John. And a lot of numbers there, Myles. But I'd look at it as commercial aero probably around $550 million plus or minus this year. And then on the defense and IGT, right around $700 million, plus or minus, right? But the key is, the numbers are up year-over-year, great performance compared to 2019, but accelerating as we exit the year. So it's more all good."

Please note that today's event is being recorded and all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] On today's call we ask that you please limit yourself to only one question during Q&A. Also, please be aware that today's call is being recorded. I would like to now turn the call over to Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPaul Luther: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace second quarter 2024 results conference call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. In today's presentation references to EBITDA, operating income and EPS mean adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, adjusted operating income, excluding special items and adjusted EPS, excluding special items. These measures are among the non-GAAP financial measures that we've included in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you, PT, and welcome, everyone to the Howmet's second quarter earnings call. Q2 is a strong quarter for the company with metrics exceeding both guidance and prior year results. Year-over-year revenue growth was 14%, building on the 14% growth in the first quarter. Within this number, commercial aerospace growth was an outstanding 27% continuing a strong trend. Other revenue markets will be covered later in the call. EBITDA was $483 million, with a margin rate of 25.7%, while operating income was $414 million with a margin of 22%. Operating income was up 38% year-over-year and increased 370 basis points with engines and fasteners performing at the high level supported by an increasingly strong set of results in our structures business. Wheels was essentially flat despite the market declines. Earnings per share were $0.67, an increase of 52% year-on-year. Free cash flow was also strong at $342 million, resulting in a quarter end cash balance of $752 million, after share buybacks of $60 million and furthermore, a $23 million bond repurchases of the 2025 bonds and also dividends of $21 million. The strong cash balance for an early retirement at par of the remaining $205 million of the 2024 bonds on July 1, one day after the quarter end. These actions will reduce annual interest costs by some $12 million and continue the march to reduce interest rate drag, which is now well below $200 million with its increase in free cash flow yield. I'll provide commentary on the future dividend actions in the outlook section. You'll also note later in the \u2013 the increase in the capital expenditures in 2024 of a $30 million level. This takes the level towards $320 million for the year. And these expenditures are mainly the deposits on future new machine tools, which are required to support even further new capacity growth for our engines business. This is necessary as we have now secured additional market share at the second engine manufacturer. These revenues will also commence during 2026, albeit at a quarter or so later than the previous discussions on this topic. I'll now pass the call across to Ken to provide additional details by end market and by business segment.\nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 5. So markets continued to be healthy in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, performance was as follows: Total revenue was up 14%, driven by strong growth in commercial aerospace, which was up 27%. For the first half, commercial aerospace was up a healthy 25%. Growth continues to be robust this year on top of the 28% growth rate in 2022 and the 24% growth rate in 2023. Moving to our other markets. First, defense aerospace was also strong, up 11%, driven by fighter programs and engine spares demand. Next is commercial transportation. As expected, the market has weakened with revenue down 4%, although Howmet continues to gain share from Steel Wheels with Howmet's lighter and more fuel-efficient aluminum wheels. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 4%, driven by oil and gas, up 14%, IGT up 6%; and general industrial down 6%. In summary, continued strong performance in commercial aerospace, defense and industrial, partially offset by commercial transportation. Now let's move to Slide 6. So first, the P&L. For the second consecutive quarter, Q2 revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share were all records and exceeded the high end of guidance. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was up 14%, and EBITDA outpaced the revenue growth by being up 31%, while absorbing the addition of approximately 190 net new employees in the quarter. Incremental flow-through of revenue to EBITDA was excellent at 50%. Moreover, the team delivered records for both EBITDA margin of 25.7% and earnings per share of $0.67, which was up a healthy 52% year-over-year. Now let's cover the balance sheet and cash flow. The balance sheet and liquidity have never been stronger. Cash at the end of the quarter was $752 million, and free cash flow was a record for Q2 at $342 million. The healthy cash balance at the quarter end was used to repay the remaining balance on the 2024 bonds of $205 million. Payment was at par and was made three months early on July 1. Moreover, in Q2, we opportunistically repurchased $23 million of the 2025 bonds. The combination of these actions will reduce annual interest expense by $12 million annually, further improving free cash flow yield. Finally, net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 1.7x. All long-term debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of interest rate expense into the future. Liquidity is strong with a healthy cash balance and $1 billion undrawn revolver complemented by the flexibility of a $1 billion commercial paper program. Finally, capital deployment. We deployed approximately $104 million of cash in the quarter to shareholders, of which $60 million was used to repurchase common stock. This was the 13th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. The average diluted share count improved to a record low Q2 exit rate of 410 million shares. Finally, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the first quarter, we deployed $21 million for the quarterly common stock dividend of $0.05 per share. John will discuss the increase in the Q3 dividend as well as our 2025 dividend policy. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the second quarter. Engine Products delivered another record performance. Revenue increased 14% in the quarter to $933 million. Commercial aerospace was up 18% and defense aerospace was up 10%. Both markets realized higher OE build rates and spares. Oil and gas was up 14% and IGT was up 6%. Demand continues to be strong across all of our engine markets driven by our differentiated products. EBITDA increased 31% year-over-year to a record $292 million. EBITDA margin increased 410 basis points year-over-year to a record 31.3%, while absorbing approximately 315 net new employees in the quarter to support future growth. The engines team delivered a record quarter for revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Now let's go to Slide 8. Fastening Systems also had another strong quarter. Revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $394 million. Commercial aerospace was up 36%, including the impact of the wide-body recovery. Commercial transportation was up 10%. General industrial was up 3% and defense aerospace, which represents about 9% of Fasteners revenue was down 20%. Year-over-year, EBITDA outpaced revenue growth with an increase of 58% to just over $100 million. EBITDA margin increased 610 basis points year-over-year to a healthy 25.6%. The team has progressively improved results for four consecutive quarters through commercial and operational improvements, complemented by the wide-body recovery. Now let's move to Slide 9. Although engineered structures had a favorable comp year-over-year, performance continued to improve sequentially. Revenue increased 38% year-over-year to $275 million. Commercial aerospace was up 42%, driven by build rates in the wide-body recovery. Defense aerospace was up 45% year-over-year, driven primarily by the F-35 program. EBITDA doubled year-over-year, while EBITDA margin improved to 14.5%. Sequentially, revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin increased for the fourth consecutive quarter. Incrementals continue to improve sequentially at 23%. We continue to optimize the structures manufacturing footprint, and we expect to exit two small plants in the UK this year. The team continues to make progress, and we expect continued improvements throughout 2024. Finally, let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels revenue was down 7% year-over-year, as expected, in a challenging market. EBITDA also decreased by 7%, driven by volume and regional mix. EBITDA margin continues to be healthy at 27%, which is essentially flat year-over-year. With that, let me turn it back over to John for the outlook.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken, and let's now move to Slide 11, and I'll talk you through the end markets and provide some overview. Firstly, regarding commercial aerospace. Our prior comments regarding strong demand for air travel throughout the world continues to apply. Air traffic growth in Asia-Pacific has strengthened in particular, for international travel. In fact, international travel globally has been increasing in the 20% range, plus or minus. Freight volumes have also been robust with increases of 10% plus recorded. Domestic travel continues to go gradually in all markets. This travel demand, combined with an aging aircraft fleet is leading to significant orders and an extremely high backlog of total aircraft, or it is leading to a position where aircraft orders placed now cannot be fulfilled until the end of the decade and beyond in certain cases. However, the issue being faced by Howmet is not the demand, but rather that sales are currently constrained to some degree by the ability of aircraft manufacturers to build and deliver aircraft on a consistent basis. These facts are the subject of many press articles and this little point in repeating those facts here. While Airbus is steadily increasing requirements while building below desired levels and slowing its volume run, the larger concern is Boeing. While parts orders directly from Boeing shows some trimming, they continue to be at levels above the actual 737 and 787 build rates. Engine orders have also been trimmed, albeit by a large percentage. Given the situation, the question surrounding Boeing and its affiliates inventory positions and liquidation of such inventory remains. We've tried to derisk this to a large extent in our guidance. And notably, update our assumed 737 build rate to 22 aircraft per month in 2024 versus the previous view of 20 per month. Naturally, we hope for a higher build on this and also the future rates increases. In the case of defense, the outlook continues to be a double-digit increase for the year. Strength is seen in engine spares for the F-35 and for spares and newbuilds for legacy fighters. New orders are also being received for structural parts for Howitzers. IGT demand is for a significant single-digit growth. It's worth noting there is a potential for increasing demand in the future for new IGT turbines as a result of increased requirements emanating farm electricity demand for data centers and AI needs. This potential demand increase is being studied and is worthy of further commentary in the future. Howmet is well placed in the IGT market being the largest supplier of turbine blades in the world to our customers of Siemens, GE Vernova, Mitsubishi Heavy and Salto. Indeed, further production capacity will be added by Howmet into the IGT market in 2025 to support this increased demand. Oil and gas continues to be strong with double-digit increases. Spares for commercial aerospace, defense and IGT to continue to grow in aggregate at a pace of approximately 17% year-to-date, with further rate increase expected in the balance of the year. Commercial truck builds are beginning to abate and the long predicted slowdown, particularly in Europe, has started and will lay on the second half at maybe a 10% reduction in addition to the more normal European summer vacation seasonality. This normal seasonality is also noted in our European aerospace operations and is fully baked into our third quarter guidance. Before I talk to specific financial numbers, I'd like to cover three topics. First, the capital expenditure required for 2024 has been increased by a further $30 million to the midpoint of $320 million. This is reflective of additional customer contracts achieved with share gain for our engines business. A further exposee will be provided on this topic in our next call. Despite the additional capital expenditure, the free cash flow guide has been increased by $70 million, having taken account of this expenditure and also the increase for working capital in the revenue guide. The conversion of net income is maintained at the prior guide of approximately 85%. And ultimately, this expenditure leads to further future revenue growth. It's a great outcome, with revenue starting to accrete in late 2025. The guide for capital expenditures for 2024, 2025 is approximately 4% of revenue. The next topic is the dividend. We will increase the common stock dividend starting with the August payment to $0.08 per share. This is an increase of 60% and a further increase from our expectations discussed during our call in May. Moreover, for 2025, common stock dividends are expected to be in the 15% of net income, excluding special items, plus or minus 5%. Finally, share buyback authorization has also been addressed by the Board and increased by $2 billion to approximately a total of $2.5 billion. Now moving to specific numbers. In Q3, we expect revenues of $1.855 billion, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA of $465 million, plus or minus $5 million, and earnings per share of $0.64 plus or minus $0.01. It should also be noted that we have increased revenue guidance for the year both incorporating the Q2 beat and a further additional uplift to the previous assumed second half revenues. For the year, we now expect revenues to be at $7.44 billion, plus or minus $40 million, which is an increase of $140 million from the prior guide. EBITDA is guided to $1.865 billion, plus or minus $10 million, which is an increase of $115 million from the prior guide. Earnings per share increased to $2.55, plus or minus $0.02, an increase of 39% year-over-year. And free cash flow is guided to $870 million, plus or minus $30 million an increase of $70 million from the prior guide. And that's after increasing that CapEx requirements by $30 million and the revenue of $140 million. You can see from the numbers shown revenue, profit and free cash flow have lifted again for 2024, and that total annual revenue has increased to a 12% growth rate year-over-year. Now I'll move to provide a summary. First statement is, we are pleased with our second quarter results. The guide for the year has been raised again on all fronts. We believe we've taken account of the commercial aircraft build rigs and the inventory positions, which is centered on Boeing. And thank you very much, and now I'll move to the questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Doug.\nDouglas Harned: John, I wanted to see if you could help a little bit in understanding what's been happening at Airbus on the LEAP-1A. They talked about slowing engine deliveries. It's our understanding that relates to airfoils in the hot section at GE, and it's a supplier issue. Howmet's obviously a \u2013 the lead supplier for airfoils in the hot section. Has this \u2013 have you had any issues on delivery to GE? And if not, does a shortfall by others provide any kind of an opportunity to capture share?\nJohn Plant: Well, Doug, I expect that to be the hot topic of today given the comments on the, I'll say, opening evening of the Farnborough Air Show last week and then followed up by an article in Bloomberg this weekend. And I guess my first reaction to it as an investor in the company. So that's really good news. Because here, we are pumping in a 27% increase in commercial aerospace revenues, and if that exactly is true, then we need to make more. And therefore, this is a really good condition for us. So just getting a little bit more specific than that. You've heard on the call that over the last three years, we've put in a 28% increase in commercial aerospace revenues followed by 24% year-to-date this year of 25%. And if you were to track those increases compared to any form of aircraft build or schedules then you can see that we are increasing significantly above any aircraft production rates. And therefore, it's unlikely that we are providing such constraints. And then just to peel it a little bit further is that we have significantly increased our production of turbine blade and hot section. And if you look at it six months ago and over the last few months, we've probably put a 40% increase through in terms of production. And therefore, that's really good in terms of a rate increase for anybody in the aerospace industry. And probably effectively operating at capacity or possibly even above it on the current set of yields that we have. So the way I look at it is that we are producing well above engine build rates. And then we don't know, first of all, the outcome of what the subsequent processing is for our [indiscernible] and nor do we get to have any view about where do they go in terms of how we build versus MRO, so you'd be \u2013 sort of sales. And so I guess the way I look at it is, for Howmet, the opportunity appears to be there to sell even more if we're able to make a few more. But at the same time, there are adverse consequences upon us because if engine build is down, and you heard it in our guidance, that we've taken the engine build assumptions down to be in line with what we've heard from the engine manufacturers in recent times. And you've seen that those have been significant rate reduction, whereas previously, we've been prepared to meet those. And so when you get that, even though we have the demand opportunity to supply into the MRO market through our customer. We also suffer because if a lack of an engine build, then obviously, we're not able to supply any structural castings that we indeed manufacture. Nor are we able to supply parts in the low-pressure part of the turbine. And so given the recent, I'll say, build restrictions, we actually have some excess label short-term working in some of our French plants because of the LPT demand. So we're not unaffected. And clearly, we would like to make even more because there is the outlet into the service area which is not into the OE build. So it's a long way of saying to you, we are increasing. We have been \u2013 had a massive increase in the last few months and doing our best to satisfy everybody. And that's about as far as I can take it. And don't know what else to say to you to provide any further color.\nDouglas Harned: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, thank you for the question. John, very helpful color regarding the LEAP engine blades as you spelled out. I mean, I guess, if we take a step back with the new engine technology, both for the GTF and for the LEAP. It's clear that the hot section is getting a lot more, it's getting used more, it's hotter, higher performance. And from our visit at Whitehall, you've clearly invested in this space. Can you quantify how much more market share you could potentially get? It seems like you're not the bottleneck for production and you've got content. And then also as a follow-up, in terms of the newbuild, you said you're not seeing the reduction there. Does that mean that one for one, you're seeing spares pick up to? Or are the OEs maintaining the rate at a higher level?\nJohn Plant: Again, at the moment, nothing is that easy to explain. And so what I did want to present to you, complex pictures, it probably becomes necessary to do so. Clearly, the investment that I've talked about, both in the last two calls and then today, a third time. But today, introducing the fact that we are further increasing our capital expenditure to meet demand for a second engine manufacturer. Then that was previously mentioned and then mentioned as a result of additional contract and share that we are able to fulfill in the future \u2013 fulfilled with the introduction of that new capacity. When we bring that new capacity online, then we're going to take the next plant, so we're building out footprint in two particular plants at the moment. And that when we finish that footprint, the level of, I'll say, sophistication, automation and quality and use of, for example, AI and our tests [indiscernible] are going to be taken to another level because to achieve the levels of production that we see, the only way to do it with the consistency in yields that we do is automation because you can't easily do it using a lot of labor. And so yes, we are taking the technology to another level in terms of manufacturing. And we're also able to help our customers in meeting what they would like to see by way of elevated temperature performance and increased pressures. So when the original developments and uplifts for the two most recent engines, they move from being more focused on from fuel efficiency to more robustness, and that's something that we're able to work with them to try to achieve. So all of that is in play. And you've read articles that some of those upgrades will be available subject to the certification requirements later in 2025. And then progressively, I'll say, launched with each of the aircraft manufacturers over the next couple of years. And it doesn't matter whether it's a LEAP-based engine or a GTF engine, and we're working on the upgrades for all of those. And again, we'll be providing those new products into the service market as well. So as an example, included or maybe it's over and above the increases in volumes that I've talked about, we've built already some tens of thousands of parts ready for the new improvements for engine manufacturers and those are currently sitting in inventory awaiting certification signoff, and then they'll be assembled into engines.\nKristine Liwag: Great. Thanks, John.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hey. Thanks very much and good morning. I wonder, John, if you could talk a little bit about 787. We've seen some mixed messages here. It seems like some of the Japanese structure suppliers may be preparing to increase their rates. Boeing deliveries are low, one of the European suppliers shutting down for a little while. When you think about the trajectory in the fasteners and structures business. How are you thinking about 787?\nJohn Plant: On the structure side. So far, we've been seeing our deliveries from Howmet in line with the previous guidance. At the same time, we do note that one of the European manufacturers is now saying they're going to cut back over the summer. And we've taken account of that in our \u2013 in the guide that we provided to you in the same way, as I said, that we covered out the reduction in LPT turbine blades and also substructural castings. In the case of Fasteners, again, we note that Boeing are not building 787 that they stated rates, that they wanted to have in their skyline. And so in the same way as we've done with the 737 in using Fasteners, which are on a Min/Max system rather than, I'll say, directly schedule part is that we've taken those inventory levels down to the minimum such that we're in accordance with our contract with Boeing, but not seeking to put inventories above that level, such that we get caught with in, but you take out later in the year or next year should that happen.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Thank you very much.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thank you. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, David.\nDavid Strauss: Hey, John. So in the past, John, I think you've talked about targeting a 30% or so incremental margin, plus or minus 5%. It looks like this year, your revised guidance implies something in the 40% to 45% range. So just wanted to get some updated comments about how to think about incremental margins for the business? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Yes. We've have increased the balance of year. I think it's just fractionally over 40% in Q3, and that takes account of both the seasonality plus the reduction in our Wheels business that we envisage at the moment, principally coming from Europe, but also affecting Class 8 trucks in the U.S. as well. So that's how we've put that incremental into Q3. And essentially in Q4, Wheels should be rather stronger than that to end up the year at a higher level. Continuing the theme from our last earnings call, David, is that, if you look at the rate of increase in employee headcount, which I think last quarter, we said it's about a net \u2013 just over 400, which in itself was a slightly reduced rate. While we've still been hiring, it's now down to just fractioning below 200. And yet, if you look at the increase in revenue, and it's significantly above that in terms of percentage. So you can assume that productivity is being achieved and in the case of our Fasteners business on top of it, I think there's a 28% increase in revenue in Q1, 20% in Q2. We've actually taken zero incremental headcount. So, here we are pumping out 20%-plus revenues with no incremental peak, which obviously helps a lot towards the, I'll say, bottom line and the efficiency within the business. And so at the half year, on a net basis, we're up probably 600 people in the company, and all of that is in our Engine business. And that's because of both the demand level that we have, plus also we do need to begin to prepare for the increased capacity because headcount is going to be required or go through all the recruitment and training that we've talked about in the past, because it takes a lot of efforts to gain the skills that are requisite for it to be an employee in our engines business. So we're pleased with where we've got to, by way of efficiency. We're seeing it on the people side. We're seeing it also a slight calming in the inflation. And so in fact, in Q2, we had a tiny deflation in our metals input, which was good for the aerospace business, but it was not worth talking about in terms of probably wasn't even \u2013 I\u2019ll say we didn't even get to 10 basis points. And so \u2013 but it was good that we didn't have a headwind. And then the only area we have a current headwind is the increase in price of aluminum which obviously affects our Wheels business. And so we'll see that small drag getting $1 recover for $1 of cost that always provides a margin drag, and we'll add that margin drag to the reduced sales affecting our Wheels business. So really signaling that Wheels revenues will be down and the margin will be down a little bit more in the third quarter because of seasonality and the demand factor plus the aluminum. But if you put together as a company, we are seeing, I was saying, good stability across the piece in terms of input metals and increase in labor productivity and good demand of parts with giving us I'd say, fairly, I'd say, good mix, which are reflected in the guidance where we're guiding at about 25% EBITDA margin in the second half as well.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Myles.\nMyles Walton: Hey, John, you stopped specifying pricing but I have to imagine, given the sort of breakaway moment here in the quarter pricing must be accelerating. Can you give any comment on that front? And also, just to take it at a higher level, you talked about the Airbus and Boeing not being able to achieve their production objectives. But it did seem like GE had more of a material shortfall on their own. And I'm curious, do you see this as a blip in their ability to get production up and maybe the risks are shifting to the engine as opposed to the airframe? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Okay. So rate changes, the aircraft manager, manufacturers are well publicized. So in the case of Airbus, I think they've taken the annual expectations of deliveries down by 30 aircraft, which I assume the majority are narrow bodies. And they did talk about some engine availability issues on their discussions at Farnborough last week. In the case of Boeing, again, it's all well publicized and we took a little bit of encouragement from what the Head of Boeing Commercial Aerospace said by way of increased stability within the manufacturing plant in Seattle. So with expectation of them achieving rates 38 by the end of the year, which is great. And clearly, we haven't assumed that they get that far, but we did feel bold enough to go from our previous assumption of 22 production, 20 production to a 22 rate albeit probably still significantly below where the majority are expecting that to be. In the case of engine manufacturer, those rates are far less, really discussed. And from what I saw and read is that the expectation is that the LEAP engine output will increase significantly in the second half of the year, which is really good. And so that will ramp up some of our current RC inventory in, say, structural casting and the low-pressure turbine, combined with obviously still the very high rates of production in the high-pressure turbine. So I think that covers that part of the question adequately. In terms of price, we haven't given any further guidance to the price topic and from what we gave at the end of last year, which was that instead of 2024 being of a similar level, plus or minus 2023 and that level has reached, I think at just about a $100 million across the whole of the company. Then we said it would be that or a little bit more. And no change from that guidance at all that we have given. And so you can assume it's exactly as we previously indicated, but really not commenting further on the topic.\nMyles Walton: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Congrats guys on a great quarter and securing the second engine win. So John, maybe you could help elaborate on the terms there. And what Ken agreed on that. So if you could just talk about how we think about that second engine OEM. I think you said the volumes start up a quarter later than the first OEM in 2026. So how do we think about that incremental volume that comes through the return profile with the additional CapEx? And I'm guessing it's better than the 31% engine margins you have today? And any thoughts on the first versus the second deal?\nJohn Plant: Yes. It's obviously good business, otherwise we wouldn't take it. At the same time, whenever you put down new engine capacity. As you know, engine manufacturing is very capital-intensive. And so we will be facing elevated depreciation charges because the average you'll get on, I'll say, your written down asset base compared to putting in new capital is very different. And in an earlier part of this call, I talked about, in fact, the extraordinary levels of automation to which we're having to go to basics to achieve this consistency of quality and yields that are so vital to being able to produce effectively for the, I'll say, new special requirements for these turbine types of products. And so I didn't really want to get into specifically pinpointing any particular margin. We can assume that it's satisfactory. Otherwise, we're going to achieve an adequate return on capital. And sufficient that I think will make our investors very satisfied. At the same time, the margin rates will be adequate. But I'll say, we'll be pumping them through with adding as little fixed cost as possible but at the same time, we recognize that we'll be adding depreciation costs. But it's a long way of saying it's okay Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you so much. Can you comment on the volume?\nJohn Plant: Clearly, volumes are up because we said we'd be taking additional share as part of this. I don't really want to comment on specific market shares that we have on any particular customer. I don't think that's an appropriate thing to be talking about publicly. But the important thing is the share gain is pretty healthy. And it is similarly in line with the previous increase that in share that we talked about for the earlier investments. So basically, this one is the investments are about six months \u2013 kicking off them six months later than the previous investment. And now clearly, our job is to try to place all of those new machine tools, get that as quickly as possible and place them and commission them as soon as possible because the demand is clearly there for them. And so our customers would like to see them come on as early as possible. And it's all going to be tied up with not just what they want for them, what they see is volumes today. But also the certification of the changes going on in the engine world, which the FAA and the EASA will have to sign off both for Airbus and Boeing where these new engine upgrades are \u2013 as they have to be certified as well. So we await that. It could be different for each of the manufacturers we feel.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Mikus: Hi. This is Scott Mikus on for Rob Spingarn. John, I hate to put you on the spot and ask for a long-term margin target here, but your operating margins were quite strong in the quarter. They're in the low-20s now and precision cash parts, there is always noise in the numbers due to metal pricing and LIFO reserves, but it's operating margins before it was acquired, we're in the high-20s. Do you think Howmet has the potential to eventually get there long-term?\nJohn Plant: Well, first of all, I wasn't quite sure whether those cash parts were operating margins or EBITDA margins, but it doesn't really matter because I don't really comment on margin at all. Aerospace is a cyclical industry and anybody who has the absolute knowledge and precedence to know exactly what volumes will be next year and the year after and the year after that and what the rate of increase will be is something that I don't have. And therefore, I've never been comfortable talking about what I think margin rates will be in the future. I think all we can do is to say this is what we're doing \u2013 these are the changes we're trying to make to improve our company. And I don't follow some I'll say false guard of whatever happened over a decade ago, one company, whether those were real or not real margins at the time and what type of margin rate was covered. So I choose not to do it, Scott. So I don't think I ever have, and I don't think I ever will comment on margin rates. It's something which like how do you know? And so I recognize that some companies do say what their margins are going to be two or three years from now. Whether they're achieved or not seems to get lost, but you won't find me doing it.\nScott Mikus: Okay. Got it. I'll stick with one. Thanks, John.\nJohn Plant: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nJohn Plant: Hey, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: John, you had explained that the incrementals were strong in the first half because you didn't have to higher as fast while the revenue growth is still pretty good. I guess that begs the question of when you suspect you'll be back to hiring. And then I guess when I look through how the segments have evolved, Engine is up like 1,000 basis points versus pre-pandemic. Fastening is still lower than pre-pandemic. Obviously, that's \u2013 we know why that has a lagged revenue recovery. I guess does Fastening have as much potential as engine as it continues to get its revenue recovery?\nJohn Plant: As you know, Noah, in commercial aero, nothing is ever exactly the same. Pre-pandemic, we were at time, I think, producing something like nine A350s a month and 13 or 14 787s a month. And as you know, we produce a completely different set of Fasteners for a composite-based aircraft than a metallic-based aircraft. And to some degree, you saw that when the 787 was halted at one point, we moved down to zero because of the clearing out of inventories, and we've been climbing back from there, both in terms of a favorable mix, but also the effects of trying to drive productivity in that business and also being probably a little bit better commercially. At this point, I don't know what eventual rate Wide Body will get to. And therefore, the future mix is going to be different. I note the increase in A350. And I suspect that the A350 would be the higher rating \u2013 wasn't for some also supply constraints, particularly in the structures area. And that's slated to go to, I think, is it 12 a month by 2027, which would be great because that will be above the previous rate. On 787, the only ambitious number I've heard is rate 10, which was slightly plus 2025, 2026, but then the thing is being modified now to 2026. But I think we've got to wait and see what happens in 2025 first. And getting up from where I think our current production is maybe three a month, four a month levels, what I've read. And it would be great to get back to five and then seven next year. And I think that's tied up with maybe a few particular parts I've read about probably also the same thing as we had previously. I mean, supply chain is often quoted, but often, there's also issues within the assembly processes for some of these aircraft. And so that all needs picking apart in much greater detail. And let's see the rates progress during obviously, balance of 2024 into 2025 before we get to what's the real rate going to be in 2026 and 2027. But should we get back to, let's say, 14 a month of 787s and if it gets 12 a month, stated for the A350. And I guess it depends on \u2013 then what the volume of the metallic-based narrow bodies will be but that would be a very positive factor for us. But I don't feel like saying that we move back to any particular previous margin level. I think the most important thing is if you just look at the track of our margin for the fastener business during the recent quarters. I think it's been truly impressive in terms of sequential improvement and that's as far as I\u2019ll go.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go head.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, John, Ken and PT and congrats on the results.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Hey. Just, John, maybe to put a finer point on it, where, if anywhere, do you see excess inventory in the channel of your products? Has there been any deferral requests or anything incrementally that is weakening some of the outlook beyond maybe 2024. Obviously, you've raised 2024, but anything that gives you pause in 2025? And then lastly \u2013 relatedly I just wanted to ask that Asheville RTX facility, has that had any negative impact on the longer-term outlook for \u2013 after 135 or any other programs you service? Thanks.\nJohn Plant: Okay. So maybe I'll deal with the Asheville question first. I haven't heard any commentary coming out of RTX in the last 30 years or so on that facility. I believe it's coming up to rate on machining work, and that's probably necessary to get through the disc inspection and recall. On the investment castings process, I haven't really heard anything that's material in that area. And so I'm still all of my previous comments about that facility, you just stand there on the record as is. The moment we're not seeing that reflected in any change of our requirements over the next few years. And at this point, don't expect it to \u2013 I mean what happens, let's say, after, I don't know, 2030 compared to the $650 million that was the announced investment, which doesn't go far across coating and machining and building online on investment castings. I think you've got a few more billion, several billions to go yet to \u2013 for that to become sufficiently equipped at scale to be cost effective. And it's not clear to me that Pratt & Whitney are emphasizing that investment compared to getting through the, I'll say, current GTF issues and servicing the cash costs of that provision that was made last year of I think it's $6 billion, obviously shared between them and some partners. But that's a big nugget to absorb. So I don't know more than that. And just because I've been spending so much time focused on that question. What was the first part of it? Sorry, was it excess inventory in the channel?\nGautam Khanna: Yes. Excess inventory.\nJohn Plant: Not really. I mean it\u2019s a bit superior. So as I said, we were a little bit surprised when we got cut back recently on the low-pressure turbine parts because those LEAP engines weren't assembled. And so we've probably got more than we would like and therefore, trying to manage that through the next quarter or so. And according to what we can do by way of changing the employment, I'll say, ours facilities into one plant in France. But its nothing of great note. And because I said earlier, if you think about it, there's so many moving parts going on at the moment in the industry, like what's \u2013 we see what aircraft manufacturers delivery rates are, how much comes out of production compared to how much comes out of inventory? What's the state of how many aircraft have started to [indiscernible] roll out plans, that's pretty opaque? And we don't really have and you don't have good production level information. And then you get from that, all of the engines, you've got all the image they got. So there's so many different aspects to it, and it must be really difficult for you to model because it's difficult for us. And so what I would advise you to do is just take our guide in the way we've tried to set it out. We've been cautious where we need to. We've called out reductions, for example, in the Wheels business, where we see now that reduction in market activity very clearly started in Q2 and it's going to be significant in Q3, exacerbated by the seasonality because, as you know, the European plants tend to go [indiscernible] for several weeks in July and August. And so we've got all of that. And the best I think we can do is to say, look at the guide, it takes account to the best level of knowledge. It keeps pace with all of the previous production quantities we talked about on the first quarter earnings call and adjusted for the Boeing rates only. And we've taken engine right down to match what we've been advised in the case of the engine manufacturers.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ron, your line is unmuted.\nRonald Epstein: Hey, guys. Sorry about that. I was muted.\nJohn Plant: Hi, Ron. I thought that was the best question all day because I thought I haven't going to answer it.\nRonald Epstein: Yes. The easy one, right?\nJohn Plant: Yes. The easy one.\nRonald Epstein: The ones that don't show up. So just a quick, just a broad one. A lot of stuff has been asked, but what are the feedback we picked up over at Farnborough and probably every meeting we went into was just a shortage of castings kind of across the industry. So maybe more broadly, I mean, you do casting, right? I mean, what kind of opportunity is that for Howmet to pick up share or more business because of what's going on in the casting world? I mean is there an opportunity? Is it not? Do you see it resolving itself? If you could talk on that?\nJohn Plant: Yes. Again, you got to pick it apart between that which is the casting for structural castings, compare to high pressure turbine castings and low-pressure turbines. And the case of where we've seen OE engine cutbacks, and that's, I'll say, negatively affected to a small degree, our structural casting and the LPT castings we do. And so I guess that just goes to the territory. The capacity isn\u2019t fungible. So you can't just say I'll now make high-pressure turbine castings and with that because there's different dyes, different I'll say, different casting techniques, et cetera. And so it's not immediately transferable at all. So the key to, let's say, is can we produce any further high-pressure turbine castings because the service demand seems to be high and possibly higher than certainly that we have been advised six months or a year ago. And so we put all our shoulders to wheel and trying everything we can to increase that while also stating that we know we're well above engine rates. I'm not giving you any specific quantities, but you can assume that, that seems absolutely correct, we're well above engine rate. And then it's \u2013 what goes to service at the MRO shops and what goes to the, I'll say, OE production, that's not our decision. So we're going to try to improve once again, and it will go to yield in the short-term that will go to fresh capital expenditure in that medium term. And so we've been clear that for us to put down fresh capital because of its high capital intensity, and you got to have a surety return is that's why we've struck agreements which lock in market share commensurate with those investment requirements for future. So we're positioned well for the future. But if you said to us, can we produce another 30% high-pressure turbine casting during the next two months? The answer would be, no, we can't. We'll be well above engine rate. And then that's about all we can say. And it's going to go, can we improve our internal yields, and obviously, we'll be talking to our customers about how they can help with that. And we've got some really good collaboration with our customers at the moment trying to achieve improvements over and above the improvements in volumes that we've already achieved. So I'm feeling pretty positive about it. I like the dynamic. I like the fact that we've got significant demand. But I've also got to be realistic. I just don't have a knob I can turn and say, I'll go and produce another 30%, it doesn't work like that. We've got new tools to put down. We've got new casting machines. We've got new presses, new everything to fundamentally change that. That's what I said. We'll bring that capacity on and we'll see the fruits of that in 2026.\nRonald Epstein: Got it. And if I may, just on that along that same question. How much better could you get in yields? Because my understanding already is you guys are pretty good.\nJohn Plant: It's going to be at the margin. Where we are \u2013 from where we are today, the only way is to where \u2013 sometimes this may be excessive requirements on drawing whether those can be relaxed anyway, which don't go to performance. But it's those sort of tiny things, which matter, but don't matter that to your product performance. There's possibly something in that, and call it, clearly, we will study that. But while always protecting the quality of the product that we produce.\nRonald Epstein: Got it. Thank you.\nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ron.\nOperator: That is all the time we have today for questions. Thank you all for attending and participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a great day.",

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thank you, PT, and welcome, everyone to the Howmet's second quarter earnings call. Q2 is a strong quarter for the company with metrics exceeding both guidance and prior year results. Year-over-year revenue growth was 14%, building on the 14% growth in the first quarter. Within this number, commercial aerospace growth was an outstanding 27% continuing a strong trend. Other revenue markets will be covered later in the call. EBITDA was $483 million, with a margin rate of 25.7%, while operating income was $414 million with a margin of 22%. Operating income was up 38% year-over-year and increased 370 basis points with engines and fasteners performing at the high level supported by an increasingly strong set of results in our structures business. Wheels was essentially flat despite the market declines. Earnings per share were $0.67, an increase of 52% year-on-year. Free cash flow was also strong at $342 million, resulting in a quarter end cash balance of $752 million, after share buybacks of $60 million and furthermore, a $23 million bond repurchases of the 2025 bonds and also dividends of $21 million. The strong cash balance for an early retirement at par of the remaining $205 million of the 2024 bonds on July 1, one day after the quarter end. These actions will reduce annual interest costs by some $12 million and continue the march to reduce interest rate drag, which is now well below $200 million with its increase in free cash flow yield. I'll provide commentary on the future dividend actions in the outlook section. You'll also note later in the \u2013 the increase in the capital expenditures in 2024 of a $30 million level. This takes the level towards $320 million for the year. And these expenditures are mainly the deposits on future new machine tools, which are required to support even further new capacity growth for our engines business. This is necessary as we have now secured additional market share at the second engine manufacturer. These revenues will also commence during 2026, albeit at a quarter or so later than the previous discussions on this topic. I'll now pass the call across to Ken to provide additional details by end market and by business segment. Thanks, Ken, and let's now move to Slide 11, and I'll talk you through the end markets and provide some overview. Firstly, regarding commercial aerospace. Our prior comments regarding strong demand for air travel throughout the world continues to apply. Air traffic growth in Asia-Pacific has strengthened in particular, for international travel. In fact, international travel globally has been increasing in the 20% range, plus or minus. Freight volumes have also been robust with increases of 10% plus recorded. Domestic travel continues to go gradually in all markets. This travel demand, combined with an aging aircraft fleet is leading to significant orders and an extremely high backlog of total aircraft, or it is leading to a position where aircraft orders placed now cannot be fulfilled until the end of the decade and beyond in certain cases. However, the issue being faced by Howmet is not the demand, but rather that sales are currently constrained to some degree by the ability of aircraft manufacturers to build and deliver aircraft on a consistent basis. These facts are the subject of many press articles and this little point in repeating those facts here. While Airbus is steadily increasing requirements while building below desired levels and slowing its volume run, the larger concern is Boeing. While parts orders directly from Boeing shows some trimming, they continue to be at levels above the actual 737 and 787 build rates. Engine orders have also been trimmed, albeit by a large percentage. Given the situation, the question surrounding Boeing and its affiliates inventory positions and liquidation of such inventory remains. We've tried to derisk this to a large extent in our guidance. And notably, update our assumed 737 build rate to 22 aircraft per month in 2024 versus the previous view of 20 per month. Naturally, we hope for a higher build on this and also the future rates increases. In the case of defense, the outlook continues to be a double-digit increase for the year. Strength is seen in engine spares for the F-35 and for spares and newbuilds for legacy fighters. New orders are also being received for structural parts for Howitzers. IGT demand is for a significant single-digit growth. It's worth noting there is a potential for increasing demand in the future for new IGT turbines as a result of increased requirements emanating farm electricity demand for data centers and AI needs. This potential demand increase is being studied and is worthy of further commentary in the future. Howmet is well placed in the IGT market being the largest supplier of turbine blades in the world to our customers of Siemens, GE Vernova, Mitsubishi Heavy and Salto. Indeed, further production capacity will be added by Howmet into the IGT market in 2025 to support this increased demand. Oil and gas continues to be strong with double-digit increases. Spares for commercial aerospace, defense and IGT to continue to grow in aggregate at a pace of approximately 17% year-to-date, with further rate increase expected in the balance of the year. Commercial truck builds are beginning to abate and the long predicted slowdown, particularly in Europe, has started and will lay on the second half at maybe a 10% reduction in addition to the more normal European summer vacation seasonality. This normal seasonality is also noted in our European aerospace operations and is fully baked into our third quarter guidance. Before I talk to specific financial numbers, I'd like to cover three topics. First, the capital expenditure required for 2024 has been increased by a further $30 million to the midpoint of $320 million. This is reflective of additional customer contracts achieved with share gain for our engines business. A further exposee will be provided on this topic in our next call. Despite the additional capital expenditure, the free cash flow guide has been increased by $70 million, having taken account of this expenditure and also the increase for working capital in the revenue guide. The conversion of net income is maintained at the prior guide of approximately 85%. And ultimately, this expenditure leads to further future revenue growth. It's a great outcome, with revenue starting to accrete in late 2025. The guide for capital expenditures for 2024, 2025 is approximately 4% of revenue. The next topic is the dividend. We will increase the common stock dividend starting with the August payment to $0.08 per share. This is an increase of 60% and a further increase from our expectations discussed during our call in May. Moreover, for 2025, common stock dividends are expected to be in the 15% of net income, excluding special items, plus or minus 5%. Finally, share buyback authorization has also been addressed by the Board and increased by $2 billion to approximately a total of $2.5 billion. Now moving to specific numbers. In Q3, we expect revenues of $1.855 billion, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA of $465 million, plus or minus $5 million, and earnings per share of $0.64 plus or minus $0.01. It should also be noted that we have increased revenue guidance for the year both incorporating the Q2 beat and a further additional uplift to the previous assumed second half revenues. For the year, we now expect revenues to be at $7.44 billion, plus or minus $40 million, which is an increase of $140 million from the prior guide. EBITDA is guided to $1.865 billion, plus or minus $10 million, which is an increase of $115 million from the prior guide. Earnings per share increased to $2.55, plus or minus $0.02, an increase of 39% year-over-year. And free cash flow is guided to $870 million, plus or minus $30 million an increase of $70 million from the prior guide. And that's after increasing that CapEx requirements by $30 million and the revenue of $140 million. You can see from the numbers shown revenue, profit and free cash flow have lifted again for 2024, and that total annual revenue has increased to a 12% growth rate year-over-year. Now I'll move to provide a summary. First statement is, we are pleased with our second quarter results. The guide for the year has been raised again on all fronts. We believe we've taken account of the commercial aircraft build rigs and the inventory positions, which is centered on Boeing. And thank you very much, and now I'll move to the questions. Hey, Doug. Well, Doug, I expect that to be the hot topic of today given the comments on the, I'll say, opening evening of the Farnborough Air Show last week and then followed up by an article in Bloomberg this weekend. And I guess my first reaction to it as an investor in the company. So that's really good news. Because here, we are pumping in a 27% increase in commercial aerospace revenues, and if that exactly is true, then we need to make more. And therefore, this is a really good condition for us. So just getting a little bit more specific than that. You've heard on the call that over the last three years, we've put in a 28% increase in commercial aerospace revenues followed by 24% year-to-date this year of 25%. And if you were to track those increases compared to any form of aircraft build or schedules then you can see that we are increasing significantly above any aircraft production rates. And therefore, it's unlikely that we are providing such constraints. And then just to peel it a little bit further is that we have significantly increased our production of turbine blade and hot section. And if you look at it six months ago and over the last few months, we've probably put a 40% increase through in terms of production. And therefore, that's really good in terms of a rate increase for anybody in the aerospace industry. And probably effectively operating at capacity or possibly even above it on the current set of yields that we have. So the way I look at it is that we are producing well above engine build rates. And then we don't know, first of all, the outcome of what the subsequent processing is for our [indiscernible] and nor do we get to have any view about where do they go in terms of how we build versus MRO, so you'd be \u2013 sort of sales. And so I guess the way I look at it is, for Howmet, the opportunity appears to be there to sell even more if we're able to make a few more. But at the same time, there are adverse consequences upon us because if engine build is down, and you heard it in our guidance, that we've taken the engine build assumptions down to be in line with what we've heard from the engine manufacturers in recent times. And you've seen that those have been significant rate reduction, whereas previously, we've been prepared to meet those. And so when you get that, even though we have the demand opportunity to supply into the MRO market through our customer. We also suffer because if a lack of an engine build, then obviously, we're not able to supply any structural castings that we indeed manufacture. Nor are we able to supply parts in the low-pressure part of the turbine. And so given the recent, I'll say, build restrictions, we actually have some excess label short-term working in some of our French plants because of the LPT demand. So we're not unaffected. And clearly, we would like to make even more because there is the outlet into the service area which is not into the OE build. So it's a long way of saying to you, we are increasing. We have been \u2013 had a massive increase in the last few months and doing our best to satisfy everybody. And that's about as far as I can take it. And don't know what else to say to you to provide any further color. Again, at the moment, nothing is that easy to explain. And so what I did want to present to you, complex pictures, it probably becomes necessary to do so. Clearly, the investment that I've talked about, both in the last two calls and then today, a third time. But today, introducing the fact that we are further increasing our capital expenditure to meet demand for a second engine manufacturer. Then that was previously mentioned and then mentioned as a result of additional contract and share that we are able to fulfill in the future \u2013 fulfilled with the introduction of that new capacity. When we bring that new capacity online, then we're going to take the next plant, so we're building out footprint in two particular plants at the moment. And that when we finish that footprint, the level of, I'll say, sophistication, automation and quality and use of, for example, AI and our tests [indiscernible] are going to be taken to another level because to achieve the levels of production that we see, the only way to do it with the consistency in yields that we do is automation because you can't easily do it using a lot of labor. And so yes, we are taking the technology to another level in terms of manufacturing. And we're also able to help our customers in meeting what they would like to see by way of elevated temperature performance and increased pressures. So when the original developments and uplifts for the two most recent engines, they move from being more focused on from fuel efficiency to more robustness, and that's something that we're able to work with them to try to achieve. So all of that is in play. And you've read articles that some of those upgrades will be available subject to the certification requirements later in 2025. And then progressively, I'll say, launched with each of the aircraft manufacturers over the next couple of years. And it doesn't matter whether it's a LEAP-based engine or a GTF engine, and we're working on the upgrades for all of those. And again, we'll be providing those new products into the service market as well. So as an example, included or maybe it's over and above the increases in volumes that I've talked about, we've built already some tens of thousands of parts ready for the new improvements for engine manufacturers and those are currently sitting in inventory awaiting certification signoff, and then they'll be assembled into engines. Thank you. On the structure side. So far, we've been seeing our deliveries from Howmet in line with the previous guidance. At the same time, we do note that one of the European manufacturers is now saying they're going to cut back over the summer. And we've taken account of that in our \u2013 in the guide that we provided to you in the same way, as I said, that we covered out the reduction in LPT turbine blades and also substructural castings. In the case of Fasteners, again, we note that Boeing are not building 787 that they stated rates, that they wanted to have in their skyline. And so in the same way as we've done with the 737 in using Fasteners, which are on a Min/Max system rather than, I'll say, directly schedule part is that we've taken those inventory levels down to the minimum such that we're in accordance with our contract with Boeing, but not seeking to put inventories above that level, such that we get caught with in, but you take out later in the year or next year should that happen. Thank you. Hey, David. Yes. We've have increased the balance of year. I think it's just fractionally over 40% in Q3, and that takes account of both the seasonality plus the reduction in our Wheels business that we envisage at the moment, principally coming from Europe, but also affecting Class 8 trucks in the U.S. as well. So that's how we've put that incremental into Q3. And essentially in Q4, Wheels should be rather stronger than that to end up the year at a higher level. Continuing the theme from our last earnings call, David, is that, if you look at the rate of increase in employee headcount, which I think last quarter, we said it's about a net \u2013 just over 400, which in itself was a slightly reduced rate. While we've still been hiring, it's now down to just fractioning below 200. And yet, if you look at the increase in revenue, and it's significantly above that in terms of percentage. So you can assume that productivity is being achieved and in the case of our Fasteners business on top of it, I think there's a 28% increase in revenue in Q1, 20% in Q2. We've actually taken zero incremental headcount. So, here we are pumping out 20%-plus revenues with no incremental peak, which obviously helps a lot towards the, I'll say, bottom line and the efficiency within the business. And so at the half year, on a net basis, we're up probably 600 people in the company, and all of that is in our Engine business. And that's because of both the demand level that we have, plus also we do need to begin to prepare for the increased capacity because headcount is going to be required or go through all the recruitment and training that we've talked about in the past, because it takes a lot of efforts to gain the skills that are requisite for it to be an employee in our engines business. So we're pleased with where we've got to, by way of efficiency. We're seeing it on the people side. We're seeing it also a slight calming in the inflation. And so in fact, in Q2, we had a tiny deflation in our metals input, which was good for the aerospace business, but it was not worth talking about in terms of probably wasn't even \u2013 I'll say we didn't even get to 10 basis points. And so \u2013 but it was good that we didn't have a headwind. And then the only area we have a current headwind is the increase in price of aluminum which obviously affects our Wheels business. And so we'll see that small drag getting $1 recover for $1 of cost that always provides a margin drag, and we'll add that margin drag to the reduced sales affecting our Wheels business. So really signaling that Wheels revenues will be down and the margin will be down a little bit more in the third quarter because of seasonality and the demand factor plus the aluminum. But if you put together as a company, we are seeing, I was saying, good stability across the piece in terms of input metals and increase in labor productivity and good demand of parts with giving us I'd say, fairly, I'd say, good mix, which are reflected in the guidance where we're guiding at about 25% EBITDA margin in the second half as well. Hey, Myles. Okay. So rate changes, the aircraft manager, manufacturers are well publicized. So in the case of Airbus, I think they've taken the annual expectations of deliveries down by 30 aircraft, which I assume the majority are narrow bodies. And they did talk about some engine availability issues on their discussions at Farnborough last week. In the case of Boeing, again, it's all well publicized and we took a little bit of encouragement from what the Head of Boeing Commercial Aerospace said by way of increased stability within the manufacturing plant in Seattle. So with expectation of them achieving rates 38 by the end of the year, which is great. And clearly, we haven't assumed that they get that far, but we did feel bold enough to go from our previous assumption of 22 production, 20 production to a 22 rate albeit probably still significantly below where the majority are expecting that to be. In the case of engine manufacturer, those rates are far less, really discussed. And from what I saw and read is that the expectation is that the LEAP engine output will increase significantly in the second half of the year, which is really good. And so that will ramp up some of our current RC inventory in, say, structural casting and the low-pressure turbine, combined with obviously still the very high rates of production in the high-pressure turbine. So I think that covers that part of the question adequately. In terms of price, we haven't given any further guidance to the price topic and from what we gave at the end of last year, which was that instead of 2024 being of a similar level, plus or minus 2023 and that level has reached, I think at just about a $100 million across the whole of the company. Then we said it would be that or a little bit more. And no change from that guidance at all that we have given. And so you can assume it's exactly as we previously indicated, but really not commenting further on the topic. Thank you. Yes. It's obviously good business, otherwise we wouldn't take it. At the same time, whenever you put down new engine capacity. As you know, engine manufacturing is very capital-intensive. And so we will be facing elevated depreciation charges because the average you'll get on, I'll say, your written down asset base compared to putting in new capital is very different. And in an earlier part of this call, I talked about, in fact, the extraordinary levels of automation to which we're having to go to basics to achieve this consistency of quality and yields that are so vital to being able to produce effectively for the, I'll say, new special requirements for these turbine types of products. And so I didn't really want to get into specifically pinpointing any particular margin. We can assume that it's satisfactory. Otherwise, we're going to achieve an adequate return on capital. And sufficient that I think will make our investors very satisfied. At the same time, the margin rates will be adequate. But I'll say, we'll be pumping them through with adding as little fixed cost as possible but at the same time, we recognize that we'll be adding depreciation costs. But it's a long way of saying it's okay Sheila. Clearly, volumes are up because we said we'd be taking additional share as part of this. I don't really want to comment on specific market shares that we have on any particular customer. I don't think that's an appropriate thing to be talking about publicly. But the important thing is the share gain is pretty healthy. And it is similarly in line with the previous increase that in share that we talked about for the earlier investments. So basically, this one is the investments are about six months \u2013 kicking off them six months later than the previous investment. And now clearly, our job is to try to place all of those new machine tools, get that as quickly as possible and place them and commission them as soon as possible because the demand is clearly there for them. And so our customers would like to see them come on as early as possible. And it's all going to be tied up with not just what they want for them, what they see is volumes today. But also the certification of the changes going on in the engine world, which the FAA and the EASA will have to sign off both for Airbus and Boeing where these new engine upgrades are \u2013 as they have to be certified as well. So we await that. It could be different for each of the manufacturers we feel. Thank you. Well, first of all, I wasn't quite sure whether those cash parts were operating margins or EBITDA margins, but it doesn't really matter because I don't really comment on margin at all. Aerospace is a cyclical industry and anybody who has the absolute knowledge and precedence to know exactly what volumes will be next year and the year after and the year after that and what the rate of increase will be is something that I don't have. And therefore, I've never been comfortable talking about what I think margin rates will be in the future. I think all we can do is to say this is what we're doing \u2013 these are the changes we're trying to make to improve our company. And I don't follow some I'll say false guard of whatever happened over a decade ago, one company, whether those were real or not real margins at the time and what type of margin rate was covered. So I choose not to do it, Scott. So I don't think I ever have, and I don't think I ever will comment on margin rates. It's something which like how do you know? And so I recognize that some companies do say what their margins are going to be two or three years from now. Whether they're achieved or not seems to get lost, but you won't find me doing it. Okay. Thank you. Hey, Noah. As you know, Noah, in commercial aero, nothing is ever exactly the same. Pre-pandemic, we were at time, I think, producing something like nine A350s a month and 13 or 14 787s a month. And as you know, we produce a completely different set of Fasteners for a composite-based aircraft than a metallic-based aircraft. And to some degree, you saw that when the 787 was halted at one point, we moved down to zero because of the clearing out of inventories, and we've been climbing back from there, both in terms of a favorable mix, but also the effects of trying to drive productivity in that business and also being probably a little bit better commercially. At this point, I don't know what eventual rate Wide Body will get to. And therefore, the future mix is going to be different. I note the increase in A350. And I suspect that the A350 would be the higher rating \u2013 wasn't for some also supply constraints, particularly in the structures area. And that's slated to go to, I think, is it 12 a month by 2027, which would be great because that will be above the previous rate. On 787, the only ambitious number I've heard is rate 10, which was slightly plus 2025, 2026, but then the thing is being modified now to 2026. But I think we've got to wait and see what happens in 2025 first. And getting up from where I think our current production is maybe three a month, four a month levels, what I've read. And it would be great to get back to five and then seven next year. And I think that's tied up with maybe a few particular parts I've read about probably also the same thing as we had previously. I mean, supply chain is often quoted, but often, there's also issues within the assembly processes for some of these aircraft. And so that all needs picking apart in much greater detail. And let's see the rates progress during obviously, balance of 2024 into 2025 before we get to what's the real rate going to be in 2026 and 2027. But should we get back to, let's say, 14 a month of 787s and if it gets 12 a month, stated for the A350. And I guess it depends on \u2013 then what the volume of the metallic-based narrow bodies will be but that would be a very positive factor for us. But I don't feel like saying that we move back to any particular previous margin level. I think the most important thing is if you just look at the track of our margin for the fastener business during the recent quarters. I think it's been truly impressive in terms of sequential improvement and that's as far as I'll go. Thank you. Thanks, Gautam. Okay. So maybe I'll deal with the Asheville question first. I haven't heard any commentary coming out of RTX in the last 30 years or so on that facility. I believe it's coming up to rate on machining work, and that's probably necessary to get through the disc inspection and recall. On the investment castings process, I haven't really heard anything that's material in that area. And so I'm still all of my previous comments about that facility, you just stand there on the record as is. The moment we're not seeing that reflected in any change of our requirements over the next few years. And at this point, don't expect it to \u2013 I mean what happens, let's say, after, I don't know, 2030 compared to the $650 million that was the announced investment, which doesn't go far across coating and machining and building online on investment castings. I think you've got a few more billion, several billions to go yet to \u2013 for that to become sufficiently equipped at scale to be cost effective. And it's not clear to me that Pratt & Whitney are emphasizing that investment compared to getting through the, I'll say, current GTF issues and servicing the cash costs of that provision that was made last year of I think it's $6 billion, obviously shared between them and some partners. But that's a big nugget to absorb. So I don't know more than that. And just because I've been spending so much time focused on that question. What was the first part of it? Sorry, was it excess inventory in the channel? Not really. I mean it's a bit superior. So as I said, we were a little bit surprised when we got cut back recently on the low-pressure turbine parts because those LEAP engines weren't assembled. And so we've probably got more than we would like and therefore, trying to manage that through the next quarter or so. And according to what we can do by way of changing the employment, I'll say, ours facilities into one plant in France. But its nothing of great note. And because I said earlier, if you think about it, there's so many moving parts going on at the moment in the industry, like what's \u2013 we see what aircraft manufacturers delivery rates are, how much comes out of production compared to how much comes out of inventory? What's the state of how many aircraft have started to [indiscernible] roll out plans, that's pretty opaque? And we don't really have and you don't have good production level information. And then you get from that, all of the engines, you've got all the image they got. So there's so many different aspects to it, and it must be really difficult for you to model because it's difficult for us. And so what I would advise you to do is just take our guide in the way we've tried to set it out. We've been cautious where we need to. We've called out reductions, for example, in the Wheels business, where we see now that reduction in market activity very clearly started in Q2 and it's going to be significant in Q3, exacerbated by the seasonality because, as you know, the European plants tend to go [indiscernible] for several weeks in July and August. And so we've got all of that. And the best I think we can do is to say, look at the guide, it takes account to the best level of knowledge. It keeps pace with all of the previous production quantities we talked about on the first quarter earnings call and adjusted for the Boeing rates only. And we've taken engine right down to match what we've been advised in the case of the engine manufacturers. Thank you. Hi, Ron. I thought that was the best question all day because I thought I haven't going to answer it. Yes. The easy one. Yes. Again, you got to pick it apart between that which is the casting for structural castings, compare to high pressure turbine castings and low-pressure turbines. And the case of where we've seen OE engine cutbacks, and that's, I'll say, negatively affected to a small degree, our structural casting and the LPT castings we do. And so I guess that just goes to the territory. The capacity isn't fungible. So you can't just say I'll now make high-pressure turbine castings and with that because there's different dyes, different I'll say, different casting techniques, et cetera. And so it's not immediately transferable at all. So the key to, let's say, is can we produce any further high-pressure turbine castings because the service demand seems to be high and possibly higher than certainly that we have been advised six months or a year ago. And so we put all our shoulders to wheel and trying everything we can to increase that while also stating that we know we're well above engine rates. I'm not giving you any specific quantities, but you can assume that, that seems absolutely correct, we're well above engine rate. And then it's \u2013 what goes to service at the MRO shops and what goes to the, I'll say, OE production, that's not our decision. So we're going to try to improve once again, and it will go to yield in the short-term that will go to fresh capital expenditure in that medium term. And so we've been clear that for us to put down fresh capital because of its high capital intensity, and you got to have a surety return is that's why we've struck agreements which lock in market share commensurate with those investment requirements for future. So we're positioned well for the future. But if you said to us, can we produce another 30% high-pressure turbine casting during the next two months? The answer would be, no, we can't. We'll be well above engine rate. And then that's about all we can say. And it's going to go, can we improve our internal yields, and obviously, we'll be talking to our customers about how they can help with that. And we've got some really good collaboration with our customers at the moment trying to achieve improvements over and above the improvements in volumes that we've already achieved. So I'm feeling pretty positive about it. I like the dynamic. I like the fact that we've got significant demand. But I've also got to be realistic. I just don't have a knob I can turn and say, I'll go and produce another 30%, it doesn't work like that. We've got new tools to put down. We've got new casting machines. We've got new presses, new everything to fundamentally change that. That's what I said. We'll bring that capacity on and we'll see the fruits of that in 2026. It's going to be at the margin. Where we are \u2013 from where we are today, the only way is to where \u2013 sometimes this may be excessive requirements on drawing whether those can be relaxed anyway, which don't go to performance. But it's those sort of tiny things, which matter, but don't matter that to your product performance. There's possibly something in that, and call it, clearly, we will study that. But while always protecting the quality of the product that we produce. Thanks, Ron."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 5. So markets continued to be healthy in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, performance was as follows: Total revenue was up 14%, driven by strong growth in commercial aerospace, which was up 27%. For the first half, commercial aerospace was up a healthy 25%. Growth continues to be robust this year on top of the 28% growth rate in 2022 and the 24% growth rate in 2023. Moving to our other markets. First, defense aerospace was also strong, up 11%, driven by fighter programs and engine spares demand. Next is commercial transportation. As expected, the market has weakened with revenue down 4%, although Howmet continues to gain share from Steel Wheels with Howmet's lighter and more fuel-efficient aluminum wheels. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 4%, driven by oil and gas, up 14%, IGT up 6%; and general industrial down 6%. In summary, continued strong performance in commercial aerospace, defense and industrial, partially offset by commercial transportation. Now let's move to Slide 6. So first, the P&L. For the second consecutive quarter, Q2 revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share were all records and exceeded the high end of guidance. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was up 14%, and EBITDA outpaced the revenue growth by being up 31%, while absorbing the addition of approximately 190 net new employees in the quarter. Incremental flow-through of revenue to EBITDA was excellent at 50%. Moreover, the team delivered records for both EBITDA margin of 25.7% and earnings per share of $0.67, which was up a healthy 52% year-over-year. Now let's cover the balance sheet and cash flow. The balance sheet and liquidity have never been stronger. Cash at the end of the quarter was $752 million, and free cash flow was a record for Q2 at $342 million. The healthy cash balance at the quarter end was used to repay the remaining balance on the 2024 bonds of $205 million. Payment was at par and was made three months early on July 1. Moreover, in Q2, we opportunistically repurchased $23 million of the 2025 bonds. The combination of these actions will reduce annual interest expense by $12 million annually, further improving free cash flow yield. Finally, net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 1.7x. All long-term debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of interest rate expense into the future. Liquidity is strong with a healthy cash balance and $1 billion undrawn revolver complemented by the flexibility of a $1 billion commercial paper program. Finally, capital deployment. We deployed approximately $104 million of cash in the quarter to shareholders, of which $60 million was used to repurchase common stock. This was the 13th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. The average diluted share count improved to a record low Q2 exit rate of 410 million shares. Finally, we continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the first quarter, we deployed $21 million for the quarterly common stock dividend of $0.05 per share. John will discuss the increase in the Q3 dividend as well as our 2025 dividend policy. Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the second quarter. Engine Products delivered another record performance. Revenue increased 14% in the quarter to $933 million. Commercial aerospace was up 18% and defense aerospace was up 10%. Both markets realized higher OE build rates and spares. Oil and gas was up 14% and IGT was up 6%. Demand continues to be strong across all of our engine markets driven by our differentiated products. EBITDA increased 31% year-over-year to a record $292 million. EBITDA margin increased 410 basis points year-over-year to a record 31.3%, while absorbing approximately 315 net new employees in the quarter to support future growth. The engines team delivered a record quarter for revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin. Now let's go to Slide 8. Fastening Systems also had another strong quarter. Revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $394 million. Commercial aerospace was up 36%, including the impact of the wide-body recovery. Commercial transportation was up 10%. General industrial was up 3% and defense aerospace, which represents about 9% of Fasteners revenue was down 20%. Year-over-year, EBITDA outpaced revenue growth with an increase of 58% to just over $100 million. EBITDA margin increased 610 basis points year-over-year to a healthy 25.6%. The team has progressively improved results for four consecutive quarters through commercial and operational improvements, complemented by the wide-body recovery. Now let's move to Slide 9. Although engineered structures had a favorable comp year-over-year, performance continued to improve sequentially. Revenue increased 38% year-over-year to $275 million. Commercial aerospace was up 42%, driven by build rates in the wide-body recovery. Defense aerospace was up 45% year-over-year, driven primarily by the F-35 program. EBITDA doubled year-over-year, while EBITDA margin improved to 14.5%. Sequentially, revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin increased for the fourth consecutive quarter. Incrementals continue to improve sequentially at 23%. We continue to optimize the structures manufacturing footprint, and we expect to exit two small plants in the UK this year. The team continues to make progress, and we expect continued improvements throughout 2024. Finally, let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels revenue was down 7% year-over-year, as expected, in a challenging market. EBITDA also decreased by 7%, driven by volume and regional mix. EBITDA margin continues to be healthy at 27%, which is essentially flat year-over-year. With that, let me turn it back over to John for the outlook."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Paul Luther, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nPaul Luther: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and welcome to the Howmet Aerospace First Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call. I'm joined by John Plant, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \n After comments by John and Ken, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would like to remind you that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations. You can find factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections listed in today's presentation and earnings press release and in our most recent SEC filings. \n In today's presentation references to EBITDA, operating income and EPS mean adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, adjusted operating income, excluding special items and adjusted EPS, excluding special items. These measures are among the non-GAAP financial measures that we've included in our discussion. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release and in the appendix in today's presentation. \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John. \nJohn Plant: Thanks, PT, and good morning, everybody. Q1 2024 was an outstanding quarter for Howmet revenue, profit, margin, and earnings per share were records and all improved versus guidance last year and sequentially. \n More specifically, Q1 performance and year-over-year improvements were as follows: Revenue was $1.824 billion, up 14%. EBITDA was $437 million, up 21%, with a healthy incremental of 35%. EBITDA margin was up 150 basis points to 24%. Operating income was 27 -- was up 27% with a margin rate of above 20%. Earnings per share were $0.57, an increase of 36% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. \n We'll recall that in Q4, the earnings per share benefited by an unusually low tax rate of 20.7% and also currency favorability and hence, the sequential improvement was indeed excellent. Free cash flow was $95 million and marks the first quarter with an inflow to be followed by further inflows in Q2, Q3 and Q4. We were particularly pleased with the positive cash flow since for many years, we've seen Q1 outflows, which had to be overcome in later quarters. \n A total of $150 million of cash was used to reach purchase shares. Just over 2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $67. Dividends of $0.05 per share were paid, and you'll recall that these had been increased by 25% in Q4 of 2023. Finally, net debt to EBITDA was a record low of 2x. \n I'll now turn the call over to Ken to cover the financials in more detail before returning to talk to the overall outlook for 2024. \nKen Giacobbe: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of the markets. All markets continued to be healthy in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, performance was as follows: Total revenue was up 14%, driven by very strong growth in the commercial aerospace market, which was up 23%. Commercial aerospace has now grown for 12 consecutive quarters and represents approximately 50% of total revenue. Growth continues to be robust, supported by demand for new more fuel-efficient aircraft with reduced carbon emissions and increased spares demand for engines. \n Moving to our other markets. First, defense aerospace was also strong, up 12%, driven by fighter programs and engine spares demand. Next is commercial transportation, which has been resilient in a challenging market. Revenue was up slightly as we continue to offset weakness in the market by taking share from steel wheels with Howmet lighter and more fuel-efficient aluminum wheels. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 7%, driven by oil and gas up 15%; general industrial, up 10% and IGT, which was flat. In summary, another strong quarter across all of our end markets. \n Now let's move to Slide 6. First, moving to the P&L. Q1 revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share were all records and exceeded the high end of guidance. Revenue was up 14% and EBITDA outpaced revenue growth by being up 21%, while absorbing the addition of approximately 430 net new employees in the quarter. Incremental flow-through of revenue to EBITDA was a healthy 35%. EBITDA margin was a record at 24% and earnings per share was also a record at $0.57, which was an increase of 36% year-over-year. \n Now let's move to the balance sheet and cover the balance sheet and cash flow. The balance sheet and liquidity have never been stronger. Cash at the end of the quarter was $534 million, and free cash flow was a record for Q1 at $95 million. Net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 2x. All long-term debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which provides stability of interest rate expense into the future. \n Howmet's improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were reflected in Moody's Q1 ratings upgrade to investment grade. With this upgrade, we are now rated as investment grade with all 3 rating agencies. Additionally, with the recent upgrades, we have established a $1 billion commercial paper program, which further strengthens our liquidity. Finally, we continue to have access to our $1 billion undrawn revolver. Total liquidity now stands at approximately $2.5 billion. \n Finally, let's move to capital deployment. We deployed approximately 700 -- excuse me, $170 million of cash in the quarter to shareholders, of which $150 million was used to repurchase common stock. This was the 12th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. The average diluted share count improved to a record low Q1 exit rate of 411 million shares. \n Finally, we continue to be confident in our free cash flow. In the first quarter, we deployed approximately $20 million for the quarterly common stock dividend of $0.05 per share. \n Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the first quarter. Engine Products continued its strong performance. Revenue increased 11% in the quarter to $885 million. Commercial aerospace was up 14% and defense aerospace was up 13%. Both markets realized higher build rates and spares growth. Oil and gas was up 15% and IGT was flat. Demand continues to be strong across all of our engines markets. EBITDA increased 17% year-over-year to a record $249 million. \n EBITDA margin increased 140 basis points year-over-year to a record 28.1%, while absorbing approximately 435 net new employees in the quarter. Once again, the engines team delivered another strong quarter. \n Now let's move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems also had a strong quarter. Revenue increased 25% year-over-year to $389 million. Commercial aerospace was up 44%, including the impact of the wide-body recovery. Commercial transportation was up 5%. General industrial was up 14% and defense aerospace was down 11%. \n Year-over-year EBITDA outpaced revenue growth with an increase of 59% to $92 million. EBITDA margin increased 510 basis points year-over-year to 23.7%, which reflects the improved commercial and operational performance, complemented by the wide-body recovery. \n Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures performance continued to improve. Revenue increased 27% year-over-year to $262 million. Commercial aerospace was up 26%, driven by build rates and the wide-body recovery. Defense aerospace was up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by the F-35 program. EBITDA was up $7 million year-over-year and EBITDA margin decreased slightly to 14.1%. Sequentially, revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin increased for the third consecutive quarter. The team is making progress, and we expect continued improvements throughout 2024. \n Finally, let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels revenue was essentially flat year-over-year in a challenging market. Although revenue was essentially flat, EBITDA increased 4%, driven by volume and productivity. EBITDA margin was a healthy 28.5%. \n With that, now let me turn it back over to John. \nJohn Plant: Thanks, Ken, and let's move to Slide 11 to show our progress on GHG. We continue to leverage our differentiated technologies to help our customers manufacture lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft and commercial trucks with lower carbon footprints. Howmet remains committed to managing our energy consumption and environmental impacts as we increase production. \n In 2023, continue -- we continue to progress against our 2024 greenhouse gas emissions goal by achieving a 20% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions from 2023 compared to 2019, which is our baseline year. We're tracking well to our 2024 goals of a 21.5% reduction. \n I would like to draw your attention to the issuance of our annual ESG report in April, which details the good progress we've made. Additionally, in the report, we reflect 2027 goals for Howmet, which shows the continued progress on our baseline year of 2019 with a full 33% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \n Now let's turn to Slide 12 and start to talk about the outlook for the business. Firstly, I'll address commercial aerospace, which represents our largest revenue market. Demand for air travel continues to be very strong. And if anything, will be constrained during the summer season by the availability of new aircraft, especially narrow-body aircraft. \n Asia Pacific travel, which has been lagging in the U.S. and Europe has been increasing rapidly. And is now back to approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels. International Asia Pacific travel was up approximately 50% in the recent months and speaks well to future aircraft demand especially wide-body aircraft. \n Freight requirements also continue to be robust. The one item that needs to be said that is the fact of the FAA restrictions on the Boeing 737 MAX production of 38 per month in the light of continuing quality problems at Boeing. These facts are extensively reported in the press and have resulted in lower production, well below the prior levels of approximately 30 aircraft per month, which in itself was well below the 2023 targets of 38 aircraft per month. Clearly, the prospect of going up to rate 42 and rate 47 per month is now unlikely in 2024. This has caused Howmet to completely replan our year. And we've concluded that a further reduction in build to approximately 20 aircraft per month average for the year is a more secure assumption than that previously reported of 34 aircraft per month. \n As we replan our year, we should take in account of this revenue adjustment, while replanning other areas of our business. For example, Spares, Defense and Wheels revenues, and we net all of this replanning out to an overall increase of approximately $200 million of revenue for 2024. This guide reflects continuing strong Airbus production in line with our overall planned percentage increase of aircraft of approximately 9%. We now envisage as an example, Wheels revenue being higher than previously expected in Q1 and Q2, whilst continuing to expect a reduction in the second half of the year. \n In the second half, we expect this to be offset by higher wide-body build especially in preparing to move into 2025, complemented by robustness in Spares, Defense and IGT sales. However, we do expect Boeing to trim back production part schedules for the 737 MAX to lower levels than previously envisioned. \n In terms of specific numbers in Q2, we expect revenue to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA $440 million, plus or minus $5 million, earnings per share of $0.58, plus or minus $0.01. For the year, we see revenues around $7.3 billion, plus or minus $75 million. EBITDA of $1.75 billion, plus or minus $30 million, earnings per share of $2.35, plus or minus $0.04 and free cash flow of $800 million, plus or minus $50 million. \n Clearly, the diversity of Howmet product revenues and solidity of performance can be seen in these numbers. We're pleased with the resulting increased outlook and our free cash flow in particular. Therefore, we expect to increase our dividend payout in the second half of the year, starting with the payment in August pending Board approval. \n Specifically, the expected dividend increase is $0.02 per share to a total of $0.07 per share, which is a 40% increase. This notably maintains the 2023 dividend yield. The balanced capital allocation plan continues. Capital expenditures elevated over 2022 and 2023 levels and is now a little ahead of depreciation. \n The main thrust continues to be the expansion in our engines business to achieve the market share increases that I already talked about on the last call. The majority of the other uses of free cash flow in terms of capital allocation will be share buyback in 2024, while still preserving the ability to pay down the stuff of the 2024 bond of $200 million should we decide to do so. \n I'm also sure that we will focus on refinancing the 2025 bonds later in the year or the latest in early 2025. I thought it useful to provide more of an extensive road map to our capital allocation thoughts during this call. \n In terms of net leverage, we're also envisaging getting closer to our minimum leverage target of towards 1.5x net debt to EBITDA by year-end from the 2x that we currently have at the end of Q1. \n In summary, moving to the summary slide. We have a strong start to the year. We have incremental EBITDA margins of 35% and an operating margin now over 20%. We have the ability to withstand the reduced narrow-body build notably from Boeing. We have a complete replanning of our year. We've increased the guide by $200 million of revenue at midpoint and the margin rate from 23% to 24%. And we've increased cash flow just under $100 million. \n We also noted that we expect to raise the dividend by 40% in the second half of the year. And that we have a clear plan for the balance of 2024 in terms of capital allocation plans. \n Thank you, and we'll now move to Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. \nNoah Poponak: Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? \nOperator: We can hear you now. Please go ahead. \nNoah Poponak: John, I appreciate all the detail there. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about the MAX. What underlying rate did you actually deliver to in the quarter? And how are you assuming it moves through the year? And I guess, listening to some other suppliers in Boeing through the earnings season, it kind of sounded like Boeing kept the supply chain moving along somewhere near 30 despite their deliveries and then would plan to start to -- hope to start to ramp back up in the back half of the year. Your comments sound like maybe that didn't happen or that's not what you're seeing. So -- if you could just provide a little more clarity around that? That would be great. \nJohn Plant: Yes, I'd like to give you a real clear-cut answer, but I find it's a little bit confusing. In what we saw was, in the first quarter, schedules at rate 38. And I assume that Boeing had assumed that they would achieve that rate. I don't know. Whereas we note that actual bills were substantially less than that and probably well below 20%. And therefore, the increase in inventory, let's say, let's call it, I don't know, 15 to 38 per month, plus the 7 months of last year where rate 38 had been assumed, but more like a build of 30. Has resulted obviously in increased inventories in Boeing. \n We've heard statements to the effect that if you go back to January -- absolutely no, we'll keep rate 38 in terms of production scheduling to more recent commentary, whereby we've advised the suppliers or will be advising suppliers of trimming our requirements according to our rate needs. And of course, it's very difficult to know exactly what that means in terms of what the assumed rate needs are. \n So we're trying to be fairly cautious in that because while they say that they're going to achieve rate 38 in the second half, I guess we'd like to see that  absolutely, but are unclear that it's going to be done. \n So in terms of, for example, in our fastener business where we operate more to a min-max system, whereas Boeing had probably been wanting to increase the minimum levels we've assumed and dropped our assumptions down to deliver no more than to the absolute minimum, which is where our contract with them lies. And so we could be trying to prevent the case where we get caught with a lot of, say, change of schedule on a rapid basis and then cut with inventory. \n We're also making the assumption in our cash flow is that those schedules are cut and that we will have a trailing list of requirements that we've ordered on our suppliers for long lead time items that they will have to honor for the most part. And therefore, we'll be taking materials in which we may not be delivering in 2024. \n So just trying to pick our way through -- what the best set of assumptions are. What we do know is that GE has changed their requirements for the LEAP-1B engine. And you've seen that announcement in a clear statement. But I think that year-on-year instead of expecting maybe a 20%, 25% increase from, let's call it, 1.75 million engines to like 19.25, it's now more like a 1,700 number. That's more like a 10% to 15% increase year-on-year. But that obviously comes back out in the balance of year. \n So it's a very mixed picture that we can draw on. And so we're providing the best assumptions we can. So we are thinking that we're going to get cut back at the same time with the increases that we're expecting for 2025. So for example, Airbus increases the A320 from, let's call it, nominally 55 a month or 65 a month then some of that demand will have to be delivered in the second half of this year. \n At the same time, if Boeing do increase their rates, we're going to have to address that. So it's trying to pick your way through all of those assumptions. And so we've tried to do that. And I know that during the course of the Q&A that I'll be going through on this call. I'll try to give you a volume more from previous assumptions to the new assumptions. That's about as best I can do on the whole Boeing -- I'll say Boeing come Spirit aerospace part of the equation, no, which is what you asked about. \nOperator: The next question is from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. \nRobert Stallard: John, maybe to follow on from Noah's question on the rates. Boeing has also seems to have slipped behind on the 787. So I was wondering if you could give us an idea of what you're now expecting for that. I think they're saying they want to get back up to 5 and supply chain is shipping at 5, but they're not producing at 5, you know what I mean? \nJohn Plant: Yes. So we cut our assumption from 6 aircraft per month down to 5. I don't know that we're going to see parts, schedule changes for the sake of 2 aircraft a month, especially if they're going to get back up to rate 5 by the second half of the year. \n So we recognize that we've been producing ahead at the current actual build rate because of the supply constraints that Boeing say that they've had, which clearly have not been from Howmet. But we've not taken it down to 3. We just assumed 5 for the year. So that's where it stands for 787. \nRobert Stallard: And is this the one that's also going to be ramping up a bit further in the second half, anticipating further rate increases for 2025? \nJohn Plant: Yes. And that's also part of our thinking is that previously, our assumptions have been going to rate 7, at the back end of this year ahead of where we'd assumed [ a 6  ] where we thought it was going to go and then probably with a higher rate sometime in 2025, on their March to 10 craft per month, which I know has now changed from 2025 to 2026. \n So the assumptions seem to be a little bit slow and taking a little bit longer. And -- but nevertheless, we are thinking that will be -- there will be an increase above rate 5 as we go into 2025 and trying to build that into -- that's why we said we'd only move from 6 per month down to 5 in 2024. \nOperator: The next question is from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. \nRobert Spingarn: John, I'm going to ask again about the 737. You've been crystal clear that the situation is unclear. Having said that though, I'm curious if somehow Boeing gets above 20 later this year, is there enough inventory in the channel, whether you have it or they have it or GE has it to support higher production rates at Boeing? Or can you ramp quickly? How do we think about when you'd need to signal? And how you might respond? \nJohn Plant: Yes. So should Boeing produce rate 38. I'm very clear that we'll be at rate 38 with them. And should GE reinstate the planned increase to the 19 25 level of LEAP engines, which is obviously part of it into cadence to 1b that we'll be able to meet rate -- what the -- again, on labor, you can see while we've increased the overall guidance, and therefore, our labor recruitment will be fairly robust is that we have enough flexibility to be able to cope with those rate assumptions. Because, again, we'll know months ahead of they're actually achieving that. It won't be like go from, let's say, rate 15 to rate 38 in a month, it's going to happen slowly. And gradually if it occurs. \nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Okay. And then just as a follow-up. When we look at the commercial aero sales at fasteners and its structures, they outpaced versus the Engine Products segment despite the issues at Boeing. I was wondering if you could add some color on how you managed to decouple your commercial aero growth from Boeing's bill rates. \nJohn Plant: I think to some degree, it reflects the revenue potential and earnings potential of Howmet when it achieves the increased rates. And so while Boeing sales in the 787 might have been building a 3. But we were building in the first quarter of our parts at a rate significantly above that. So let's assume rate 6 or even in rate 7. And so this that's obviously a very good dynamic for the business and then showed with I thought, which was excellent margin improvement in the business, which was a combination of operational performance, commercial performance and the mix. And when that happened, we've put on 500-plus basis points in margin improvement year-over-year. And there's still -- I don't know what it was, 200 basis points sequentially. \n So all really good. And obviously, we're trying to work out exactly what that will be. As the assumption I made is that we get down to rate 5 on the 787 and obviously, a much lower rate on the 737. Albeit as you know there's a metallic fasteners, they don't quite have the richness of mix that we will get on a composite aircraft. \n At the same time with Airbus, as you know, the A350 is a composite-based aircraft. And so the rate increase that we've seen there and also as we prepare for a further rate increase in 2025, then again, that's all looking positive for Howmet. \nRobert Spingarn: Does that mean that possibly the first quarter is a high point with regard to some -- something like a 787 fasteners or if you were a rate 7 and they're at rate 3 and you get the point. \nJohn Plant: Yes. I mean, what we've guided to you in Q2 is that, in fact, revenues would be slightly higher than Q1. So we're still expecting overall to be good. But very much for our year would be -- we're cautious because of the rate assumptions I've given you on the 737 and therefore, expecting to have the impact of that. \n Plus, also, as you heard me talk about on my prepared remarks is that we are expecting weakness in our commercial wheels business in the second half of the year. So far, we've been pleasantly surprised by the strength in that segment. Clearly, we hope it continues, but our planning again for some reduction because we've already heard customers like PACCAR reducing their commercial Class 8 truck build as they go forward. \n So again, it's a different number in the U.S., maybe a 10% truck build reduction we're thinking of in North America and maybe something a little bit higher in Europe, offset by whatever penetration we can achieve in terms of aluminum versus steel. So -- but the important thing I thought in this quarter was that we were able to really operated a really -- a good level and achieved a rate increase, let's say, 26.5%, 27% EBITDA margin, doing like 28.5%. And that's really good because obviously it's a supply -- it's more leverage at the operating margin and the EBITDA margin level. So it was all good. So it's a cautious assumption on commercial truck in the second half, cautious assumption around Boeing MAX production coming off, as I talked about earlier, a rate 38 scheduling in Q1. \nOperator: The next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. \nDouglas Harned: I want to switch away from Boeing here for a moment. And earlier this year, GE started making the first shipments of its redesigned LEAP-1A, HPT blades to Airbus. These are intended to last longer in harsh environments. And we expect to see that similarly for the LEAP-1B eventually a year from now, we're going to see something done in the geared turbofan. \n When you look at these new designs, for blades, how do you see that affecting your outlook in terms of -- presumably, these are more expensive. The amount of turnover you might have in the aftermarket and better pricing potential on these new designs. \nJohn Plant: Okay. Maybe the best thing I can do is to give you a picture of the revenue walk for the company first and then return to the specific question, obviously improved durability as a second subject.\n So in our assumption, is that we are thinking that we'll have a, let's say, a hit from the MAX reduction assumption from the 34 rate we'd assume in Q1 to the 20 rate. And so that's something well over $100 million of a hit. And then we see that being offset with an increased reimbursements of our defense sales. And you saw those up 12% in Q1, which was significantly higher than our assumption, which was mid-single digits. So I think that's $60 million-ish, give or take. \n On Wheels, we think the first half is going to be stronger than we thought. So let's call that $50 million-ish on wheels. And then with our other sectors that we serve, for example, like oil and gas, you heard us talk to a 15% increase there. And while IGT was flat in Q1, we're thinking of a mid-single digit increase for the year. for IGT and Industrial, there's another $60 million. So essentially, all of all of the Max [indiscernible] and more it gets covered by those items. \n And then the big one, I think, is our assumption around spares, which is we've put in an increased revenue assumption of over $120 million plus on our spares lift. And that reflects, let's say, a further aggregate 25% lift in our spares business year-on-year and more like 35% on commercial aero. So it's pretty significant. And now the rate -- the spares revenues are substantially above 2019 levels, a 2019 was about $800 million, I think $1.1 billion plus in that area. So the -- if you assume that -- on the OE side, it was all about net offset. You can see our total $200 million increase, let's call it, $120 million plus comes from the spares assumption. And so that's how you get there. \n In terms of when you think through what's going on at the moment, clearly, the existing engine, which is now all past model, which is the CFM56 there. We have not yet seen the peak of spares for that business. And because of the lack of current narrow-body production by Boeing is that it's the airlines are working the fleet hard. And therefore, CFM56 it's probably going to peak more like 25, maybe 26 now, and that's still increasing. So that's good. \n The 737 MAX is -- it's obviously been having its own increase in, let's say, MRO shop visits. And on the current version of the LEAP engine, those won't peak in my view until well after 2030. And -- so we're seeing an increase there. And I've also talked on the last earnings call about the immediacy of the time on wing issue and they're producing a little bit of extra revenue. I probably overstated calling it at a [ bubble ] 3 or 4 years, but that's going to go on, both for the LEAP engine and in particular, the geared turbo fan, and that's well reported. \n I think what we'll see is that there will be a gradual introduction of the new improved robust turbine blades. And that's probably more significant as we go into '25 and beyond than it is in 2024. But that obviously the -- assuming that is successful in terms of the durability, and I have every reason to believe it will be, then I guess that affects shop visits coming, making up about 2030 and beyond. But meanwhile, of course, we'll have the benefit of LEAP -- current production for the last -- let's call 8 years and the geared turbofan for longer, that will be increasing that -- that's a road map through. \n So it's a long way of saying we should have improved asset economics around more robust fixes for GTF and LEAP that fixed time line wing issues. Plus the increased spares demand initially from the CFM56, which is still coming at us, and it's good. And then obviously, further increases to the LEAP, which and -- geared turbofan which include the time line when we issues the well reported. \nOperator: The next question is from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. \nKenneth Herbert: John, I appreciate all the color there on the aftermarket you just provided. It sounds like you're seeing as part of that 100-ish million plus in the commercial spares business this year. What's your visibility on that beyond this year? Do you think we get a point assuming Boeing and Airbus start to clean up, Boeing in particular, deliveries of new aircraft that moderates fairly quickly? Or do you get a sense that, that could have substantial room to run even beyond this year, just considering increased use of some of the legacy aircraft? I know you went through maybe CFM56 peak is pushed to the right. But how do you view that flowing into your business on the spare side? \nJohn Plant: I see commercial aerospace sales going up in '25, '26 and '27. It's a bit too difficult to get up beyond that, but I see rising reducing the spares area during those years. I also see increased spares for the F-35. And in the past, I've said I think by the time we get to 2025, we could be seeing spares revenues almost as much as the current OE demand for F-35 turbine blades.\n And then what happened after depends upon the rate of production and the rate of usage for the F-35 around the world. Clearly, in recent months it has been an extraordinary list of, I will say, time in the air for F-35s. On the other hand, I've also read articles about the plan that we know to run them a little bit less. \n But nevertheless, we see F-35 spares being very strong over the next few years. And the -- I think the aircraft park at the end of last year was just under 1,000 aircraft and now it's over 1,000, but will be increasing, assuming that Lockheed delivers, let's call it, about 150 aircraft a year, which looks like doing 150 every year for probably the next 10 years. But so -- by which time, the fleet of F-35s around the world will be very large and the spares will be extraordinary. \n And then in between of that, let's call it in around the 2028 mark, I think we'll see improved turbine componentry to meet the requirements where additional thrust is required to offset the current draw from the weapon systems and avionics that is currently the issue being addressed. \nOperator: The next question is from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. \nMyles Walton: John, on the fastening unit, the commercial aero underlying growth there was pretty outstanding and the acceleration in the last 4 quarters. I think about 1/3 of that business is distribution. Is it -- the distribution business growing faster than that average? Are they pulling because they see scarcity coming? And also, just to round out, are you feeling better about fastening eclipsing prior peak margins at this point yet? \nJohn Plant: Certainly, the program that we put in 3 years ago of creating a separate segment within our fasteners business for distribution is notable success for us. And I'm going to say we've probably seen an almost doubling of that business in the last 3 years. We don't provide like all makes to everybody and try to manage all the logistics of people, but this is trying to capture that margin previously that we had effectively passed on to other distributors. Because we distribute those parts. And we mainly focus on those parts which are proprietary with technology moats around them from the Howmet say, suite of fastener brands. \n So that is growing faster than the OE business for us, and therefore, again, that's been another thrust for us. It's also an improvement in fastener margins. So far, any commentary that I've given, Myles, I've never been willing to say that we'll achieve 2019 levels of margin rates because I think those were the very different conditions. I mean there, we had 787 running at 13 or 14 a month, as an example. And the A350 also at a higher rate. \n So the -- I mean, as you know, what we talked about on this call is that those rates are way -- it may be 1/3 of that. And so it's all wrapped up in our own progression of efficiency, but also what's the mix of aircraft come 2027? I might be a bit more bullish if you'll guarantee to me that Boeing will be making 14 787 and now I think I read that Airbus is going to make 15 a month of A350. I mean, if that happened, it's all great. It's really good for us. \nMyles Walton: Yes, no guarantees from me, John. And just one clarification. The... \nJohn Plant: I realized that. That's why I put it that way. That's why I try to not to put my head in that noose because I had no plan... \nMyles Walton: I'll keep line it up for you. \nJohn Plant: No [indiscernible] that knows that sort of stuff. \nMyles Walton: One clarification. Are you saying that the commercial air foils are now close to $550 million in '24? Is that what the math gets to? \nJohn Plant: I actually don't think I quoted a number. You talked about the spares on commercial now? \nMyles Walton: Yes, exactly. \nJohn Plant: Yes, I think it's about right. I'd have to go back to my notes to guide what a more precise number. I think it's well above the $400 million that we saw in 2019. So I think $550 million is probably a best approximation, and Ken can jump in if he wants to correct me on that number. The defense spares for last year, we're already growing from like 400 to 600, and that's continued. So it's all good on that front. \nOperator: The next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: Thanks, John and Ken. Maybe can you talk about margins? You raised margins by 100 basis points at the midpoint. And we don't typically think about you guys having a different economic value on OE versus spares. So you're still hiring to have to flex on -- to match rates. And so I guess, what got better on the profit line? And how do you think about that trending throughout the year? \nJohn Plant: Inevitably, if you look at our rate of hiring, and we're also coming off a bigger base of experienced labor. So part of that is improved labor efficiency, Sheila. And notwithstanding, I'll say, the Boeing volatility, I'm hoping we can plan our way around because the overall revenue without -- obviously, it'll be a different mix and different plants, but I'm hopeful we can manage our way through to keep that the overall operating efficiency that we have had in Q1, and that's what we've guided to. You can see we've guided to a 24% EBITDA margin. So even though, let's say, we look to see that go down a little bit in the second half, and that's a, let's say, a 28% plus business. And therefore, we'll need to work the other harder just to keep it right 24% in terms of EBITDA margin percentage, which we believe we can, and we'll do otherwise, we wouldn't have guided there.\n But I think it's been one where nothing ever moves in an absolute straight line. Like on a graph, you make little steps this quarter. It was a significant step for us we've made, I'll call it, a reasonable half a step in the second half of last year. And then we saw a lot of the things that we've been doing come to fruition. And achieve that margin rate assisted by the -- say, the step-up in demand and essentially, we've also been able to achieve a lot of that without taking labor on. So for example, all of the $400 million effectively were in our engine business because the way we see that going forward. And the net -- even though we have a net increase in revenue across fastener structures and wheels is that essentially, where is a [indiscernible] in terms of labor. \n So all of that came out of productivity. And so we think that we're going to be able to maintain that productivity during the second half and then improve ourselves in Engine a bit to offset the -- I'll say, the revenue volatility that we're going to get, which is basically up in aerospace, up in defense, still net up in commercial despite the voting assumption to put down in commercial wheels? \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: You did mention price in that, John. Can you sustain the Q4 net price drop through? Or does it actually get better? \nJohn Plant: What I've said previously is that we thought that we were going to be able to essentially hold and match what we did in 2023 into 2024. I think where we are today is that we're absolutely clear that we're going to -- we're going to be able to hold much and maybe improve a little bit over 2023 levels on that front as well. \n So again, if you put, I'll say, a fairly good price assumption with good mix with good spares and then offset the negative from Wheels. We just got that high margin rate. That's why we sort of balance it all out, given you the guide we have at a 24% margin. \nOperator: The next question is from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. \nGautam Khanna: I had 2 questions, John. One follow-up clarification from what was just asked. On just the fungibility of production within your operations, i.e., if in a quarter or a month, Boeing asks, or GES for a destock, I'm talking about the subcontract manufacturers to Boeing. Just -- how able you guys are to respond. It sounds like you're able to just move and navigate from one program to the next. And so it is pretty fungible. .\n And then my second question is, just longer term, John, you've done a great job. I'm just curious what your longer-term plans are at the company. I hope you plan to stick around, but just wanted to get you to opine on your future plans. \nJohn Plant: So we don't have, what I call, customer dedicated plants, more product focused. So we deliver to multiple customers from most of our plants. In the case of fasteners. Some are a little bit more wide-body narrow-body focused. And so that mix can make a big difference. So if you wind the clock back, a year, 18 months, where the -- I mean, essentially 787 was halted. I mean you could say, well, one a month, but I mean it wasn't really one a month. And I remember I'll say, I think Q4 '22, essentially or Q1 of '23, we were only producing the [ metallic ] fasteners. As that was having a negative effect on us because we had 2 or 3 plants which were grossly underloaded because the equipment required to make the fasteners going a composite aircraft is different to those on the metallic aircraft. So that was both the, I'll say, an idea in terms of both, I'll say, the mix and also the exposure that we had on plants. And obviously, we got massive on recovered fixed cost, that's a problem.\n And obviously, we've been moving through that well, and that's why you've got some part of the margin rate improvement that we have in our fasteners business. It's only part of it, as I think I described many other things in it. \n For the most part, elsewhere, I mean, there are flavors across our engine business, pretesentially, again, like our core making facilities, they don't really know, what type of aircraft they go to or what customer they go to. It does matter what type of material are used in those cores. And therefore, as you, I think, know, is the core manufacturing has been taking on quite a different completion over the last 2 or 3 years, in terms of the increase in requirements to the ceramic based care. \n So I think that probably deals with that and then say, structures wheels, there's no -- again, commentary on that like a wheel is -- just goes to because we control not only the brand, but we can roll the design is that our wheels plants are indifferent to which end markets, which trailer or distribution and need which customer. So that's a good place to be in, not to have customer dedicated plants and the most difficult while we manage is narrow to wide in the fastener business. \n Second part of your question was my plans. Well, I can't say I've got any plans, particularly at the moment. I've always said to you as I said that the pleasure of the Board, I've always been wanting to see Howmet through -- I'll call it, the aerospace recovery just that we never quite get to the good recovery part of it yet. So one day, there's going to be a really good time when -- as I talked about in the press, the state of Grace, which I said maybe it will get second half of '24 or early half '25. And it just didn't happen in right now. It's -- I don't think any of us expected the Alaska Airlines incident and the concomitant effect on production and where we are now and also now the 787, so things are not smooth. And that's the case for both Boeing, in particular, but also Airbus. So I'm convinced it will get better. And one day, I'll tell you if I have a plan. How is that? \nOperator: Next question is from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. \nRonald Epstein: A question we get and we've heard maybe from some of the engine OEMs is that the supply chain needs to make more investment to have the capacity for the upcoming ramp, right? As you highlighted in your remarks that when Boeing does get back to rate, the number of leaps [indiscernible] -- it's a huge amount of growth. And one of the areas that they've suggested that investment needs to be made is in tooling. Just curious your view on that and how you're thinking about CapEx for this potential ramp going forward? \nJohn Plant: Yes. So what I said previously, maybe I'll just amplify a little bit today is that we said we were going to take back CapEx. And so if last year was probably just over $200 million. I think the midpoint of that guide now is around $300 million, it could be $290 million, but $300 million, give or take, I think, in that region. So maybe just below $300 million. \n And I think that we're going to spend all of that this year. And there will be an elevated investment requirements in 2025 as well. And essentially, that's because, yes, there's a large increase in aircraft engine, both, I think, for commercial and for defense. Because defense you've also got all the new rotor graft programs or re-engining of certain things, I think you heard of it, we talked about before. And so those investments are absolutely required. And so you can assume that the investment is a lot more than the $100 million increase that I talked about, and let's assume it's something getting close to the $200 million, which if you think about that plus all of the additional facilitization and hiring, it's a big bill. And that was essentially focused to one of the engine companies. I talked about last time. because of our increased share that we've locked in for the next few years at that company. \n And hopefully, more to come. It's because a good, strong, solid business. You're seeing margin rates improve year after year, and you've seen another step forward this year. And I think in [indiscernible] ,which we're trying to hold it now and then maybe we'll make further improvements as we go into next year. But given the demand profile. \n But at the moment, it's clearly one where there's a willingness to invest because of the, I think, returns in that business. And I think the industry needs it as well. So that's where we are on that. And probably a little bit more of a muted investment, for example, in our structures business. So you've heard me talk about titanium where to answer the question you haven't asked, we're still increasing production. You've seen that in the revenue numbers. We're taking the share we've talked about and the increments we talked about as a result of the sanctions on VSMPO. So less occurring. But again, I'm not willing to put fresh capital in the ground for that given its long duration to come on stream and also the geopolitical risk that I've talked about in the past because we don't know what's going to happen, not even what happened after the election this year. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session, and the conference has also now concluded.

            "name": "John Plant",
            "content": "Thanks, PT, and good morning, everybody. Q1 2024 was an outstanding quarter for Howmet revenue, profit, margin, and earnings per share were records and all improved versus guidance last year and sequentially. \n More specifically, Q1 performance and year-over-year improvements were as follows: Revenue was $1.824 billion, up 14%. EBITDA was $437 million, up 21%, with a healthy incremental of 35%. EBITDA margin was up 150 basis points to 24%. Operating income was 27 -- was up 27% with a margin rate of above 20%. Earnings per share were $0.57, an increase of 36% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. \n We'll recall that in Q4, the earnings per share benefited by an unusually low tax rate of 20.7% and also currency favorability and hence, the sequential improvement was indeed excellent. Free cash flow was $95 million and marks the first quarter with an inflow to be followed by further inflows in Q2, Q3 and Q4. We were particularly pleased with the positive cash flow since for many years, we've seen Q1 outflows, which had to be overcome in later quarters. \n A total of $150 million of cash was used to reach purchase shares. Just over 2.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $67. Dividends of $0.05 per share were paid, and you'll recall that these had been increased by 25% in Q4 of 2023. Finally, net debt to EBITDA was a record low of 2x. \n I'll now turn the call over to Ken to cover the financials in more detail before returning to talk to the overall outlook for 2024. Thanks, Ken, and let's move to Slide 11 to show our progress on GHG. We continue to leverage our differentiated technologies to help our customers manufacture lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft and commercial trucks with lower carbon footprints. Howmet remains committed to managing our energy consumption and environmental impacts as we increase production. \n In 2023, continue -- we continue to progress against our 2024 greenhouse gas emissions goal by achieving a 20% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions from 2023 compared to 2019, which is our baseline year. We're tracking well to our 2024 goals of a 21.5% reduction. \n I would like to draw your attention to the issuance of our annual ESG report in April, which details the good progress we've made. Additionally, in the report, we reflect 2027 goals for Howmet, which shows the continued progress on our baseline year of 2019 with a full 33% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. \n Now let's turn to Slide 12 and start to talk about the outlook for the business. Firstly, I'll address commercial aerospace, which represents our largest revenue market. Demand for air travel continues to be very strong. And if anything, will be constrained during the summer season by the availability of new aircraft, especially narrow-body aircraft. \n Asia Pacific travel, which has been lagging in the U.S. and Europe has been increasing rapidly. And is now back to approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels. International Asia Pacific travel was up approximately 50% in the recent months and speaks well to future aircraft demand especially wide-body aircraft. \n Freight requirements also continue to be robust. The one item that needs to be said that is the fact of the FAA restrictions on the Boeing 737 MAX production of 38 per month in the light of continuing quality problems at Boeing. These facts are extensively reported in the press and have resulted in lower production, well below the prior levels of approximately 30 aircraft per month, which in itself was well below the 2023 targets of 38 aircraft per month. Clearly, the prospect of going up to rate 42 and rate 47 per month is now unlikely in 2024. This has caused Howmet to completely replan our year. And we've concluded that a further reduction in build to approximately 20 aircraft per month average for the year is a more secure assumption than that previously reported of 34 aircraft per month. \n As we replan our year, we should take in account of this revenue adjustment, while replanning other areas of our business. For example, Spares, Defense and Wheels revenues, and we net all of this replanning out to an overall increase of approximately $200 million of revenue for 2024. This guide reflects continuing strong Airbus production in line with our overall planned percentage increase of aircraft of approximately 9%. We now envisage as an example, Wheels revenue being higher than previously expected in Q1 and Q2, whilst continuing to expect a reduction in the second half of the year. \n In the second half, we expect this to be offset by higher wide-body build especially in preparing to move into 2025, complemented by robustness in Spares, Defense and IGT sales. However, we do expect Boeing to trim back production part schedules for the 737 MAX to lower levels than previously envisioned. \n In terms of specific numbers in Q2, we expect revenue to be $1.35 billion, plus or minus $10 million, EBITDA $440 million, plus or minus $5 million, earnings per share of $0.58, plus or minus $0.01. For the year, we see revenues around $7.3 billion, plus or minus $75 million. EBITDA of $1.75 billion, plus or minus $30 million, earnings per share of $2.35, plus or minus $0.04 and free cash flow of $800 million, plus or minus $50 million. \n Clearly, the diversity of Howmet product revenues and solidity of performance can be seen in these numbers. We're pleased with the resulting increased outlook and our free cash flow in particular. Therefore, we expect to increase our dividend payout in the second half of the year, starting with the payment in August pending Board approval. \n Specifically, the expected dividend increase is $0.02 per share to a total of $0.07 per share, which is a 40% increase. This notably maintains the 2023 dividend yield. The balanced capital allocation plan continues. Capital expenditures elevated over 2022 and 2023 levels and is now a little ahead of depreciation. \n The main thrust continues to be the expansion in our engines business to achieve the market share increases that I already talked about on the last call. The majority of the other uses of free cash flow in terms of capital allocation will be share buyback in 2024, while still preserving the ability to pay down the stuff of the 2024 bond of $200 million should we decide to do so. \n I'm also sure that we will focus on refinancing the 2025 bonds later in the year or the latest in early 2025. I thought it useful to provide more of an extensive road map to our capital allocation thoughts during this call. \n In terms of net leverage, we're also envisaging getting closer to our minimum leverage target of towards 1.5x net debt to EBITDA by year-end from the 2x that we currently have at the end of Q1. \n In summary, moving to the summary slide. We have a strong start to the year. We have incremental EBITDA margins of 35% and an operating margin now over 20%. We have the ability to withstand the reduced narrow-body build notably from Boeing. We have a complete replanning of our year. We've increased the guide by $200 million of revenue at midpoint and the margin rate from 23% to 24%. And we've increased cash flow just under $100 million. \n We also noted that we expect to raise the dividend by 40% in the second half of the year. And that we have a clear plan for the balance of 2024 in terms of capital allocation plans. \n Thank you, and we'll now move to Q&A. Yes, I'd like to give you a real clear-cut answer, but I find it's a little bit confusing. In what we saw was, in the first quarter, schedules at rate 38. And I assume that Boeing had assumed that they would achieve that rate. I don't know. Whereas we note that actual bills were substantially less than that and probably well below 20%. And therefore, the increase in inventory, let's say, let's call it, I don't know, 15 to 38 per month, plus the 7 months of last year where rate 38 had been assumed, but more like a build of 30. Has resulted obviously in increased inventories in Boeing. \n We've heard statements to the effect that if you go back to January -- absolutely no, we'll keep rate 38 in terms of production scheduling to more recent commentary, whereby we've advised the suppliers or will be advising suppliers of trimming our requirements according to our rate needs. And of course, it's very difficult to know exactly what that means in terms of what the assumed rate needs are. \n So we're trying to be fairly cautious in that because while they say that they're going to achieve rate 38 in the second half, I guess we'd like to see that  absolutely, but are unclear that it's going to be done. \n So in terms of, for example, in our fastener business where we operate more to a min-max system, whereas Boeing had probably been wanting to increase the minimum levels we've assumed and dropped our assumptions down to deliver no more than to the absolute minimum, which is where our contract with them lies. And so we could be trying to prevent the case where we get caught with a lot of, say, change of schedule on a rapid basis and then cut with inventory. \n We're also making the assumption in our cash flow is that those schedules are cut and that we will have a trailing list of requirements that we've ordered on our suppliers for long lead time items that they will have to honor for the most part. And therefore, we'll be taking materials in which we may not be delivering in 2024. \n So just trying to pick our way through -- what the best set of assumptions are. What we do know is that GE has changed their requirements for the LEAP-1B engine. And you've seen that announcement in a clear statement. But I think that year-on-year instead of expecting maybe a 20%, 25% increase from, let's call it, 1.75 million engines to like 19.25, it's now more like a 1,700 number. That's more like a 10% to 15% increase year-on-year. But that obviously comes back out in the balance of year. \n So it's a very mixed picture that we can draw on. And so we're providing the best assumptions we can. So we are thinking that we're going to get cut back at the same time with the increases that we're expecting for 2025. So for example, Airbus increases the A320 from, let's call it, nominally 55 a month or 65 a month then some of that demand will have to be delivered in the second half of this year. \n At the same time, if Boeing do increase their rates, we're going to have to address that. So it's trying to pick your way through all of those assumptions. And so we've tried to do that. And I know that during the course of the Q&A that I'll be going through on this call. I'll try to give you a volume more from previous assumptions to the new assumptions. That's about as best I can do on the whole Boeing -- I'll say Boeing come Spirit aerospace part of the equation, no, which is what you asked about. Yes. So we cut our assumption from 6 aircraft per month down to 5. I don't know that we're going to see parts, schedule changes for the sake of 2 aircraft a month, especially if they're going to get back up to rate 5 by the second half of the year. \n So we recognize that we've been producing ahead at the current actual build rate because of the supply constraints that Boeing say that they've had, which clearly have not been from Howmet. But we've not taken it down to 3. We just assumed 5 for the year. So that's where it stands for 787. Yes. And that's also part of our thinking is that previously, our assumptions have been going to rate 7, at the back end of this year ahead of where we'd assumed [ a 6  ] where we thought it was going to go and then probably with a higher rate sometime in 2025, on their March to 10 craft per month, which I know has now changed from 2025 to 2026. \n So the assumptions seem to be a little bit slow and taking a little bit longer. And -- but nevertheless, we are thinking that will be -- there will be an increase above rate 5 as we go into 2025 and trying to build that into -- that's why we said we'd only move from 6 per month down to 5 in 2024. Yes. So should Boeing produce rate 38. I'm very clear that we'll be at rate 38 with them. And should GE reinstate the planned increase to the 19 25 level of LEAP engines, which is obviously part of it into cadence to 1b that we'll be able to meet rate -- what the -- again, on labor, you can see while we've increased the overall guidance, and therefore, our labor recruitment will be fairly robust is that we have enough flexibility to be able to cope with those rate assumptions. Because, again, we'll know months ahead of they're actually achieving that. It won't be like go from, let's say, rate 15 to rate 38 in a month, it's going to happen slowly. And gradually if it occurs. I think to some degree, it reflects the revenue potential and earnings potential of Howmet when it achieves the increased rates. And so while Boeing sales in the 787 might have been building a 3. But we were building in the first quarter of our parts at a rate significantly above that. So let's assume rate 6 or even in rate 7. And so this that's obviously a very good dynamic for the business and then showed with I thought, which was excellent margin improvement in the business, which was a combination of operational performance, commercial performance and the mix. And when that happened, we've put on 500-plus basis points in margin improvement year-over-year. And there's still -- I don't know what it was, 200 basis points sequentially. \n So all really good. And obviously, we're trying to work out exactly what that will be. As the assumption I made is that we get down to rate 5 on the 787 and obviously, a much lower rate on the 737. Albeit as you know there's a metallic fasteners, they don't quite have the richness of mix that we will get on a composite aircraft. \n At the same time with Airbus, as you know, the A350 is a composite-based aircraft. And so the rate increase that we've seen there and also as we prepare for a further rate increase in 2025, then again, that's all looking positive for Howmet. Yes. I mean, what we've guided to you in Q2 is that, in fact, revenues would be slightly higher than Q1. So we're still expecting overall to be good. But very much for our year would be -- we're cautious because of the rate assumptions I've given you on the 737 and therefore, expecting to have the impact of that. \n Plus, also, as you heard me talk about on my prepared remarks is that we are expecting weakness in our commercial wheels business in the second half of the year. So far, we've been pleasantly surprised by the strength in that segment. Clearly, we hope it continues, but our planning again for some reduction because we've already heard customers like PACCAR reducing their commercial Class 8 truck build as they go forward. \n So again, it's a different number in the U.S., maybe a 10% truck build reduction we're thinking of in North America and maybe something a little bit higher in Europe, offset by whatever penetration we can achieve in terms of aluminum versus steel. So -- but the important thing I thought in this quarter was that we were able to really operated a really -- a good level and achieved a rate increase, let's say, 26.5%, 27% EBITDA margin, doing like 28.5%. And that's really good because obviously it's a supply -- it's more leverage at the operating margin and the EBITDA margin level. So it was all good. So it's a cautious assumption on commercial truck in the second half, cautious assumption around Boeing MAX production coming off, as I talked about earlier, a rate 38 scheduling in Q1. Okay. Maybe the best thing I can do is to give you a picture of the revenue walk for the company first and then return to the specific question, obviously improved durability as a second subject.\n So in our assumption, is that we are thinking that we'll have a, let's say, a hit from the MAX reduction assumption from the 34 rate we'd assume in Q1 to the 20 rate. And so that's something well over $100 million of a hit. And then we see that being offset with an increased reimbursements of our defense sales. And you saw those up 12% in Q1, which was significantly higher than our assumption, which was mid-single digits. So I think that's $60 million-ish, give or take. \n On Wheels, we think the first half is going to be stronger than we thought. So let's call that $50 million-ish on wheels. And then with our other sectors that we serve, for example, like oil and gas, you heard us talk to a 15% increase there. And while IGT was flat in Q1, we're thinking of a mid-single digit increase for the year. for IGT and Industrial, there's another $60 million. So essentially, all of all of the Max [indiscernible] and more it gets covered by those items. \n And then the big one, I think, is our assumption around spares, which is we've put in an increased revenue assumption of over $120 million plus on our spares lift. And that reflects, let's say, a further aggregate 25% lift in our spares business year-on-year and more like 35% on commercial aero. So it's pretty significant. And now the rate -- the spares revenues are substantially above 2019 levels, a 2019 was about $800 million, I think $1.1 billion plus in that area. So the -- if you assume that -- on the OE side, it was all about net offset. You can see our total $200 million increase, let's call it, $120 million plus comes from the spares assumption. And so that's how you get there. \n In terms of when you think through what's going on at the moment, clearly, the existing engine, which is now all past model, which is the CFM56 there. We have not yet seen the peak of spares for that business. And because of the lack of current narrow-body production by Boeing is that it's the airlines are working the fleet hard. And therefore, CFM56 it's probably going to peak more like 25, maybe 26 now, and that's still increasing. So that's good. \n The 737 MAX is -- it's obviously been having its own increase in, let's say, MRO shop visits. And on the current version of the LEAP engine, those won't peak in my view until well after 2030. And -- so we're seeing an increase there. And I've also talked on the last earnings call about the immediacy of the time on wing issue and they're producing a little bit of extra revenue. I probably overstated calling it at a [ bubble ] 3 or 4 years, but that's going to go on, both for the LEAP engine and in particular, the geared turbo fan, and that's well reported. \n I think what we'll see is that there will be a gradual introduction of the new improved robust turbine blades. And that's probably more significant as we go into '25 and beyond than it is in 2024. But that obviously the -- assuming that is successful in terms of the durability, and I have every reason to believe it will be, then I guess that affects shop visits coming, making up about 2030 and beyond. But meanwhile, of course, we'll have the benefit of LEAP -- current production for the last -- let's call 8 years and the geared turbofan for longer, that will be increasing that -- that's a road map through. \n So it's a long way of saying we should have improved asset economics around more robust fixes for GTF and LEAP that fixed time line wing issues. Plus the increased spares demand initially from the CFM56, which is still coming at us, and it's good. And then obviously, further increases to the LEAP, which and -- geared turbofan which include the time line when we issues the well reported. I see commercial aerospace sales going up in '25, '26 and '27. It's a bit too difficult to get up beyond that, but I see rising reducing the spares area during those years. I also see increased spares for the F-35. And in the past, I've said I think by the time we get to 2025, we could be seeing spares revenues almost as much as the current OE demand for F-35 turbine blades.\n And then what happened after depends upon the rate of production and the rate of usage for the F-35 around the world. Clearly, in recent months it has been an extraordinary list of, I will say, time in the air for F-35s. On the other hand, I've also read articles about the plan that we know to run them a little bit less. \n But nevertheless, we see F-35 spares being very strong over the next few years. And the -- I think the aircraft park at the end of last year was just under 1,000 aircraft and now it's over 1,000, but will be increasing, assuming that Lockheed delivers, let's call it, about 150 aircraft a year, which looks like doing 150 every year for probably the next 10 years. But so -- by which time, the fleet of F-35s around the world will be very large and the spares will be extraordinary. \n And then in between of that, let's call it in around the 2028 mark, I think we'll see improved turbine componentry to meet the requirements where additional thrust is required to offset the current draw from the weapon systems and avionics that is currently the issue being addressed. Certainly, the program that we put in 3 years ago of creating a separate segment within our fasteners business for distribution is notable success for us. And I'm going to say we've probably seen an almost doubling of that business in the last 3 years. We don't provide like all makes to everybody and try to manage all the logistics of people, but this is trying to capture that margin previously that we had effectively passed on to other distributors. Because we distribute those parts. And we mainly focus on those parts which are proprietary with technology moats around them from the Howmet say, suite of fastener brands. \n So that is growing faster than the OE business for us, and therefore, again, that's been another thrust for us. It's also an improvement in fastener margins. So far, any commentary that I've given, Myles, I've never been willing to say that we'll achieve 2019 levels of margin rates because I think those were the very different conditions. I mean there, we had 787 running at 13 or 14 a month, as an example. And the A350 also at a higher rate. \n So the -- I mean, as you know, what we talked about on this call is that those rates are way -- it may be 1/3 of that. And so it's all wrapped up in our own progression of efficiency, but also what's the mix of aircraft come 2027? I might be a bit more bullish if you'll guarantee to me that Boeing will be making 14 787 and now I think I read that Airbus is going to make 15 a month of A350. I mean, if that happened, it's all great. It's really good for us. I realized that. That's why I put it that way. That's why I try to not to put my head in that noose because I had no plan... No [indiscernible] that knows that sort of stuff. I actually don't think I quoted a number. You talked about the spares on commercial now? Yes, I think it's about right. I'd have to go back to my notes to guide what a more precise number. I think it's well above the $400 million that we saw in 2019. So I think $550 million is probably a best approximation, and Ken can jump in if he wants to correct me on that number. The defense spares for last year, we're already growing from like 400 to 600, and that's continued. So it's all good on that front. Inevitably, if you look at our rate of hiring, and we're also coming off a bigger base of experienced labor. So part of that is improved labor efficiency, Sheila. And notwithstanding, I'll say, the Boeing volatility, I'm hoping we can plan our way around because the overall revenue without -- obviously, it'll be a different mix and different plants, but I'm hopeful we can manage our way through to keep that the overall operating efficiency that we have had in Q1, and that's what we've guided to. You can see we've guided to a 24% EBITDA margin. So even though, let's say, we look to see that go down a little bit in the second half, and that's a, let's say, a 28% plus business. And therefore, we'll need to work the other harder just to keep it right 24% in terms of EBITDA margin percentage, which we believe we can, and we'll do otherwise, we wouldn't have guided there.\n But I think it's been one where nothing ever moves in an absolute straight line. Like on a graph, you make little steps this quarter. It was a significant step for us we've made, I'll call it, a reasonable half a step in the second half of last year. And then we saw a lot of the things that we've been doing come to fruition. And achieve that margin rate assisted by the -- say, the step-up in demand and essentially, we've also been able to achieve a lot of that without taking labor on. So for example, all of the $400 million effectively were in our engine business because the way we see that going forward. And the net -- even though we have a net increase in revenue across fastener structures and wheels is that essentially, where is a [indiscernible] in terms of labor. \n So all of that came out of productivity. And so we think that we're going to be able to maintain that productivity during the second half and then improve ourselves in Engine a bit to offset the -- I'll say, the revenue volatility that we're going to get, which is basically up in aerospace, up in defense, still net up in commercial despite the voting assumption to put down in commercial wheels? \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: You did mention price in that, John. Can you sustain the Q4 net price drop through? Or does it actually get better? What I've said previously is that we thought that we were going to be able to essentially hold and match what we did in 2023 into 2024. I think where we are today is that we're absolutely clear that we're going to -- we're going to be able to hold much and maybe improve a little bit over 2023 levels on that front as well. \n So again, if you put, I'll say, a fairly good price assumption with good mix with good spares and then offset the negative from Wheels. We just got that high margin rate. That's why we sort of balance it all out, given you the guide we have at a 24% margin. So we don't have, what I call, customer dedicated plants, more product focused. So we deliver to multiple customers from most of our plants. In the case of fasteners. Some are a little bit more wide-body narrow-body focused. And so that mix can make a big difference. So if you wind the clock back, a year, 18 months, where the -- I mean, essentially 787 was halted. I mean you could say, well, one a month, but I mean it wasn't really one a month. And I remember I'll say, I think Q4 '22, essentially or Q1 of '23, we were only producing the [ metallic ] fasteners. As that was having a negative effect on us because we had 2 or 3 plants which were grossly underloaded because the equipment required to make the fasteners going a composite aircraft is different to those on the metallic aircraft. So that was both the, I'll say, an idea in terms of both, I'll say, the mix and also the exposure that we had on plants. And obviously, we got massive on recovered fixed cost, that's a problem.\n And obviously, we've been moving through that well, and that's why you've got some part of the margin rate improvement that we have in our fasteners business. It's only part of it, as I think I described many other things in it. \n For the most part, elsewhere, I mean, there are flavors across our engine business, pretesentially, again, like our core making facilities, they don't really know, what type of aircraft they go to or what customer they go to. It does matter what type of material are used in those cores. And therefore, as you, I think, know, is the core manufacturing has been taking on quite a different completion over the last 2 or 3 years, in terms of the increase in requirements to the ceramic based care. \n So I think that probably deals with that and then say, structures wheels, there's no -- again, commentary on that like a wheel is -- just goes to because we control not only the brand, but we can roll the design is that our wheels plants are indifferent to which end markets, which trailer or distribution and need which customer. So that's a good place to be in, not to have customer dedicated plants and the most difficult while we manage is narrow to wide in the fastener business. \n Second part of your question was my plans. Well, I can't say I've got any plans, particularly at the moment. I've always said to you as I said that the pleasure of the Board, I've always been wanting to see Howmet through -- I'll call it, the aerospace recovery just that we never quite get to the good recovery part of it yet. So one day, there's going to be a really good time when -- as I talked about in the press, the state of Grace, which I said maybe it will get second half of '24 or early half '25. And it just didn't happen in right now. It's -- I don't think any of us expected the Alaska Airlines incident and the concomitant effect on production and where we are now and also now the 787, so things are not smooth. And that's the case for both Boeing, in particular, but also Airbus. So I'm convinced it will get better. And one day, I'll tell you if I have a plan. How is that? Yes. So what I said previously, maybe I'll just amplify a little bit today is that we said we were going to take back CapEx. And so if last year was probably just over $200 million. I think the midpoint of that guide now is around $300 million, it could be $290 million, but $300 million, give or take, I think, in that region. So maybe just below $300 million. \n And I think that we're going to spend all of that this year. And there will be an elevated investment requirements in 2025 as well. And essentially, that's because, yes, there's a large increase in aircraft engine, both, I think, for commercial and for defense. Because defense you've also got all the new rotor graft programs or re-engining of certain things, I think you heard of it, we talked about before. And so those investments are absolutely required. And so you can assume that the investment is a lot more than the $100 million increase that I talked about, and let's assume it's something getting close to the $200 million, which if you think about that plus all of the additional facilitization and hiring, it's a big bill. And that was essentially focused to one of the engine companies. I talked about last time. because of our increased share that we've locked in for the next few years at that company. \n And hopefully, more to come. It's because a good, strong, solid business. You're seeing margin rates improve year after year, and you've seen another step forward this year. And I think in [indiscernible] ,which we're trying to hold it now and then maybe we'll make further improvements as we go into next year. But given the demand profile. \n But at the moment, it's clearly one where there's a willingness to invest because of the, I think, returns in that business. And I think the industry needs it as well. So that's where we are on that. And probably a little bit more of a muted investment, for example, in our structures business. So you've heard me talk about titanium where to answer the question you haven't asked, we're still increasing production. You've seen that in the revenue numbers. We're taking the share we've talked about and the increments we talked about as a result of the sanctions on VSMPO. So less occurring. But again, I'm not willing to put fresh capital in the ground for that given its long duration to come on stream and also the geopolitical risk that I've talked about in the past because we don't know what's going to happen, not even what happened after the election this year."

            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of the markets. All markets continued to be healthy in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, performance was as follows: Total revenue was up 14%, driven by very strong growth in the commercial aerospace market, which was up 23%. Commercial aerospace has now grown for 12 consecutive quarters and represents approximately 50% of total revenue. Growth continues to be robust, supported by demand for new more fuel-efficient aircraft with reduced carbon emissions and increased spares demand for engines. \n Moving to our other markets. First, defense aerospace was also strong, up 12%, driven by fighter programs and engine spares demand. Next is commercial transportation, which has been resilient in a challenging market. Revenue was up slightly as we continue to offset weakness in the market by taking share from steel wheels with Howmet lighter and more fuel-efficient aluminum wheels. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 7%, driven by oil and gas up 15%; general industrial, up 10% and IGT, which was flat. In summary, another strong quarter across all of our end markets. \n Now let's move to Slide 6. First, moving to the P&L. Q1 revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and earnings per share were all records and exceeded the high end of guidance. Revenue was up 14% and EBITDA outpaced revenue growth by being up 21%, while absorbing the addition of approximately 430 net new employees in the quarter. Incremental flow-through of revenue to EBITDA was a healthy 35%. EBITDA margin was a record at 24% and earnings per share was also a record at $0.57, which was an increase of 36% year-over-year. \n Now let's move to the balance sheet and cover the balance sheet and cash flow. The balance sheet and liquidity have never been stronger. Cash at the end of the quarter was $534 million, and free cash flow was a record for Q1 at $95 million. Net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 2x. All long-term debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which provides stability of interest rate expense into the future. \n Howmet's improved financial leverage and strong cash generation were reflected in Moody's Q1 ratings upgrade to investment grade. With this upgrade, we are now rated as investment grade with all 3 rating agencies. Additionally, with the recent upgrades, we have established a $1 billion commercial paper program, which further strengthens our liquidity. Finally, we continue to have access to our $1 billion undrawn revolver. Total liquidity now stands at approximately $2.5 billion. \n Finally, let's move to capital deployment. We deployed approximately 700 -- excuse me, $170 million of cash in the quarter to shareholders, of which $150 million was used to repurchase common stock. This was the 12th consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. The average diluted share count improved to a record low Q1 exit rate of 411 million shares. \n Finally, we continue to be confident in our free cash flow. In the first quarter, we deployed approximately $20 million for the quarterly common stock dividend of $0.05 per share. \n Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the first quarter. Engine Products continued its strong performance. Revenue increased 11% in the quarter to $885 million. Commercial aerospace was up 14% and defense aerospace was up 13%. Both markets realized higher build rates and spares growth. Oil and gas was up 15% and IGT was flat. Demand continues to be strong across all of our engines markets. EBITDA increased 17% year-over-year to a record $249 million. \n EBITDA margin increased 140 basis points year-over-year to a record 28.1%, while absorbing approximately 435 net new employees in the quarter. Once again, the engines team delivered another strong quarter. \n Now let's move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems also had a strong quarter. Revenue increased 25% year-over-year to $389 million. Commercial aerospace was up 44%, including the impact of the wide-body recovery. Commercial transportation was up 5%. General industrial was up 14% and defense aerospace was down 11%. \n Year-over-year EBITDA outpaced revenue growth with an increase of 59% to $92 million. EBITDA margin increased 510 basis points year-over-year to 23.7%, which reflects the improved commercial and operational performance, complemented by the wide-body recovery. \n Now let's move to Slide 9. Engineered Structures performance continued to improve. Revenue increased 27% year-over-year to $262 million. Commercial aerospace was up 26%, driven by build rates and the wide-body recovery. Defense aerospace was up 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by the F-35 program. EBITDA was up $7 million year-over-year and EBITDA margin decreased slightly to 14.1%. Sequentially, revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin increased for the third consecutive quarter. The team is making progress, and we expect continued improvements throughout 2024. \n Finally, let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels revenue was essentially flat year-over-year in a challenging market. Although revenue was essentially flat, EBITDA increased 4%, driven by volume and productivity. EBITDA margin was a healthy 28.5%. \n With that, now let me turn it back over to John."
