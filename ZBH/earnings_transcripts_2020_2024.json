As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 5, 2021. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's quarterly earnings conference call. Joining me virtually today are Bryan Hanson, our President and CEO; and CFO, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements.

As a note to all call participants, we provided updates via 2 press releases issued this morning, and we have also posted an investor presentation to our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson : All right. Great. Thanks, Keri. And also I want to say just thanks to everyone for joining us on the call here this morning. As you saw from our announcements earlier today, we clearly have a few updates that we want to fill you in on and I'm looking forward to a very productive call this morning. Just given the backdrop of COVID, let me just start by saying that I certainly hope that all of you are doing well and staying safe. And continuing to, as much as it's frustrating, I'm sure by now, continuing to social distance and wear your masks. I think, at this point, we're all pretty good at it. So let's make sure that we continue to do it. And to all of the ZB team members joining the call this morning and who are listening at a later time, I just want to let you know I'm thinking about you as well. I just want to say thanks. Thanks for everything that you do and have done and will do actually to continue to follow our protocols, to keep yourself safe, obviously, but also our teammates safe. And as a result of that, continue to deliver for our customers and our patients and move our mission forward. And I just continue to be very proud of everything this team has accomplished against a significantly challenging backdrop in 2020. So, I'm proud of you, I'm glad to see what you've been able to do, and I'm looking forward to what you're going to do in 2021. And here we are, right? We're in 2021. And there's going to be challenges and we've seen already early on in 2021, but I'm confident that we're ready to deal with the challenges as we do, and I'm pretty confident that we're going to see some real opportunities for 2021 as well. And there's just a lot of updates that I want to share with you today, but I'm going to keep my comments to a minimum, if possible. I really want to make sure that we have time for Suky to get into a little more detail on Q4 and then ultimately say how that's going to translate into 2021. Now we're not going to give too many specifics on 2021, but he'll give you some color on what we're seeing from Q4 and again, the impact we think that's going to have on 2021. And I want to make sure that we leave time for questions as well, okay, so for today, I'm just going to kind of keep it to 3 main topics. The first is really how we're continuing to navigate COVID-19 and to continue inside of that to ensure that we're executing against our strategy. The second one is really going to talk about the ongoing transformation of the company. We really are making sure that we're moving forward with active portfolio management. And obviously, we're taking the next steps there with the planned spin-off of our Spine and Dental business. So, we'll talk a bit about that, and then third, I want to make sure that we, again, touch upon our long-term growth strategy and how it positions us to drive growth, obviously as a company, but also value for you and value for us. And so, let's start again, navigating the challenges and executing here in the short term. There's just no doubt that COVID, unfortunately, remains a challenge. Coming out of Q4, we're seeing the pandemic pressure and the surges continue, and frankly worsen across pretty much all of our regions and markets. There's clearly more lockdown measures that we're seeing throughout Europe, Middle East, and Africa, to a far lesser extent, but still impacting Asia Pacific as well. And certainly, in the Americas, we're all seeing it in the U.S. May be different by state, but we're clearly seeing increased pressure as a result of surges in the pandemic. So, all of that is kind of the backdrop that we saw coming out of Q4.  Unfortunately, this pressure in the corresponding decline in elective procedures grew throughout Q4 and actually was worse at the end of December. And at this point, we expect that increase in pressure will continue throughout Q1, at least and will impact all 3 of our regions. As a matter of fact, we're actually seeing this probably increase in pressure coming out of Q4. So, we would expect Q1 to be a little more challenging than even what we saw in Q4. But even given that backdrop, I'd say that I'm optimistic. Sounds crazy to just say what I said, but say that I'm also optimistic, but [indiscernible] the approved vaccines. We're currently rolling those out around the world. We do believe the vaccines are going to change the COVID-19 dynamic, and we're going to see positive impact as a result of it. As soon as we start to see the surges stop, we see the impact of COVID end. And we're confident that the recovery is going to mean that the normal patient flow is going to start again, and we're going to have the pull-through effect of a sizable patient backlog that's been created over the past number of quarters. We expect that when that recovery occurs, we're going to see a period of what I would define as normal market growth augmented by deferred procedures that will be coming in as well. And we're going to be ready for that. And we're excited about that.  So as much as it's going to be a little rocky in the short-term and potentially more challenging than what we saw in the fourth quarter, we see a light at the end of the tunnel, and that's a good thing. The big question is when? When is that going to happen? We know the vaccine is going to have the impact. The big question is when. And that's certainly going to be the key variable we're going to be looking at as we try to predict where 2021 is going to look like. So while I would just say, against this backdrop of COVID, what is clear to us is we can't control when the vaccines allow the surges to stop, but what we can control inside of that is how we execute our strategy. And I have confidence we're going to continue to move forward. Our core business is strong. Our execution is on point. I would just say momentum around our key commercial launches and programs continues to be strong. And I would say that overall, our commercial confidence is better than it has ever been. So let's give a few examples of this. I can say it all day long, but once we talk about it and actually, it reflects in the numbers, who cares. So let's first start with ROSA Knee. Obviously, this is something that everyone's going to be paying attention to. Certainly, I am. And I know we said we're going to hit between 200 to 300 cumulative placements by the end of 2020. Obviously, you know that we are in that range as of Q3. So I'm happy to report that, not only did we achieve that goal, we achieved the high end of that goal. And I would tell you that the momentum is strong coming into 2021. Q4 was actually our strongest quarter as of the date of launch of ROSA Knee. So we had some pretty strong quarters in the past, Q4 was our best, and we were on the high end of the goal that we set for the year. And as I've said before, with some of the new launches that we have coming, specifically associated with the knee, I feel pretty confident that 2021 is going to continue to show that kind of resilience and strength for ROSA Knee. On the Persona Revision side, again, this product continues to be very successful for us. We now show that in Q4, we actually had the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth that we've seen since launch. We did realize our 2020 expectations of $100 million in gross revenue and almost $40 million in net of cannibalization revenue during the year. And I would just tell you that that's just the beginning because Persona Revision serves as a really compelling tip of the spear product for our commercial team. Once we get Persona Revision in, we've got an opportunity to hunt for the typical primary knee as well. So we're very excited about that launch, and it continues to be strong. On the hip side, Avenir Complete continues to be a strong one for us. Even in the pandemic, it continues to beat our expectations. And if I just look at Q4 specifically, we grew about 30% over Q3, again, even with the increased pressures of the pandemic in Q4. So very excited with what we're able to do with Avenir Complete, and we expect big things to continue with this product throughout 2021. And as you obviously know, we also expect at the end of 2021 to launch the ROSA Hip which, again, gives us a lot of confidence in the hip category for our business. And then finally, for Signature ONE Planner, we demonstrated, again, strong sequential growth with registrations up nearly 25% in Q4 over Q3, and we expect utilization to continue to expand significantly in 2021 with really a goal of having more than 50% of our shoulder procedures using presurgical planning. And that's important for a lot of reasons. Remember, the presurgical planning creates stickiness with the customer. But it also enhances our ability to get more guides and to augment using the procedure, which can really take up the ASP for that procedure. So again, exciting stuff with Signature ONE Planner as well. And so all in, we continue to execute -- we continue to execute as a team. The way we're showing up every day, the way we're showing up in the market, frankly, versus our peers, gives me confidence in our business as does our continued innovation and our product launches. But we're going to see more this year, some pretty pivotal innovation that we're going to see this year. As I mentioned before, we're going to see what ROSA Partial Knee, we're going to see ROSA Hip. And we're also going to see the first smart implant, Persona-IQ, launched this year. So definitely exciting for us from an innovation standpoint in 2021. And yes, that leads me to really my second topic this morning. We continue the transformation of ZB. That's been the goal since I got here. You've heard me talk about our 3 phases of transformation. First was the hearts and minds and the execution challenges that we had in the very beginning. That's what we talked about a lot in the beginning. The second phase of this was really doing a more robust, longer-term strategy, making sure that we brought innovation to the market and getting our execution straight. We're clearly well into that phase. And third is our portfolio transformation. And that's the goal of active portfolio management to change the complexion of the organization, so that we can have better goal of sustaining the mid-single-digit growth. And I'm proud to say that we're squarely positioned in phase 3 now as well. And as you've seen by our recent announcement, we're going to continue to move this forward. We have the portfolio management strategy and the process in place and have built a pretty strong capability to move us forward in this area. Late last year, we executed a number of smaller but still important M&A deals to fill portfolio gaps and to better position us in higher growth areas that we do believe we have a right to win in. And just this morning, we announced our intent to spin-off our Spine and Dental businesses. Ultimately creating, we believe, 2 independent, publicly traded companies, both Zimmer Biomet and the new company called NewCo that are going to be better positioned, separate. I truly believe, by separating out these businesses, we're going to create 2 stronger companies. 2 companies that are going to be better positioned to meet customer needs and improve patient lives, and ultimately, and very importantly, deliver greater value to you, our shareholders. And let me give you a bit more detail on why we believe this is an opportunity for value creation and really why we think it delivers value for both the ZB and NewCo. First of all, the transaction increases our management focus and resource prioritization. We truly do believe for both companies. We think about NewCo, and we think it's going to thrive as an independent company with prioritized capital allocation to pursue strategies and growth opportunities and through the investments inside of Spine and Dental that has not been a focus for ZB. It will absolutely be a focus for NewCo. And for Zimmer Biomet, the transaction is an important next step in our transition into a more streamlined company with sharper focus in greater and more optimized resource allocation towards innovation in those core businesses that we are committed to, that are profitable for us, where we see attractive markets with a right to win in those markets and be market leaders. And really, the second thing is it's going to drive increased growth and efficiency for both companies. We really do believe that. Simply put, we expect that these 2 companies, with their simplified operating models and just reduced complexity and increased focus, we'll be able to grow revenue, margin and earnings per share faster than they would if we remain combined as one company. And Suky is going to talk more about the specific financial impact that we expect in just a few minutes, but just note, it's positive for both organizations, financially speaking, as we separate the organizations. And third, it's going to enhance value creation for our patients, our providers and all of our key stakeholders, including our own team members. This is the next step in ZB's transformation, and it underscores our commitment to ensuring long-term priorities remain aligned with shareholders' best interest. It's going drive the business forward to meet customer needs and advance our mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life of people around the world. We think we can do it better as 2 separate organizations. Okay. So that's the backdrop of the spin. And today, obviously, it's just day 1 in terms of announcements around this process. You can absolutely expect that we're going to continue to provide updates as we move forward, as NewCo takes shape and as we move towards the transaction close, which we're currently expecting to be around mid-2022. Okay. So we're confident in the steps we're taking and our ability to keep executing and in our overall ZB strategy. And that brings me really to the third and really the final topic that I have for these remarks, and it's our plan to drive long-term growth. And ultimately, as a result of that, deliver increased value for you. And to do that, we remain fully committed and confident in ZB's long-term growth and margin expansion expectations. In fact, the spin-off transaction that we're going to do over the next year serves to de-risk, if not accelerate, our path to that 4% to 5% growth rate we've talked about and our 30% operating margin profile by the end of 2023. And to get there, to be able to deliver on both of those, we're going to have to be committed to our priority growth areas, and we've talked about these in the past, but I'm going to remind you of them again. The key area of concentration for us would be knees, hips and S.E.T. If we think about knees first and foremost, we need to be able to grow above market rates here. And we're going to continue to focus on the fastest growth submarkets of knees. For us, that's going to be robotics, data and informatics, cementless and revision. We feel we have plenty of innovation and momentum here to continue to grow sustainably above market rates in knee. From a hip perspective, it's a little less ambitious in the beginning. We just said that we need to grow at market in the short-term, with the idea that over the long-term, particularly after ROSA Hip is launched, that we would grow above market in hip as well. And I can tell you based on our performance so far, the ROSA Hip application being launched later in 2021 and the Avenir Complete momentum that we have, we feel confident we're going to be able to do that as well. And as far as that goes, we just want to grow at market, if not the higher end of market. And to do that, we're going to focus on the most attractive sub-element of S.E.T for us and that's, for us, again, going to be sports, medicine and extremities. Those are key areas of concentration for us that we're going to invest internally. We're going to look for external ways to build scale, and we're going to build commercial infrastructure as well, right? It's only closed by saying that I continue to be more confident about ZB's future than ever. I know I say that a lot recently, but I really do feel the momentum right now. I truly believe that we are well positioned for success and that our strategy is absolutely working. And our transformation is well underway. And our proven ability to rise to challenges and face adversity, I think has prepared us well for navigating the current environment. And really, for that matter, any environment in front of us. And I just want to, again, say thanks to the entire ZB team in your focus on our mission, our strategy and how we show up and execute every day is unmatched. It's what makes ZB and what makes me confident that we're going to continue to deliver. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky for more financial details of the quarter and also looking forward. Okay. Suky?\nSuky Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the details, I'd like to summarize the quarter as one where we made significant progress across a number of strategic and operational fronts, all in the backdrop of heightened market pressure. While revenue and profitability were challenged due to the pandemic, we executed extremely well against the things we can control, positioning ourselves to win through eventual market recovery and beyond. Now for this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 2 topics. First, our Q4 results, including commentary on the COVID impact and what we're seeing so far in Q1; and second, how ZB is positioned for long-term growth, specifically, how we believe the spin-off transaction we announced this morning is expected to impact us post execution. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $2.085 billion, a reported decrease of 1.9% and a constant currency decrease of 3.7% versus 2019. But we did not experience any material day rate differences in our year-over-year comparisons. Our consolidated regional results were in line with expectations despite deepening pandemic pressure on global elective procedures as we exited the year. While the market softened through the quarter, execution remained strong across all regions. Beginning with Asia Pacific, the region grew 2% versus Q4 2019 with growth across all 3 of our largest markets of Japan, China and Australia, New Zealand. While COVID pressure on elective procedures increased towards the end of the quarter, the impact is less pronounced than what we are seeing in EMEA and the Americas. We are excited about the uptake we're seeing in ROSA in the region and with the solid performance across our knee and hip businesses. As expected, the EMEA region was hardest hit by COVID-19, decreasing 17.5% versus 2019, with all sub-regions in decline. Surges in the virus leading to policy actions and government lockdowns negatively impacted elective procedures across the region. Lastly, the Americas region was about flat, decreasing 0.3% compared to 2019, driven by continued COVID headwinds in Latin America, in tandem with a softening U.S. market. The U.S. was flat despite increased pressure on elective procedures. Performance was buoyed by continued strong demand for recent innovative product introductions, strong execution by our commercial organization and some favorable impact related to the order timing and year-end purchases, as some accounts increased their buying patterns to utilize remaining 2020 budgets. Turning to our business performance for Q4. The global knee business declined 4.8%, negatively impacted by the ongoing pressures in EMEA. However, the U.S. knee business continued to grow, increasing 1.8%, and Asia Pacific knee business returned to growth increasing 2.9%. Overall, execution was strong with continued momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee. Our global hip business decreased 3.4%, again, driven by declines in EMEA. Both U.S. hips and APAC hips continued their growth trends, increasing 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively. Sports, extremity and trauma sales declined 3.3%. Dental, Spine and CMFT continued to deliver better execution, increasing 0.8%. And finally, our other category was down 9.3%. Moving to the P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.59 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.11. Additional details on our GAAP results can be viewed in our press release issued this morning. On an adjusted basis, with revenue down 3.7%, EPS was down about 10%, driven by a lower operating margin and a higher share count, which more than offset the favorable tax rate in the quarter. Lower adjusted operating margin was driven by lower revenue and an expected year-over-year decline in gross margins. Adjusted gross margin was 71.3%, sequentially better than Q3 but lower than Q4 2019. Versus the prior year, favorable geographic mix was more than offset by lower volumes, ongoing pricing pressure and the impact from prior period deferred costs. OpEx was down versus the prior year as we implemented several cost containment initiatives as part of our response to the pandemic, in addition to the realization of our transformation programs that were ultimately reinvested back into R&D and commercial infrastructure to help drive consistent above-market growth in priority areas. Based on our performance versus market over the recent quarters, our reinvestment of efficiency savings is translating into strong returns. The Q4 adjusted tax rate of 15% was better than the previous year due to geographic mix of income and certain discrete benefits in the quarter related to recent audit settlements. Turning to cash and liquidity in the quarter. Free cash flow totaled $329 million, higher than the same period in 2019, driven by better working capital and lower capital expenditures. And we utilized better-than-expected cash flow to pay down $250 million of debt ahead of schedule, ending the year with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $800 million. Now moving to 2021. Due to the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on elective procedures, we will not be providing full year financial guidance at this time. We recognize that this is challenging for you as you build your '21 models. However, we will reserve financial guidance until we have more certainty around the outlook of elective procedures relative to COVID surges, and related vaccine adoption. We strive to be credible and transparent. And to that end, I will provide additional quarterly details and broader full year shaping as an interim measure. So far through January, we've seen COVID pressure continuing to intensify from the end of December. Based on what we've seen so far in the quarter and in tandem with our latest estimates for procedure cadence, we project that Q1 revenue will be down in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit percentage range versus Q1 2020. Now we have optimism and confidence that we'll see a positive vaccine impact on elective procedures this year. And once we do, we expect elective procedure volumes to return to pre-pandemic levels and the sizable patient backlog to serve as a tailwind to underlying market growth. As we turn to the P&L, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on sales volume will put pressure on adjusted operating margins and earnings leverage until we return to consistent pre-COVID revenue levels and growth rates, as I just discussed. Despite this near-term pressure, our confidence in the market recovery and the longer-term financial profile of the company is driving continued investment into priority areas of the business. We expect that adjusted gross margin will stabilize in 2021, with quarterly margin levels broadly in line with what we saw in the back half of 2020. We could see some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter depending on a number of variables, including volumes, price, foreign currency, mix and other drivers that can change results over time. Regarding operating expenses. Sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect non-commission spending in Q1 to be modestly lower with increases in future quarters' OpEx investments as the impact of the pandemic abates. We expect interest expense to increase in the mid-single-digit versus 2020, as the benefit from lower debt balances is more than offset by the renewal of net investment hedge positions. Our tax rate is expected to be modestly higher than the full year 2020 rate and could fluctuate over the year as a result of variability in geographic mix of income due to the pandemic. Also, we are not projecting any material U.S. corporate tax reform to be implemented in 2021. We project that the full year share count in 2021 will continue to increase modestly versus Q4 2020, and we are not planning for any share buybacks in the year. And in terms of capital allocation, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and are planning to pay down an additional $500 million of debt in 2021. Now let's turn to today's announcement related to our intent to spin the Spine and Dental businesses into an independent publicly traded company. The transaction will be structures of tax redistribution of newly issued NewCo shares to ZB shareholders. As Bryan mentioned, we believe that this tax-efficient transaction, which is expected to close in mid-2022, subject to certain conditions, will drive greater focus for each company with an enhanced prioritization of capital allocation, while accelerating growth and providing the platform for greater shareholder value. In terms of the NewCo financial profile, 2019 and 2020 pro forma revenues totaled approximately $1.022 billion and $897 million, respectively, and is supported by a diversified geographic base with real opportunities for enhanced growth and margin expansion. We expect NewCo to have a financial profile generally in line with its peer group and a capital structure supportive of innovation and investment over time. Importantly, the transaction will empower NewCo to pursue a more focused investment and execution strategy. ZB delivered 2019 and 2020 pro forma revenue of $6.96 billion and $6.128 billion, respectively. For post-spin ZB, the transaction is expected to deliver an improved growth profile with accretion to our revenue growth of approximately 50 basis points over the course of our 5-year strategic planning period. We also expect that it will expand our adjusted EBITDA and operating margins on a pro forma basis by approximately 125 basis points. With that, you should have even greater confidence in our operating margin expansion goals. We remain committed to at least 30% adjusted operating margins by the end of 2023. And with this transaction, we have the opportunity to accelerate the timing of that goal. However, we will continue to balance margin acceleration against investment opportunities to accelerate durable top-line growth.  Ultimately, this transaction provides greater optionality to invest more in the business, while delivering a leading margin profile, and that's an incredibly powerful lever.  And in terms of capital structure, post spin, we will prioritize proceeds towards debt pay down to maintain our investment-grade rating. We're truly excited about this transformational opportunity to increase value for our investors, and we'll continue to provide more details as execution of the spin progresses. To summarize, while the pandemic continued to pressure our growth and earnings profile in the quarter, we made substantial progress on many fronts, including very strong performance versus the market; progress on our efficiency programs that enabled increased investment for growth; free cash flow generation that was ahead of revenue growth; strengthening of our balance sheet through early pay down of debt; integrating our strategic and accretive tuck-in M&A deals; and positioning ourselves to execute the spin-off of our Spine and Dental business as a platform for greater value. I'm truly proud of what the ZB team accomplished in the quarter and throughout 2020. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.\nKeri Mattox : Thanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, a reminder to please limit yourselves to a single question and one follow-up, so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator, may we have the first question please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Company.\nSteven Lichtman: Bryan, as you continue in phase 3, obviously accelerated with today's announcement, I was wondering if you could provide your latest thoughts on capital allocation. Are you still targeting tuck-ins, larger deals? Any color would be helpful. And I have a follow-up on COVID.\nBryan Hanson: Okay. Yes. I'll just briefly answer your first question, and then I'll pass it over to Suky. But yes, our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We do want to look at tuck-in acquisitions that we think would have low dis-synergy risk and we have a right to win in the space. And that's what we're going to continue to do. This does not change that. And Suky, you want to give maybe a little more color just overall -- on the overall capital allocation strategy?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, sure. So we made good progress even in the backdrop of the pandemic in 2020. We're going to continue to make progress in strengthening our balance sheet and creating firepower moving forward. As I said in my earlier remarks, we expect to pay down about $500 million of debt -- of maturing debt this year. And as cash flows improve, as the virus abates throughout 2021, that will increase and expand our opportunity, firepower opportunity for continued tuck-in M&A. So again, consistent with how we talked about previously, first priority is to maintain investment grade, pay down debt, delever. And our second priority from a capital allocation standpoint is to continue to grow that topline and bottom-line through accretive strategic tuck-in M&A, and this now gives us even greater focus through our spin transaction.\nSteven Lichtman : Great. And then just on COVID, where do you think the size of deferred procedures is? I know we've talked about in the past, I know it's a tough number to tee that, obviously. But any comments there would be great as we hopefully see end market conditions improve as the year goes on?\nBryan Hanson : Yes. It's a fantastic question truthfully and one that we track quite a bit and try to estimate. I would just say that without being able to be a fine point to it, it's hundreds of millions of dollars is the way that we view it. And that's what gets us pretty excited about the fact that the end of the pandemic, and our view is on the horizon. And once that occurs, we've got a heck of a backlog that we need to work through. Now the timing of when you work through it, it's based on capacity, capabilities in different markets and those types of things, but we feel it's very sizable, and we're excited to start working through it.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis : Just 2 for me, and I'll start strategically on the spin, Bryan. A lot of times in spins, we create a lot of value through multiple arbitrage between the 2 assets. We even finished our math there. My sense is the multiple spreads won't be that wide here. So the real value creation for Zimmer is sort of to execute your goals or grow faster. So, when you say 50 bps of growth, Bryan, does this get you to 4% to 5% growth faster or are we talking about it's just going to get you to a higher end or higher structural growth rate at some point towards the end of the LRP? And then I have a quick follow-up\u2026\nBryan Hanson : Yes, yes. So for us, when we just think about growth rate, we're kind of sticking to that 4% to 5% that we've been talking about. But what we should look at here is that you should have greater confidence, obviously in our ability to do that and potentially be on the higher end of that range. And so that is a key focus for us. And really the significant value for us is that ability to focus. Remember, we talked before about getting to 4% to 5%. We had a number of variables associated with it. One of those variables, even though we didn't have the same level of investment in these businesses, was that they had to grow at least at the lower end of the market. And over time, if you're not investing appropriately in businesses, there's risk in that. So, we've eliminated that risk as we spin these out, and we've unlocked value for SpinCo because ultimately -- or NewCo because ultimately, they're going to invest more intently in those businesses. So, it provides value in both ways, but go ahead on your second question there.\nDavid Lewis : Sure. And sorry, Bryan, can we think about our confidence which suggests that maybe 4% to 5% growth is possible in the next 2 years? Is it there any faster? And then I'll ask my other question for Suky just real quick. Suky, there\u2019s a lot of focus this call on the USD number. Can you just give us any sense as it relates to the USD number, what was the impact of those strategic deals or bulk purchase deals on the fourth quarter and how does the ROSA contribution in the fourth quarter on a revenue basis look relative to the third quarter?\nBryan Hanson : Suky you could talk, you\u2019re on mute.\nSuky Upadhyay : Yes, thank you, Bryan. So thanks for the question, David. On your first question relative to the year-end and the U.S. number, it's not uncommon at the end of any quarter, especially at the end of the year-end, to see higher sales and some potential timing favorability or headwinds for that matter. In this quarter, we actually saw some incremental uptake in our U.S. business. Again, probably not different than what many others saw across our sector as many accounts were utilizing their year-end budgets to bring in some product. For us, we look at it, it was a modest benefit on the total company. It was in the low-single digits. But again, it was something that was above our normal trend, so we wanted to make sure we called it out. And again, any impact that, that might have into 2021 is reflected in those Q1 estimates that I've already provided. So overall, still a very, very strong quarter for the company versus market, both in knee and hip. Your second question relative to ROSA. We did see a shift in the fourth quarter, especially with those expanded hospital budgets or remaining budgets, I should say, more dollar sales on installments than we've previously seen in Q2 and Q3. But year-over-year, Q4 last year to this year, it was not a major material headwind or tailwind on our overall growth numbers.\nKeri Mattox: Operator, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.\nLarry Keusch: Just wanted to first come back to the spin-off here. I guess, what I'm really curious about is why is now the right time for this spin-off? And along with that why a spin versus the sale? And then I'll come back to the second question.\nBryan Hanson : Yes. So the timing of it is -- it fits right into the phases of where we look at transforming the business. For us, it was sequential. We wanted to make sure that phase 1 in our transformation was in great shape, and it is. Phase 2 would need to be well underway before we want to take something like this on. And I think based on our performance over the last few quarters versus our competitors, it's pretty clear that Phase 2 is working quite well. And now's the time. It's time for active portfolio management. And in a time when we don't have as much capital to work with, this is clearly one of the most significant ways that we can impact and influence the portfolio in a positive way for both companies, I do believe that. So that's the why now. And we're excited about it. We truly are. We're excited about it for our organization, NewCo -- and we're excited about it for NewCo. And we'll be in it together for the next year, 1.5 years and even post that. So that's the margin -- the line now. And we've looked at multiple ways to drive value with these businesses. Just know that this isn't the only option that we've looked at. And just given the number of options on the table, we felt that this was the most significant way that we could drive value for our shareholders and our businesses and our team members. So that's the reason for the spin.\nLarry Keusch : Okay. Very good. And then, Bryan, look, you guys seem to be increasingly well positioned in creating sort of this digital ecosystem in orthopedics. If I think about it, you've got a surgical planning, you've got robotics, you've got mymobility, you've got Persona-IQ. So maybe just talk about how you see the product offering evolving at Zimmer and how the ecosystem can help improve outcomes? And what are you thinking about sort of reimbursement for Persona-IQ from both the implant and the remote monitoring aspect of it?\nBryan Hanson : Yes. So no, I won't get into specifics on reimbursement for Persona-IQ, but we definitely see it as a very important piece of the puzzle when we think about the ecosystem that you're referencing. And I would just say that we're taking it very seriously when we look at ecosystem versus just the typical implant. We've had a significant shift in our research and development dollars towards robotic storage, data infomatics to build that ecosystem that's going to be meaningful for patients and for our customers alike. And I got to say, there's a lot of excitement around that in our organization, a lot of excitement from our customer base as well. And the competency that we've built over the last few years in this area is, in my opinion, second to none. And where we don't have the competency, we've been working with external partners that have pretty significant names like Apple, and you're going to hear more about those coming up as well. So we feel really good about where we are today. And we feel, in my opinion, anyway, that these ecosystems to be able to capture data before, during and after procedure are going to be a significant benefit for patient outcomes. And ultimately, at some point, when we pick up enough data and have the data like available to us, be able to have predictive analytics to be able to make better pure decisions before the surgery occurs. And that's really the intent. So we're very excited about it. We've shifted dramatically research and development in this area, and we feel we're ahead right now versus our competitors.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen : Just 2 financial questions for me, probably both for Suky. So Suky, the margins of the Spine and Dental businesses, how do they compare to the new or current Zimmer? You talked about them being similar to peers, but there are a lot of different peers out there. Can you give us a little bit more color on the margins of those businesses, please? And I have one follow-up.\nSuky Upadhyay : Sure. Good morning, Larry. So the first thing I would say is we\u2019ve provide some color on the pro forma accretion impact on our RemainCo EBITDA and operating margins, which should give you a good initial view as to what the NewCo margins could look like. Just stepping back, overall, both those businesses are, Spine, Dental and our bone healing business, have a gross margin profile that's a little bit below the overall company average. I would say bone healing is actually a little bit above the company average. But really, it comes down to the cost to serve where the spending levels in both those businesses are much higher than the company average, which overall drives the operating margin for both Spine and Dental lower than where ZB HoldCo is from a standalone basis. So as we think about margin opportunity going forward in both those businesses, we do think that there's opportunity to enhance margins. One will come through, we believe, a real opportunity to accelerate top-line growth, which will bring some operating leverage to the business. But there's also opportunity for mix shift and potential efficiency within the existing cost structure. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on how to think about margins in those businesses going forward.\nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And then on 2021, you gave some helpful color on Q1 revenue growth, Suky. Maybe you could talk about sales growth cadence through the year, just any reaction to consensus, which assumes about 2% growth over 2019. I know you don't have guidance out there, but just directionally -- and operating margins. In the past, I think you said they could come close to 2019 but maybe lag a bit. How should we be thinking about that for full year 2021?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Yes, absolutely. So first, on revenue, why we're not providing guidance is because there are a number of variables that are just really difficult to predict at this time with any level of credibility or confidence. The first being where is the trough in this most recent surge that we're seeing. January, February, where does it land in Q1? What does that uptake look like post adoption of vaccine. And then when do you ultimately return to normalized market growth and potential tailwind from the deferred procedures. So we're running a number of scenarios. There are some scenarios where absolutely we could see a path to growth versus 2019. But again, those variables are, at this point, just too uncertain. But clearly, I think just stepping back, once we do have adoption -- wide adoption of that vaccine, which we believe will have at some point in 2021, we think that there's a real opportunity for some strong growth, again, once we return to normalized market and are augmented by that tailwind. But it's just too difficult to say what our cadence looks like at this time. Regarding margins, you're absolutely right. As the margins or revenue continues to improve throughout the year, which we believe it will, once we have good uptake with the vaccine, the margins should follow. There may be a slight lag, consistent with how we've talked about things before as we catch up on certain investments. But make no mistake, they will expand, and we do see the opportunity for significant margin expansion over time as we normalize our revenue uptake.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs.\nAmit Hazan : I wanted to start on the U.S. market for knees and hips. And obviously, with the dollars, there's a lot of noise as you mentioned. So just from an underlying basis, I'm wondering what you think about market share -- what you think what happened to market share in the fourth quarter for you in both knees and hips in the U.S. from a volume perspective?\nBryan Hanson : Yes. Yes. So what I would say is, I try not to look at any specific quarter and draw too much of a conclusion. I would now -- saying that I'd much rather have what we just saw in the fourth quarter, where we're significantly above-market growth that always feels good. But instead, more look at a trend. And if I just go back, let's call it, 3 quarters, that gives you more of a sense of how we're doing versus market. And if I think about U.S., which is probably the cleanest way to look at this because there's a lot of noise in the mix and everything else that people may have outside of the U.S., but we just look at U.S. and we're somewhere in the neighborhood, just think about large joints, 500 to 600 basis points over the last 3 quarters above market, above our key competitors. Knees is a little better than hips, but we're seeing outperformance in both. Knees probably more 600 basis points to 700 basis points and hips, more like 500 basis points to 600 basis points better. So that's what I look at. Not a single quarter, but a combination of quarters and where we're seeing that trend. And by the way, I fully expect us to continue that trend. And I talked about the innovation that is going to be pretty pivotal this year in both hips and knees with the current momentum that we already have, with the commercial prowess that we have as an organization, and that innovation is still yet to come, and our confidence level is pretty high.\nAmit Hazan : And I just wanted a follow-up -- focus on R&D. And as we look at just the absolute number this year, I was on that you haven't spent this little on R&D in several years. It's down 15% for the year. And that kind of separates you from other companies in medtech, and like that medtech and clinical. I'm wondering if you can give some color to where you've made the cuts, how you're prioritizing that budget, and how that impacts your future product cadence?\nBryan Hanson : Would I like too much to run a business? It's, first and foremost, always assessing how are you spending research and development dollars and then making mix shift spend to make sure that you're spending it wisely. And so that's why you saw -- you're not seeing research and development increase. You saw some slight compression there. But it really was just to get straight on what are we going to spend our dollars on. And we killed a lot of projects that just didn't have returns that we expected. And that's the cleanup, if you will. What you're going to see from here, though, is an increase, for sure, in research and development. I always want to make sure that we're spending money wisely before we say whether we're spending enough or too little or do we need to spend more. We have a real good deal now for what we should be spending money on, that we're spending money in a disciplined fashion, and we have a lot of things in the bulk in now that we want to turn on. So as we look forward, you should expect to see increased spend in research and development, but increased spend in a very disciplined way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: I'll just state my 2 questions upfront in the interest of time. So the first one is just to come back to something people have been asking about already, but I was wondering if we could get just a little bit of a better sense for the impact of the bulk orders that you're calling out on Q4, specifically on U.S. hips and U.S. knees. And again, the reason I ask is that your hip and knee growth in the U.S. is so materially above what we're seeing from peers. And the gap was just very, very wide this quarter. So any sense as to the quantification on U.S. hips and U.S. knees in those bulk orders would be great? And then on the second question, which is on the spin announcement, Bryan. I mean, I don't think it's unfair to say that Spine and Dental are 2 relatively subscale businesses with not a lot of synergies between them. So I guess my question is, why not sell them to the folks with scale? It just seems like that will be a lot cleaner. So would love your take on that.\nBryan Hanson : Yes. So first of all, on the quarter itself, again, we feel great about our quarter performance. And I would say that when you're looking at this year, in COVID, in particular, there was a lot of money that folks had to spend, and we always see in the fourth quarter, we've seen purchases that occur. We see it every quarter, but fourth quarter, in particular. So it's not abnormal to see as Suky referenced before. If I was going to try to put a number to it, I'd say maybe in the 200 basis points to 300 basis points of benefit that we saw, if you're thinking about large joints. So it was important for us in a normal quarter given this quarter differential between us and competitors, not as material. And I would be surprised, quite frankly, if others didn't see the same thing. But either way, that's -- we just want to make sure we call it out as being transparent as we possibly can. And that was the order of magnitude that we saw in the quarter. As far as the spin and having both Dental and Spine together, if you're going to spin a business, you want to make sure that it has a reasonable amount of scale, obviously, for it to be a viable publicly traded company. We feel that $1 billion-plus is kind of that number. Although there's not obvious reasons that you would look at from a strategic standpoint that those businesses would be together from a commercial perspective, there is a lot of capability and know-how and materials that are used for implants across Dental as well as Spine that there is some value in. And so it was really more around the idea of scale and the importance of that scale and utilizing those competencies, if you will, on those raw materials that go across those 2 businesses. And that was the reason why we spun both together.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch : So as you think about spinning this out in the next 18 months, what do you need to prepare? And does it accelerate tuck-in acquisitions or anything in terms of spending so that the next company heads into its stand-up phase in a good position?\nBryan Hanson : Yes. I would say it's generally business as usual for most of the organizations. We're going to continue to focus where we have. We've got pretty good separation between businesses. So it's not going to be highly disruptive. There's a lot of work to be done. Don't get me wrong for this thing to occur and to occur as effectively as we wanted to. But it's not going to be disruptive to the 2 organizations because they're pretty again separated today. But yes, we're actually increasing, not a significant amount, but increasing spend in these businesses to get them a good tailwind coming into the spin itself. And if there was small opportunities for us to spend capital over the next 12 months, that would make sense to again, to bolster that portfolio, we would certainly consider it in the same way that we would have beforehand. But we want to make sure that we're setting up NewCo to the first success. And we're very close on a CEO to bring in, and that person will bring leadership right out of the gate. And so that's really the way we're looking at it. If we can give them a little more money to spend to get things going, that's what we're going to do here in 2021. And if, again, very small deals, but if there were things that we could do to, again, bolster their portfolio, we'd do that as well.\nJoanne Wuensch : And a quick follow-up question for Suky. How do you think about us modeling over the coming quarters in terms of sequential improvement, starting with the fourth quarter commentary?\nSuky Upadhyay: So Joanne, as I said, it's difficult to predict at this point until we start to see a little bit more stabilization in our -- some of our key or larger markets. If you go back to last year, we're hopeful that this is a 1 to 2-month trough, and we begin to see a V-shaped recovery as we did last year within Q2, leading into Q3. If that happens into Q2, and we start to see stabilization of market growth in the back end of the year and then potentially that tailwind that we've been talking about with preferred patients, that could present a nice trajectory for us and one of those pathways to potential growth for this year. But it really is just too early to tell. As we\u2019ve done over 2020, we will keep you updated as we learn more and as we understand how this impacts our business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.\nChris Pasquale : First one from me, just hoping you can give us any more clarity on the timing of the new ROSA Knee and Hip applications. I think I heard you say late '21 for hips. Just trying to get a sense for whether either of those can really have an impact this year?\nBryan Hanson : Yes, we think both will have an impact this year. Obviously, the U Knee will be first -- will be in the first half of the year. That's one that we are very excited about. We have a significant share of the U Knee market, and we're excited to be able to bring robotics to that market. And then hip will be second half of the year. And even though second half, we still believe it will have an opportunity for us to be the hit number in the back half of the year.\nChris Pasquale : Great. That's helpful. And then can you talk a little bit more about the performance at ASC and how you see those individual positions heading into '21? I'm curious whether there's any notable differences between them in terms of how you finish the year and whether you're seeing any opportunities within extremities, in particular, to take advantage of some of the disruption in that market?\nBryan Hanson : Yes. I mean, for us, obviously, S.E.T is not all created equal. We talked about sports and extremities as being key focus. Upper extremities is the here and the now. Lower extremities would be more in the future. In sports, is the here and the now with the recent acquisition that we did to tuck-in -- to fill in some product gaps that we have. But we feel good about all 3 of those areas. And our ASC presence, again, with the tuck-in acquisition that we recently did to give us more scale in the ASC and the contracting team that we put into place, was not as fulsome yet as hip or knee, but it's getting there pretty quick. So our confidence level is high that we're going to see the growth rate that we need in S.E.T, and it's going to be driven by sports, it's going to be driven by extremities, and it's going to be driven by our presence in the ASC.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose : So I'll ask my -- both of my upfront. First is, Bryan, you talked a lot about data and the ecosystem -- connected ecosystem. Can you kind of just help us understand how that translates relative to revenues or driving lower cost? I mean, you changed the commercial model? Does it help you develop better technologies? And these have good long-term outcomes. But I'm just trying to understand how this drives incremental growth longer term. And then, obviously, you're having great success with ROSA in robot placements. Help us understand maybe utilization there and then maybe any benefits you're seeing with respect to price and mix on the actual implant side?\nBryan Hanson : Yes. If you think about it, we're trying to attack is the fact that 20% of patients in the knee right now are still not satisfied with the outcome that they have. That's a pretty significant number. And we truly do believe that the ecosystem is going to be able to help resolve that disappointment in any procedure. And that's good for everybody, by the way. As we move down this path, we make those outcomes at better as a result of capturing the data and then making different decisions as a result of the data, that's going to allow us to get better outcomes. And when that occurs, you're going to have more patients get bold enough to move into the funnel because it's underserved today. There are patients that need a knee procedure that are afraid of the outcome, are not competent as a result of it, and they're not entering the funnel. So as we can change that outcome, and we believe we can, then we're going to have more people into the funnel, and let's get to the entire market. That's the way we're thinking about data and informatics and driving better outcomes over time. As far as ROSA goes, I'll tell you, I'm excited. We've got one application in our robotic system. I think that's what people -- remind people of just one application, there's 2 more coming this year, but there's one right now. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we were at the higher end of our placement goal in 2020. But what I would tell you is that in reality, we were above that number. When I say higher end, I actually meant above 300. And the quarter was significant. And I think this is really important. We placed over 115 units in the fourth quarter, which was just an outstanding performance by the team. And what I love about that is that happened in concert with one of our other players in the marketplace, one of our competitors also having a record quarter in the fourth quarter. And that's good news because that tells you that orthopedics is open for robotics -- wide open for robotics. And that tells you that you've got an opportunity for all boats to rise as a result. So we truly do believe that the market is accepting of robotics, it's moving quickly, it's hitting the pivot point, and it's going to be very accepting, we believe, as well of the data and informatics that can come with it.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. And if I could just build on what Bryan said, it was a question earlier about the strength of our U.S. number in recon and yes, absolutely, we had some benefits due to timing. But one of the great things about some of that benefit that we saw is really -- it came because of some stocking because of new accounts and account conversion. And I think that's yet another proof point of the strength that we're seeing in our commercial execution and with our new products. So we had a really strong quarter, no doubt in the U.S. We'll continue to see momentum for all the products that Bryan mentioned earlier. And that just actually accelerated in the fourth quarter. And now we've shown it consistently for a few quarters. So we're pretty excited about where this is leading into 2021 and even more excited about where that potential is through recovery and post recovery.\nKeri Mattox : I think we have time for maybe one last question before we hit the 9:30 time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kaila Krum with Truist Securities.\nKaila Krum : Just 2 quick ones on portfolio management. I mean, it sounds like you'll continue to do tuck-ins. But I mean, first, is it fair to say you'll now focus on these core areas in orthopedics? And then second, I'm curious, do you think that a different portfolio of buying products with greater scale can be more synergistic with your ortho business? Or do you simply think that there are limited synergies between the spine and ortho markets overall?\nBryan Hanson : Yes. So our strategy around M&A and how we would spend capital dollars to augment the portfolio is unchanged. There are certain categories that we've talked about in the past where we believe we have a right to win, that we have a brand recognition that gives us that right to win, and there's a path for leadership as a result of that. And they're profitable. And those are really the main things we're focused on. How do we enter into spaces, build scale in faster growth markets, where we have a right to win, and we have a path to leadership and the profitable businesses. And that wasn't the case for us for Spine. But it doesn't mean that Spine can't be a very attractive business. It's just not one that we would invest in to become a leader because there's other opportunities for us to spend in sports or extremities or thoracic that are just more attractive markets and more profitable. So we would look at these as being better as a result of that as separate businesses versus a part of our portfolio. And I don't believe -- and we certainly haven't seen that there's a real benefit in having even a fulsome spine business in concert with large joints or S.E.T. We just don't see a lot of contracting -- large contracts that pull-through either one of those businesses.\nKeri Mattox: Great. I think that takes us to 9:30. We'd like to thank everyone for joining us on this morning's call. Of course, the IR team, and -- of course, the team will be available today if there are any further questions. I'm sure we'll be talking to all of you. Thanks so much and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you again, for participating in today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into the details, I'd like to summarize the quarter as one where we made significant progress across a number of strategic and operational fronts, all in the backdrop of heightened market pressure. While revenue and profitability were challenged due to the pandemic, we executed extremely well against the things we can control, positioning ourselves to win through eventual market recovery and beyond. Now for this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 2 topics. First, our Q4 results, including commentary on the COVID impact and what we're seeing so far in Q1; and second, how ZB is positioned for long-term growth, specifically, how we believe the spin-off transaction we announced this morning is expected to impact us post execution. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $2.085 billion, a reported decrease of 1.9% and a constant currency decrease of 3.7% versus 2019. But we did not experience any material day rate differences in our year-over-year comparisons. Our consolidated regional results were in line with expectations despite deepening pandemic pressure on global elective procedures as we exited the year. While the market softened through the quarter, execution remained strong across all regions. Beginning with Asia Pacific, the region grew 2% versus Q4 2019 with growth across all 3 of our largest markets of Japan, China and Australia, New Zealand. While COVID pressure on elective procedures increased towards the end of the quarter, the impact is less pronounced than what we are seeing in EMEA and the Americas. We are excited about the uptake we're seeing in ROSA in the region and with the solid performance across our knee and hip businesses. As expected, the EMEA region was hardest hit by COVID-19, decreasing 17.5% versus 2019, with all sub-regions in decline. Surges in the virus leading to policy actions and government lockdowns negatively impacted elective procedures across the region. Lastly, the Americas region was about flat, decreasing 0.3% compared to 2019, driven by continued COVID headwinds in Latin America, in tandem with a softening U.S. market. The U.S. was flat despite increased pressure on elective procedures. Performance was buoyed by continued strong demand for recent innovative product introductions, strong execution by our commercial organization and some favorable impact related to the order timing and year-end purchases, as some accounts increased their buying patterns to utilize remaining 2020 budgets. Turning to our business performance for Q4. The global knee business declined 4.8%, negatively impacted by the ongoing pressures in EMEA. However, the U.S. knee business continued to grow, increasing 1.8%, and Asia Pacific knee business returned to growth increasing 2.9%. Overall, execution was strong with continued momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee. Our global hip business decreased 3.4%, again, driven by declines in EMEA. Both U.S. hips and APAC hips continued their growth trends, increasing 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively. Sports, extremity and trauma sales declined 3.3%. Dental, Spine and CMFT continued to deliver better execution, increasing 0.8%. And finally, our other category was down 9.3%. Moving to the P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.59 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.11. Additional details on our GAAP results can be viewed in our press release issued this morning. On an adjusted basis, with revenue down 3.7%, EPS was down about 10%, driven by a lower operating margin and a higher share count, which more than offset the favorable tax rate in the quarter. Lower adjusted operating margin was driven by lower revenue and an expected year-over-year decline in gross margins. Adjusted gross margin was 71.3%, sequentially better than Q3 but lower than Q4 2019. Versus the prior year, favorable geographic mix was more than offset by lower volumes, ongoing pricing pressure and the impact from prior period deferred costs. OpEx was down versus the prior year as we implemented several cost containment initiatives as part of our response to the pandemic, in addition to the realization of our transformation programs that were ultimately reinvested back into R&D and commercial infrastructure to help drive consistent above-market growth in priority areas. Based on our performance versus market over the recent quarters, our reinvestment of efficiency savings is translating into strong returns. The Q4 adjusted tax rate of 15% was better than the previous year due to geographic mix of income and certain discrete benefits in the quarter related to recent audit settlements. Turning to cash and liquidity in the quarter. Free cash flow totaled $329 million, higher than the same period in 2019, driven by better working capital and lower capital expenditures. And we utilized better-than-expected cash flow to pay down $250 million of debt ahead of schedule, ending the year with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $800 million. Now moving to 2021. Due to the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on elective procedures, we will not be providing full year financial guidance at this time. We recognize that this is challenging for you as you build your '21 models. However, we will reserve financial guidance until we have more certainty around the outlook of elective procedures relative to COVID surges, and related vaccine adoption. We strive to be credible and transparent. And to that end, I will provide additional quarterly details and broader full year shaping as an interim measure. So far through January, we've seen COVID pressure continuing to intensify from the end of December. Based on what we've seen so far in the quarter and in tandem with our latest estimates for procedure cadence, we project that Q1 revenue will be down in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit percentage range versus Q1 2020. Now we have optimism and confidence that we'll see a positive vaccine impact on elective procedures this year. And once we do, we expect elective procedure volumes to return to pre-pandemic levels and the sizable patient backlog to serve as a tailwind to underlying market growth. As we turn to the P&L, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on sales volume will put pressure on adjusted operating margins and earnings leverage until we return to consistent pre-COVID revenue levels and growth rates, as I just discussed. Despite this near-term pressure, our confidence in the market recovery and the longer-term financial profile of the company is driving continued investment into priority areas of the business. We expect that adjusted gross margin will stabilize in 2021, with quarterly margin levels broadly in line with what we saw in the back half of 2020. We could see some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter depending on a number of variables, including volumes, price, foreign currency, mix and other drivers that can change results over time. Regarding operating expenses. Sequentially versus the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect non-commission spending in Q1 to be modestly lower with increases in future quarters' OpEx investments as the impact of the pandemic abates. We expect interest expense to increase in the mid-single-digit versus 2020, as the benefit from lower debt balances is more than offset by the renewal of net investment hedge positions. Our tax rate is expected to be modestly higher than the full year 2020 rate and could fluctuate over the year as a result of variability in geographic mix of income due to the pandemic. Also, we are not projecting any material U.S. corporate tax reform to be implemented in 2021. We project that the full year share count in 2021 will continue to increase modestly versus Q4 2020, and we are not planning for any share buybacks in the year. And in terms of capital allocation, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and are planning to pay down an additional $500 million of debt in 2021. Now let's turn to today's announcement related to our intent to spin the Spine and Dental businesses into an independent publicly traded company. The transaction will be structures of tax redistribution of newly issued NewCo shares to ZB shareholders. As Bryan mentioned, we believe that this tax-efficient transaction, which is expected to close in mid-2022, subject to certain conditions, will drive greater focus for each company with an enhanced prioritization of capital allocation, while accelerating growth and providing the platform for greater shareholder value. In terms of the NewCo financial profile, 2019 and 2020 pro forma revenues totaled approximately $1.022 billion and $897 million, respectively, and is supported by a diversified geographic base with real opportunities for enhanced growth and margin expansion. We expect NewCo to have a financial profile generally in line with its peer group and a capital structure supportive of innovation and investment over time. Importantly, the transaction will empower NewCo to pursue a more focused investment and execution strategy. ZB delivered 2019 and 2020 pro forma revenue of $6.96 billion and $6.128 billion, respectively. For post-spin ZB, the transaction is expected to deliver an improved growth profile with accretion to our revenue growth of approximately 50 basis points over the course of our 5-year strategic planning period. We also expect that it will expand our adjusted EBITDA and operating margins on a pro forma basis by approximately 125 basis points. With that, you should have even greater confidence in our operating margin expansion goals. We remain committed to at least 30% adjusted operating margins by the end of 2023. And with this transaction, we have the opportunity to accelerate the timing of that goal. However, we will continue to balance margin acceleration against investment opportunities to accelerate durable top-line growth.  Ultimately, this transaction provides greater optionality to invest more in the business, while delivering a leading margin profile, and that's an incredibly powerful lever.  And in terms of capital structure, post spin, we will prioritize proceeds towards debt pay down to maintain our investment-grade rating. We're truly excited about this transformational opportunity to increase value for our investors, and we'll continue to provide more details as execution of the spin progresses. To summarize, while the pandemic continued to pressure our growth and earnings profile in the quarter, we made substantial progress on many fronts, including very strong performance versus the market; progress on our efficiency programs that enabled increased investment for growth; free cash flow generation that was ahead of revenue growth; strengthening of our balance sheet through early pay down of debt; integrating our strategic and accretive tuck-in M&A deals; and positioning ourselves to execute the spin-off of our Spine and Dental business as a platform for greater value. I'm truly proud of what the ZB team accomplished in the quarter and throughout 2020. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. Yes, sure. So we made good progress even in the backdrop of the pandemic in 2020. We're going to continue to make progress in strengthening our balance sheet and creating firepower moving forward. As I said in my earlier remarks, we expect to pay down about $500 million of debt -- of maturing debt this year. And as cash flows improve, as the virus abates throughout 2021, that will increase and expand our opportunity, firepower opportunity for continued tuck-in M&A. So again, consistent with how we talked about previously, first priority is to maintain investment grade, pay down debt, delever. And our second priority from a capital allocation standpoint is to continue to grow that topline and bottom-line through accretive strategic tuck-in M&A, and this now gives us even greater focus through our spin transaction. Yes, thank you, Bryan. So thanks for the question, David. On your first question relative to the year-end and the U.S. number, it's not uncommon at the end of any quarter, especially at the end of the year-end, to see higher sales and some potential timing favorability or headwinds for that matter. In this quarter, we actually saw some incremental uptake in our U.S. business. Again, probably not different than what many others saw across our sector as many accounts were utilizing their year-end budgets to bring in some product. For us, we look at it, it was a modest benefit on the total company. It was in the low-single digits. But again, it was something that was above our normal trend, so we wanted to make sure we called it out. And again, any impact that, that might have into 2021 is reflected in those Q1 estimates that I've already provided. So overall, still a very, very strong quarter for the company versus market, both in knee and hip. Your second question relative to ROSA. We did see a shift in the fourth quarter, especially with those expanded hospital budgets or remaining budgets, I should say, more dollar sales on installments than we've previously seen in Q2 and Q3. But year-over-year, Q4 last year to this year, it was not a major material headwind or tailwind on our overall growth numbers. Sure. Good morning, Larry. So the first thing I would say is we've provide some color on the pro forma accretion impact on our RemainCo EBITDA and operating margins, which should give you a good initial view as to what the NewCo margins could look like. Just stepping back, overall, both those businesses are, Spine, Dental and our bone healing business, have a gross margin profile that's a little bit below the overall company average. I would say bone healing is actually a little bit above the company average. But really, it comes down to the cost to serve where the spending levels in both those businesses are much higher than the company average, which overall drives the operating margin for both Spine and Dental lower than where ZB HoldCo is from a standalone basis. So as we think about margin opportunity going forward in both those businesses, we do think that there's opportunity to enhance margins. One will come through, we believe, a real opportunity to accelerate top-line growth, which will bring some operating leverage to the business. But there's also opportunity for mix shift and potential efficiency within the existing cost structure. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color on how to think about margins in those businesses going forward. Yes. Yes, absolutely. So first, on revenue, why we're not providing guidance is because there are a number of variables that are just really difficult to predict at this time with any level of credibility or confidence. The first being where is the trough in this most recent surge that we're seeing. January, February, where does it land in Q1? What does that uptake look like post adoption of vaccine. And then when do you ultimately return to normalized market growth and potential tailwind from the deferred procedures. So we're running a number of scenarios. There are some scenarios where absolutely we could see a path to growth versus 2019. But again, those variables are, at this point, just too uncertain. But clearly, I think just stepping back, once we do have adoption -- wide adoption of that vaccine, which we believe will have at some point in 2021, we think that there's a real opportunity for some strong growth, again, once we return to normalized market and are augmented by that tailwind. But it's just too difficult to say what our cadence looks like at this time. Regarding margins, you're absolutely right. As the margins or revenue continues to improve throughout the year, which we believe it will, once we have good uptake with the vaccine, the margins should follow. There may be a slight lag, consistent with how we've talked about things before as we catch up on certain investments. But make no mistake, they will expand, and we do see the opportunity for significant margin expansion over time as we normalize our revenue uptake. So Joanne, as I said, it's difficult to predict at this point until we start to see a little bit more stabilization in our -- some of our key or larger markets. If you go back to last year, we're hopeful that this is a 1 to 2-month trough, and we begin to see a V-shaped recovery as we did last year within Q2, leading into Q3. If that happens into Q2, and we start to see stabilization of market growth in the back end of the year and then potentially that tailwind that we've been talking about with preferred patients, that could present a nice trajectory for us and one of those pathways to potential growth for this year. But it really is just too early to tell. As we've done over 2020, we will keep you updated as we learn more and as we understand how this impacts our business. Yes. And if I could just build on what Bryan said, it was a question earlier about the strength of our U.S. number in recon and yes, absolutely, we had some benefits due to timing. But one of the great things about some of that benefit that we saw is really -- it came because of some stocking because of new accounts and account conversion. And I think that's yet another proof point of the strength that we're seeing in our commercial execution and with our new products. So we had a really strong quarter, no doubt in the U.S. We'll continue to see momentum for all the products that Bryan mentioned earlier. And that just actually accelerated in the fourth quarter. And now we've shown it consistently for a few quarters. So we're pretty excited about where this is leading into 2021 and even more excited about where that potential is through recovery and post recovery."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "All right. Great. Thanks, Keri. And also I want to say just thanks to everyone for joining us on the call here this morning. As you saw from our announcements earlier today, we clearly have a few updates that we want to fill you in on and I'm looking forward to a very productive call this morning. Just given the backdrop of COVID, let me just start by saying that I certainly hope that all of you are doing well and staying safe. And continuing to, as much as it's frustrating, I'm sure by now, continuing to social distance and wear your masks. I think, at this point, we're all pretty good at it. So let's make sure that we continue to do it. And to all of the ZB team members joining the call this morning and who are listening at a later time, I just want to let you know I'm thinking about you as well. I just want to say thanks. Thanks for everything that you do and have done and will do actually to continue to follow our protocols, to keep yourself safe, obviously, but also our teammates safe. And as a result of that, continue to deliver for our customers and our patients and move our mission forward. And I just continue to be very proud of everything this team has accomplished against a significantly challenging backdrop in 2020. So, I'm proud of you, I'm glad to see what you've been able to do, and I'm looking forward to what you're going to do in 2021. And here we are, right? We're in 2021. And there's going to be challenges and we've seen already early on in 2021, but I'm confident that we're ready to deal with the challenges as we do, and I'm pretty confident that we're going to see some real opportunities for 2021 as well. And there's just a lot of updates that I want to share with you today, but I'm going to keep my comments to a minimum, if possible. I really want to make sure that we have time for Suky to get into a little more detail on Q4 and then ultimately say how that's going to translate into 2021. Now we're not going to give too many specifics on 2021, but he'll give you some color on what we're seeing from Q4 and again, the impact we think that's going to have on 2021. And I want to make sure that we leave time for questions as well, okay, so for today, I'm just going to kind of keep it to 3 main topics. The first is really how we're continuing to navigate COVID-19 and to continue inside of that to ensure that we're executing against our strategy. The second one is really going to talk about the ongoing transformation of the company. We really are making sure that we're moving forward with active portfolio management. And obviously, we're taking the next steps there with the planned spin-off of our Spine and Dental business. So, we'll talk a bit about that, and then third, I want to make sure that we, again, touch upon our long-term growth strategy and how it positions us to drive growth, obviously as a company, but also value for you and value for us. And so, let's start again, navigating the challenges and executing here in the short term. There's just no doubt that COVID, unfortunately, remains a challenge. Coming out of Q4, we're seeing the pandemic pressure and the surges continue, and frankly worsen across pretty much all of our regions and markets. There's clearly more lockdown measures that we're seeing throughout Europe, Middle East, and Africa, to a far lesser extent, but still impacting Asia Pacific as well. And certainly, in the Americas, we're all seeing it in the U.S. May be different by state, but we're clearly seeing increased pressure as a result of surges in the pandemic. So, all of that is kind of the backdrop that we saw coming out of Q4.  Unfortunately, this pressure in the corresponding decline in elective procedures grew throughout Q4 and actually was worse at the end of December. And at this point, we expect that increase in pressure will continue throughout Q1, at least and will impact all 3 of our regions. As a matter of fact, we're actually seeing this probably increase in pressure coming out of Q4. So, we would expect Q1 to be a little more challenging than even what we saw in Q4. But even given that backdrop, I'd say that I'm optimistic. Sounds crazy to just say what I said, but say that I'm also optimistic, but [indiscernible] the approved vaccines. We're currently rolling those out around the world. We do believe the vaccines are going to change the COVID-19 dynamic, and we're going to see positive impact as a result of it. As soon as we start to see the surges stop, we see the impact of COVID end. And we're confident that the recovery is going to mean that the normal patient flow is going to start again, and we're going to have the pull-through effect of a sizable patient backlog that's been created over the past number of quarters. We expect that when that recovery occurs, we're going to see a period of what I would define as normal market growth augmented by deferred procedures that will be coming in as well. And we're going to be ready for that. And we're excited about that.  So as much as it's going to be a little rocky in the short-term and potentially more challenging than what we saw in the fourth quarter, we see a light at the end of the tunnel, and that's a good thing. The big question is when? When is that going to happen? We know the vaccine is going to have the impact. The big question is when. And that's certainly going to be the key variable we're going to be looking at as we try to predict where 2021 is going to look like. So while I would just say, against this backdrop of COVID, what is clear to us is we can't control when the vaccines allow the surges to stop, but what we can control inside of that is how we execute our strategy. And I have confidence we're going to continue to move forward. Our core business is strong. Our execution is on point. I would just say momentum around our key commercial launches and programs continues to be strong. And I would say that overall, our commercial confidence is better than it has ever been. So let's give a few examples of this. I can say it all day long, but once we talk about it and actually, it reflects in the numbers, who cares. So let's first start with ROSA Knee. Obviously, this is something that everyone's going to be paying attention to. Certainly, I am. And I know we said we're going to hit between 200 to 300 cumulative placements by the end of 2020. Obviously, you know that we are in that range as of Q3. So I'm happy to report that, not only did we achieve that goal, we achieved the high end of that goal. And I would tell you that the momentum is strong coming into 2021. Q4 was actually our strongest quarter as of the date of launch of ROSA Knee. So we had some pretty strong quarters in the past, Q4 was our best, and we were on the high end of the goal that we set for the year. And as I've said before, with some of the new launches that we have coming, specifically associated with the knee, I feel pretty confident that 2021 is going to continue to show that kind of resilience and strength for ROSA Knee. On the Persona Revision side, again, this product continues to be very successful for us. We now show that in Q4, we actually had the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth that we've seen since launch. We did realize our 2020 expectations of $100 million in gross revenue and almost $40 million in net of cannibalization revenue during the year. And I would just tell you that that's just the beginning because Persona Revision serves as a really compelling tip of the spear product for our commercial team. Once we get Persona Revision in, we've got an opportunity to hunt for the typical primary knee as well. So we're very excited about that launch, and it continues to be strong. On the hip side, Avenir Complete continues to be a strong one for us. Even in the pandemic, it continues to beat our expectations. And if I just look at Q4 specifically, we grew about 30% over Q3, again, even with the increased pressures of the pandemic in Q4. So very excited with what we're able to do with Avenir Complete, and we expect big things to continue with this product throughout 2021. And as you obviously know, we also expect at the end of 2021 to launch the ROSA Hip which, again, gives us a lot of confidence in the hip category for our business. And then finally, for Signature ONE Planner, we demonstrated, again, strong sequential growth with registrations up nearly 25% in Q4 over Q3, and we expect utilization to continue to expand significantly in 2021 with really a goal of having more than 50% of our shoulder procedures using presurgical planning. And that's important for a lot of reasons. Remember, the presurgical planning creates stickiness with the customer. But it also enhances our ability to get more guides and to augment using the procedure, which can really take up the ASP for that procedure. So again, exciting stuff with Signature ONE Planner as well. And so all in, we continue to execute -- we continue to execute as a team. The way we're showing up every day, the way we're showing up in the market, frankly, versus our peers, gives me confidence in our business as does our continued innovation and our product launches. But we're going to see more this year, some pretty pivotal innovation that we're going to see this year. As I mentioned before, we're going to see what ROSA Partial Knee, we're going to see ROSA Hip. And we're also going to see the first smart implant, Persona-IQ, launched this year. So definitely exciting for us from an innovation standpoint in 2021. And yes, that leads me to really my second topic this morning. We continue the transformation of ZB. That's been the goal since I got here. You've heard me talk about our 3 phases of transformation. First was the hearts and minds and the execution challenges that we had in the very beginning. That's what we talked about a lot in the beginning. The second phase of this was really doing a more robust, longer-term strategy, making sure that we brought innovation to the market and getting our execution straight. We're clearly well into that phase. And third is our portfolio transformation. And that's the goal of active portfolio management to change the complexion of the organization, so that we can have better goal of sustaining the mid-single-digit growth. And I'm proud to say that we're squarely positioned in phase 3 now as well. And as you've seen by our recent announcement, we're going to continue to move this forward. We have the portfolio management strategy and the process in place and have built a pretty strong capability to move us forward in this area. Late last year, we executed a number of smaller but still important M&A deals to fill portfolio gaps and to better position us in higher growth areas that we do believe we have a right to win in. And just this morning, we announced our intent to spin-off our Spine and Dental businesses. Ultimately creating, we believe, 2 independent, publicly traded companies, both Zimmer Biomet and the new company called NewCo that are going to be better positioned, separate. I truly believe, by separating out these businesses, we're going to create 2 stronger companies. 2 companies that are going to be better positioned to meet customer needs and improve patient lives, and ultimately, and very importantly, deliver greater value to you, our shareholders. And let me give you a bit more detail on why we believe this is an opportunity for value creation and really why we think it delivers value for both the ZB and NewCo. First of all, the transaction increases our management focus and resource prioritization. We truly do believe for both companies. We think about NewCo, and we think it's going to thrive as an independent company with prioritized capital allocation to pursue strategies and growth opportunities and through the investments inside of Spine and Dental that has not been a focus for ZB. It will absolutely be a focus for NewCo. And for Zimmer Biomet, the transaction is an important next step in our transition into a more streamlined company with sharper focus in greater and more optimized resource allocation towards innovation in those core businesses that we are committed to, that are profitable for us, where we see attractive markets with a right to win in those markets and be market leaders. And really, the second thing is it's going to drive increased growth and efficiency for both companies. We really do believe that. Simply put, we expect that these 2 companies, with their simplified operating models and just reduced complexity and increased focus, we'll be able to grow revenue, margin and earnings per share faster than they would if we remain combined as one company. And Suky is going to talk more about the specific financial impact that we expect in just a few minutes, but just note, it's positive for both organizations, financially speaking, as we separate the organizations. And third, it's going to enhance value creation for our patients, our providers and all of our key stakeholders, including our own team members. This is the next step in ZB's transformation, and it underscores our commitment to ensuring long-term priorities remain aligned with shareholders' best interest. It's going drive the business forward to meet customer needs and advance our mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life of people around the world. We think we can do it better as 2 separate organizations. Okay. So that's the backdrop of the spin. And today, obviously, it's just day 1 in terms of announcements around this process. You can absolutely expect that we're going to continue to provide updates as we move forward, as NewCo takes shape and as we move towards the transaction close, which we're currently expecting to be around mid-2022. Okay. So we're confident in the steps we're taking and our ability to keep executing and in our overall ZB strategy. And that brings me really to the third and really the final topic that I have for these remarks, and it's our plan to drive long-term growth. And ultimately, as a result of that, deliver increased value for you. And to do that, we remain fully committed and confident in ZB's long-term growth and margin expansion expectations. In fact, the spin-off transaction that we're going to do over the next year serves to de-risk, if not accelerate, our path to that 4% to 5% growth rate we've talked about and our 30% operating margin profile by the end of 2023. And to get there, to be able to deliver on both of those, we're going to have to be committed to our priority growth areas, and we've talked about these in the past, but I'm going to remind you of them again. The key area of concentration for us would be knees, hips and S.E.T. If we think about knees first and foremost, we need to be able to grow above market rates here. And we're going to continue to focus on the fastest growth submarkets of knees. For us, that's going to be robotics, data and informatics, cementless and revision. We feel we have plenty of innovation and momentum here to continue to grow sustainably above market rates in knee. From a hip perspective, it's a little less ambitious in the beginning. We just said that we need to grow at market in the short-term, with the idea that over the long-term, particularly after ROSA Hip is launched, that we would grow above market in hip as well. And I can tell you based on our performance so far, the ROSA Hip application being launched later in 2021 and the Avenir Complete momentum that we have, we feel confident we're going to be able to do that as well. And as far as that goes, we just want to grow at market, if not the higher end of market. And to do that, we're going to focus on the most attractive sub-element of S.E.T for us and that's, for us, again, going to be sports, medicine and extremities. Those are key areas of concentration for us that we're going to invest internally. We're going to look for external ways to build scale, and we're going to build commercial infrastructure as well, right? It's only closed by saying that I continue to be more confident about ZB's future than ever. I know I say that a lot recently, but I really do feel the momentum right now. I truly believe that we are well positioned for success and that our strategy is absolutely working. And our transformation is well underway. And our proven ability to rise to challenges and face adversity, I think has prepared us well for navigating the current environment. And really, for that matter, any environment in front of us. And I just want to, again, say thanks to the entire ZB team in your focus on our mission, our strategy and how we show up and execute every day is unmatched. It's what makes ZB and what makes me confident that we're going to continue to deliver. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky for more financial details of the quarter and also looking forward. Okay. Suky? Okay. Yes. I'll just briefly answer your first question, and then I'll pass it over to Suky. But yes, our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We do want to look at tuck-in acquisitions that we think would have low dis-synergy risk and we have a right to win in the space. And that's what we're going to continue to do. This does not change that. And Suky, you want to give maybe a little more color just overall -- on the overall capital allocation strategy? Yes. It's a fantastic question truthfully and one that we track quite a bit and try to estimate. I would just say that without being able to be a fine point to it, it's hundreds of millions of dollars is the way that we view it. And that's what gets us pretty excited about the fact that the end of the pandemic, and our view is on the horizon. And once that occurs, we've got a heck of a backlog that we need to work through. Now the timing of when you work through it, it's based on capacity, capabilities in different markets and those types of things, but we feel it's very sizable, and we're excited to start working through it. Yes, yes. So for us, when we just think about growth rate, we're kind of sticking to that 4% to 5% that we've been talking about. But what we should look at here is that you should have greater confidence, obviously in our ability to do that and potentially be on the higher end of that range. And so that is a key focus for us. And really the significant value for us is that ability to focus. Remember, we talked before about getting to 4% to 5%. We had a number of variables associated with it. One of those variables, even though we didn't have the same level of investment in these businesses, was that they had to grow at least at the lower end of the market. And over time, if you're not investing appropriately in businesses, there's risk in that. So, we've eliminated that risk as we spin these out, and we've unlocked value for SpinCo because ultimately -- or NewCo because ultimately, they're going to invest more intently in those businesses. So, it provides value in both ways, but go ahead on your second question there. Suky you could talk, you're on mute. Yes. So the timing of it is -- it fits right into the phases of where we look at transforming the business. For us, it was sequential. We wanted to make sure that phase 1 in our transformation was in great shape, and it is. Phase 2 would need to be well underway before we want to take something like this on. And I think based on our performance over the last few quarters versus our competitors, it's pretty clear that Phase 2 is working quite well. And now's the time. It's time for active portfolio management. And in a time when we don't have as much capital to work with, this is clearly one of the most significant ways that we can impact and influence the portfolio in a positive way for both companies, I do believe that. So that's the why now. And we're excited about it. We truly are. We're excited about it for our organization, NewCo -- and we're excited about it for NewCo. And we'll be in it together for the next year, 1.5 years and even post that. So that's the margin -- the line now. And we've looked at multiple ways to drive value with these businesses. Just know that this isn't the only option that we've looked at. And just given the number of options on the table, we felt that this was the most significant way that we could drive value for our shareholders and our businesses and our team members. So that's the reason for the spin. Yes. So no, I won't get into specifics on reimbursement for Persona-IQ, but we definitely see it as a very important piece of the puzzle when we think about the ecosystem that you're referencing. And I would just say that we're taking it very seriously when we look at ecosystem versus just the typical implant. We've had a significant shift in our research and development dollars towards robotic storage, data infomatics to build that ecosystem that's going to be meaningful for patients and for our customers alike. And I got to say, there's a lot of excitement around that in our organization, a lot of excitement from our customer base as well. And the competency that we've built over the last few years in this area is, in my opinion, second to none. And where we don't have the competency, we've been working with external partners that have pretty significant names like Apple, and you're going to hear more about those coming up as well. So we feel really good about where we are today. And we feel, in my opinion, anyway, that these ecosystems to be able to capture data before, during and after procedure are going to be a significant benefit for patient outcomes. And ultimately, at some point, when we pick up enough data and have the data like available to us, be able to have predictive analytics to be able to make better pure decisions before the surgery occurs. And that's really the intent. So we're very excited about it. We've shifted dramatically research and development in this area, and we feel we're ahead right now versus our competitors. Yes. Yes. So what I would say is, I try not to look at any specific quarter and draw too much of a conclusion. I would now -- saying that I'd much rather have what we just saw in the fourth quarter, where we're significantly above-market growth that always feels good. But instead, more look at a trend. And if I just go back, let's call it, 3 quarters, that gives you more of a sense of how we're doing versus market. And if I think about U.S., which is probably the cleanest way to look at this because there's a lot of noise in the mix and everything else that people may have outside of the U.S., but we just look at U.S. and we're somewhere in the neighborhood, just think about large joints, 500 to 600 basis points over the last 3 quarters above market, above our key competitors. Knees is a little better than hips, but we're seeing outperformance in both. Knees probably more 600 basis points to 700 basis points and hips, more like 500 basis points to 600 basis points better. So that's what I look at. Not a single quarter, but a combination of quarters and where we're seeing that trend. And by the way, I fully expect us to continue that trend. And I talked about the innovation that is going to be pretty pivotal this year in both hips and knees with the current momentum that we already have, with the commercial prowess that we have as an organization, and that innovation is still yet to come, and our confidence level is pretty high. Would I like too much to run a business? It's, first and foremost, always assessing how are you spending research and development dollars and then making mix shift spend to make sure that you're spending it wisely. And so that's why you saw -- you're not seeing research and development increase. You saw some slight compression there. But it really was just to get straight on what are we going to spend our dollars on. And we killed a lot of projects that just didn't have returns that we expected. And that's the cleanup, if you will. What you're going to see from here, though, is an increase, for sure, in research and development. I always want to make sure that we're spending money wisely before we say whether we're spending enough or too little or do we need to spend more. We have a real good deal now for what we should be spending money on, that we're spending money in a disciplined fashion, and we have a lot of things in the bulk in now that we want to turn on. So as we look forward, you should expect to see increased spend in research and development, but increased spend in a very disciplined way. Yes. So first of all, on the quarter itself, again, we feel great about our quarter performance. And I would say that when you're looking at this year, in COVID, in particular, there was a lot of money that folks had to spend, and we always see in the fourth quarter, we've seen purchases that occur. We see it every quarter, but fourth quarter, in particular. So it's not abnormal to see as Suky referenced before. If I was going to try to put a number to it, I'd say maybe in the 200 basis points to 300 basis points of benefit that we saw, if you're thinking about large joints. So it was important for us in a normal quarter given this quarter differential between us and competitors, not as material. And I would be surprised, quite frankly, if others didn't see the same thing. But either way, that's -- we just want to make sure we call it out as being transparent as we possibly can. And that was the order of magnitude that we saw in the quarter. As far as the spin and having both Dental and Spine together, if you're going to spin a business, you want to make sure that it has a reasonable amount of scale, obviously, for it to be a viable publicly traded company. We feel that $1 billion-plus is kind of that number. Although there's not obvious reasons that you would look at from a strategic standpoint that those businesses would be together from a commercial perspective, there is a lot of capability and know-how and materials that are used for implants across Dental as well as Spine that there is some value in. And so it was really more around the idea of scale and the importance of that scale and utilizing those competencies, if you will, on those raw materials that go across those 2 businesses. And that was the reason why we spun both together. Yes. I would say it's generally business as usual for most of the organizations. We're going to continue to focus where we have. We've got pretty good separation between businesses. So it's not going to be highly disruptive. There's a lot of work to be done. Don't get me wrong for this thing to occur and to occur as effectively as we wanted to. But it's not going to be disruptive to the 2 organizations because they're pretty again separated today. But yes, we're actually increasing, not a significant amount, but increasing spend in these businesses to get them a good tailwind coming into the spin itself. And if there was small opportunities for us to spend capital over the next 12 months, that would make sense to again, to bolster that portfolio, we would certainly consider it in the same way that we would have beforehand. But we want to make sure that we're setting up NewCo to the first success. And we're very close on a CEO to bring in, and that person will bring leadership right out of the gate. And so that's really the way we're looking at it. If we can give them a little more money to spend to get things going, that's what we're going to do here in 2021. And if, again, very small deals, but if there were things that we could do to, again, bolster their portfolio, we'd do that as well. Yes, we think both will have an impact this year. Obviously, the U Knee will be first -- will be in the first half of the year. That's one that we are very excited about. We have a significant share of the U Knee market, and we're excited to be able to bring robotics to that market. And then hip will be second half of the year. And even though second half, we still believe it will have an opportunity for us to be the hit number in the back half of the year. Yes. I mean, for us, obviously, S.E.T is not all created equal. We talked about sports and extremities as being key focus. Upper extremities is the here and the now. Lower extremities would be more in the future. In sports, is the here and the now with the recent acquisition that we did to tuck-in -- to fill in some product gaps that we have. But we feel good about all 3 of those areas. And our ASC presence, again, with the tuck-in acquisition that we recently did to give us more scale in the ASC and the contracting team that we put into place, was not as fulsome yet as hip or knee, but it's getting there pretty quick. So our confidence level is high that we're going to see the growth rate that we need in S.E.T, and it's going to be driven by sports, it's going to be driven by extremities, and it's going to be driven by our presence in the ASC. Yes. If you think about it, we're trying to attack is the fact that 20% of patients in the knee right now are still not satisfied with the outcome that they have. That's a pretty significant number. And we truly do believe that the ecosystem is going to be able to help resolve that disappointment in any procedure. And that's good for everybody, by the way. As we move down this path, we make those outcomes at better as a result of capturing the data and then making different decisions as a result of the data, that's going to allow us to get better outcomes. And when that occurs, you're going to have more patients get bold enough to move into the funnel because it's underserved today. There are patients that need a knee procedure that are afraid of the outcome, are not competent as a result of it, and they're not entering the funnel. So as we can change that outcome, and we believe we can, then we're going to have more people into the funnel, and let's get to the entire market. That's the way we're thinking about data and informatics and driving better outcomes over time. As far as ROSA goes, I'll tell you, I'm excited. We've got one application in our robotic system. I think that's what people -- remind people of just one application, there's 2 more coming this year, but there's one right now. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we were at the higher end of our placement goal in 2020. But what I would tell you is that in reality, we were above that number. When I say higher end, I actually meant above 300. And the quarter was significant. And I think this is really important. We placed over 115 units in the fourth quarter, which was just an outstanding performance by the team. And what I love about that is that happened in concert with one of our other players in the marketplace, one of our competitors also having a record quarter in the fourth quarter. And that's good news because that tells you that orthopedics is open for robotics -- wide open for robotics. And that tells you that you've got an opportunity for all boats to rise as a result. So we truly do believe that the market is accepting of robotics, it's moving quickly, it's hitting the pivot point, and it's going to be very accepting, we believe, as well of the data and informatics that can come with it. Yes. So our strategy around M&A and how we would spend capital dollars to augment the portfolio is unchanged. There are certain categories that we've talked about in the past where we believe we have a right to win, that we have a brand recognition that gives us that right to win, and there's a path for leadership as a result of that. And they're profitable. And those are really the main things we're focused on. How do we enter into spaces, build scale in faster growth markets, where we have a right to win, and we have a path to leadership and the profitable businesses. And that wasn't the case for us for Spine. But it doesn't mean that Spine can't be a very attractive business. It's just not one that we would invest in to become a leader because there's other opportunities for us to spend in sports or extremities or thoracic that are just more attractive markets and more profitable. So we would look at these as being better as a result of that as separate businesses versus a part of our portfolio. And I don't believe -- and we certainly haven't seen that there's a real benefit in having even a fulsome spine business in concert with large joints or S.E.T. We just don't see a lot of contracting -- large contracts that pull-through either one of those businesses."

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: All right. Great, Keri, thank you. And here now with our third virtual earnings call, it was hard to believe that so much time is already passed as we live inside the pandemic environment. But either way we're here, and I certainly hope that you're listening somewhere safe and socially distanced. We're clearly taking precautions here and we continue to follow our safety protocols and that's the reason why Keri, Suky and I are in different locations again for this call. As we've seen in the past hopefully we again do not have any jet mishaps, but just know if we do for whatever reason will push fast and make sure that we move forward. So, 2020 has clearly been unlike any of the year in ZB's nearly 100-year history, as I'm sure it is for every company that's out there right now. And as you know, I think we're all probably too aware, it's not over yet, it's definitely not over year. And that said, I have to say that look at how we have managed and just really navigated COVID-19 this year and specifically in the third quarter. And I'd say that I'm proud of the team, I am confident about ZB's future, I'm more confident now than they ever have been about ZB's future. I truly believe we are well positioned for success and our strategy is absolutely working. As you all know, we've been acutely focused on transforming ZB since I joined the company that's almost three years ago now. We face challenges before and while nothing could have ever prepared us fully for COVID-19, I do believe our ability to rise to those earlier challenges and then truly put us in a stronger position to effectively manage the pandemic situation, the environment that we're in right now. I actually think it's been a catalyst for ZB. The team is focused on our mission, our strategy, how we show up and execute every day is the strongest it's been since I joined the company. And the way I look at it is the things we can control, we are absolutely galvanized around and executing flawlessly against. So, it feels good right now it's much as it's noisy around as the COVID. The execution inside the organization is as strong as I've seen. And that said, the unpredictability of COVID means there are several variables and unfortunately they are pretty big variables that are outside of our control. And as a result, the pandemic continues to be challenging. It continues to be fluid. This requires us to quickly adjust to change given the changing environment. So, ultimately, we can effectively meet the needs of our customers, and very importantly our patients at all times and that's exactly what we've been focused on. Along those lines, there are really three key areas that I'm going to talk about today that I think are important for you take away, be aware of and also see the progress that we're making inside of each. The first one, you should be pretty obvious, it's our view of the COVID-19 recovery path from here, where we see it going. And I think importantly inside of that the areas of concentration or execution that we're going to have inside of the COVID recovery path. The second is an update on our strategy to drive long-term growth and through that value for ZB and for you. And the third is an update on the ongoing transformation of our business, which I truly do believe we're making great progress on. And again I'll spend time on each of these and then I'll pass it to Suky, he's going to give you more detail and color about Q3 on the financials and then how we're thinking about and framing Q4 in our minds. So, first, let's talk about the recovery and execution we saw in the third quarter. Ultimately, the recovery of the electric procedures going from Q2 to Q3 is encouraging. I would imagine is encouraging for everybody at this point looking at Q2 to Q3. But it's still difficult to predict from here what's going to happen. The fact is, we've talked about how the key variables impacting procedure volumes needed to remain constant, obviously they can improve, but they needed to at least stay where they were for the recovery to continue and to see sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3. As you probably remember that we said that these variables included both positive and negative influences on procedure volume. On the positive side, which we pretty obvious, we have the new patient volume and in the backlog of patients that had deferred treatment during the pandemic for whatever reason. On the negative side, we have the effects from the economic downturn, but most importantly surges in the virus that can drive negative policy decisions and/or increased patient fear. Those would be the negative influencers, obviously, if I look at the combination of those in terms of recovery in Q3, the variables played out in a way that allowed continued improvement over Q2. So, overall, the full quarter were stronger than expected and we actually returned to growth over 2019 faster than we thought we would. And this was driven again by these COVID recovery dynamics, but importantly, our team's strong focus on and probably even more importantly execution against our strategy. We've been very focused on moving the strategy forward regardless of the noise around us. We saw a steeper rate of recovery in July, followed by a more modest recovery or even a flattening of the curve toward the end of the quarter. And this was driven by the shift in the recovery variables that I just outlined a minute ago. We've seen continued increasing surges of the virus, especially in Europe, Middle East and Africa and in the US, and this is negatively impacting both patient fear and in certain areas policy decisions. And as a result, we exited the quarter with September growth flat versus 2019. There is not much we can do just end the virus surges, but we have launched a unique and a very large scale direct-to-patient campaign focused on patient fear, right. So, we can't influence the virus, but we could try to influence patient fear and the focus of the campaign is to educate and support patients about their options to get procedures during COVID and really even beyond focusing on the fear the patients typically have to come and get a procedure. And what we're finding early on in this campaign is that the feedback has been very positive and in particular associated with the concept of mymobility and its ability to allow for virtual care capabilities during this challenging time. All right. So, those are obviously some of the factors surrounding COVID and its recovery dynamics. But I also want to make sure that we spend time talking about the things that we have more control over, the execution of our strategy and the performance of our business inside the impact of the pandemic. And even in the midst of this turbulence, we continue to deliver against our goals. This focus and execution against our strategy is the reason we have performed well over the last two quarters versus the overall market. And specifically, if you look at Q3, our performance in US knees and hips is a great example of this underlying momentum. We grew 3% in the quarter in US knees. We also saw 10% growth in US hips. Like I said, these numbers are strong even without the backdrop of COVID. So, the question is going to be, what's driving the performance, I'm sure I'm going to get that right away, so I'm just going to answer it now. Our core business is strong really for four major reasons in the way that we view it. The first is pretty obvious, we have truly shifted from this triaging of execution challenges to launching meaningful innovation. Now, I'm going spend a little bit more time on this one in particular, but that's a big one. Second, our operating mechanism and really the resulting operational discipline has never been stronger, and I would argue probably as good as I've ever seen it anywhere. And third, our compensation programs have shifted towards disproportionately rewarding growth not just paying you for keeping the business you have but truly disproportionately paying and rewarding for growth. And then finally, and I'm not sure if this was causing it or because of it. But our commercial confidence is higher than I've ever seen in my tenure here at ZB, the commercial confidence, the swag or whatever you want to call it, is higher than I've ever seen. So, again, those are really the combination of things that is helping create the momentum inside the pandemic. But let's talk specifically about innovation that as a component of this equation. Broadly speaking, over the last year, we've taken a very dismal, a low single-digit vitality index to a low double-digit number, and that's still not as good as we'd like it to be, but that's a pretty big jump. And with our current product pipeline, I could promise you that's only going to continue to move in the right direction. And as you know obviously vitality index speaks to the percent of sales, driven by new product launches. So, in other words, those products that have been launched within the last three years. The revenue associated with them versus your overall revenue. So, again, a real nice jump in the right direction in vitality index and more coming. But to get a little more specific, I think, go to some of the key launches that you're interested in and I'll start with our knee franchise, our ROSA execution continues and I'm very proud to report that we have already passed the 200 ROSA Knee placement mark in the worldwide placement strategy that we have. And importantly, our utilization continues to increase and the placement pipeline remains very strong. So, again, remember we're way under penetrated in robotics for our business in across all of orthopedics. So, the tailwind associated with ROSA in our opinion is going to be around for a while and it feels very good right now. On the Persona Revision side of things, we keep gaining traction in the marketplace with this product launch, Q3 results were even stronger than the last quarter, which had been our best quarter to date post the launch. And Revision remains on track as I said before to hit $100 million of gross revenue this year, and that's 40% of that will be new growth. In other words $40 million of net of cannibalization revenue this year from Persona Revision by itself. This is really exciting and not only because it shows strong momentum for Persona Revision, but it also opens the door to more growth. Revision System is truly a tip of the spear product. When we converted competitive surgeon to our Revision System, we absolutely have the right to hunt for their primary knee business and that's exactly what we're going to do. And if you know about this marketplace, you would also know that the primary business is usually much larger than the Revision business. So, you can get the order of magnitude of opportunity we have to go after now, so exciting stuff there on the knee side. Shifting to hips Avenir Complete is really, still outperforming our expectations for 2020 that's even with the pandemic impact. These are the expectations that we have for 2020 before we knew about the pandemic, just to give you some perspective on that on how well it's doing. And this launch has really helped provide a great implant to leverage the high growth direct anterior approach submarket in hips, that's one of the most attractive sub-markets in hips in US implant [ph], the perfect opportunity for us to take advantage of that attractive market. And then one more product I'll highlight in the quarter is in our upper extremities business, our Signature ONE Planner, I talked about this last quarter as well. We had another 50-plus-percent increase in surgeon registrations in Q3 and we already have one in four cases using pre-surgical planning for shoulder replacement. This increased penetration of the system is important in my mind two very important ways. First of all, there is a real potential for mix benefit where maybe said another way, share of wallet gain in each procedure that you use pre-surgical planning in and it also provides more stickiness with the surgeon, right, on the surgeon's stickiness it's probably obvious when surgeons using our implant and they're also using a pre-surgical planning, it's harder for them to want to move away from that environment because they are used to it. On the share of wallet benefit, this is may not be as obvious, but it's pretty significant opportunity. It comes because you get a higher utilization in augments and guides when you do a pre-planned procedure versus those without pre-surgical planning is because you know the anatomy before you get in and you know that if you're going to have an anatomy issue, you've already got your augments ready to go and guys ready to go. That's great for the patient because they are going to get better outcome, it's great for the surgeon because they have what they need to do the procedure, and it's great for us because we get more revenue for that surgical procedure. And so very exciting stuff. And so, in short, I would just say that even with the challenges of COVID, we're driving our business forward, meeting our customer needs and improving patient lives as we go. That's the whole missioning [ph] of this organization, right. And it truly is what we do and wake up for every day, alleviating the pain of patients around the world and improving the quality of their life, and we are doing that during COVID. And as a team, we've dealt with many challenges over the past three years. We've prepared us for this moment. I've said it before, this fits on when companies and teams can slow down. They can hesitate, they can take their foot off the pedal. Hey, we're being smart and safe, but we are not letting up and it shows. It shows in the ZB performance and in the energy of this team right now. All right. So, I'm going to move on to cover our strategy to deliver long-term organic growth and ultimately drive more value for ZB and very importantly for you as well. And as we've outlined to drive our strategic pillar of top quartile performance in TSR and truly bring value to you. And ultimately, to achieve mid-single-digit growth, organically, we have got to focus most intensely on driving long-term growth in our key focus areas. And, first, as we've said in the past, the first and foremost area of concentration is above market performance and needs. Just given the size and the scale of this business, we need to be ahead of market here and we're going to do that by focusing aggressively in the fastest growth sub-markets of knee, robotics, data and informatics, cementless, and for us revision. These are the areas of concentration and investment that are going to allow us to sustainably perform above market in knees. And next, we've got to drive consistent at market growth, if not the higher end of market for our performance in S.E.T. And that's focusing on the most attractive sub-elements of S.E.T. For us that's going to be sports and it's going to be extremities. Also, we've got to make sure that we have a consistent at market performance in hips that's in the short-term, right. In the longer term, when we launch into robotics, we absolutely expect above market growth in hips as well. And then finally, while our other businesses, at least at this point, will not receive the same level of investment and will be managed differently, we still expect these businesses to drive in line to the lower end of their market growth. And that's our pathway, that's our pathway for long-term durable 4% to 5% organic growth rates in this business. Okay. So, next I want to talk about ZB's transformation. You've probably heard me outline the three phases of our ZB transformation, now I'm just going to go over them again just quickly here. Phase 1, capturing the hearts and minds of the team, truly capturing the hearts and minds of the team and addressing our execution challenges that was really Phase 1. And with this in mind, we have aggressively shifted to the One ZB mission to One ZB culture, we've added new and very diverse executive talent and we've stabilized the business across all key areas. So, good progress in Phase 1. Phase 2 was really around shifting to a disciplined strategic clarity for the organization, that's more focused on long-term success, not solving problems but truly long-term success. This is where ZB shifts to innovation, drives our strategic plan, has our pillar priorities that are very clear to the organization, locks in our operating mechanisms and involves organizational structure to ensure that we can drive a focused approach to execution of this strategy. In Phase 3, is where we transform for the future. Through active portfolio management we look to change the portfolio complexion to accelerate growth, all right. So, we have made pretty significant and really durable progress in Phase 1. We've laid the foundation for and are absolutely executing against Phase 2 and now we're moving squarely into Phase 3 of the ZB turnaround. And so for us, when I think about Phase 3, I think about that active portfolio management includes three main components and really should include these same three for anyone who is looking at active portfolio management. But the first one is disproportionately investing in our priority businesses, in our priority markets and that would be across research and development commercial infrastructure, just mind share being disproportionately invested in those areas. For number two, being selective in M&A, prioritizing opportunities that are accretive to our weighted average market growth and aligned to our strategy, so selective M&A. And the final one, when appropriate, and in line with our overall strategy divesting non-core assets that are financially less attractive in our core businesses, right. So, those are the three components of active portfolio management in a way that we see them. As we manage the ZB portfolio, we're going to continue to focus on high-growth areas and areas where we truly believe we have a right to win. No size is going to be a factor here, particularly in the short term. And out of the gate, here we can have a preference towards smaller tuck-in deals that can be easily integrated and operationalized while also maintaining very importantly our investment grade rating. And I really do believe this philosophy is apparent when looking at the recent transactions we just highlighted in our earnings press release. Again, while these deals are not material in terms of acquired revenue they are absolutely instrumental in filling some of the product gaps we have at ZB in our ASC in sports portfolios and really they add to our pipeline of new technologies and product launches in markets that are accretive to our growth rates. And these deals are small. So, they're going to be easily integrated and we're going to be able to validate our new deal process, our new team, the integration playbook that we now have in place. So, I think, great first step in the M&A side of things from a -- looking at the individual deals, if I look at the acquisition of incisive. This is an OR solutions company in the $1.2 billion integrated OR market. And this is going to provide ZB with a soon to be launched, it's now launched yet, but a soon to be launched surgical booms and lights portfolio that will help us push more aggressively into the attractive ASC market, which is clearly an area we want to go. We also see some real differentiation, it's not just filling the gap of the portfolio, it shouldn't bring [ph] a differentiation for really two reasons. First of all, we have a smaller footprint and this focuses on reducing the acquisition cost but also the construction cost, which we know is a pretty important aspect of the ASC market, looking at controlling these costs. And the second reason why we think it's differentiated is we've really done a really interesting job incorporating an innovative and automated way to capture data in the operating room that ultimately leverages artificial intelligence, and that helps us in the operating room drive efficiency and productivity and potentially even better outcomes. Again, this is really lending itself to the needs of the ASC setting. So, again, pretty excited about this portfolio opportunity. This idea of a smart alarm and really leveraging data to drive decision support and efficiency is also reflected in our exclusive relationship with [indiscernible]. Through this partnership, we actually see the opportunity to further differentiate our knee ecosystem, which is a major focus of ours right now. Our goal is to launch an intelligent Persona total knee implant that incorporates smart sensor technology. We feel the combination of active data capture from this smart implant that we already have from mymobility and we already have from ROSA is going to provide an unmatched dataset that ultimately could be leveraged through AI for a decision support related to how best to treat and care for the patient. This will give us a unique opportunity we feel to create an intersection between the $4 billion total knee market and the telehealth solution space, which is growing somewhere north of 15%, so a very attractive area for us to differentiate the ecosystem and kind of enter into an adjacent space in telehealth. And the last deal I want to talk about is our acquisition Reline [ph] and this is focused on the sports medicine market, which we know is a $5 billion market and it's growing 5% to 7%. So, again, accretive to our overall weighted average market growth. And this deal clearly helps fill our gaps in arthroscopy capital. The capital makes up about 30% of the sports market, till now we had absolutely no offering in this space. With this acquisition, we have not only filled the gap, we also see some real differentiation in the portfolio. They have done a nice job of again innovatively consolidating three tower components into a single comprehensive system, both at the equipment side and on the end [ph] vector side. This is the first in the industry. This system is very early in commercialization stage. But I would say it's getting very positive feedback early on, and we see this as another great opportunity to drive a successful product launch, leveraging our ZB commercial infrastructure, which we absolutely know we can do. So -- and I would just say, hey, we've got other portfolio management opportunities in the near term funnel and we're not ready to talk about those yet, but we have [indiscernible] the funnel and we will continue to keep you up-to-date as we make progress here. And finally, we are fully committed to our margin expansion goal of at least 30% operating margin by the end of 2023. And Suky is going to talk more about this, but our restructuring plan is on track and the cost savings we're delivering will help drive margin expansion, which has got to be there, but also support reinvestment in the business for growth. It's got to be able to do both. And that was what the whole idea of behind the restructuring plan was. So, again, Suky will give more detail on that, but it's on track so far. Overall, we are clearly watching the COVID recovery trends closely and completely realize as everybody does the short-term market performance and I want to reiterate market performance is out of our direct control as a result of the COVID recovery trends. That said and I hope it is very clear, we feel confident in ZB, we feel confident in our business strength in our execution and the long-term growth prospects we have as a business. And as a result of that the value creation opportunity we have as a company, okay. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky, again, for more financial details for the quarter and looking forward. Suky?\nSuky Upadhyay: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. To echo Bryan's comments, ZB's underlying fundamentals remain strong. Overall, our Q3 performance was better than expected. Revenue was ahead of expectations as we posted operational growth due to faster market recovery across most developed markets in tandem with strong commercial execution. Improved revenue performance drove better margins and a solid quarter of free cash flow. I've a genuine feeling of pride in how our 20,000 plus team members have responded to a very challenging environment. Net sales in the third quarter were $1.9 billion, a reported increase of 2% and constant currency increase of 1.1% versus the same period in 2019. Sequentially Q3 improved over Q2 as expected. Inside of that, we continue to see variability and recovery by market and region as we progress throughout the quarter and we did see a flattening of the recovery curve with September effectively flat versus the prior year. I'll talk about performance across our regions and then move to our business segments. And moving forward, unless I note otherwise, my comments will be on a constant currency basis. Beginning with Asia Pacific, the region returned to growth, increasing 0.7% versus Q3 2019. We saw strong performance in China with results well ahead of normal levels and while Japan has not yet returned to prior year volume, so market continues to show stability. Australia, New Zealand made steady progress in Q3, but were negatively impacted by surges of the virus late in the quarter. Finally, India and other small Southeast Asian countries continue to significantly underperform the broader region. EMEA decreased 5.7% while we saw recovery from Q2, the region did not return to growth in any part of the quarter and we observed a slowing in September due to recent COVID-19 surges and corresponding policy actions. Developed countries excluding the UK showed the strongest signs of recovery, but decelerated in the latter part of the quarter. The UK in emerging markets continue to be a significant drag on overall regional growth and are lagging developed markets recovery. Lastly, the Americas region continued to grow, increasing 3.3% with strong growth of 5% in the US. While the recovery was robust in the US, we observed the same flattening in the recovery curve due to increases in virus surges in September. Similar to Q2, caseloads in elective procedures in hard hit regions are continuing at about 70% to 90% when compared to 2019 volumes. Outside of the US, the rest of Americas continues to lag with numbers well below normal levels. Turning to our business performance for Q3, the global knee business declined 1.4% versus Q3 2019, a marked sequential improvement from the 47% decline we saw in Q2. The US knee business returned to growth, increasing 3% in the quarter. Overall execution was strong with continued momentum for ROSA. Additionally, our persona family of primary revision and partial knee continues to get great traction with existing and new customers. Our global hip business increased 4.4%. Another big sequential improvement from the 31% decline we saw in the Q2. I do want to call out that US hips increased about 10% in the quarter, strong market recovery for sure, but also a great illustration of our commercial team's execution in the backdrop of new product introductions. Sports extremities and trauma sales grew 2.5% over Q3 2019. Notably, the Americas grew about 6% but that growth was offset by softness in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Also strength in upper extremities was partially offset by slower growth in sports and trauma due to lower social activities as a result of COVID. Dental, spine and CMFT increased 6.5% due to strong execution, new products including robotics and market recovery. And finally, our other category was down 11.1%. I'll now walk through our third quarter P&L and liquidity and then share more color and insights that may provide shaping of our expectations for the remainder of the year. So, moving on to the P&L, as we have previously discussed, we move quickly and have taken a disciplined, proactive approach to mitigate the earnings impact of the pandemic, while also enhancing ZB's liquidity profile. Results in the third quarter were better than we expected at the time of our second quarter call, as we saw margins, earnings and cash flow sequentially improve versus the second quarter, consistent with our revenue improvement. In the third quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.81. GAAP earnings per share versus the prior year were lower, primarily due to a sizable one-time Swiss tax credit that the company realized in 2019. For additional details on GAAP results, please refer to today's press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. On an adjusted basis versus 2019, earnings grew in line with revenue growth as lower SG&A spending offset lower gross margins and a higher share count. Adjusted gross margin was 70.6% for the third quarter and as expected, results were sequentially better than Q2, but lower than 2019. Versus the prior year pressure from prior period deferred costs and lower volumes due to COVID were partially offset by a favorable regional mix tailwind as we saw stronger recovery in the US and developed markets in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased sequentially over Q2, driven by commissions related to higher revenues and increased commercial investments. Expenses [ph] were lower than prior year due to the early impact of our restructuring programs and due to moderated investment levels as we continue to navigate pandemic uncertainty. Overall, adjusted operating margins for the quarter was 26.3%, better than expected and driven by the favorable geographic mix in gross margin and a slower ramp on spending. Moving beyond operating margin net interest expense and adjusted other income totaled $52 million and the adjusted tax rate of 16.6% was slightly better than expected due to some modest discrete benefits in the quarter. Turning to cash and liquidity, we'll return to positive free cash flow earlier than expected totaling $287 million. This is lower than the prior year as we used a portion of our better than expected operating cash performance to reduce our AR securitization program. We ended Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of just under $1 billion and our $2.5 billion of credit facilities remain untapped. Relative to the deals that Brian referenced earlier, we expect the cash call to be approximately $80 million in the second half of this year and that will be funded through existing cash balances. Turning to Q4, our consolidated revenue outlook for the remainder of the year has a heightened level of uncertainty, given recent COVID surges that we have seen in a number of markets and due to that backdrop, we will not be providing financial guidance for the fourth quarter. So far, through October regional trends have been similar to what we saw for the full third quarter except for EMEA. That is Asia Pacific and the Americas continue to grow in line with full Q3 growth rates, albeit with more pressure or risk in the US due to increased virus surges. On the other hand, EMEA has worsen due to surges in the virus as declines have accelerated in October with some governments in the region taking new policy actions to limit elective procedure. We expect consolidated Q4 revenue performance to continue to be fluid based on the major variables impacting the recovery, which include the rate of pull-through on the backlog patient anxiety and elective procedure capacity constraints due to COVID surgeons and/or resulting policy actions. While market dynamics remain uncertain [ph] what I do know is that our commercial and supply execution combined with our innovative new product introductions, will continue to drive strong performance relative to the market. Looking ahead on gross margin, we expect sequential improvement, but continued year-over-year pressure due to the same drivers we saw in Q3. Adjusted operating expenses are expected to be sequentially higher in Q4 but down versus prior year as we also saw in Q3. Interest expense will be stable to Q3 and we expect that our tax rate will be slightly higher than Q3 2020. Lastly, fully diluted shares outstanding are expected to step up in Q4, due to the exercise of options as a result of the acceleration of stock price we saw in the third quarter. Longer term, we remain committed to our target of at least 30% adjusted operating margins by the end of 2023. Our near-term initiatives relative to reorganization, consolidation and zero based budgeting, as examples, are complete or near completion. And we are steadily advancing our longer-term structural initiatives around supply and G&A efficiency. To summarize, our underlying business performance is strong. Our execution is on point and ZB's transformation is delivering positive proof points even in the midst of the challenging pandemic. We continue to believe that ZB is well positioned to address near term challenges and to accelerate growth over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Keri.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, a reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up, so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that operator, may we have the first question please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So, Bryan, I want to start on the backlog and the commentary about in September exit rate. And then I have one on ROSA. If you recall back, the last quarter you talked about $700 million backlog for ZB. And I'm just wondering if you could comment a little bit around that backlog in terms of what do you feel like you achieved against that in the third quarter, and how we should think about that maybe refilling back up in light of some of the dynamics of COVID in the fourth quarter here that you're talking about?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. So, I appreciate the question. So, what I would tell you is that the -- what we saw in Q3 because we actually saw a positive growth relatively in line, if not a little above say, for instance, in hips in like a typical market growth. That would indicate that we did not build further backlog or deferred patients in a way that I calculated in Q3. That said, we still have hundreds of millions of dollars of deferred patients that will eventually come back in the funnel. So, I still feel very bullish about the fact that we have these deferred patients. There are patients, as we know for most of our business that has a disease that progresses. It does not get better by itself. And as a result of that those patients typically come back in the fall. So, I wouldn't say that we built more backlog in Q3, but we certainly still have quite a bit of backlog to go through. So that's my view of where we are from a backlog standpoint. And again, I think, eventually when we get to the point where we have a vaccine that people have confidence in it or treatment that people have confidence in. We're going to have that backlog of patients begin to come through in concert with new patients and that should be a really nice headwind for our business, looking forward in that day for sure.\nRyan Zimmerman: Understood. And then just the second question, ROSA really nice number there, the 200 -- exceeding the 200 placements on ROSA. Just talk a little bit about the visibility on the order book and your expectation for 2021. Is it unreasonable to believe that you can accelerate beyond that 200 to 300 placement rate you're expecting this year? Thank you for taking the questions.\nBryan Hanson: And for just clarification, just to make sure that 200 to 300 is what we've done from operational standpoint since launch. And there wasn't 200 to 300 that we would expect just in 2020, but it would be since launch, which is just call about a little over a year and a half now since full launch of the ROSA System. But I'd tell you that, hey, I'm pretty enthusiastic as it the team around the ROSA placements that we saw in Q3, it was the best quarter that we've had relative to the number of installations we did in a single quarter. And I can tell you that that momentum is continuing into Q4. And even though, I think, it will be slightly better, if it is still slightly better than what we did in Q3, that's what our expectation will be in Q4. And so that pipeline, if I'm just going to call, future customers is robust as it's ever been with our product. And as I mentioned before in the prepared remarks, I really do believe the under penetration of robotics is it such a point that this is a tailwind for the organization for a long time to come. And it's a very exciting tailwind. No question about it. Because not only is it before us [ph], it's to the patient. It really is providing a level of accuracy in the operating room that you can see when you're in the operating room with surgeon. Forget studies, we've got those coming, but when the surgeon uses the robotic system in the operating room, you can see the lights go off -- I mean go on. They clearly understand that they have an opportunity to get better cuts more accurate cuts, but also and very importantly feedback right away in the operating room around tissue balancing. It's really you need to see actually to have an opportunity to go and see that kind of light bulb go off in the surgeon's mind when they're using it is pretty amazing. Relative to 2021, I don't want to give specifics there. But what I would tell you is that I would be disappointed if the level of placements that we saw in Q3 and Q4 which were better than the first half of 2020. I would be disappointed if that level of placement didn't continue into 2021, right. And that would indicate in fact that does happen that 2021 should have more placements overall than 2020 did. So, again, I think real positive momentum, great feedback from our customers and a really strong pipeline of future customers that are out there right now.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Bryan.\nBryan Hanson: Sure. Can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Can you hear me okay?\nKeri Mattox: Yes.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. Maybe great.\nBob Hopkins: Good morning. Thanks. So, first quick question, I appreciate, Bryan, your comments on deals and divestitures and the two deals you announced. So, quick question there is, one, are those deals that could start to have an impact from a revenue perspective, more in 2022, just kind of how should we be thinking about those launches? And then on the divestiture side, kind of how would you characterize how likely divestitures might be in 2021? Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Okay. So, what I would tell you is that the deals that we just talked about, obviously, are not super accretive relative to acquired revenue growth just [ph] not much there. Think about most product launches that we have facilitating product launches in these very attractive spaces ASC, it would also be in sports, which is kind of a combination ASC impact, and then also in the data informatics portion of things. But I would absolutely expect revenue growth to be driven in 2021, I wouldn't say 2022. I definitely believe that the portfolio being provided by these acquisitions will immediately give us traction to be able to go out and hunt in the ASC marketplace, in the sports marketplace and continue in 2021 to provide more unique offerings inside of our knee category and we talked about that knee ecosystem. So, it's all three [ph] of the things that we just talked about in prepared remarks, we will provide revenue growth just not acquired revenue growth in 2021 and well beyond by the way. As far as divestitures go, clearly, I wouldn't talk about the time frame, I don't want to give anybody any [ph] expectation here. But the fact is when we think about active portfolio management that is one of the vectors. One of the obvious ones is M&A. And for us M&A that we're going to focus on will always be to build scale and or innovation that matters in markets that are accretive to our ZB weighted average market growth. And very importantly, where we think we have a right to win and see a clear path to leadership in those categories that would potentially be on the docket for divestiture. It would in those areas that are not as financially attractive to the business are not as core to our strategy and where we don't really see a clear pathway to leadership. Those would be the things that we would look at when we think about sharing the business, but I just don't want to give you a specific time frame because I don't want to set that expectation. But just know that that is part of the equation as we think about active portfolio management with the intent over time to move more of our revenue in higher growth markets, right, as we intend. If we're going to be a top quartile performer in total shareholder return, we have to have more of our revenue in higher growth markets, I'm just talked about mid-single-digits to upper single-digit growth markets and that's the intent of the active portfolio management process.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks so much, Bob. Bran, can we go to the next question in the queue, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. One on ROSA and then just one on your average Chinese business. Just on ROSA, I was just wondering just kind of parse out just the implant performance in knees in the quarter. Was there a headwind from third quarter 2019 ROSA upfront purchase revenues, again, versus the placement dynamic has been happening over the course of the pandemic. And just, can you help us as we think about modeling these ROSA placements out in the 2021, and just all robotic solutions out there in the orthopedic marketplace. And do you think that percentage of systems that are placed that will drive an upfront capital purchase and that upfront revenue is at a 50% bar, is at a 25%, anything you can help us just in terms of modeling out that that system revenue as we think about 2021 and beyond would be helpful.\nBryan Hanson: Okay. Maybe I'll hit that piece first. What I would tell you is we're definitely seeing it's not dramatic, but we're already seeing a slight shift back towards customers having a desire to acquire either lease or acquire the robotic systems and it almost seems like it's already starting although not nearly at the pace that it was, let's say, last year. And so I would guess, it's purely a guess, but I would again based on that assume that as we move into 2021 you might see more of a shift in that direction. But I just don't have a good sense for where it's going to land. I'll say [ph] it right now, it's definitely the larger portion of installations are these placement programs which is truly what we would prefer. I really like having that longer-term contract in relationship with the customer that does require certain volume commitment to the company and we're just building that relationship in a more stable way. But I would assume that as our customers get more confidence in the market that they may want to shift back to where they were before which is maybe acquiring more. I just don't want to give you a sense for what the percentage would be, but it is moving slightly back in that direction. Relative to Q3, interestingly enough even though there were some sales of ROSA in Q3. On a relative basis, it was actually a headwind for us. If I think about US knees particularly I talked about 3% growth in the US knees. If I eliminated ROSA as a part of that and just looked at core knees, and base knees, we actually grew closer to 4%, even a little better than 4% in base knees in the US. So, it was almost 100 bps of -- actually a little more than 100 bps of headwind from ROSA in the quarter. So, hopefully that answers the question.\nJosh Jennings: That's very helpful. Thanks for those details. And then just I heard Suky call out strength in upper extremities in the quarter, are you seeing any disruption from the Stryker-Wright combination, maybe hard to parse out in the middle of the pandemic. But I just wanted to get your thoughts on the opportunity with the integration next year from second biggest competitor and what that opportunity represents in your mind for the upper extremities business? Thanks for taking the questions.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. Absolutely. I mean, the fact is, when we look at the performance in Wright, they had a pretty good quarter. So, clearly, at least based on that performance one would indicate that it's not disruptive yet. Always hoping for things to happen, I would be very happy if there was disruption when you try to bring those two organizations together finally. The fact is, most of the time in our industry when they're bringing two organizations together is dis-synergy risk there just is. And that's why I like some of the small deals that we just did, it really eliminates that dis-synergy risk because there are really more product launches versus bring two sales organizations together. So, I would expect at some point just given the historical views of acquisitions in our space that you are going to see some level of the dis-synergy and hoping that we have an opportunity to take advantage of that. That said, I hope is [ph] in a strategy we have a very clear strategy in our extremities business and we're executing against that. And I feel very confident in the commercial infrastructure we're putting together, the product pipeline that we have and the traction that we're getting in the marketplace right now with or without disruption from our competitors.\nJosh Jennings: Thanks, Bryan.\nBryan Hanson: Thanks.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a footprint [ph] here. Bryan, maybe a big picture question, if I look at 2021, Street's modeling earnings above 2019, I'm just curious a couple of your peers have called out gross margin manufacturing variance et cetera. Is there anything you need to be aware from a margin perspective, and should the Street perhaps -- are you guys comfortable with the Street EPS numbers?\nBryan Hanson: Maybe what I'll do for that one is just pass it over to Suky to provide a little more color there. I know you had some of that in your prepared remarks, Suky, but maybe you can comment on that.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, sure. So, we're not obviously giving guidance on 2021 and I'm not going to speak to Street numbers. What I would say is next year's profile, obviously, it's going to be driven by revenue and a large component of that is going to depend on what happens relative to COVID-19. From a top line perspective, if we saw situation where the recent surges and [ph] experiences begin to abate or moderate and then stabilize, there could be a pathway to seeing a 2021 revenue profile. That's in line with the 2019 revenues. And if we got into next year and saw that stabilization moderation, but also on top of that saw vaccine or credible treatment. In tandem with the vaccine, you could potentially see volumes or revenues ahead of 2019 level. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it from a broad strokes perspective, but there is look [ph] a lot of runway between here and there relative to COVID and how that's going to play out. So, we're going to pause on giving too much additional color beyond that. From a margin perspective, it's really going to fall in line with overall revenue and volumes, right, as you would expect. Volumes and revenue is better, so will margins. That's intuitive. I would say, as we think about our margins going into next year, there are a number of headwinds and tailwinds that we have taken into consideration using sort of second half of this year as a starting point or as a run rate. First on gross margins, we'd actually had a pretty good quarter in Q3. We expect to sequentially step-up in gross margin into Q4 based on overall volumes and seasonality that we typically see in the fourth quarter. But as we move into next year and as overall regional mix starts to stabilize with a stabilization of COVID, we're seeing a mix tailwind right now that may abate into next year. So, that could be a slight headwind, as we go into next year. And then we have had some pressure on overall COGS this year because of lower volumes, because of prior-year deferred costs. Those are going to continue into next year. So, there are a couple of headwinds in gross margin that we're closely watching. Now having said that, we're also very aggressive on our cost down opportunities and cost of goods. So, that could be a tailwind to next year. But we've always talked about coming out of 2020 as part of our broader restructuring program, the 30% operating margin aspiration that you should expect to start to see a stabilization from 2020 as you move out to 2023 when it comes to gross margin. And then within operating margin, I'll tell you we're going to continue to ramp up investment. I think, what you see over the last two quarters was our performance relative to market has been strong. One of the reasons behind that is because we've been making really smart investments and our commercial teams have been optimizing those investments and getting quick ROI those. And so we're going to continue to ramp up that spending because we got a lot of great products. We've got great execution in very strong end markets and so we're going to see a step-up in investment as we move into 2021. Having said all that we're consistent with where we were before that if we saw revenues at 2019 levels, we would expect -- we'd be disappointed if operating margin within 2021 didn't reach those levels, maybe not for the full year, but within 2021, we would expect to get to those margin levels. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit more perspective on how we're thinking about 2021. But, again, a lot more to play out yet with COVID.\nVijay Kumar: Yes. That's extremely helpful. And Bryan one for you on that. Thanks for all the color on the Persona Revision. I guess, when you look at next year, as you guys gain traction on the Revision side, should those, I guess, gains accelerate as you gain a beachhead into the primary side of knee as well.\nBryan Hanson: I'm sorry, could you repeat that, I missed part of the -- the first part of your question, you went out a little bit for me. Could you repeat that?\nVijay Kumar: So, on that the Persona Revision knee side, I think, the comment you made was that should allow you guys to go after the primary implant side as well. So, when you think\u2026\nBryan Hanson: Oh, I guess, yes.\nVijay Kumar: $40 million of net gains on the Revision side, should we perhaps be looking at an accelerating share gains for next year as you gain share into -- on the primary side.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, I'd say, it's -- that's the most exciting thing for me on Persona Revision. And probably it was a little ostomy to take impurities [ph] in the beginning, because I assume the better connection between Revision sets and primary, but what we're finding is that a good portion of that $40 million or so of competitive conversion [ph] where we have the primary business already, we did not have the Revision System. But a lot of them or the other way around, but we didn't have the primary or the Revision. And so when we pick up that Revision business, it absolutely, as I said before, gives us a right to hunt for the primary business. And it's an order of magnitude larger than the Revision business. So, if you just look at the market differential, let's call, Revision somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% of the overall knee market. The rest of it is really primary unit that are out there. And that again once we get the Revision business, we then can go after that primary, the unit that the surgeon is doing. And it doesn't mean you're going to natural get or automatically get it but you again have a right to go after it and you build the trust and you build the relationship with the surgeon and it gives you that chance. So, I absolutely expect two things in 2021, continued competitive conversions with primary and with Revision, but also that opportunity to pull in the primary business as well. And it will clearly be one of the catalysts that we use to continue to drive towards above market growth in knees just as we've been saying. It will absolutely be one of the variables that will drive us in that direction in 2021.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nBryan Hanson: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.\nRaj Denhoy: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions if I could, so I'm just trying to put a finer point on your comments around the fourth quarter. So, it sounds like you're suggesting that Asia Pacific and the Americas perhaps in line with the third quarter, but given that EMEA is worsening, I guess, we should assume that the growth rate in the fourth quarter will be below what you posted during the third quarter, is that a fair way to think about that?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. So, maybe, Suky, I'll start, if you want to provide any more color feel free to do so. I would say, generally, what you're saying is accurate, I would say that Asia Pacific which is clearly being less impacted by surgeons in the virus seem to be relatively consistent. Again, it's early in the quarter based on what we've seen so far, pretty consistent with the growth rates that we saw in Q3, overall, Q3. The Americas, even though it's a positive growth, it has slightly decelerated versus Q3. But the good news is even with the surges that we're seeing in the US, we're still seeing positive growth. And it's close relative to what we saw in Q3 again, it's early. And the risk feels a little more tenuous right now because the surges are so much more prominent than they were in Q3. But the fact is that US is hanging in there and still has positive growth, but in EMEA, to your point, we are seeing more pressure. The policy decisions and the reaction to the virus surge is more acute in Europe, Middle East and Africa. No question about it. And I would expect Q4 to be slower growth and it was already negative in Q3 than Q3 was. And so we're really watching this everywhere, obviously, but right now, Europe, Middle East and Africa is a key area of focus for us to understand what's happening in that region. And then importantly, inside of that storm, if you will, what are we going to do to make sure that we stay ahead of the competition while it's occurring.\nRaj Denhoy: Okay. But maybe just...\nBryan Hanson: Anything else you want to add?\nSuky Upadhyay: No, I think, you summarized it really well, Bryan.\nBryan Hanson: Thanks.\nRaj Denhoy: And really my second question is, I guess, somewhat related, frankly, Suky made a comment that that demand in some areas is still at 70% to 90% of normal. And I guess I'm curious how to think about that, is that a kind of broad statement that you are still more than 10% below what you would consider normal demand, and it's going to take something like a vaccine or better treatment ultimately to get that to 100% and beyond?\nBryan Hanson: Well, let me clarify what you're saying there is, what you're saying is that, so take the US, for instance, if you look at a specific state or a county inside the US that is being very hard hit by surges, what he was referencing is that even in those very hard hit areas, the county or the state, you're still seeing 70% to 90% of procedure volumes that you would typically see, say, versus 2019. So, that doesn't necessarily mean that broad-based, we're seeing 70%, 90% of demand, it's just, let's say that in that hard-hit area, you're still seeing 70% to 90% of typical procedure volume, so that is what he was referencing.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, I think, Raj...\nRaj Denhoy: Perfect. Thank you.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, the extrapolation from there is even in the very acute second surges, we're not seeing anything that resembles what we saw in April and May, right. So, clearly, the end markets, the hospital systems with precision, more deference being provided to them, they are better prepared to deal with COVID. They have better protocols and triage our patients, I mean, they've got incentives to get the elective procedures through. So, that's really the key point of that statement of 70% to 90%.\nRaj Denhoy: Very clear. Thanks for the clarification.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks. And Barn, It looks like we have time for at least one, maybe two more questions.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Miksic: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I have one on S.E.T. and one on, just to follow up on Raj's question on trend. So, on sports medicine, extremities, trauma, you provide a global reporting line here, it's a 20% or so of your business. I was wondering, if you could maybe expand a little bit on how the major moving parts of that business are performing and maybe proportions or geographic color would be helpful. And then I actually have one quick follow up.\nBryan Hanson: Okay. We don't really provide a breakdown beyond the S.E.T. overall category. But what I would tell you is that the US and I think that Suky referenced this in your prepared remarks, you said I think that the overall S.E.T. category. The US was definitely the strongest performer in the world. I think, we have somewhere neighborhood the 6% in US S.E.T. performance from a growth standpoint. So, that would indicate that we clearly had lower growth in other parts of the world, which isn't surprising when you think about our S.E.T. category, say, for instance in Asia Pacific, a bigger part of that category would be trauma in that region plus other [ph] regions, just given the dominance or the significant portion of revenue in each [ph] specific that China has. And even though we're seeing less surges of the virus in that part of the world, we still are seeing less activity. And that typically will drive lower volumes and/or lower revenue growth in sports, it would drive lower revenue growth in trauma. So, just when people aren't moving as much and they are not doing as much, we typically see those two businesses with inside of S.E.T. get hurt. And I would tell you that as we talked a lot about, we've had pretty significant focus in extremities obviously upper extremities is one of the key areas of focus for us. And I would just say, our growth rate there is promising. And that's probably all the detail I provide below S.E.T. But overall, if I look at the category, the US region -- the US or the Americas was definitely the strongest growth region.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks for that. And then just on -- Suky, your comments just now on trends and what we could expect and not expect potentially around surges. Is there anything -- there was a pretty tight period, I guess, this summer in Arizona, Texas when there were some very narrowly focused constraints by county and other. I just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you saw there? How quickly it rebounce back and sort of what we might learn from that as it pertains to maybe the next few months in some other areas?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, I think, we actually commented on that on our second quarter call. And some of those very hard hit counties within the states that you mentioned were operating somewhere in that 80% to 90% range. So, we've seen a very consistent pattern coming out for a few months where we've seen heightened surface. So, I think, that's again another positive inflection that we're not going to return back to those periods of April and May, even with acute surges, at least based on what we're seeing today. The time to abate, it really -- it's variable, right, there is no broad statement, it depends on the specific market, the specific sub-market that you're talking about or territory and the number of surges and how quickly -- how big that population is, and how quickly those surge rates come back down. So, it's tough to say. But in some of those hardest hits where we were at 80%, 90%, we've seen a path in some of those where they've gotten back to normal or perhaps a little bit above normal within a few months. But, again, it's really variable from market to market.\nMatt Miksic: Thanks.\nOperator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn back to Keri Mattox for additional or closing remarks.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks so much, and thanks everyone for joining us. I know we'll be in touch today, if you have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the IR Team. And we look forward to continuing the conversation.\nBryan Hanson: All right, great. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. To echo Bryan's comments, ZB's underlying fundamentals remain strong. Overall, our Q3 performance was better than expected. Revenue was ahead of expectations as we posted operational growth due to faster market recovery across most developed markets in tandem with strong commercial execution. Improved revenue performance drove better margins and a solid quarter of free cash flow. I've a genuine feeling of pride in how our 20,000 plus team members have responded to a very challenging environment. Net sales in the third quarter were $1.9 billion, a reported increase of 2% and constant currency increase of 1.1% versus the same period in 2019. Sequentially Q3 improved over Q2 as expected. Inside of that, we continue to see variability and recovery by market and region as we progress throughout the quarter and we did see a flattening of the recovery curve with September effectively flat versus the prior year. I'll talk about performance across our regions and then move to our business segments. And moving forward, unless I note otherwise, my comments will be on a constant currency basis. Beginning with Asia Pacific, the region returned to growth, increasing 0.7% versus Q3 2019. We saw strong performance in China with results well ahead of normal levels and while Japan has not yet returned to prior year volume, so market continues to show stability. Australia, New Zealand made steady progress in Q3, but were negatively impacted by surges of the virus late in the quarter. Finally, India and other small Southeast Asian countries continue to significantly underperform the broader region. EMEA decreased 5.7% while we saw recovery from Q2, the region did not return to growth in any part of the quarter and we observed a slowing in September due to recent COVID-19 surges and corresponding policy actions. Developed countries excluding the UK showed the strongest signs of recovery, but decelerated in the latter part of the quarter. The UK in emerging markets continue to be a significant drag on overall regional growth and are lagging developed markets recovery. Lastly, the Americas region continued to grow, increasing 3.3% with strong growth of 5% in the US. While the recovery was robust in the US, we observed the same flattening in the recovery curve due to increases in virus surges in September. Similar to Q2, caseloads in elective procedures in hard hit regions are continuing at about 70% to 90% when compared to 2019 volumes. Outside of the US, the rest of Americas continues to lag with numbers well below normal levels. Turning to our business performance for Q3, the global knee business declined 1.4% versus Q3 2019, a marked sequential improvement from the 47% decline we saw in Q2. The US knee business returned to growth, increasing 3% in the quarter. Overall execution was strong with continued momentum for ROSA. Additionally, our persona family of primary revision and partial knee continues to get great traction with existing and new customers. Our global hip business increased 4.4%. Another big sequential improvement from the 31% decline we saw in the Q2. I do want to call out that US hips increased about 10% in the quarter, strong market recovery for sure, but also a great illustration of our commercial team's execution in the backdrop of new product introductions. Sports extremities and trauma sales grew 2.5% over Q3 2019. Notably, the Americas grew about 6% but that growth was offset by softness in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Also strength in upper extremities was partially offset by slower growth in sports and trauma due to lower social activities as a result of COVID. Dental, spine and CMFT increased 6.5% due to strong execution, new products including robotics and market recovery. And finally, our other category was down 11.1%. I'll now walk through our third quarter P&L and liquidity and then share more color and insights that may provide shaping of our expectations for the remainder of the year. So, moving on to the P&L, as we have previously discussed, we move quickly and have taken a disciplined, proactive approach to mitigate the earnings impact of the pandemic, while also enhancing ZB's liquidity profile. Results in the third quarter were better than we expected at the time of our second quarter call, as we saw margins, earnings and cash flow sequentially improve versus the second quarter, consistent with our revenue improvement. In the third quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.81. GAAP earnings per share versus the prior year were lower, primarily due to a sizable one-time Swiss tax credit that the company realized in 2019. For additional details on GAAP results, please refer to today's press release and our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. On an adjusted basis versus 2019, earnings grew in line with revenue growth as lower SG&A spending offset lower gross margins and a higher share count. Adjusted gross margin was 70.6% for the third quarter and as expected, results were sequentially better than Q2, but lower than 2019. Versus the prior year pressure from prior period deferred costs and lower volumes due to COVID were partially offset by a favorable regional mix tailwind as we saw stronger recovery in the US and developed markets in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased sequentially over Q2, driven by commissions related to higher revenues and increased commercial investments. Expenses [ph] were lower than prior year due to the early impact of our restructuring programs and due to moderated investment levels as we continue to navigate pandemic uncertainty. Overall, adjusted operating margins for the quarter was 26.3%, better than expected and driven by the favorable geographic mix in gross margin and a slower ramp on spending. Moving beyond operating margin net interest expense and adjusted other income totaled $52 million and the adjusted tax rate of 16.6% was slightly better than expected due to some modest discrete benefits in the quarter. Turning to cash and liquidity, we'll return to positive free cash flow earlier than expected totaling $287 million. This is lower than the prior year as we used a portion of our better than expected operating cash performance to reduce our AR securitization program. We ended Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of just under $1 billion and our $2.5 billion of credit facilities remain untapped. Relative to the deals that Brian referenced earlier, we expect the cash call to be approximately $80 million in the second half of this year and that will be funded through existing cash balances. Turning to Q4, our consolidated revenue outlook for the remainder of the year has a heightened level of uncertainty, given recent COVID surges that we have seen in a number of markets and due to that backdrop, we will not be providing financial guidance for the fourth quarter. So far, through October regional trends have been similar to what we saw for the full third quarter except for EMEA. That is Asia Pacific and the Americas continue to grow in line with full Q3 growth rates, albeit with more pressure or risk in the US due to increased virus surges. On the other hand, EMEA has worsen due to surges in the virus as declines have accelerated in October with some governments in the region taking new policy actions to limit elective procedure. We expect consolidated Q4 revenue performance to continue to be fluid based on the major variables impacting the recovery, which include the rate of pull-through on the backlog patient anxiety and elective procedure capacity constraints due to COVID surgeons and/or resulting policy actions. While market dynamics remain uncertain [ph] what I do know is that our commercial and supply execution combined with our innovative new product introductions, will continue to drive strong performance relative to the market. Looking ahead on gross margin, we expect sequential improvement, but continued year-over-year pressure due to the same drivers we saw in Q3. Adjusted operating expenses are expected to be sequentially higher in Q4 but down versus prior year as we also saw in Q3. Interest expense will be stable to Q3 and we expect that our tax rate will be slightly higher than Q3 2020. Lastly, fully diluted shares outstanding are expected to step up in Q4, due to the exercise of options as a result of the acceleration of stock price we saw in the third quarter. Longer term, we remain committed to our target of at least 30% adjusted operating margins by the end of 2023. Our near-term initiatives relative to reorganization, consolidation and zero based budgeting, as examples, are complete or near completion. And we are steadily advancing our longer-term structural initiatives around supply and G&A efficiency. To summarize, our underlying business performance is strong. Our execution is on point and ZB's transformation is delivering positive proof points even in the midst of the challenging pandemic. We continue to believe that ZB is well positioned to address near term challenges and to accelerate growth over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Keri. Yes, sure. So, we're not obviously giving guidance on 2021 and I'm not going to speak to Street numbers. What I would say is next year's profile, obviously, it's going to be driven by revenue and a large component of that is going to depend on what happens relative to COVID-19. From a top line perspective, if we saw situation where the recent surges and [ph] experiences begin to abate or moderate and then stabilize, there could be a pathway to seeing a 2021 revenue profile. That's in line with the 2019 revenues. And if we got into next year and saw that stabilization moderation, but also on top of that saw vaccine or credible treatment. In tandem with the vaccine, you could potentially see volumes or revenues ahead of 2019 level. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it from a broad strokes perspective, but there is look [ph] a lot of runway between here and there relative to COVID and how that's going to play out. So, we're going to pause on giving too much additional color beyond that. From a margin perspective, it's really going to fall in line with overall revenue and volumes, right, as you would expect. Volumes and revenue is better, so will margins. That's intuitive. I would say, as we think about our margins going into next year, there are a number of headwinds and tailwinds that we have taken into consideration using sort of second half of this year as a starting point or as a run rate. First on gross margins, we'd actually had a pretty good quarter in Q3. We expect to sequentially step-up in gross margin into Q4 based on overall volumes and seasonality that we typically see in the fourth quarter. But as we move into next year and as overall regional mix starts to stabilize with a stabilization of COVID, we're seeing a mix tailwind right now that may abate into next year. So, that could be a slight headwind, as we go into next year. And then we have had some pressure on overall COGS this year because of lower volumes, because of prior-year deferred costs. Those are going to continue into next year. So, there are a couple of headwinds in gross margin that we're closely watching. Now having said that, we're also very aggressive on our cost down opportunities and cost of goods. So, that could be a tailwind to next year. But we've always talked about coming out of 2020 as part of our broader restructuring program, the 30% operating margin aspiration that you should expect to start to see a stabilization from 2020 as you move out to 2023 when it comes to gross margin. And then within operating margin, I'll tell you we're going to continue to ramp up investment. I think, what you see over the last two quarters was our performance relative to market has been strong. One of the reasons behind that is because we've been making really smart investments and our commercial teams have been optimizing those investments and getting quick ROI those. And so we're going to continue to ramp up that spending because we got a lot of great products. We've got great execution in very strong end markets and so we're going to see a step-up in investment as we move into 2021. Having said all that we're consistent with where we were before that if we saw revenues at 2019 levels, we would expect -- we'd be disappointed if operating margin within 2021 didn't reach those levels, maybe not for the full year, but within 2021, we would expect to get to those margin levels. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit more perspective on how we're thinking about 2021. But, again, a lot more to play out yet with COVID. No, I think, you summarized it really well, Bryan. Yes, I think, Raj... Yes, the extrapolation from there is even in the very acute second surges, we're not seeing anything that resembles what we saw in April and May, right. So, clearly, the end markets, the hospital systems with precision, more deference being provided to them, they are better prepared to deal with COVID. They have better protocols and triage our patients, I mean, they've got incentives to get the elective procedures through. So, that's really the key point of that statement of 70% to 90%. Yes, I think, we actually commented on that on our second quarter call. And some of those very hard hit counties within the states that you mentioned were operating somewhere in that 80% to 90% range. So, we've seen a very consistent pattern coming out for a few months where we've seen heightened surface. So, I think, that's again another positive inflection that we're not going to return back to those periods of April and May, even with acute surges, at least based on what we're seeing today. The time to abate, it really -- it's variable, right, there is no broad statement, it depends on the specific market, the specific sub-market that you're talking about or territory and the number of surges and how quickly -- how big that population is, and how quickly those surge rates come back down. So, it's tough to say. But in some of those hardest hits where we were at 80%, 90%, we've seen a path in some of those where they've gotten back to normal or perhaps a little bit above normal within a few months. But, again, it's really variable from market to market."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "All right. Great, Keri, thank you. And here now with our third virtual earnings call, it was hard to believe that so much time is already passed as we live inside the pandemic environment. But either way we're here, and I certainly hope that you're listening somewhere safe and socially distanced. We're clearly taking precautions here and we continue to follow our safety protocols and that's the reason why Keri, Suky and I are in different locations again for this call. As we've seen in the past hopefully we again do not have any jet mishaps, but just know if we do for whatever reason will push fast and make sure that we move forward. So, 2020 has clearly been unlike any of the year in ZB's nearly 100-year history, as I'm sure it is for every company that's out there right now. And as you know, I think we're all probably too aware, it's not over yet, it's definitely not over year. And that said, I have to say that look at how we have managed and just really navigated COVID-19 this year and specifically in the third quarter. And I'd say that I'm proud of the team, I am confident about ZB's future, I'm more confident now than they ever have been about ZB's future. I truly believe we are well positioned for success and our strategy is absolutely working. As you all know, we've been acutely focused on transforming ZB since I joined the company that's almost three years ago now. We face challenges before and while nothing could have ever prepared us fully for COVID-19, I do believe our ability to rise to those earlier challenges and then truly put us in a stronger position to effectively manage the pandemic situation, the environment that we're in right now. I actually think it's been a catalyst for ZB. The team is focused on our mission, our strategy, how we show up and execute every day is the strongest it's been since I joined the company. And the way I look at it is the things we can control, we are absolutely galvanized around and executing flawlessly against. So, it feels good right now it's much as it's noisy around as the COVID. The execution inside the organization is as strong as I've seen. And that said, the unpredictability of COVID means there are several variables and unfortunately they are pretty big variables that are outside of our control. And as a result, the pandemic continues to be challenging. It continues to be fluid. This requires us to quickly adjust to change given the changing environment. So, ultimately, we can effectively meet the needs of our customers, and very importantly our patients at all times and that's exactly what we've been focused on. Along those lines, there are really three key areas that I'm going to talk about today that I think are important for you take away, be aware of and also see the progress that we're making inside of each. The first one, you should be pretty obvious, it's our view of the COVID-19 recovery path from here, where we see it going. And I think importantly inside of that the areas of concentration or execution that we're going to have inside of the COVID recovery path. The second is an update on our strategy to drive long-term growth and through that value for ZB and for you. And the third is an update on the ongoing transformation of our business, which I truly do believe we're making great progress on. And again I'll spend time on each of these and then I'll pass it to Suky, he's going to give you more detail and color about Q3 on the financials and then how we're thinking about and framing Q4 in our minds. So, first, let's talk about the recovery and execution we saw in the third quarter. Ultimately, the recovery of the electric procedures going from Q2 to Q3 is encouraging. I would imagine is encouraging for everybody at this point looking at Q2 to Q3. But it's still difficult to predict from here what's going to happen. The fact is, we've talked about how the key variables impacting procedure volumes needed to remain constant, obviously they can improve, but they needed to at least stay where they were for the recovery to continue and to see sequential improvement from Q2 to Q3. As you probably remember that we said that these variables included both positive and negative influences on procedure volume. On the positive side, which we pretty obvious, we have the new patient volume and in the backlog of patients that had deferred treatment during the pandemic for whatever reason. On the negative side, we have the effects from the economic downturn, but most importantly surges in the virus that can drive negative policy decisions and/or increased patient fear. Those would be the negative influencers, obviously, if I look at the combination of those in terms of recovery in Q3, the variables played out in a way that allowed continued improvement over Q2. So, overall, the full quarter were stronger than expected and we actually returned to growth over 2019 faster than we thought we would. And this was driven again by these COVID recovery dynamics, but importantly, our team's strong focus on and probably even more importantly execution against our strategy. We've been very focused on moving the strategy forward regardless of the noise around us. We saw a steeper rate of recovery in July, followed by a more modest recovery or even a flattening of the curve toward the end of the quarter. And this was driven by the shift in the recovery variables that I just outlined a minute ago. We've seen continued increasing surges of the virus, especially in Europe, Middle East and Africa and in the US, and this is negatively impacting both patient fear and in certain areas policy decisions. And as a result, we exited the quarter with September growth flat versus 2019. There is not much we can do just end the virus surges, but we have launched a unique and a very large scale direct-to-patient campaign focused on patient fear, right. So, we can't influence the virus, but we could try to influence patient fear and the focus of the campaign is to educate and support patients about their options to get procedures during COVID and really even beyond focusing on the fear the patients typically have to come and get a procedure. And what we're finding early on in this campaign is that the feedback has been very positive and in particular associated with the concept of mymobility and its ability to allow for virtual care capabilities during this challenging time. All right. So, those are obviously some of the factors surrounding COVID and its recovery dynamics. But I also want to make sure that we spend time talking about the things that we have more control over, the execution of our strategy and the performance of our business inside the impact of the pandemic. And even in the midst of this turbulence, we continue to deliver against our goals. This focus and execution against our strategy is the reason we have performed well over the last two quarters versus the overall market. And specifically, if you look at Q3, our performance in US knees and hips is a great example of this underlying momentum. We grew 3% in the quarter in US knees. We also saw 10% growth in US hips. Like I said, these numbers are strong even without the backdrop of COVID. So, the question is going to be, what's driving the performance, I'm sure I'm going to get that right away, so I'm just going to answer it now. Our core business is strong really for four major reasons in the way that we view it. The first is pretty obvious, we have truly shifted from this triaging of execution challenges to launching meaningful innovation. Now, I'm going spend a little bit more time on this one in particular, but that's a big one. Second, our operating mechanism and really the resulting operational discipline has never been stronger, and I would argue probably as good as I've ever seen it anywhere. And third, our compensation programs have shifted towards disproportionately rewarding growth not just paying you for keeping the business you have but truly disproportionately paying and rewarding for growth. And then finally, and I'm not sure if this was causing it or because of it. But our commercial confidence is higher than I've ever seen in my tenure here at ZB, the commercial confidence, the swag or whatever you want to call it, is higher than I've ever seen. So, again, those are really the combination of things that is helping create the momentum inside the pandemic. But let's talk specifically about innovation that as a component of this equation. Broadly speaking, over the last year, we've taken a very dismal, a low single-digit vitality index to a low double-digit number, and that's still not as good as we'd like it to be, but that's a pretty big jump. And with our current product pipeline, I could promise you that's only going to continue to move in the right direction. And as you know obviously vitality index speaks to the percent of sales, driven by new product launches. So, in other words, those products that have been launched within the last three years. The revenue associated with them versus your overall revenue. So, again, a real nice jump in the right direction in vitality index and more coming. But to get a little more specific, I think, go to some of the key launches that you're interested in and I'll start with our knee franchise, our ROSA execution continues and I'm very proud to report that we have already passed the 200 ROSA Knee placement mark in the worldwide placement strategy that we have. And importantly, our utilization continues to increase and the placement pipeline remains very strong. So, again, remember we're way under penetrated in robotics for our business in across all of orthopedics. So, the tailwind associated with ROSA in our opinion is going to be around for a while and it feels very good right now. On the Persona Revision side of things, we keep gaining traction in the marketplace with this product launch, Q3 results were even stronger than the last quarter, which had been our best quarter to date post the launch. And Revision remains on track as I said before to hit $100 million of gross revenue this year, and that's 40% of that will be new growth. In other words $40 million of net of cannibalization revenue this year from Persona Revision by itself. This is really exciting and not only because it shows strong momentum for Persona Revision, but it also opens the door to more growth. Revision System is truly a tip of the spear product. When we converted competitive surgeon to our Revision System, we absolutely have the right to hunt for their primary knee business and that's exactly what we're going to do. And if you know about this marketplace, you would also know that the primary business is usually much larger than the Revision business. So, you can get the order of magnitude of opportunity we have to go after now, so exciting stuff there on the knee side. Shifting to hips Avenir Complete is really, still outperforming our expectations for 2020 that's even with the pandemic impact. These are the expectations that we have for 2020 before we knew about the pandemic, just to give you some perspective on that on how well it's doing. And this launch has really helped provide a great implant to leverage the high growth direct anterior approach submarket in hips, that's one of the most attractive sub-markets in hips in US implant [ph], the perfect opportunity for us to take advantage of that attractive market. And then one more product I'll highlight in the quarter is in our upper extremities business, our Signature ONE Planner, I talked about this last quarter as well. We had another 50-plus-percent increase in surgeon registrations in Q3 and we already have one in four cases using pre-surgical planning for shoulder replacement. This increased penetration of the system is important in my mind two very important ways. First of all, there is a real potential for mix benefit where maybe said another way, share of wallet gain in each procedure that you use pre-surgical planning in and it also provides more stickiness with the surgeon, right, on the surgeon's stickiness it's probably obvious when surgeons using our implant and they're also using a pre-surgical planning, it's harder for them to want to move away from that environment because they are used to it. On the share of wallet benefit, this is may not be as obvious, but it's pretty significant opportunity. It comes because you get a higher utilization in augments and guides when you do a pre-planned procedure versus those without pre-surgical planning is because you know the anatomy before you get in and you know that if you're going to have an anatomy issue, you've already got your augments ready to go and guys ready to go. That's great for the patient because they are going to get better outcome, it's great for the surgeon because they have what they need to do the procedure, and it's great for us because we get more revenue for that surgical procedure. And so very exciting stuff. And so, in short, I would just say that even with the challenges of COVID, we're driving our business forward, meeting our customer needs and improving patient lives as we go. That's the whole missioning [ph] of this organization, right. And it truly is what we do and wake up for every day, alleviating the pain of patients around the world and improving the quality of their life, and we are doing that during COVID. And as a team, we've dealt with many challenges over the past three years. We've prepared us for this moment. I've said it before, this fits on when companies and teams can slow down. They can hesitate, they can take their foot off the pedal. Hey, we're being smart and safe, but we are not letting up and it shows. It shows in the ZB performance and in the energy of this team right now. All right. So, I'm going to move on to cover our strategy to deliver long-term organic growth and ultimately drive more value for ZB and very importantly for you as well. And as we've outlined to drive our strategic pillar of top quartile performance in TSR and truly bring value to you. And ultimately, to achieve mid-single-digit growth, organically, we have got to focus most intensely on driving long-term growth in our key focus areas. And, first, as we've said in the past, the first and foremost area of concentration is above market performance and needs. Just given the size and the scale of this business, we need to be ahead of market here and we're going to do that by focusing aggressively in the fastest growth sub-markets of knee, robotics, data and informatics, cementless, and for us revision. These are the areas of concentration and investment that are going to allow us to sustainably perform above market in knees. And next, we've got to drive consistent at market growth, if not the higher end of market for our performance in S.E.T. And that's focusing on the most attractive sub-elements of S.E.T. For us that's going to be sports and it's going to be extremities. Also, we've got to make sure that we have a consistent at market performance in hips that's in the short-term, right. In the longer term, when we launch into robotics, we absolutely expect above market growth in hips as well. And then finally, while our other businesses, at least at this point, will not receive the same level of investment and will be managed differently, we still expect these businesses to drive in line to the lower end of their market growth. And that's our pathway, that's our pathway for long-term durable 4% to 5% organic growth rates in this business. Okay. So, next I want to talk about ZB's transformation. You've probably heard me outline the three phases of our ZB transformation, now I'm just going to go over them again just quickly here. Phase 1, capturing the hearts and minds of the team, truly capturing the hearts and minds of the team and addressing our execution challenges that was really Phase 1. And with this in mind, we have aggressively shifted to the One ZB mission to One ZB culture, we've added new and very diverse executive talent and we've stabilized the business across all key areas. So, good progress in Phase 1. Phase 2 was really around shifting to a disciplined strategic clarity for the organization, that's more focused on long-term success, not solving problems but truly long-term success. This is where ZB shifts to innovation, drives our strategic plan, has our pillar priorities that are very clear to the organization, locks in our operating mechanisms and involves organizational structure to ensure that we can drive a focused approach to execution of this strategy. In Phase 3, is where we transform for the future. Through active portfolio management we look to change the portfolio complexion to accelerate growth, all right. So, we have made pretty significant and really durable progress in Phase 1. We've laid the foundation for and are absolutely executing against Phase 2 and now we're moving squarely into Phase 3 of the ZB turnaround. And so for us, when I think about Phase 3, I think about that active portfolio management includes three main components and really should include these same three for anyone who is looking at active portfolio management. But the first one is disproportionately investing in our priority businesses, in our priority markets and that would be across research and development commercial infrastructure, just mind share being disproportionately invested in those areas. For number two, being selective in M&A, prioritizing opportunities that are accretive to our weighted average market growth and aligned to our strategy, so selective M&A. And the final one, when appropriate, and in line with our overall strategy divesting non-core assets that are financially less attractive in our core businesses, right. So, those are the three components of active portfolio management in a way that we see them. As we manage the ZB portfolio, we're going to continue to focus on high-growth areas and areas where we truly believe we have a right to win. No size is going to be a factor here, particularly in the short term. And out of the gate, here we can have a preference towards smaller tuck-in deals that can be easily integrated and operationalized while also maintaining very importantly our investment grade rating. And I really do believe this philosophy is apparent when looking at the recent transactions we just highlighted in our earnings press release. Again, while these deals are not material in terms of acquired revenue they are absolutely instrumental in filling some of the product gaps we have at ZB in our ASC in sports portfolios and really they add to our pipeline of new technologies and product launches in markets that are accretive to our growth rates. And these deals are small. So, they're going to be easily integrated and we're going to be able to validate our new deal process, our new team, the integration playbook that we now have in place. So, I think, great first step in the M&A side of things from a -- looking at the individual deals, if I look at the acquisition of incisive. This is an OR solutions company in the $1.2 billion integrated OR market. And this is going to provide ZB with a soon to be launched, it's now launched yet, but a soon to be launched surgical booms and lights portfolio that will help us push more aggressively into the attractive ASC market, which is clearly an area we want to go. We also see some real differentiation, it's not just filling the gap of the portfolio, it shouldn't bring [ph] a differentiation for really two reasons. First of all, we have a smaller footprint and this focuses on reducing the acquisition cost but also the construction cost, which we know is a pretty important aspect of the ASC market, looking at controlling these costs. And the second reason why we think it's differentiated is we've really done a really interesting job incorporating an innovative and automated way to capture data in the operating room that ultimately leverages artificial intelligence, and that helps us in the operating room drive efficiency and productivity and potentially even better outcomes. Again, this is really lending itself to the needs of the ASC setting. So, again, pretty excited about this portfolio opportunity. This idea of a smart alarm and really leveraging data to drive decision support and efficiency is also reflected in our exclusive relationship with [indiscernible]. Through this partnership, we actually see the opportunity to further differentiate our knee ecosystem, which is a major focus of ours right now. Our goal is to launch an intelligent Persona total knee implant that incorporates smart sensor technology. We feel the combination of active data capture from this smart implant that we already have from mymobility and we already have from ROSA is going to provide an unmatched dataset that ultimately could be leveraged through AI for a decision support related to how best to treat and care for the patient. This will give us a unique opportunity we feel to create an intersection between the $4 billion total knee market and the telehealth solution space, which is growing somewhere north of 15%, so a very attractive area for us to differentiate the ecosystem and kind of enter into an adjacent space in telehealth. And the last deal I want to talk about is our acquisition Reline [ph] and this is focused on the sports medicine market, which we know is a $5 billion market and it's growing 5% to 7%. So, again, accretive to our overall weighted average market growth. And this deal clearly helps fill our gaps in arthroscopy capital. The capital makes up about 30% of the sports market, till now we had absolutely no offering in this space. With this acquisition, we have not only filled the gap, we also see some real differentiation in the portfolio. They have done a nice job of again innovatively consolidating three tower components into a single comprehensive system, both at the equipment side and on the end [ph] vector side. This is the first in the industry. This system is very early in commercialization stage. But I would say it's getting very positive feedback early on, and we see this as another great opportunity to drive a successful product launch, leveraging our ZB commercial infrastructure, which we absolutely know we can do. So -- and I would just say, hey, we've got other portfolio management opportunities in the near term funnel and we're not ready to talk about those yet, but we have [indiscernible] the funnel and we will continue to keep you up-to-date as we make progress here. And finally, we are fully committed to our margin expansion goal of at least 30% operating margin by the end of 2023. And Suky is going to talk more about this, but our restructuring plan is on track and the cost savings we're delivering will help drive margin expansion, which has got to be there, but also support reinvestment in the business for growth. It's got to be able to do both. And that was what the whole idea of behind the restructuring plan was. So, again, Suky will give more detail on that, but it's on track so far. Overall, we are clearly watching the COVID recovery trends closely and completely realize as everybody does the short-term market performance and I want to reiterate market performance is out of our direct control as a result of the COVID recovery trends. That said and I hope it is very clear, we feel confident in ZB, we feel confident in our business strength in our execution and the long-term growth prospects we have as a business. And as a result of that the value creation opportunity we have as a company, okay. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky, again, for more financial details for the quarter and looking forward. Suky? Yes. So, I appreciate the question. So, what I would tell you is that the -- what we saw in Q3 because we actually saw a positive growth relatively in line, if not a little above say, for instance, in hips in like a typical market growth. That would indicate that we did not build further backlog or deferred patients in a way that I calculated in Q3. That said, we still have hundreds of millions of dollars of deferred patients that will eventually come back in the funnel. So, I still feel very bullish about the fact that we have these deferred patients. There are patients, as we know for most of our business that has a disease that progresses. It does not get better by itself. And as a result of that those patients typically come back in the fall. So, I wouldn't say that we built more backlog in Q3, but we certainly still have quite a bit of backlog to go through. So that's my view of where we are from a backlog standpoint. And again, I think, eventually when we get to the point where we have a vaccine that people have confidence in it or treatment that people have confidence in. We're going to have that backlog of patients begin to come through in concert with new patients and that should be a really nice headwind for our business, looking forward in that day for sure. And for just clarification, just to make sure that 200 to 300 is what we've done from operational standpoint since launch. And there wasn't 200 to 300 that we would expect just in 2020, but it would be since launch, which is just call about a little over a year and a half now since full launch of the ROSA System. But I'd tell you that, hey, I'm pretty enthusiastic as it the team around the ROSA placements that we saw in Q3, it was the best quarter that we've had relative to the number of installations we did in a single quarter. And I can tell you that that momentum is continuing into Q4. And even though, I think, it will be slightly better, if it is still slightly better than what we did in Q3, that's what our expectation will be in Q4. And so that pipeline, if I'm just going to call, future customers is robust as it's ever been with our product. And as I mentioned before in the prepared remarks, I really do believe the under penetration of robotics is it such a point that this is a tailwind for the organization for a long time to come. And it's a very exciting tailwind. No question about it. Because not only is it before us [ph], it's to the patient. It really is providing a level of accuracy in the operating room that you can see when you're in the operating room with surgeon. Forget studies, we've got those coming, but when the surgeon uses the robotic system in the operating room, you can see the lights go off -- I mean go on. They clearly understand that they have an opportunity to get better cuts more accurate cuts, but also and very importantly feedback right away in the operating room around tissue balancing. It's really you need to see actually to have an opportunity to go and see that kind of light bulb go off in the surgeon's mind when they're using it is pretty amazing. Relative to 2021, I don't want to give specifics there. But what I would tell you is that I would be disappointed if the level of placements that we saw in Q3 and Q4 which were better than the first half of 2020. I would be disappointed if that level of placement didn't continue into 2021, right. And that would indicate in fact that does happen that 2021 should have more placements overall than 2020 did. So, again, I think real positive momentum, great feedback from our customers and a really strong pipeline of future customers that are out there right now. Sure. Can we go to the next question, please? Yes. Maybe great. Okay. So, what I would tell you is that the deals that we just talked about, obviously, are not super accretive relative to acquired revenue growth just [ph] not much there. Think about most product launches that we have facilitating product launches in these very attractive spaces ASC, it would also be in sports, which is kind of a combination ASC impact, and then also in the data informatics portion of things. But I would absolutely expect revenue growth to be driven in 2021, I wouldn't say 2022. I definitely believe that the portfolio being provided by these acquisitions will immediately give us traction to be able to go out and hunt in the ASC marketplace, in the sports marketplace and continue in 2021 to provide more unique offerings inside of our knee category and we talked about that knee ecosystem. So, it's all three [ph] of the things that we just talked about in prepared remarks, we will provide revenue growth just not acquired revenue growth in 2021 and well beyond by the way. As far as divestitures go, clearly, I wouldn't talk about the time frame, I don't want to give anybody any [ph] expectation here. But the fact is when we think about active portfolio management that is one of the vectors. One of the obvious ones is M&A. And for us M&A that we're going to focus on will always be to build scale and or innovation that matters in markets that are accretive to our ZB weighted average market growth. And very importantly, where we think we have a right to win and see a clear path to leadership in those categories that would potentially be on the docket for divestiture. It would in those areas that are not as financially attractive to the business are not as core to our strategy and where we don't really see a clear pathway to leadership. Those would be the things that we would look at when we think about sharing the business, but I just don't want to give you a specific time frame because I don't want to set that expectation. But just know that that is part of the equation as we think about active portfolio management with the intent over time to move more of our revenue in higher growth markets, right, as we intend. If we're going to be a top quartile performer in total shareholder return, we have to have more of our revenue in higher growth markets, I'm just talked about mid-single-digits to upper single-digit growth markets and that's the intent of the active portfolio management process. Okay. Maybe I'll hit that piece first. What I would tell you is we're definitely seeing it's not dramatic, but we're already seeing a slight shift back towards customers having a desire to acquire either lease or acquire the robotic systems and it almost seems like it's already starting although not nearly at the pace that it was, let's say, last year. And so I would guess, it's purely a guess, but I would again based on that assume that as we move into 2021 you might see more of a shift in that direction. But I just don't have a good sense for where it's going to land. I'll say [ph] it right now, it's definitely the larger portion of installations are these placement programs which is truly what we would prefer. I really like having that longer-term contract in relationship with the customer that does require certain volume commitment to the company and we're just building that relationship in a more stable way. But I would assume that as our customers get more confidence in the market that they may want to shift back to where they were before which is maybe acquiring more. I just don't want to give you a sense for what the percentage would be, but it is moving slightly back in that direction. Relative to Q3, interestingly enough even though there were some sales of ROSA in Q3. On a relative basis, it was actually a headwind for us. If I think about US knees particularly I talked about 3% growth in the US knees. If I eliminated ROSA as a part of that and just looked at core knees, and base knees, we actually grew closer to 4%, even a little better than 4% in base knees in the US. So, it was almost 100 bps of -- actually a little more than 100 bps of headwind from ROSA in the quarter. So, hopefully that answers the question. Yes. Absolutely. I mean, the fact is, when we look at the performance in Wright, they had a pretty good quarter. So, clearly, at least based on that performance one would indicate that it's not disruptive yet. Always hoping for things to happen, I would be very happy if there was disruption when you try to bring those two organizations together finally. The fact is, most of the time in our industry when they're bringing two organizations together is dis-synergy risk there just is. And that's why I like some of the small deals that we just did, it really eliminates that dis-synergy risk because there are really more product launches versus bring two sales organizations together. So, I would expect at some point just given the historical views of acquisitions in our space that you are going to see some level of the dis-synergy and hoping that we have an opportunity to take advantage of that. That said, I hope is [ph] in a strategy we have a very clear strategy in our extremities business and we're executing against that. And I feel very confident in the commercial infrastructure we're putting together, the product pipeline that we have and the traction that we're getting in the marketplace right now with or without disruption from our competitors. Thanks. Maybe what I'll do for that one is just pass it over to Suky to provide a little more color there. I know you had some of that in your prepared remarks, Suky, but maybe you can comment on that. I'm sorry, could you repeat that, I missed part of the -- the first part of your question, you went out a little bit for me. Could you repeat that? Oh, I guess, yes. Yes, I'd say, it's -- that's the most exciting thing for me on Persona Revision. And probably it was a little ostomy to take impurities [ph] in the beginning, because I assume the better connection between Revision sets and primary, but what we're finding is that a good portion of that $40 million or so of competitive conversion [ph] where we have the primary business already, we did not have the Revision System. But a lot of them or the other way around, but we didn't have the primary or the Revision. And so when we pick up that Revision business, it absolutely, as I said before, gives us a right to hunt for the primary business. And it's an order of magnitude larger than the Revision business. So, if you just look at the market differential, let's call, Revision somewhere in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% of the overall knee market. The rest of it is really primary unit that are out there. And that again once we get the Revision business, we then can go after that primary, the unit that the surgeon is doing. And it doesn't mean you're going to natural get or automatically get it but you again have a right to go after it and you build the trust and you build the relationship with the surgeon and it gives you that chance. So, I absolutely expect two things in 2021, continued competitive conversions with primary and with Revision, but also that opportunity to pull in the primary business as well. And it will clearly be one of the catalysts that we use to continue to drive towards above market growth in knees just as we've been saying. It will absolutely be one of the variables that will drive us in that direction in 2021. Sure. Yes. So, maybe, Suky, I'll start, if you want to provide any more color feel free to do so. I would say, generally, what you're saying is accurate, I would say that Asia Pacific which is clearly being less impacted by surgeons in the virus seem to be relatively consistent. Again, it's early in the quarter based on what we've seen so far, pretty consistent with the growth rates that we saw in Q3, overall, Q3. The Americas, even though it's a positive growth, it has slightly decelerated versus Q3. But the good news is even with the surges that we're seeing in the US, we're still seeing positive growth. And it's close relative to what we saw in Q3 again, it's early. And the risk feels a little more tenuous right now because the surges are so much more prominent than they were in Q3. But the fact is that US is hanging in there and still has positive growth, but in EMEA, to your point, we are seeing more pressure. The policy decisions and the reaction to the virus surge is more acute in Europe, Middle East and Africa. No question about it. And I would expect Q4 to be slower growth and it was already negative in Q3 than Q3 was. And so we're really watching this everywhere, obviously, but right now, Europe, Middle East and Africa is a key area of focus for us to understand what's happening in that region. And then importantly, inside of that storm, if you will, what are we going to do to make sure that we stay ahead of the competition while it's occurring. Anything else you want to add? Thanks. Well, let me clarify what you're saying there is, what you're saying is that, so take the US, for instance, if you look at a specific state or a county inside the US that is being very hard hit by surges, what he was referencing is that even in those very hard hit areas, the county or the state, you're still seeing 70% to 90% of procedure volumes that you would typically see, say, versus 2019. So, that doesn't necessarily mean that broad-based, we're seeing 70%, 90% of demand, it's just, let's say that in that hard-hit area, you're still seeing 70% to 90% of typical procedure volume, so that is what he was referencing. Okay. We don't really provide a breakdown beyond the S.E.T. overall category. But what I would tell you is that the US and I think that Suky referenced this in your prepared remarks, you said I think that the overall S.E.T. category. The US was definitely the strongest performer in the world. I think, we have somewhere neighborhood the 6% in US S.E.T. performance from a growth standpoint. So, that would indicate that we clearly had lower growth in other parts of the world, which isn't surprising when you think about our S.E.T. category, say, for instance in Asia Pacific, a bigger part of that category would be trauma in that region plus other [ph] regions, just given the dominance or the significant portion of revenue in each [ph] specific that China has. And even though we're seeing less surges of the virus in that part of the world, we still are seeing less activity. And that typically will drive lower volumes and/or lower revenue growth in sports, it would drive lower revenue growth in trauma. So, just when people aren't moving as much and they are not doing as much, we typically see those two businesses with inside of S.E.T. get hurt. And I would tell you that as we talked a lot about, we've had pretty significant focus in extremities obviously upper extremities is one of the key areas of focus for us. And I would just say, our growth rate there is promising. And that's probably all the detail I provide below S.E.T. But overall, if I look at the category, the US region -- the US or the Americas was definitely the strongest growth region. All right, great. Thanks, everyone."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, August 4, 2020. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participations are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, and Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me virtually today are Bryan Hanson, our President and CEO; and CFO, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website at zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: Great. Thanks, Keri. And before we started, I just want to say that I certainly hope that you\u2019re safe, your families are healthy, and that you\u2019re doing everything you can to manage through this very unusual situation that we find ourselves in. Speaking of that, once again, we find ourselves in an earnings call where we\u2019re in different places. We\u2019re not held together. And my guess is, as we may have some mishaps, potentially anyway, when we hand off to each other, so I\u2019m just going to apologize ahead of time for any mishaps that we see through the handoffs here, and potentially any background noises we might get. Obviously, this is an unprecedented time for all of us, very challenging time as we deal with the pandemic here in the U.S. and around the globe. And we, as a result of that, want to talk about the virus today. We want to talk about how we\u2019re managing through it. We want to talk about how we\u2019re modeling its potential impact. But, we really also want to make sure that we spend some time on our underlying strength of the business that we have and our plans for long-term growth. And along those lines, I\u2019m really going to try to center the conversation around three main topics. The first one is obviously our execution and the financial results in Q2, but really spent time in Q2 on the strength of the underlying business and why we\u2019re feeling confident in the things that we can control. The second thing would be around our broader modeling and our assumptions on a go forward basis associated with the pandemic. May not be associating as you want there, but we\u2019re simply going to give you the best that we can on how we\u2019re looking at it. And then, the final piece would be just on our long-term plan for growth. What are the things we\u2019re going to be focusing on to be able to get sustained growth in the future? So, first, let\u2019s talk about the second quarter, and I want to begin with saying that safety, as I said, last quarter, continues to be our top priority. Safety of our team members, our customers, our patients, the communities that we serve, and we continue to execute on that comprehensive global pandemic plan that we did develop last year. Believe it or not, I said before, we actually developed that plan before this all happened. And we\u2019ve been putting that into action at the very earlier stages of COVID-19. And as a result of that plan and our additional safety protocols, we\u2019ve definitely seen changes to how we work and have learned a lot about how we can more efficiently collaborate across the globe, significant changes associated with that. But importantly, these safety-related protocols have not -- they have not caused disruptions in our supply chain and our ability to meet our customer demand, and then our ability to serve those patients who rely on our technology and our products to improve the quality of their life. And I\u2019d say, I\u2019m really proud of how seriously the entire ZB team has taken our collective safety. And I want to thank each and every one of our team members, especially our manufacturing and commercial teams, who have just gone above and beyond during this entire time, during a very challenging time. I just can\u2019t thank you enough. So, in terms of our Q2 execution and performance, I\u2019m going to cover some broad takeaways, and then I really want Suky, after I finish, to get into more specific detail, maybe more than what we would typically get into, just given the current circumstances. So first, the recovery that we\u2019ve seen to date and really specifically in Q2 is encouraging. Now it\u2019s early, but so far, it\u2019s been better than we expected. Based on what we are seeing and really just experiencing in the recovery, there is real reason for optimism. But, given the number of unknowns related to COVID, I would say, it\u2019s more prudent to be cautiously optimistic right now. You\u2019re going to hear that theme throughout the discussion today. We\u2019re watching closely and continuing to see rising patient demand, which is key, right? We\u2019ve got to see that patient demand. And that\u2019s resulting obviously in increased procedure volumes. And very importantly, we\u2019re also seeing that majority of surgeons and hospitals are ramping up capacity to support that demand. It\u2019s a pretty big variable associated with whether or not you can get that backlog patient and the new patient coming in. And so, as a result of this, our Q2 performance was better than we expected across all of our regions, and in particular, we saw strength in the U.S. And I got to say, the U.S. recovery performance is really encouraging to me, as this is momentum that we\u2019re seeing despite the resurgence of the virus in many of our states. Importantly, this trend has continued into July, even as some of the states with the rising COVID numbers like Florida, Texas and Arizona. So again, even though we\u2019re seeing that of resurgence of the virus, we still are pretty bullish on what we\u2019re seeing in U.S. so far. Clearly, and for good reason, everyone is going to focus on the impact of COVID in the quarter, and probably more importantly, its forward-looking impact on our business. And we\u2019re absolutely going to talk about that in a minute. But the last thing I want to discuss for Q2, centers more around the things we can actually directly control, even during the pandemic, and the activities that ultimately will drive durable growth and strengthen our business. So, through the pandemic, I can tell you that we have remained maniacally-focused on executing against our growth drivers, and that focus is delivering results, and we saw those in the second quarter. So, I\u2019m going to just start with what I know everyone wants to hear about is our progress with ROSA. Now, obviously, robotics plays an important part of our strategy on a go-forward basis. And importantly, we continue to see very strong demand for ROSA, even through the pandemic. And also importantly, we\u2019re getting very good feedback from surgeons that are using the system. And while I can tell you that I\u2019m not going to provide the level of detail I\u2019m about to give you, probably ever again, I do want to give you some additional insights into where we are with ROSA and the launch, just given the fact that it\u2019s being hidden right now with all the clouds, I guess, associated with the COVID impacts on our business. So, I was just going to say, so we\u2019re now about a year away from the full launch of our business, about a year into that launch. And we now have about 150 ROSA Knee Systems out in the globe. And the good news is, we\u2019re seeing with those units, very strong utilization per unit. And some of those are newly placed, so you\u2019re not seeing the same volume yet. But this has been out there for a while, we\u2019re getting very good utilization per unit. And if I just kind of add it up and I look at the current procedural volumes that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re really on pace to be doing about 3,000-plus cases per quarter. And just to put that into context, now relative to growth, that\u2019s more than double the procedural volumes that we would have seen in the fourth quarter of 2019. And by the way, that\u2019s inside of the pressure on elective procedures that we\u2019re seeing as a result of the pandemic. In addition to that, we\u2019ve got a number of accounts in our active pipeline, a whole bunch of companies in the active pipeline. Some of those will fall out, but based on the volume of accounts in that pipeline, we\u2019ll be very disappointed if we don\u2019t have between 200 and 300 ROSA systems out in the market by the end of this year. So, I would just say, for ROSA, we continue to keep very-strong momentum and remain on track actually slightly ahead of our expectations for both, system placements and procedures, even with the pressure of COVID in this environment. So, good news obviously on the ROSA front. Another great example of strong innovation and commercial prowess is the Persona Revision story that we\u2019re seeing play out and saw play out in the second floor. Our launch of the revision system is well ahead of plan, believe it or not, and receiving very positive remarks from current Persona users, which is important. But, even more importantly, we\u2019re seeing very-positive remarks from competitive services, which is where we want to make sure that we\u2019re focusing. In some of the key areas of feedback are really a lot of excitement around the ease-of-use of the system, a significant excitement around precision and the intuitive nature of the instruments that we have, which is important in this procedure, and also the ability to provide all the benefits of a more personalized fit for the patient that Persona brings to the table and do this in revision system, which again, is unique in the marketplace. So, just for perspective, the Persona Revision surpassed our expectations in Q2 and delivered the most successful quarter to date since launch. Let\u2019s kind of repeat that. It\u2019s the most successful quarter to date since launched, in Q2, which is the quarter that\u2019s been most impacted by the pandemic. The demand is still very-robust even outside of that. We already have doubled the instrument sets originally anticipated for the launch to support that demand. And again, for context, this product is on a trajectory to reach close to $100 million in revenue during 2020. Some of that\u2019s going to be cannibalized out, as you cannibalize revenue. And I would expect, the capitalization rate to be about 60%. So, again, on track to do $100 million or very close to it in 2020, and I would expect about 60% cannibalization of that revenue. And we also have continued our focus on driving our dedicated commercial team for extremities as I\u2019ve talked about quite a bit. And we\u2019ve been very-pleased that our Signature ONE Planner shoulder system continues to gain traction, again, even in Q2. Now, surgeon registrations, just to give you some perspective for Signature ONE increased nearly 60% in Q2 sequentially over Q1. And our recent FDA clearance also enables even greater integration of that system with our family of implants and guides, that\u2019s going to open up even more opportunities. We\u2019ve also increased the portability of the system. We\u2019re really trying to make it more open architecture, so that you can use it on your computer, but you can also put it on my iPad or an iPhone, so that if you\u2019re walking in and out of the surgery and the operating room, you can still use the system, increase that portability, which surgeons want. So, we\u2019re excited again about our shoulder franchise and the impact that this system will have on our success there. And then, finally, mymobility. Our partnership with Apple continues to be a prime example of how research and development, investment in tech innovation are going to drive the next wave of telemedicine advances, and we truly believe will change the patient and surgeon experience in our space. And with mymobility, what we\u2019re really focusing on is ensuring that we have that patient-physician communication link that\u2019s even better than it was before, but allowing this to happen more virtually. The system also helps improve adherence to the pre and post-patient requirements because that information is the pushed to the patient when they need to actually do something. And very importantly, it\u2019s advancing the collection and the analysis of patient-specific data points that ultimately can help the care team make the best and most personalized care decisions for that patient. In June, we announced with Apple a new application. It\u2019s going to be able to provide now gauge quality functionality within mymobility, and that will happen this fall. And that\u2019s a pretty exciting development and a big step forward, no pun intended, in this remote data collection journey. Again, with the idea of collecting data that is personalized with the patient and ultimately as a result of having that provide better care decisions. So, the mymobility functionality in today\u2019s COVID environment is especially interesting because it does allow for this significant demand that we\u2019re seeing right now for allowing effective and engaged, remote and virtual patient care. So, we\u2019re excited clearly about mymobility, we were before the pandemic, but certainly this is giving us some additional steam in the marketplace. So, moving to the second key area of focus for the earnings call, I want to talk about COVID-19 and our modeling assumptions for the rest of this year. And we\u2019re encouraged about what we saw in Q2 and are confident in our ability to continue to execute. But we understand, and I think probably everybody does, the near-term uncertainty that COVID-19 brings. Our thinking regarding COVID is obviously changing. It\u2019s evolving, it\u2019s sharpening as we experience more of its actual impact on our procedures, and over time, we\u2019re also seeing the impact on various markets and submarkets. And so, I\u2019d like to think about just based on that knowledge that we\u2019re getting, we can refine our thinking here and explain it really by talking about three major variables that I think we\u2019ve got to pay attention to. One of those variables would be a tailwind for us created by the pandemic, and then, two would be headwinds that we\u2019ve got to pay attention to. So, the first, when we talk about the tailwind, it\u2019s just going to be backlog of deferred patients that we have built. These are both, the initial deferred procedures that we saw in the beginning and the building backlog that\u2019s continuing to happen. From a headroom standpoint, I really look at it two ways. One would be around those patient specific factors, patient fear or unemployment for instance, and then the second one would be around the recurrence of the virus. And I would think about that in two ways, the recurrence having an impact on actual bed capacity and the recurrence having an impact on policy decisions that could directly impact elective procedures, okay? So, that\u2019s kind of the variables that I think about in determining where we think this is going to go. Relative to the backlog, I think, it\u2019s really important to note that the approximate value of this backlog just for ZB, just for this company is already worth about $700 million to $800 million in revenue. That\u2019s the approximate value of the backlog already created. It\u2019s worth about $700 million to $800 million in revenue, future revenue. And this value continues to grow and the factor that continues to grow and will continue to grow until the market returns to normal market growth rates. Relative to the headwinds, given that we are currently seeing play out, I would say that patient fear and virus recurrence impacting specifically bed capacity are the two most significant threats. I would say that policy decisions and unemployment concerns would be less material, at least based on the rate that we\u2019re seeing policy decisions roll out right now. So, the key takeaway -- I am just giving you a lot of information on these variables than I\u2019m paying attention too. If the variables that I really just described, continue to play out as they are today, we would expect that sequential improvement seen in Q2 would continue through the back half of 2020, but likely at a more modest pace in Q3, Q4. Just to repeat that, if the variables that I just described, continue to play out just as they are today, just what we\u2019re seeing today, we would absolutely expect the sequential improvement that we saw in Q2 to continue in the back half, but it would be in a more modest pace. And another important aspect of this equation, I think sometimes this is lost, so it\u2019s important thing to bring up, is that the two most significant headwinds become non-variables once a vaccine is available. And the vast majority of those patients that didn\u2019t get treatment for either of these reasons, become a tailwind eventually for our business, remembering that this is a progressive disease. And as a result of the progressive nature of that disease, the vast majority of these deferred patients will eventually reenter the procedural funnel and become a tailwind for us. Finally, I\u2019d like to also spend a portion of my time today talking about the third category, which is our long-term plan for growth. And I can tell you that our strategy is relatively simple. You\u2019ve heard me talk about it before. Not all of our businesses are going to be treated the same. All of our businesses are important to us, but they\u2019re not all going to be invested in or managed the same. We have prioritized the high growth and most strategically relevant areas of our business. And we\u2019re going to make very-disciplined investments there to continue to drive innovation, innovation centered around improving patient outcomes and also providing for procedure efficiencies. And to drive our strategic pillar of top quartile performance in TSR, we have to focus most intently and driving long-term growth in these key areas. Number one -- and yes, said this before, but number one, we must achieve above market growth in these. And just given the size and scale of this business for us, we need to be ahead of market here. And we\u2019re going to do that by focusing more aggressively in the fastest growth sub-markets of knee, robotics, data and informatics, revision like I just talked about. Next, we need to see and drive consistent at-market, actually as a higher end of the market range for S.E.T. We need to see that happen for our business. And we\u2019re going to do that again by focusing more of our attention in those most attractive sub elements of S.E.T. Also, we need to consistently deliver at-market performance in hips in the short-term. That\u2019s all marking [ph] for us, at-market performance in the short-term but transitioning to above market growth with our future robotics launch in this space. And then, finally, while our other businesses, at least at this point, will not receive the same level of investment and they will be managed differently, we still would expect that these businesses would drive in line, maybe to the lower end of market growth for these areas. Okay. So, that\u2019s the way we think about our businesses and the way that we\u2019re going to invest in them. And by focusing on these markets, just as I\u2019ve described, we believe that over time, our pursuit of consistent and sustainable mid-single-digits organic growth rates is absolutely possible. Now, to fuel the investment needed to drive this long-term growth and at the same time, drive margin expansion over time, we\u2019ve continued to focus and execute on our restructuring program. And the last piece, when it comes to long-term growth, is our M&A strategy, and this is going to be key for us. And it remains consistent with what we outlined in 2019 and earlier this year. We will continue to focus on high-growth areas and the areas where we truly believe we have a right to win. The size is going to be a factor here as well with a preference, at least at the outset toward tuck-in deals that we can easily integrate and operationalize, while also maintaining an investment grade rating. So overall, I think it\u2019s obvious, we feel confident in our business strength and execution, in the current pace of recovery from COVID, in our long-term growth prospects. And, we\u2019ve already learned so much from COVID-19. While it\u2019s a challenge that none of us would really want to face, the fact is, we do believe that it has reinforced the strength of our business strategy. And I believe that it\u2019s positively impacted our team engagement and our One ZB culture. And trust me, we will focus on leveraging our learnings to accelerate ZB\u2019s transformation. At the end of the day, there\u2019s a lot of short-term variables associated with COVID that demand, a level of caution. But make no mistake, we are very optimistic about our path forward. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Suky to get into more financial details. Suky?\nSuky Upadhyay: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. I hope all of you are well. I\u2019d like to reiterate Bryan\u2019s most recent comments that our underlying fundamentals remain strong and our long-term growth profile is compelling. Before jumping into the specifics, I would summarize our second quarter performance as simply being better-than-expected. Revenue was ahead of expectations, driven by fast recovery in most markets, which led to better margins, and we ended the quarter with a strong cash position and ample liquidity. Net sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion, a reported and operational decrease of about 38% from the prior year, driven by the pandemic. We saw the deepest impact on elective procedures and revenue in April, but then saw a rapid recovery with sequential improvement in May and June. While we\u2019re not at normal procedure volumes yet, we are encouraged by the trends since April, as all of our regions and businesses performed better-than-anticipated, since our first quarter call. We will look more closely at our Q2 revenue trends, starting with regional performance and then hit it to our businesses. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my commentary will be on a constant currency basis. Beginning with Asia Pacific, the region decreased about 18% in the second quarter versus the same period in the prior year. While China demonstrated sharp V-shaped recovery since April, posting improvement in May and growth in June, most other markets in the region continued to perform below normal run rates. In Japan, our largest market in Asia Pacific, we\u2019ve seen a different profile as that market never got to trough levels experienced in China and was stable in Q2, operating at about 80% of normal run rates. Australia and New Zealand, our third largest market in Asia Pacific observed a sharp decline and a sharp recovery within Q2 and continues to make progress back to normalization. And smaller markets within Asia Pacific continue to struggle with containing the virus and implementing effective policies, and accordingly procedures were down substantially in the second quarter. But, there\u2019s a wide disparity across the sub-markets within the region. But, as expected, a common theme is that we see improvement in the number of elective procedures when the infection rates are stable or declining and where there\u2019s deterrence to physicians and hospitals to make treatment decisions based on the local situation. This holds true for other regions as well. Moving to EMEA, the region decreased 49% in the second quarter. As with other regions, we observed the deepest trough in April and then saw steady improvement through the quarter across all major markets, with the exception of the UK where patients continue to be deferred at very-high rates. Overall, developed markets with EMEA are recovering well. By the end of the second quarter, Germany has started to approach prior year procedure volumes. France, Italy and Spain also improved significantly this quarter and showed the fastest recovery in the region in June. While not yet back to normalized levels, we are encouraged by this progress. Emerging markets in EMEA are improving, but generally continue to lag developed markets in that pace of recovery. Last week, the Americas decreased 40% in the second quarter. As we talked about on our last quarterly call, the COVID-19 impact ramped up materially in mid-March with federal and state governments guidance to defer elective procedures. April was the trough in Americas, but we saw stronger than expected recovery in May and June, as U.S. states reopened. In the U.S., while there are variations week to week, to-date, we have seen approximately 50% of states at or above prior year cases levels, with 80% of states above 90%, when compared to last year. While progress in the U.S. has been good, other markets within the Americas continue to struggle and operate well below normal levels. For example, if you strip out the rest of the Americas from the U.S., you\u2019d see that the U.S. hip and knee growth was actually about 200 to 300 basis points higher than the total Americas number. So clearly, non-U.S. markets in the Americas are still struggling and creating a drag on overall regional performance. Importantly, in the U.S., and in other regions and markets, we\u2019re seeing second waves of steep infection growth. However, we clearly see that the healthcare systems in general are better equipped to address the pandemic, such that we\u2019re not seeing an erosion of elective procedures at the same level as observed in April. For example, in some of the hardest hit counties within Texas, we continue to see procedure volumes at 80% or better prior year volumes, see a similar pattern in other severely hit states. Since the second quarter in July, we\u2019ve seen continued progress and sequential improvement in elective procedure trends. Next, let\u2019s turn to our businesses for Q2. Our global knee business declined 47%. As we talked about last quarter, prior to the pandemic, we saw strong performance in this category, driven by improved operational execution and the continued positive impact of the Persona Revision launch. As Bryan talked about a few minutes ago, ROSA Knee continues to be an important growth driver for us in the near term and the long term. And our ecosystem strategy in the knee business and other categories is really starting to take traction. Our global hip business declined 31% in the second quarter. We continue to see our hip business recover faster than the knee business, pointing to somewhat less elective nature of these procedures. And we continue to see strong traction for our Avenir Complete launch. Sports, extremity and trauma sales declined 29% in Q2. This decline was less pronounced than what we observed in large joints, primarily due to the non-elective nature from trauma. However, the trauma market continued to be pressured due to reduced activity levels related to widespread quarantine, and stay-at-home orders. Dental, spine and CMFT sales declined 37% in the quarter. We\u2019ve seen stronger recovery in spine due to recent new product introductions, including Tether. Also, much like our hip business, spine procedures are seen as less elective by many physicians and patients, primarily due to the pain burden. Finally, our other category was down 44% versus the prior year. Looking beyond Q2, as you know, we withdrew our 2020 full year financial guidance in April due to the uncertainty related to procedure volume uptake. The impact of COVID-19 continues to be fluid and there are a number of market dynamics and variables that we are unable to reliably quantify at this time. As such, we will not be providing updated financial guidance for 2020. But, we do want to share information and insights that may provide shaping of our revenue expectations for the remainder of the year. To give you a sense of the sequential improvement we saw through the second quarter, remember that, on our first quarter call, we noted that, revenues were down about 70% in April across the full business. By the end of the quarter, in June, that decline was only 3.6% down. However, it\u2019s important to note that there was an additional selling day in June 2020 versus June 2019. After adjusting for the additional day in 2020, June was down 13.5%. There was no day rate impact on the full quarter. So, the key takeaway is, if the variables that Bryan described earlier, continue to play out as they are today, we expect the sequential improvement seen in Q2 to also continue through the back half of 2020, but likely at a more modest pace. Now, let\u2019s turn to P&L liquidity. We\u2019ve taken a disciplined and proactive approach to mitigate the earnings impact of the pandemic and enhance our liquidity profile. Results in the quarter were a little bit better than expected since our first port of call and we would expect margins, earnings and cash flow to improve as our revenue profile improves moving forward. In terms of our second quarter results, we reported GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter of $1 and adjusted diluted earnings per share $0.05. GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter were negative and lower than the prior year, due primarily to the impact of the pandemic, and I will speak to that as part of our adjusted results. Adjusted earnings per share were lower than the prior year, driven by lower revenues and higher cost of goods. Adjusted gross margins were 65.5% for the second quarter, due to less favorable mix and lower fixed costs absorption as a result of decreased production volumes. Adjusted operating expenses were lower due to reduced variable selling expense, the continued early impact of our restructuring program and cost reductions we actioned to deal with the pandemic. As we previously discussed, we were able to flex quickly on COVID-19-related cost reductions in the fourth quarter by leveraging the restructuring programs already in place. Overall, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 5.7%, substantially lower than the prior year. But again, a bit better than what we expected on our first quarter call. Moving beyond operating margin, net interest expense of $54 million was down versus the prior year, due to debt pay-down in 2019. And our adjusted tax rate was 42.8% in the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate was distorted in the quarter due to discrete tax expenses on a small base of pre-tax income. We do not expect that trend to continue moving forward. Moving to cash and liquidity in the quarter. While free cash flow was negative $145 million, we ended Q2 with higher cash and cash equivalents of $713 million, further strengthening our liquidity position. Also, we continued to maintain $2.5 billion in additional liquidity through our credit facilities, which remain untapped. We believe we\u2019re well-positioned from a capital structure standpoint. In terms of our P&L for the remainder of 2020, we expect that operating expenses will continue to ramp up in the second half of the year when compared to Q2, as we were seeing higher investment levels in R&D and commercial initiatives, in tandem with higher revenues. Interest expense will be a bit higher in the second half of the year versus the first half, driven by the refinancing of debt this year and the additional $1 billion facility put in place. For the adjusted tax rate, a full year rate is expected to be about 100 basis points higher than what we originally guided in February, driven by a change in geographic mix of income due to COVID-19. Overall, we expect that margins, earnings and cash flow will improve as our revenue profile improves. From a longer term perspective, we remain committed to achieving at least 30% operating margin in 2023. As we continue to track well versus our restructuring plans. To summarize, our underlying business and our financial fundamentals remain strong, such that as the market continues to improve, we expect our financial performance will also improve. I continue to be extremely proud of how the ZBT has responded and performed over the past few months. We believe, we\u2019re well-positioned to address the current challenges, as well as accelerate our growth profile over the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bryan.\nBryan Hanson: In closing, it\u2019s clear that the challenge of COVID-19 has been significant to ZB -- to many, obviously. But we\u2019re also very-encouraged by the early days of recovery, and I think really importantly, our ability to rise to that challenge as a team. And I\u2019m going to leave you with three points from today\u2019s call that I hope you take away. The first one is that the Q2 recovery clearly happened faster than expected, and we are encouraged as a result of that. But, we are still cautiously optimistic about the performance in the back half of 2020, just due to the variables associated with the pandemic that we still have to manage through. And two, while our business has been impacted due to COVID-19, our strategic focus and our progress has not been disrupted. And if anything, this challenge has provided us with learnings that are enhancing strategic components of our business. And then, three, we feel very confident about our underlying business strength, our core business strategy and Zimmer Biomet\u2019s ability to drive long-term growth and value. This will take a minute before we close out to Q&A to say thank you to each and every one of our team members around the world. They\u2019re doing just a fantastic job. And your commitment and dedication to ZB enables us to deliver the value to our customers, to our patients and to our shareholders. So, with that, I\u2019m going to turn the call back over to Keri, and I\u2019m looking forward to your questions.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Bryan. Before we start the Q&A session, a reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. We\u2019ll take our first question from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nRick Wise: Bryan, thanks for all the detailed information. Maybe if I could ask even more selfishly, if you could expand a little, give us a little more color on how you\u2019re thinking about -- not just the cadence but the drivers of recovery from here. You highlighted sort of bit. But, when I look at the second quarter numbers and the weighted averages for their market for both [indiscernible] it looks like to me, Zimmer did outperform, declined less than the group averages both worldwide and U.S. specifically. Maybe help us better understand specifically the drivers. Is it execution, your execution focus, your products for keens, ROSA, is it all the above? Where do you think the emphasis points? And just bottom line of this, what\u2019s the setup then as we look at \u201821 beyond? How quickly can we get to that mid-single-digit absolutely possible kind of growth? Thanks so much, Bryan.\nBryan Hanson: Thanks, Rick. That was a lot of questions in there, man. So, I\u2019m going to try to tackle this in maybe in two categories. One, I think, I\u2019ll just deal from -- your question is, what\u2019s kind of driving the underlying strength of the business, and I\u2019ll give a little more color on that versus what I had in my prepared remarks. And maybe the second piece of it is just broadly speaking about the recovery from COVID, just any deeper thinking there. And then, maybe I\u2019ll pass it over to Suky to get into some detail on -- maybe a little more detail even on how we\u2019re looking June, July, and what we think that\u2019s going to mean on a go forward basis. But I would say, first of all, the things that we can control right now are extremely important to stay disciplined on. And so, I truly do believe, that\u2019s the reason why our strategy is being executed as flawlessly as it is. And that\u2019s really important to us. Some of the major things that are alarming to happen is, number one, we don\u2019t have the supply issues that we used to have. And you remember, what I used to talk about this. There was going to be post-traumatic stress disorder from the commercial organization in this category, and they wouldn\u2019t believe us for a while that it was actually solved, they do now. They\u2019re not wasting time anymore on this. They are fully focused on driving new business. That\u2019s a big part of it. The second piece to that is you\u2019ve got to have new products. You got to have innovation. Having supply is just basic hygiene. You got to move past that and actually bring new products to the table because that\u2019s the lifeblood of a commercial organization. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re giving them. Giving them new technologies that I already talked about, and they\u2019re delivering in those areas, sticking to the commitments that we had. The other big one is that we have dramatically changed the engagement between the senior management of this organization and our commercial organization. There was distrust there before that does not exist anymore. And the combination of those things, I would tell you, we\u2019ve got a swagger back in the ZB commercial organization. And that swagger goes a long way when you\u2019re talking about getting out in the field and getting things done. On top of that, we\u2019ve also got to change compensation program that\u2019s more focused on growth. It\u2019s biased to paying people to grow and less biased to those that don\u2019t. And we also have operating mechanisms with discipline to hold people accountable for delivering that we did not have before. So, those are the things that the things we can control that are driving positive momentum in the business and will continue to drive positive momentum in the business. Outside of that, when we talk about COVID, I would stick with the variables that I mentioned before. And when we think about those variables, that idea of the headwinds being patient fear and recurrence of the virus, those are big variables, and they\u2019re going to be unpredictable, unfortunately. There\u2019s no way to predict what they\u2019re going to do in the future. That\u2019s why that volatility exists and we\u2019re not giving specific guidance moving forward. But, I think sometimes the best way to try to get a sense for what\u2019s going to happen is look at what\u2019s happening right now, because we are seeing the resurgence of the virus in many areas. And as a result of what we\u2019re learning in those areas that would give us some feel for what would happen on a go forward basis. So, maybe with that, I\u2019ll just kind of flip it to Suky, to be able to talk more specifically about what we\u2019re seeing right now. And maybe that\u2019ll give you some color on what we think is going to happen going forward.\nSuky Upadhyay: Great. Thanks, Bryan. And thanks for the question, Rick. So, we clearly saw really good performance and improvement through the back end of Q2. As I talked about June exits on a day rate basis, were down 13.5%. That compares to being down 70%, if you recall back in April. So, clearly a pretty steep V-shaped recovery in the quarter. Now, in spite of that what we saw was Asia Pacific was about overall Company average plus or minus. Some of the areas we\u2019re really watching in Asia Pacific, our second and third largest market, China and Asia -- sorry, Australia and New Zealand, performing really well, getting very close or at normal wise run rates. The other big watch-out for us is Japan, which continues to operate in sort of that 80% to 90% range, and that is our largest market. So, we\u2019re keeping a close watch on the recovery in that particular market. And, of course, we\u2019re really struggling in a lot of smaller markets in Southeast Asia. As we turn to EMEA relative to that overall company average of down 13.5%, EMEA was down significantly more than that. And that\u2019s simply because the recovery just started later in the quarter for that particular region. Seeing really good uptake with our larger markets, but we\u2019ve got to keep our eyes on the UK, which continues to defer at a very high rate and emerging markets is lacking. That was already a pretty lumpy business with tendering. COVID has just made it that much more difficult to predict the trend. But again, recovery in the biggest markets within EMEA is really good in the back end of the quarter. Then, you turn to the Americas, and this is probably where we saw the biggest and sharpest return in the second quarter, and as Bryan talked about, a little bit ahead of our expectations. Within the U.S., we\u2019re seeing really good traction. We do continue to get hit in some pretty hard states, as we talked about, Florida, Texas, Arizona, but nothing compared to the first wave. Those particular markets are operating in the 80% to 90% range. And what we\u2019re seeing is some of the states that have recovered a little bit later, like New York, New Jersey, some of the Northeastern states, they\u2019re operating close to 100 or maybe even some aspects or some parts going above 100. So, you\u2019re seeing that offset, some of the harder hit states. So again, the U.S. is overall trending pretty well, but we\u2019re keeping our eyes on that second surge. I think, within America\u2019s however, we\u2019re seeing a pretty big headwind from Canada and more importantly from Latin America, as those particular markets continue to struggle. And so, try and kind of emphasize the headwind that we\u2019re getting from those markets, if you actually looked at our U.S. knee number for instance, there was about 200 basis-point headwind by including total Americas. And so, if you excluded Americas, our U.S. knee number was about down 44.7%. So, again, about 200 basis points better, and that\u2019s even with a tough comp on ROSA. And then, our U.S. hip business had a headwind of about 300 basis points, when you include the rest of Americas. And so, clearly, the rest of the Americas is a piece of kind of masking, even better performance in the U.S. So, as we think about things going forward in July, sequentially, things got better than where June was. And so, that\u2019s good second leading indicator there. However, July was still down versus prior year, okay? So, than June, but still down. And when you think of the composition of the reasons I talked about, it\u2019s very similar to what we saw in June. Americas a little bit better than the overall company average in July, APAC kind of in line and EMEA, a little bit behind. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color. Sorry for the long answer, but I know that\u2019s a question on a lot of your minds. So, we just wanted to address it proactively.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Just two for me. One, Bryan or Suky, just on recovery. Bryan, you mentioned this $700 million, $800 million backlog. I just sort of wonder how much of that has been worked out. And I\u2019m assuming this dynamic of scheduled versus rescheduled patients is why you said recovery is less steep into sort of the back half. And just maybe talk about that backlog and whether you think you can get back to growth in the fourth quarter. And then, I had a quick follow-up on ROSA.\nBryan Hanson: So, what I would say is that $700 million or $800 million is still out there. So, I would say, that\u2019s the amount of backlog that is still out for future revenue, and none of that is I\u2019m counting as being already captured. I do believe that when you think about the backlog, again, you\u2019ve got to separate it into two different categories. First category would be those patients that were deferred in the very beginning. So, you absolutely know they\u2019re deferred patients. And the other portion of that backlog are those -- I\u2019m just going to call them category 2 patients, which are kind of just building right now and will continue to build until we get back to market growth. And so, that $700 million to $800 million will be future revenue for us. My sense is that, first category of patients, those that were deferred initially will likely be completely run through, by the time we get to the end of 2020, or most of them will. But you\u2019re still going to have a pretty significant backlog left for 2021. I would say, the way you can calculate that is, when you look at your overall market growth delta between what we actually did in 2020 versus the market growth, whatever that delta is, in those procedures that are elective and also are connected to progressive diseases, a large majority of those patients will come back into the funnel. So, if you just look at that delta. Let\u2019s say, you had 100 procedures or less than typical market, you could take probably 80% of those or 80 procedures and say that\u2019s my backlog that will come into 2021. So, that\u2019s kind of the way I\u2019m thinking about it. The challenge is that you have these big variables that are still moving out there around patient fear and the resurgence of the virus. So, it\u2019s difficult to say that the backlog coming back in is going to give us that tailwind that we want without the negative impacts of those two variables. But, what I\u2019ll say again is, if we can move to the point where we have a valid vaccine or an effective treatment, that takes those two variables off the table. And then, you\u2019ve got the backlog as a tailwind, which should be significant for us. And so, you could see a pathway, I guess what I\u2019m saying. If things stay about the same, as you come into a vaccine, renew or mitigate those two negative variables, a very strong growth in 2021, the challenge is, those variables -- and I\u2019m saying that need to go away are pretty significant, and we just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to happen or not. But certainly, you could see a pathway, just given again that backlog volume of strong growth in the back half in 2021. It just depends on how those other two variables play out.\nDavid Lewis: Okay. Just a follow-up there. It\u2019s hard to be definitive on fourth quarter growth I think is what I\u2019m hearing, that\u2019s what in your comment there. And then, I\u2019ll ask my second question as well. Just on ROSA, Bryan, obviously that number is kind of materially how the way the Street was thinking on ROSA placements and thanks for the detail. So, did placements accelerate here into the second quarter? I\u2019m sort of curious, has the selling structure around this placement has changed at all as well as usage based agreements? And if you could just give us some sense from a competitive account perspective, where the systems are being placed, what percent are the traditional Zimmer majority accounts versus the competitive share capture? Thanks so much.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, absolutely. So, it\u2019s a combination. I would tell you that we are absolutely looking at both competitive as well as friends and family. So, even though the original strategy was to focus just on friends and family, because we\u2019ve got a huge opportunity just given the amount of implant percentages that we have in the market, we are definitely seeing competitive situations and we\u2019re winning in those areas. When I think about ROSA in general, I would just say that we continue to see sequential improvement in placements. And believe it or not, even in Q2 there was no disruption in that sequential improvement. That just speaks to the maturity of our commercial organization, the majority of the pipeline of potential customers that we have, and our ability to translate that pipeline into actual sales. And I would expect that to continue. I would say that more recently, as I referenced before, the mix in the way that we\u2019re placing these is different. Most customers previously wanted to buy. And now, we\u2019re seeing a shift to this opportunity to acquire the technology through volume commitments, which in reality, as I stated before, is actually the preferred method of placement for us. I would much rather have that annuity revenue that is linking me to the customer for a longer period of time than having upfront capital acquisition. And that\u2019s what Suky referenced before. If you look in Q2, you look at our knee performance in the U.S., for instance, we actually had a headwind associated with robotics versus last year, was actually a slight drag to our growth rate in knees, because we had sold more last year than we did this quarter. So, again, I think, again, the pipeline is strong, excited about the product line and we\u2019re seeing continued sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Matthew O\u2019Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: Just a follow-up on the ROSA side of things. When I look at, Bryan, the number that you\u2019re thinking that you\u2019re going to have in the field this year, that\u2019s around 200 compared to how many you had out that you\u2019re placing this year versus what you had out last year. So that\u2019s pretty similar to what the market leader did as far as placements last year in this category. So, what I\u2019m trying to figure out is kind of to David\u2019s question, what\u2019s the split between friends and family versus competitive accounts? And are you seeing a building improvement on the competitive account side, as we speak or kind of as you\u2019re looking forward? And I do have a follow-up.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. So, I would say, without giving specifics. I would say that the competitive accounts are probably greater than 50% of the placements. Again, that\u2019s even increasing as we\u2019re finding more customers looking at this opportunity to bring in the system, based on volume commitments. So almost by default, to be able to get a system placed like that, you\u2019ve got to have a competitive situation, so that they can commit that volume to be able to get the robotic system placed. So I\u2019d say, it\u2019s north of 50% and it looks better right now because of the placement strategy shift, not from us, but from our customers.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: And then, on the revision side, and I didn\u2019t hear much on cementless, I may have missed it. But, when I look back historically, you\u2019ve lost, I think some somewhere around 300, 400 basis points a share on the revision side, cementless, as they incurred primaries in total, I think it was a couple hundred basis points. So, there\u2019s a lot of users out there that are familiar with Zimmer. Are those the ones are getting back the quickest right now or even going into new accounts that you hadn\u2019t really been present before? Because of those assistance, because of ROSA, and you feel comfortable. Again, I understand there\u2019s some variability about outperforming the knee market, broadly speaking over the next several years?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. I\u2019d say, on the cementless, we continue to gain traction. I think we\u2019re -- our product is being well received. And as we see more penetration of robotics in our accounts, you\u2019re going to see by the very nature of robotics and the capability to use cementless more comfortably, you\u2019re going to see a continued increase in the cementless percentage of our business. What I\u2019d say on the revision side, it is absolutely a tip of the spear product. And we\u2019re clearly going into accounts that have been using Persona and have not been able to use our revision system, and we\u2019re picking up those accounts. Those are the obvious ones. But, it\u2019s such a good revision said that we\u2019re getting competitive surgeons that want to move to this. And as a result of that, we\u2019ll get primary pull-through as well. So as much as that\u2019s an exciting product, when I talked about close to $100 million opportunity there for this year, that\u2019s not including the pull-through that we would get when we have competitive conversions on the primary need.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a quick clarification. In the script, you said that at the end of June, the decline was only 3.6%, but adjusted for selling days, it was down 13.5%. Is the just more the exit rate of June versus the full month or is there something else going on there?\nBryan Hanson: Hey, Robbie. That was the full month of June, as opposed to the final weeks.\nRobbie Marcus: Got it. Okay. And then, maybe, Bryan, it sounds like -- if I go back to dental and maybe spine, when times are tough, it\u2019s easier to revisit different parts of the business that might not be some of your top performers or have the best growth rates going forward. How are you thinking about some of your businesses that have been underperforming lately and how are you thinking about potentially improving or monetizing them in this environment where there are a lot of willing buyers out there with recently raised capital? Thanks.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. So, as -- the first focus is, as I said in the prepared remarks, we have certain businesses and sub businesses that will be the primary areas of investment. But, what I\u2019ll make very clear is that does not mean that the businesses outside of that are not important to us, and it does not mean that I don\u2019t expect results in those businesses. And they are getting investment, just not the same level. So, I fully expect my businesses in dental, spine, CMFT that I did not name as areas of extreme focus, I expect them with the investments they\u2019re getting to perform. And if I think about spine specifically, we\u2019ve got an opportunity there to do that. Now, it\u2019s got to happen in a few different ways. We\u2019ve had a lot of flux in our commercial organization that is now stable. Well, that stable commercial organization has to turn into a productive commercial organization. We have Mobi-C, which is the best cervical disc in the marketplace. We have a good traction to that. We have -- that as a tip of the spear product that we have not been taking advantage of and I need to see that. And we have Tether that Suky mentioned in the prepared remarks, that is an innovative change that dramatically changes the patient experience in scoliosis patients. That is an exciting product that we need to be able to use. And we have ROSA. So, we\u2019ve got the components of success in spine with the investment level that we have. I need to see it transpire in the same way that we saw with the similar investment level, dental perform. And so, I just want to make sure that it\u2019s clear that just because I don\u2019t have those businesses as one of the primary growth drivers of the organization, it does not mean they\u2019re not important to us, and it does not mean that we\u2019re not going to continue to invest in some level, and it does not mean that I don\u2019t expect results.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. The first one is I wanted to follow up on David\u2019s question on $700 million to $800 million of backlog. I understand that the backlog is out there. But, any chance you can give us the color as to procedures you guys saw in June or July, where the split between deferred procedures that happened to versus newly-diagnosed cases that were done. I\u2019m just trying to understand the price of recovery and the sustainability of that recovery.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. What I would tell you is that, although we do collect data on this, it\u2019s becoming more muddled. And the reason why is because you\u2019ve got a complete mixture now of what is a deferred patient. If you need look at just those folks that we knew were deferred, then I can get a sense for how many of those are coming through. But, when I look at truly this growing backlog of deferred patients, it\u2019s difficult to know which one of those is a new versus a deferred that\u2019s created as a result of COVID. So, it is becoming muddled. I think, the easiest way to look at it again is to go back to in those areas that we have, large joints, shoulder, those areas that are elective, but are connected to a progressive disease. I would just look at the delta in market growth and just know that 80-plus-percent of those patients are eventually going to come back in. And I\u2019d stop worrying as much about what is a deferred patient, what is a new patient. I just look at the total deficiency to market and know that history shows those patients eventually come back in the funnel at a pretty high rate. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. I think, spending too much time now trying to understand the deferred to new patient mix is just -- it\u2019s too muddled, it\u2019s too challenging to understand what that actually means.\nPito Chickering: Okay. A follow-up there. August, is typically a pretty slim month, surgeons take vacations. Any color from your sales force about how do you see surge in demand in August? And do you think that docs are motivated to work through their backlog and provide big growth and easy comps?\nBryan Hanson: I\u2019d tell you, it\u2019s interesting because particularly in Europe, you see August being a challenging month, because a lot of holidays. But, even in parts of Spain what we\u2019re hearing is that people are going to take fewer weeks of vacation to be able to deal with some of the backlog. And that is an area that you typically don\u2019t hear, that\u2019s at a response. And it\u2019s the same pretty much around the world. The general feedback that we\u2019re getting from service in hospitals is they\u2019re going to take fewer days of vacation to try to work through the backlog. Everyone recognizes there\u2019s a bolus of patients that need to get served. And my general sense is that you\u2019re going to see people try to work through that backlog. The only time that you would see maybe no -- something that would look different than that is in the public health system in Europe. But, we just don\u2019t have the same incentive to be able to work through it, and potentially sometimes even the budget to be able to work through it. But generally speaking, I\u2019m getting very good feedback on the desire to work through the summer, work through this backlog and take care of patients.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Taylor with UBS.\nMatt Taylor: So, it\u2019s really interesting to hear the color on ROSA system placements and utilization there. And around the focus on utilization perspective, and I\u2019m going to much about that. You saw pretty strong use despite the pandemic conditions. And I guess, I was hoping, you could provide some outlook for that and maybe benchmark it versus other systems that are out there. Where do you think utilization could go in the coming quarters for these ROSA systems in that maturity?\nBryan Hanson: My sense is, we could see continued increases of utilization per system. And again, remember, go back to the tenants that we had in place as we design the system. One of the primary things we focused on was to make sure that it did not disrupt the surgical flow and it did not change the time to do a procedure. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re finding actually happening. So, the good news on that is it -- the surgeon can digest it more easily, because it doesn\u2019t change what they do as much. It just makes it better. But, what it also allows is more surgical volume, right, using robotics, because we don\u2019t slow the procedure down. So, I would expect, as people get more comfortable with it, and they see the difference in outcome for patients that use robotics versus not use robotics, I would expect it to continue to go up per unit. And then, obviously, as we place more units, I see those procedural lines increasing pretty quickly.\nMatt Taylor: And another follow-up, people have alluded to the deposits prior to it and being able to push that forward in a tough environment. Do you think that hospitals are benefiting from stimulus or how have they been able to continue to make the kind of capital investments or other arrangements despite the disruption and pressure on the budget?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. I really do. We were very concerned out of the gate that we wouldn\u2019t be getting paid by hospitals, let alone, seeing this kind of traction. And I think the stimulus did help. I think it took the pressure off and it made hospitals feel more confident and comfortable to be able to continue to move their strategy forward. And so, our receivables, for instance, never really got significantly damaged during all this, because I think they felt comfortable with that liquidity. And we really haven\u2019t seen much of a change in demand, I mean, initially, for sure. I mean, people didn\u2019t know what was going on and they didn\u2019t know for sure what was going to happen. So, there was a month, period of time where there was a little bit of chaos. But as you worked through that and people felt more confident and comfortable in liquidity, things got back to normal pretty quick.\nMatt Taylor: Thanks a lot.\nBryan Hanson: I said normal. Clearly that\u2019s a new normal, not actual normal.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks. Katie, I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.\nRichard Newitter: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on ROSA. I think, one of your competitors, the leader in the markets, and they saw high proportion of placements, better than expected placement into ASC setting. I\u2019m just curious if you could comment at all on whether you might have been seeing ROSA is getting placement with ASC? And within the context of that question, how Zimmer maybe has positioned to benefit from -- or to feel an impact from accelerated trend through the ASC setting more broadly? Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. I mean, clearly, you would see a natural desire from patients, I would think to be in a non-hospital setting, just given the issues around virus fear. So, it\u2019s not surprising to me that we\u2019re seeing some additional pace moving to the ASC from a procedure volume standpoint. And we are absolutely ensuring that commercially we\u2019re going to be ready for that. We\u2019ve already focused on it obviously, but we\u2019re going to put that on steroids now. And I would say from a robotics standpoint, it plays quite well for us. Remember that you do not have to have a CT scan to be able to use a robotic system for ROSA and that helps us quite a bit in the ASC setting. And also, we\u2019ll go back to this idea of throughput, these are business people in ASC setting. Volume is very important to them. They have to get the throughput of patients to be able to get the same reimbursement and to be able to get the business dynamics that they want. And that ability to use our system without a change in time really matters to them. And so, again, I think it bodes well for us, quite frankly. And I\u2019m very happy to hear that our competitor also saw surge in robotic placements. It tells you that the demand for robotics is real and the penetration of robotics is still very-low. And that to me is an opportunity for everyone who has a real robotics solution.\nRichard Newitter: Got it. And then, Bryan, just for my follow-up. I\u2019m curious, on the M&A front, I appreciate you are doing the start-up, smaller or tuck-in. I\u2019m just curious, in the wake of COVID, has that in any way changed maybe where you might be initially focused on the types of acquisitions or anything that now just on a go-forward basis might fit more strategically into the business, as you look forward? Thanks.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. Let me -- I\u2019ll answer that very specifically. But, let me pull up this for a second, because I think it\u2019s helpful context, because we are in a phase now where I feel much more confident and comfortable moving into active portfolio management, and we will absolutely move in that direction. But, it was important to get there, because I kind of think about this positioning, this Company transforming this company for success in three phases. The first phase was kind of obvious to everybody. We had to triage patients, right? We had real problems around culture, mission, connection just wasn\u2019t there, we didn\u2019t have the top level talent that we needed to be able to move the business forward, we had supply issues, quality issues, we had a DoJ monitor in the house. And so, we had all these things that we had to fix. And I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019re not going to continue to focus in those areas, because it\u2019s going to evolve. But that was kind of Phase 1. We had to fix those things. Phase 2 is more around shifting to innovation, had to get new products out in the market, we had to be able to crystallize our strategy, and our focus in our strategic pillars, and then make sure we had the right organizational structure to drive that. So, all those things kind of happen in Phase 2, and we\u2019ve got to have the operating mechanisms to make sure that we deliver on those things. Phase 3 really comes around portfolio transformation. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to be focused on. And yes, I would say that the insights that we\u2019re getting from COVID, because we\u2019re learning every day, and we are applying those insights into the way that we\u2019re going to manage our strategy, didn\u2019t fundamentally change the strategy, but it\u2019s augmenting the strategy. And I would say that we will have a focus as we look for diversification, and being able to get better penetration in the ASC to be able to continue to focus in those subcategories and set that we know are going to be attractive, and to be able to think about acquisitions now, to get us away from our dependence on elective procedures. So, there\u2019s a lot of different sectors that we\u2019re considering now in the way that we\u2019re going to look at potential opportunities for acquisition. I would still say, as I said before, there are going to be smaller tuck-ins for now, because our access to liquidity isn\u2019t quite the same, just given what\u2019s going on right now. And we want to make sure that we stay investment grade, but we are clearly focused right now on active portfolio management.\nOperator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Keri Mattox for any additional closing remarks.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Katie. And thank you all again for joining us this morning. If you have questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to the IR team. You can also find a replay of the call on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. Thanks so much and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. I hope all of you are well. I'd like to reiterate Bryan's most recent comments that our underlying fundamentals remain strong and our long-term growth profile is compelling. Before jumping into the specifics, I would summarize our second quarter performance as simply being better-than-expected. Revenue was ahead of expectations, driven by fast recovery in most markets, which led to better margins, and we ended the quarter with a strong cash position and ample liquidity. Net sales in the quarter were $1.2 billion, a reported and operational decrease of about 38% from the prior year, driven by the pandemic. We saw the deepest impact on elective procedures and revenue in April, but then saw a rapid recovery with sequential improvement in May and June. While we're not at normal procedure volumes yet, we are encouraged by the trends since April, as all of our regions and businesses performed better-than-anticipated, since our first quarter call. We will look more closely at our Q2 revenue trends, starting with regional performance and then hit it to our businesses. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my commentary will be on a constant currency basis. Beginning with Asia Pacific, the region decreased about 18% in the second quarter versus the same period in the prior year. While China demonstrated sharp V-shaped recovery since April, posting improvement in May and growth in June, most other markets in the region continued to perform below normal run rates. In Japan, our largest market in Asia Pacific, we've seen a different profile as that market never got to trough levels experienced in China and was stable in Q2, operating at about 80% of normal run rates. Australia and New Zealand, our third largest market in Asia Pacific observed a sharp decline and a sharp recovery within Q2 and continues to make progress back to normalization. And smaller markets within Asia Pacific continue to struggle with containing the virus and implementing effective policies, and accordingly procedures were down substantially in the second quarter. But, there's a wide disparity across the sub-markets within the region. But, as expected, a common theme is that we see improvement in the number of elective procedures when the infection rates are stable or declining and where there's deterrence to physicians and hospitals to make treatment decisions based on the local situation. This holds true for other regions as well. Moving to EMEA, the region decreased 49% in the second quarter. As with other regions, we observed the deepest trough in April and then saw steady improvement through the quarter across all major markets, with the exception of the UK where patients continue to be deferred at very-high rates. Overall, developed markets with EMEA are recovering well. By the end of the second quarter, Germany has started to approach prior year procedure volumes. France, Italy and Spain also improved significantly this quarter and showed the fastest recovery in the region in June. While not yet back to normalized levels, we are encouraged by this progress. Emerging markets in EMEA are improving, but generally continue to lag developed markets in that pace of recovery. Last week, the Americas decreased 40% in the second quarter. As we talked about on our last quarterly call, the COVID-19 impact ramped up materially in mid-March with federal and state governments guidance to defer elective procedures. April was the trough in Americas, but we saw stronger than expected recovery in May and June, as U.S. states reopened. In the U.S., while there are variations week to week, to-date, we have seen approximately 50% of states at or above prior year cases levels, with 80% of states above 90%, when compared to last year. While progress in the U.S. has been good, other markets within the Americas continue to struggle and operate well below normal levels. For example, if you strip out the rest of the Americas from the U.S., you'd see that the U.S. hip and knee growth was actually about 200 to 300 basis points higher than the total Americas number. So clearly, non-U.S. markets in the Americas are still struggling and creating a drag on overall regional performance. Importantly, in the U.S., and in other regions and markets, we're seeing second waves of steep infection growth. However, we clearly see that the healthcare systems in general are better equipped to address the pandemic, such that we're not seeing an erosion of elective procedures at the same level as observed in April. For example, in some of the hardest hit counties within Texas, we continue to see procedure volumes at 80% or better prior year volumes, see a similar pattern in other severely hit states. Since the second quarter in July, we've seen continued progress and sequential improvement in elective procedure trends. Next, let's turn to our businesses for Q2. Our global knee business declined 47%. As we talked about last quarter, prior to the pandemic, we saw strong performance in this category, driven by improved operational execution and the continued positive impact of the Persona Revision launch. As Bryan talked about a few minutes ago, ROSA Knee continues to be an important growth driver for us in the near term and the long term. And our ecosystem strategy in the knee business and other categories is really starting to take traction. Our global hip business declined 31% in the second quarter. We continue to see our hip business recover faster than the knee business, pointing to somewhat less elective nature of these procedures. And we continue to see strong traction for our Avenir Complete launch. Sports, extremity and trauma sales declined 29% in Q2. This decline was less pronounced than what we observed in large joints, primarily due to the non-elective nature from trauma. However, the trauma market continued to be pressured due to reduced activity levels related to widespread quarantine, and stay-at-home orders. Dental, spine and CMFT sales declined 37% in the quarter. We've seen stronger recovery in spine due to recent new product introductions, including Tether. Also, much like our hip business, spine procedures are seen as less elective by many physicians and patients, primarily due to the pain burden. Finally, our other category was down 44% versus the prior year. Looking beyond Q2, as you know, we withdrew our 2020 full year financial guidance in April due to the uncertainty related to procedure volume uptake. The impact of COVID-19 continues to be fluid and there are a number of market dynamics and variables that we are unable to reliably quantify at this time. As such, we will not be providing updated financial guidance for 2020. But, we do want to share information and insights that may provide shaping of our revenue expectations for the remainder of the year. To give you a sense of the sequential improvement we saw through the second quarter, remember that, on our first quarter call, we noted that, revenues were down about 70% in April across the full business. By the end of the quarter, in June, that decline was only 3.6% down. However, it's important to note that there was an additional selling day in June 2020 versus June 2019. After adjusting for the additional day in 2020, June was down 13.5%. There was no day rate impact on the full quarter. So, the key takeaway is, if the variables that Bryan described earlier, continue to play out as they are today, we expect the sequential improvement seen in Q2 to also continue through the back half of 2020, but likely at a more modest pace. Now, let's turn to P&L liquidity. We've taken a disciplined and proactive approach to mitigate the earnings impact of the pandemic and enhance our liquidity profile. Results in the quarter were a little bit better than expected since our first port of call and we would expect margins, earnings and cash flow to improve as our revenue profile improves moving forward. In terms of our second quarter results, we reported GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter of $1 and adjusted diluted earnings per share $0.05. GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter were negative and lower than the prior year, due primarily to the impact of the pandemic, and I will speak to that as part of our adjusted results. Adjusted earnings per share were lower than the prior year, driven by lower revenues and higher cost of goods. Adjusted gross margins were 65.5% for the second quarter, due to less favorable mix and lower fixed costs absorption as a result of decreased production volumes. Adjusted operating expenses were lower due to reduced variable selling expense, the continued early impact of our restructuring program and cost reductions we actioned to deal with the pandemic. As we previously discussed, we were able to flex quickly on COVID-19-related cost reductions in the fourth quarter by leveraging the restructuring programs already in place. Overall, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 5.7%, substantially lower than the prior year. But again, a bit better than what we expected on our first quarter call. Moving beyond operating margin, net interest expense of $54 million was down versus the prior year, due to debt pay-down in 2019. And our adjusted tax rate was 42.8% in the quarter. Our adjusted tax rate was distorted in the quarter due to discrete tax expenses on a small base of pre-tax income. We do not expect that trend to continue moving forward. Moving to cash and liquidity in the quarter. While free cash flow was negative $145 million, we ended Q2 with higher cash and cash equivalents of $713 million, further strengthening our liquidity position. Also, we continued to maintain $2.5 billion in additional liquidity through our credit facilities, which remain untapped. We believe we're well-positioned from a capital structure standpoint. In terms of our P&L for the remainder of 2020, we expect that operating expenses will continue to ramp up in the second half of the year when compared to Q2, as we were seeing higher investment levels in R&D and commercial initiatives, in tandem with higher revenues. Interest expense will be a bit higher in the second half of the year versus the first half, driven by the refinancing of debt this year and the additional $1 billion facility put in place. For the adjusted tax rate, a full year rate is expected to be about 100 basis points higher than what we originally guided in February, driven by a change in geographic mix of income due to COVID-19. Overall, we expect that margins, earnings and cash flow will improve as our revenue profile improves. From a longer term perspective, we remain committed to achieving at least 30% operating margin in 2023. As we continue to track well versus our restructuring plans. To summarize, our underlying business and our financial fundamentals remain strong, such that as the market continues to improve, we expect our financial performance will also improve. I continue to be extremely proud of how the ZBT has responded and performed over the past few months. We believe, we're well-positioned to address the current challenges, as well as accelerate our growth profile over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan. Great. Thanks, Bryan. And thanks for the question, Rick. So, we clearly saw really good performance and improvement through the back end of Q2. As I talked about June exits on a day rate basis, were down 13.5%. That compares to being down 70%, if you recall back in April. So, clearly a pretty steep V-shaped recovery in the quarter. Now, in spite of that what we saw was Asia Pacific was about overall Company average plus or minus. Some of the areas we're really watching in Asia Pacific, our second and third largest market, China and Asia -- sorry, Australia and New Zealand, performing really well, getting very close or at normal wise run rates. The other big watch-out for us is Japan, which continues to operate in sort of that 80% to 90% range, and that is our largest market. So, we're keeping a close watch on the recovery in that particular market. And, of course, we're really struggling in a lot of smaller markets in Southeast Asia. As we turn to EMEA relative to that overall company average of down 13.5%, EMEA was down significantly more than that. And that's simply because the recovery just started later in the quarter for that particular region. Seeing really good uptake with our larger markets, but we've got to keep our eyes on the UK, which continues to defer at a very high rate and emerging markets is lacking. That was already a pretty lumpy business with tendering. COVID has just made it that much more difficult to predict the trend. But again, recovery in the biggest markets within EMEA is really good in the back end of the quarter. Then, you turn to the Americas, and this is probably where we saw the biggest and sharpest return in the second quarter, and as Bryan talked about, a little bit ahead of our expectations. Within the U.S., we're seeing really good traction. We do continue to get hit in some pretty hard states, as we talked about, Florida, Texas, Arizona, but nothing compared to the first wave. Those particular markets are operating in the 80% to 90% range. And what we're seeing is some of the states that have recovered a little bit later, like New York, New Jersey, some of the Northeastern states, they're operating close to 100 or maybe even some aspects or some parts going above 100. So, you're seeing that offset, some of the harder hit states. So again, the U.S. is overall trending pretty well, but we're keeping our eyes on that second surge. I think, within America's however, we're seeing a pretty big headwind from Canada and more importantly from Latin America, as those particular markets continue to struggle. And so, try and kind of emphasize the headwind that we're getting from those markets, if you actually looked at our U.S. knee number for instance, there was about 200 basis-point headwind by including total Americas. And so, if you excluded Americas, our U.S. knee number was about down 44.7%. So, again, about 200 basis points better, and that's even with a tough comp on ROSA. And then, our U.S. hip business had a headwind of about 300 basis points, when you include the rest of Americas. And so, clearly, the rest of the Americas is a piece of kind of masking, even better performance in the U.S. So, as we think about things going forward in July, sequentially, things got better than where June was. And so, that's good second leading indicator there. However, July was still down versus prior year, okay? So, than June, but still down. And when you think of the composition of the reasons I talked about, it's very similar to what we saw in June. Americas a little bit better than the overall company average in July, APAC kind of in line and EMEA, a little bit behind. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color. Sorry for the long answer, but I know that's a question on a lot of your minds. So, we just wanted to address it proactively."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Keri. And before we started, I just want to say that I certainly hope that you're safe, your families are healthy, and that you're doing everything you can to manage through this very unusual situation that we find ourselves in. Speaking of that, once again, we find ourselves in an earnings call where we're in different places. We're not held together. And my guess is, as we may have some mishaps, potentially anyway, when we hand off to each other, so I'm just going to apologize ahead of time for any mishaps that we see through the handoffs here, and potentially any background noises we might get. Obviously, this is an unprecedented time for all of us, very challenging time as we deal with the pandemic here in the U.S. and around the globe. And we, as a result of that, want to talk about the virus today. We want to talk about how we're managing through it. We want to talk about how we're modeling its potential impact. But, we really also want to make sure that we spend some time on our underlying strength of the business that we have and our plans for long-term growth. And along those lines, I'm really going to try to center the conversation around three main topics. The first one is obviously our execution and the financial results in Q2, but really spent time in Q2 on the strength of the underlying business and why we're feeling confident in the things that we can control. The second thing would be around our broader modeling and our assumptions on a go forward basis associated with the pandemic. May not be associating as you want there, but we're simply going to give you the best that we can on how we're looking at it. And then, the final piece would be just on our long-term plan for growth. What are the things we're going to be focusing on to be able to get sustained growth in the future? So, first, let's talk about the second quarter, and I want to begin with saying that safety, as I said, last quarter, continues to be our top priority. Safety of our team members, our customers, our patients, the communities that we serve, and we continue to execute on that comprehensive global pandemic plan that we did develop last year. Believe it or not, I said before, we actually developed that plan before this all happened. And we've been putting that into action at the very earlier stages of COVID-19. And as a result of that plan and our additional safety protocols, we've definitely seen changes to how we work and have learned a lot about how we can more efficiently collaborate across the globe, significant changes associated with that. But importantly, these safety-related protocols have not -- they have not caused disruptions in our supply chain and our ability to meet our customer demand, and then our ability to serve those patients who rely on our technology and our products to improve the quality of their life. And I'd say, I'm really proud of how seriously the entire ZB team has taken our collective safety. And I want to thank each and every one of our team members, especially our manufacturing and commercial teams, who have just gone above and beyond during this entire time, during a very challenging time. I just can't thank you enough. So, in terms of our Q2 execution and performance, I'm going to cover some broad takeaways, and then I really want Suky, after I finish, to get into more specific detail, maybe more than what we would typically get into, just given the current circumstances. So first, the recovery that we've seen to date and really specifically in Q2 is encouraging. Now it's early, but so far, it's been better than we expected. Based on what we are seeing and really just experiencing in the recovery, there is real reason for optimism. But, given the number of unknowns related to COVID, I would say, it's more prudent to be cautiously optimistic right now. You're going to hear that theme throughout the discussion today. We're watching closely and continuing to see rising patient demand, which is key, right? We've got to see that patient demand. And that's resulting obviously in increased procedure volumes. And very importantly, we're also seeing that majority of surgeons and hospitals are ramping up capacity to support that demand. It's a pretty big variable associated with whether or not you can get that backlog patient and the new patient coming in. And so, as a result of this, our Q2 performance was better than we expected across all of our regions, and in particular, we saw strength in the U.S. And I got to say, the U.S. recovery performance is really encouraging to me, as this is momentum that we're seeing despite the resurgence of the virus in many of our states. Importantly, this trend has continued into July, even as some of the states with the rising COVID numbers like Florida, Texas and Arizona. So again, even though we're seeing that of resurgence of the virus, we still are pretty bullish on what we're seeing in U.S. so far. Clearly, and for good reason, everyone is going to focus on the impact of COVID in the quarter, and probably more importantly, its forward-looking impact on our business. And we're absolutely going to talk about that in a minute. But the last thing I want to discuss for Q2, centers more around the things we can actually directly control, even during the pandemic, and the activities that ultimately will drive durable growth and strengthen our business. So, through the pandemic, I can tell you that we have remained maniacally-focused on executing against our growth drivers, and that focus is delivering results, and we saw those in the second quarter. So, I'm going to just start with what I know everyone wants to hear about is our progress with ROSA. Now, obviously, robotics plays an important part of our strategy on a go-forward basis. And importantly, we continue to see very strong demand for ROSA, even through the pandemic. And also importantly, we're getting very good feedback from surgeons that are using the system. And while I can tell you that I'm not going to provide the level of detail I'm about to give you, probably ever again, I do want to give you some additional insights into where we are with ROSA and the launch, just given the fact that it's being hidden right now with all the clouds, I guess, associated with the COVID impacts on our business. So, I was just going to say, so we're now about a year away from the full launch of our business, about a year into that launch. And we now have about 150 ROSA Knee Systems out in the globe. And the good news is, we're seeing with those units, very strong utilization per unit. And some of those are newly placed, so you're not seeing the same volume yet. But this has been out there for a while, we're getting very good utilization per unit. And if I just kind of add it up and I look at the current procedural volumes that we're seeing, we're really on pace to be doing about 3,000-plus cases per quarter. And just to put that into context, now relative to growth, that's more than double the procedural volumes that we would have seen in the fourth quarter of 2019. And by the way, that's inside of the pressure on elective procedures that we're seeing as a result of the pandemic. In addition to that, we've got a number of accounts in our active pipeline, a whole bunch of companies in the active pipeline. Some of those will fall out, but based on the volume of accounts in that pipeline, we'll be very disappointed if we don't have between 200 and 300 ROSA systems out in the market by the end of this year. So, I would just say, for ROSA, we continue to keep very-strong momentum and remain on track actually slightly ahead of our expectations for both, system placements and procedures, even with the pressure of COVID in this environment. So, good news obviously on the ROSA front. Another great example of strong innovation and commercial prowess is the Persona Revision story that we're seeing play out and saw play out in the second floor. Our launch of the revision system is well ahead of plan, believe it or not, and receiving very positive remarks from current Persona users, which is important. But, even more importantly, we're seeing very-positive remarks from competitive services, which is where we want to make sure that we're focusing. In some of the key areas of feedback are really a lot of excitement around the ease-of-use of the system, a significant excitement around precision and the intuitive nature of the instruments that we have, which is important in this procedure, and also the ability to provide all the benefits of a more personalized fit for the patient that Persona brings to the table and do this in revision system, which again, is unique in the marketplace. So, just for perspective, the Persona Revision surpassed our expectations in Q2 and delivered the most successful quarter to date since launch. Let's kind of repeat that. It's the most successful quarter to date since launched, in Q2, which is the quarter that's been most impacted by the pandemic. The demand is still very-robust even outside of that. We already have doubled the instrument sets originally anticipated for the launch to support that demand. And again, for context, this product is on a trajectory to reach close to $100 million in revenue during 2020. Some of that's going to be cannibalized out, as you cannibalize revenue. And I would expect, the capitalization rate to be about 60%. So, again, on track to do $100 million or very close to it in 2020, and I would expect about 60% cannibalization of that revenue. And we also have continued our focus on driving our dedicated commercial team for extremities as I've talked about quite a bit. And we've been very-pleased that our Signature ONE Planner shoulder system continues to gain traction, again, even in Q2. Now, surgeon registrations, just to give you some perspective for Signature ONE increased nearly 60% in Q2 sequentially over Q1. And our recent FDA clearance also enables even greater integration of that system with our family of implants and guides, that's going to open up even more opportunities. We've also increased the portability of the system. We're really trying to make it more open architecture, so that you can use it on your computer, but you can also put it on my iPad or an iPhone, so that if you're walking in and out of the surgery and the operating room, you can still use the system, increase that portability, which surgeons want. So, we're excited again about our shoulder franchise and the impact that this system will have on our success there. And then, finally, mymobility. Our partnership with Apple continues to be a prime example of how research and development, investment in tech innovation are going to drive the next wave of telemedicine advances, and we truly believe will change the patient and surgeon experience in our space. And with mymobility, what we're really focusing on is ensuring that we have that patient-physician communication link that's even better than it was before, but allowing this to happen more virtually. The system also helps improve adherence to the pre and post-patient requirements because that information is the pushed to the patient when they need to actually do something. And very importantly, it's advancing the collection and the analysis of patient-specific data points that ultimately can help the care team make the best and most personalized care decisions for that patient. In June, we announced with Apple a new application. It's going to be able to provide now gauge quality functionality within mymobility, and that will happen this fall. And that's a pretty exciting development and a big step forward, no pun intended, in this remote data collection journey. Again, with the idea of collecting data that is personalized with the patient and ultimately as a result of having that provide better care decisions. So, the mymobility functionality in today's COVID environment is especially interesting because it does allow for this significant demand that we're seeing right now for allowing effective and engaged, remote and virtual patient care. So, we're excited clearly about mymobility, we were before the pandemic, but certainly this is giving us some additional steam in the marketplace. So, moving to the second key area of focus for the earnings call, I want to talk about COVID-19 and our modeling assumptions for the rest of this year. And we're encouraged about what we saw in Q2 and are confident in our ability to continue to execute. But we understand, and I think probably everybody does, the near-term uncertainty that COVID-19 brings. Our thinking regarding COVID is obviously changing. It's evolving, it's sharpening as we experience more of its actual impact on our procedures, and over time, we're also seeing the impact on various markets and submarkets. And so, I'd like to think about just based on that knowledge that we're getting, we can refine our thinking here and explain it really by talking about three major variables that I think we've got to pay attention to. One of those variables would be a tailwind for us created by the pandemic, and then, two would be headwinds that we've got to pay attention to. So, the first, when we talk about the tailwind, it's just going to be backlog of deferred patients that we have built. These are both, the initial deferred procedures that we saw in the beginning and the building backlog that's continuing to happen. From a headroom standpoint, I really look at it two ways. One would be around those patient specific factors, patient fear or unemployment for instance, and then the second one would be around the recurrence of the virus. And I would think about that in two ways, the recurrence having an impact on actual bed capacity and the recurrence having an impact on policy decisions that could directly impact elective procedures, okay? So, that's kind of the variables that I think about in determining where we think this is going to go. Relative to the backlog, I think, it's really important to note that the approximate value of this backlog just for ZB, just for this company is already worth about $700 million to $800 million in revenue. That's the approximate value of the backlog already created. It's worth about $700 million to $800 million in revenue, future revenue. And this value continues to grow and the factor that continues to grow and will continue to grow until the market returns to normal market growth rates. Relative to the headwinds, given that we are currently seeing play out, I would say that patient fear and virus recurrence impacting specifically bed capacity are the two most significant threats. I would say that policy decisions and unemployment concerns would be less material, at least based on the rate that we're seeing policy decisions roll out right now. So, the key takeaway -- I am just giving you a lot of information on these variables than I'm paying attention too. If the variables that I really just described, continue to play out as they are today, we would expect that sequential improvement seen in Q2 would continue through the back half of 2020, but likely at a more modest pace in Q3, Q4. Just to repeat that, if the variables that I just described, continue to play out just as they are today, just what we're seeing today, we would absolutely expect the sequential improvement that we saw in Q2 to continue in the back half, but it would be in a more modest pace. And another important aspect of this equation, I think sometimes this is lost, so it's important thing to bring up, is that the two most significant headwinds become non-variables once a vaccine is available. And the vast majority of those patients that didn't get treatment for either of these reasons, become a tailwind eventually for our business, remembering that this is a progressive disease. And as a result of the progressive nature of that disease, the vast majority of these deferred patients will eventually reenter the procedural funnel and become a tailwind for us. Finally, I'd like to also spend a portion of my time today talking about the third category, which is our long-term plan for growth. And I can tell you that our strategy is relatively simple. You've heard me talk about it before. Not all of our businesses are going to be treated the same. All of our businesses are important to us, but they're not all going to be invested in or managed the same. We have prioritized the high growth and most strategically relevant areas of our business. And we're going to make very-disciplined investments there to continue to drive innovation, innovation centered around improving patient outcomes and also providing for procedure efficiencies. And to drive our strategic pillar of top quartile performance in TSR, we have to focus most intently and driving long-term growth in these key areas. Number one -- and yes, said this before, but number one, we must achieve above market growth in these. And just given the size and scale of this business for us, we need to be ahead of market here. And we're going to do that by focusing more aggressively in the fastest growth sub-markets of knee, robotics, data and informatics, revision like I just talked about. Next, we need to see and drive consistent at-market, actually as a higher end of the market range for S.E.T. We need to see that happen for our business. And we're going to do that again by focusing more of our attention in those most attractive sub elements of S.E.T. Also, we need to consistently deliver at-market performance in hips in the short-term. That's all marking [ph] for us, at-market performance in the short-term but transitioning to above market growth with our future robotics launch in this space. And then, finally, while our other businesses, at least at this point, will not receive the same level of investment and they will be managed differently, we still would expect that these businesses would drive in line, maybe to the lower end of market growth for these areas. Okay. So, that's the way we think about our businesses and the way that we're going to invest in them. And by focusing on these markets, just as I've described, we believe that over time, our pursuit of consistent and sustainable mid-single-digits organic growth rates is absolutely possible. Now, to fuel the investment needed to drive this long-term growth and at the same time, drive margin expansion over time, we've continued to focus and execute on our restructuring program. And the last piece, when it comes to long-term growth, is our M&A strategy, and this is going to be key for us. And it remains consistent with what we outlined in 2019 and earlier this year. We will continue to focus on high-growth areas and the areas where we truly believe we have a right to win. The size is going to be a factor here as well with a preference, at least at the outset toward tuck-in deals that we can easily integrate and operationalize, while also maintaining an investment grade rating. So overall, I think it's obvious, we feel confident in our business strength and execution, in the current pace of recovery from COVID, in our long-term growth prospects. And, we've already learned so much from COVID-19. While it's a challenge that none of us would really want to face, the fact is, we do believe that it has reinforced the strength of our business strategy. And I believe that it's positively impacted our team engagement and our One ZB culture. And trust me, we will focus on leveraging our learnings to accelerate ZB's transformation. At the end of the day, there's a lot of short-term variables associated with COVID that demand, a level of caution. But make no mistake, we are very optimistic about our path forward. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Suky to get into more financial details. Suky? In closing, it's clear that the challenge of COVID-19 has been significant to ZB -- to many, obviously. But we're also very-encouraged by the early days of recovery, and I think really importantly, our ability to rise to that challenge as a team. And I'm going to leave you with three points from today's call that I hope you take away. The first one is that the Q2 recovery clearly happened faster than expected, and we are encouraged as a result of that. But, we are still cautiously optimistic about the performance in the back half of 2020, just due to the variables associated with the pandemic that we still have to manage through. And two, while our business has been impacted due to COVID-19, our strategic focus and our progress has not been disrupted. And if anything, this challenge has provided us with learnings that are enhancing strategic components of our business. And then, three, we feel very confident about our underlying business strength, our core business strategy and Zimmer Biomet's ability to drive long-term growth and value. This will take a minute before we close out to Q&A to say thank you to each and every one of our team members around the world. They're doing just a fantastic job. And your commitment and dedication to ZB enables us to deliver the value to our customers, to our patients and to our shareholders. So, with that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Keri, and I'm looking forward to your questions. Thanks, Rick. That was a lot of questions in there, man. So, I'm going to try to tackle this in maybe in two categories. One, I think, I'll just deal from -- your question is, what's kind of driving the underlying strength of the business, and I'll give a little more color on that versus what I had in my prepared remarks. And maybe the second piece of it is just broadly speaking about the recovery from COVID, just any deeper thinking there. And then, maybe I'll pass it over to Suky to get into some detail on -- maybe a little more detail even on how we're looking June, July, and what we think that's going to mean on a go forward basis. But I would say, first of all, the things that we can control right now are extremely important to stay disciplined on. And so, I truly do believe, that's the reason why our strategy is being executed as flawlessly as it is. And that's really important to us. Some of the major things that are alarming to happen is, number one, we don't have the supply issues that we used to have. And you remember, what I used to talk about this. There was going to be post-traumatic stress disorder from the commercial organization in this category, and they wouldn't believe us for a while that it was actually solved, they do now. They're not wasting time anymore on this. They are fully focused on driving new business. That's a big part of it. The second piece to that is you've got to have new products. You got to have innovation. Having supply is just basic hygiene. You got to move past that and actually bring new products to the table because that's the lifeblood of a commercial organization. And that's what we're giving them. Giving them new technologies that I already talked about, and they're delivering in those areas, sticking to the commitments that we had. The other big one is that we have dramatically changed the engagement between the senior management of this organization and our commercial organization. There was distrust there before that does not exist anymore. And the combination of those things, I would tell you, we've got a swagger back in the ZB commercial organization. And that swagger goes a long way when you're talking about getting out in the field and getting things done. On top of that, we've also got to change compensation program that's more focused on growth. It's biased to paying people to grow and less biased to those that don't. And we also have operating mechanisms with discipline to hold people accountable for delivering that we did not have before. So, those are the things that the things we can control that are driving positive momentum in the business and will continue to drive positive momentum in the business. Outside of that, when we talk about COVID, I would stick with the variables that I mentioned before. And when we think about those variables, that idea of the headwinds being patient fear and recurrence of the virus, those are big variables, and they're going to be unpredictable, unfortunately. There's no way to predict what they're going to do in the future. That's why that volatility exists and we're not giving specific guidance moving forward. But, I think sometimes the best way to try to get a sense for what's going to happen is look at what's happening right now, because we are seeing the resurgence of the virus in many areas. And as a result of what we're learning in those areas that would give us some feel for what would happen on a go forward basis. So, maybe with that, I'll just kind of flip it to Suky, to be able to talk more specifically about what we're seeing right now. And maybe that'll give you some color on what we think is going to happen going forward. So, what I would say is that $700 million or $800 million is still out there. So, I would say, that's the amount of backlog that is still out for future revenue, and none of that is I'm counting as being already captured. I do believe that when you think about the backlog, again, you've got to separate it into two different categories. First category would be those patients that were deferred in the very beginning. So, you absolutely know they're deferred patients. And the other portion of that backlog are those -- I'm just going to call them category 2 patients, which are kind of just building right now and will continue to build until we get back to market growth. And so, that $700 million to $800 million will be future revenue for us. My sense is that, first category of patients, those that were deferred initially will likely be completely run through, by the time we get to the end of 2020, or most of them will. But you're still going to have a pretty significant backlog left for 2021. I would say, the way you can calculate that is, when you look at your overall market growth delta between what we actually did in 2020 versus the market growth, whatever that delta is, in those procedures that are elective and also are connected to progressive diseases, a large majority of those patients will come back into the funnel. So, if you just look at that delta. Let's say, you had 100 procedures or less than typical market, you could take probably 80% of those or 80 procedures and say that's my backlog that will come into 2021. So, that's kind of the way I'm thinking about it. The challenge is that you have these big variables that are still moving out there around patient fear and the resurgence of the virus. So, it's difficult to say that the backlog coming back in is going to give us that tailwind that we want without the negative impacts of those two variables. But, what I'll say again is, if we can move to the point where we have a valid vaccine or an effective treatment, that takes those two variables off the table. And then, you've got the backlog as a tailwind, which should be significant for us. And so, you could see a pathway, I guess what I'm saying. If things stay about the same, as you come into a vaccine, renew or mitigate those two negative variables, a very strong growth in 2021, the challenge is, those variables -- and I'm saying that need to go away are pretty significant, and we just don't know if it's going to happen or not. But certainly, you could see a pathway, just given again that backlog volume of strong growth in the back half in 2021. It just depends on how those other two variables play out. Yes, absolutely. So, it's a combination. I would tell you that we are absolutely looking at both competitive as well as friends and family. So, even though the original strategy was to focus just on friends and family, because we've got a huge opportunity just given the amount of implant percentages that we have in the market, we are definitely seeing competitive situations and we're winning in those areas. When I think about ROSA in general, I would just say that we continue to see sequential improvement in placements. And believe it or not, even in Q2 there was no disruption in that sequential improvement. That just speaks to the maturity of our commercial organization, the majority of the pipeline of potential customers that we have, and our ability to translate that pipeline into actual sales. And I would expect that to continue. I would say that more recently, as I referenced before, the mix in the way that we're placing these is different. Most customers previously wanted to buy. And now, we're seeing a shift to this opportunity to acquire the technology through volume commitments, which in reality, as I stated before, is actually the preferred method of placement for us. I would much rather have that annuity revenue that is linking me to the customer for a longer period of time than having upfront capital acquisition. And that's what Suky referenced before. If you look in Q2, you look at our knee performance in the U.S., for instance, we actually had a headwind associated with robotics versus last year, was actually a slight drag to our growth rate in knees, because we had sold more last year than we did this quarter. So, again, I think, again, the pipeline is strong, excited about the product line and we're seeing continued sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter. Yes. So, I would say, without giving specifics. I would say that the competitive accounts are probably greater than 50% of the placements. Again, that's even increasing as we're finding more customers looking at this opportunity to bring in the system, based on volume commitments. So almost by default, to be able to get a system placed like that, you've got to have a competitive situation, so that they can commit that volume to be able to get the robotic system placed. So I'd say, it's north of 50% and it looks better right now because of the placement strategy shift, not from us, but from our customers. Yes. I'd say, on the cementless, we continue to gain traction. I think we're -- our product is being well received. And as we see more penetration of robotics in our accounts, you're going to see by the very nature of robotics and the capability to use cementless more comfortably, you're going to see a continued increase in the cementless percentage of our business. What I'd say on the revision side, it is absolutely a tip of the spear product. And we're clearly going into accounts that have been using Persona and have not been able to use our revision system, and we're picking up those accounts. Those are the obvious ones. But, it's such a good revision said that we're getting competitive surgeons that want to move to this. And as a result of that, we'll get primary pull-through as well. So as much as that's an exciting product, when I talked about close to $100 million opportunity there for this year, that's not including the pull-through that we would get when we have competitive conversions on the primary need. Hey, Robbie. That was the full month of June, as opposed to the final weeks. Yes. So, as -- the first focus is, as I said in the prepared remarks, we have certain businesses and sub businesses that will be the primary areas of investment. But, what I'll make very clear is that does not mean that the businesses outside of that are not important to us, and it does not mean that I don't expect results in those businesses. And they are getting investment, just not the same level. So, I fully expect my businesses in dental, spine, CMFT that I did not name as areas of extreme focus, I expect them with the investments they're getting to perform. And if I think about spine specifically, we've got an opportunity there to do that. Now, it's got to happen in a few different ways. We've had a lot of flux in our commercial organization that is now stable. Well, that stable commercial organization has to turn into a productive commercial organization. We have Mobi-C, which is the best cervical disc in the marketplace. We have a good traction to that. We have -- that as a tip of the spear product that we have not been taking advantage of and I need to see that. And we have Tether that Suky mentioned in the prepared remarks, that is an innovative change that dramatically changes the patient experience in scoliosis patients. That is an exciting product that we need to be able to use. And we have ROSA. So, we've got the components of success in spine with the investment level that we have. I need to see it transpire in the same way that we saw with the similar investment level, dental perform. And so, I just want to make sure that it's clear that just because I don't have those businesses as one of the primary growth drivers of the organization, it does not mean they're not important to us, and it does not mean that we're not going to continue to invest in some level, and it does not mean that I don't expect results. Yes. What I would tell you is that, although we do collect data on this, it's becoming more muddled. And the reason why is because you've got a complete mixture now of what is a deferred patient. If you need look at just those folks that we knew were deferred, then I can get a sense for how many of those are coming through. But, when I look at truly this growing backlog of deferred patients, it's difficult to know which one of those is a new versus a deferred that's created as a result of COVID. So, it is becoming muddled. I think, the easiest way to look at it again is to go back to in those areas that we have, large joints, shoulder, those areas that are elective, but are connected to a progressive disease. I would just look at the delta in market growth and just know that 80-plus-percent of those patients are eventually going to come back in. And I'd stop worrying as much about what is a deferred patient, what is a new patient. I just look at the total deficiency to market and know that history shows those patients eventually come back in the funnel at a pretty high rate. That's the way we're thinking about it. I think, spending too much time now trying to understand the deferred to new patient mix is just -- it's too muddled, it's too challenging to understand what that actually means. I'd tell you, it's interesting because particularly in Europe, you see August being a challenging month, because a lot of holidays. But, even in parts of Spain what we're hearing is that people are going to take fewer weeks of vacation to be able to deal with some of the backlog. And that is an area that you typically don't hear, that's at a response. And it's the same pretty much around the world. The general feedback that we're getting from service in hospitals is they're going to take fewer days of vacation to try to work through the backlog. Everyone recognizes there's a bolus of patients that need to get served. And my general sense is that you're going to see people try to work through that backlog. The only time that you would see maybe no -- something that would look different than that is in the public health system in Europe. But, we just don't have the same incentive to be able to work through it, and potentially sometimes even the budget to be able to work through it. But generally speaking, I'm getting very good feedback on the desire to work through the summer, work through this backlog and take care of patients. My sense is, we could see continued increases of utilization per system. And again, remember, go back to the tenants that we had in place as we design the system. One of the primary things we focused on was to make sure that it did not disrupt the surgical flow and it did not change the time to do a procedure. And that's what we're finding actually happening. So, the good news on that is it -- the surgeon can digest it more easily, because it doesn't change what they do as much. It just makes it better. But, what it also allows is more surgical volume, right, using robotics, because we don't slow the procedure down. So, I would expect, as people get more comfortable with it, and they see the difference in outcome for patients that use robotics versus not use robotics, I would expect it to continue to go up per unit. And then, obviously, as we place more units, I see those procedural lines increasing pretty quickly. Yes. I really do. We were very concerned out of the gate that we wouldn't be getting paid by hospitals, let alone, seeing this kind of traction. And I think the stimulus did help. I think it took the pressure off and it made hospitals feel more confident and comfortable to be able to continue to move their strategy forward. And so, our receivables, for instance, never really got significantly damaged during all this, because I think they felt comfortable with that liquidity. And we really haven't seen much of a change in demand, I mean, initially, for sure. I mean, people didn't know what was going on and they didn't know for sure what was going to happen. So, there was a month, period of time where there was a little bit of chaos. But as you worked through that and people felt more confident and comfortable in liquidity, things got back to normal pretty quick. I said normal. Clearly that's a new normal, not actual normal. Yes. I mean, clearly, you would see a natural desire from patients, I would think to be in a non-hospital setting, just given the issues around virus fear. So, it's not surprising to me that we're seeing some additional pace moving to the ASC from a procedure volume standpoint. And we are absolutely ensuring that commercially we're going to be ready for that. We've already focused on it obviously, but we're going to put that on steroids now. And I would say from a robotics standpoint, it plays quite well for us. Remember that you do not have to have a CT scan to be able to use a robotic system for ROSA and that helps us quite a bit in the ASC setting. And also, we'll go back to this idea of throughput, these are business people in ASC setting. Volume is very important to them. They have to get the throughput of patients to be able to get the same reimbursement and to be able to get the business dynamics that they want. And that ability to use our system without a change in time really matters to them. And so, again, I think it bodes well for us, quite frankly. And I'm very happy to hear that our competitor also saw surge in robotic placements. It tells you that the demand for robotics is real and the penetration of robotics is still very-low. And that to me is an opportunity for everyone who has a real robotics solution. Yes. Let me -- I'll answer that very specifically. But, let me pull up this for a second, because I think it's helpful context, because we are in a phase now where I feel much more confident and comfortable moving into active portfolio management, and we will absolutely move in that direction. But, it was important to get there, because I kind of think about this positioning, this Company transforming this company for success in three phases. The first phase was kind of obvious to everybody. We had to triage patients, right? We had real problems around culture, mission, connection just wasn't there, we didn't have the top level talent that we needed to be able to move the business forward, we had supply issues, quality issues, we had a DoJ monitor in the house. And so, we had all these things that we had to fix. And I'm not saying that we're not going to continue to focus in those areas, because it's going to evolve. But that was kind of Phase 1. We had to fix those things. Phase 2 is more around shifting to innovation, had to get new products out in the market, we had to be able to crystallize our strategy, and our focus in our strategic pillars, and then make sure we had the right organizational structure to drive that. So, all those things kind of happen in Phase 2, and we've got to have the operating mechanisms to make sure that we deliver on those things. Phase 3 really comes around portfolio transformation. And that's exactly what we're going to be focused on. And yes, I would say that the insights that we're getting from COVID, because we're learning every day, and we are applying those insights into the way that we're going to manage our strategy, didn't fundamentally change the strategy, but it's augmenting the strategy. And I would say that we will have a focus as we look for diversification, and being able to get better penetration in the ASC to be able to continue to focus in those subcategories and set that we know are going to be attractive, and to be able to think about acquisitions now, to get us away from our dependence on elective procedures. So, there's a lot of different sectors that we're considering now in the way that we're going to look at potential opportunities for acquisition. I would still say, as I said before, there are going to be smaller tuck-ins for now, because our access to liquidity isn't quite the same, just given what's going on right now. And we want to make sure that we stay investment grade, but we are clearly focused right now on active portfolio management."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zimmer Biomet First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, and Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me virtually today are Bryan Hanson, our President and CEO; and CFO, Suky Upadhyay.  Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that we recently made slight changes to our revenue reporting format as discussed on our fourth quarter call. These changes are designed to further align with the company's recent reorganization and are used in our first quarter results. Reconciliations are available on our website.  Additionally, our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may vary materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.  Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within the earnings release found on our website at zimmerbiomet.com.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: Thanks, Keri. And I think everybody knows that we're in different locations right now, so I'll just apologize upfront for any of the awkward handoffs that we have between each other for this earnings call and any bad cellphone connection and/or dogs barking in the background. I'm sure everybody's used to that by now.  I just also want to say before I get started that I certainly hope that you and your families are healthy and safe and trying to get used to this unusual environment that we're working in and living in right now. I can tell you that I've been home more consecutive days with my family than I have I'm pretty sure in the last 20 years, and I know for sure that they cannot wait for this to be over because they want me to get out of the house. So again, hopefully, you're managing through this as best as possible, certainly gives us an opportunity to learn things about ourselves that we did not know before and our families.  Given the fact that it is so unprecedented when we think about COVID-19 and really just thinking through it, there really is no proxy that you can look back on that would give you the pathway forward as a result of looking at that historic view. There's nothing that compares to this, I mean, when have we ever seen a global pandemic shut basically the world down.  And as a result of the significance of it, obviously, we want to make sure that we spend a lot of time talking about it today on the earnings call. I'll spend time walking through it. Suky will spend time giving his view of it. We'll let you know how it's impacting ZB, what we can give you relative to what we think will happen in the future from here. But the fact is there's going to be a lot of information moving back and forth, particularly in the Q&A, I'm sure.  And I just want to make sure that you walk away from the call with at least these 5 key points because at the end of the day, I truly do believe these will be the most significant and meaningful points that we have throughout the call. And the first one is really that Zimmer Biomet, myself included, have been very focused on ensuring that our 1 priority through all of this has been the safety of our team members. And I'll talk more about this in a minute, but I'm very happy with the momentum that we've picked up here very early to make sure that our team members are safe and the amount of energy that we've put behind this.  The second thing is that we have a high level of confidence that we have adequate liquidity and financial flexibility to manage through this storm. I would tell you that I'm very proud of the work that Suky and his team did to make sure that we backstopped the organization aggressively right out of the gate. And we do have a high level of confidence in our liquidity and financial flexibility as a result.  Number three, we also have a very high level of confidence in the recovery. I'm very sure that a majority of these patients will come back into the funnel. The biggest variable right now is just the timing of that. But just know that we have a high level of confidence the recovery will happen, and many, many of the patients that are being deferred now will come back in the funnel.  The fourth thing is that we will continue as an organization to invest in our key strategic areas, in research and development and commercial projects. This will not deter us from continuing to double down in those key areas, and I'll talk more about that in a minute. It doesn't mean that we won't save money because we have aggressively, but we will be committed to spending money in these key strategic areas.  And the fifth thing is that we are, just given the work we've done over the last 2 years to reshape the company, we are better prepared right now to deal with this challenge than we would have if it was 2 years ago. As a matter of fact, we feel confident that given that reshaping of the company and the position we're in, we cannot only come through COVID-19. We will come through in a better position as a result of the work that we have done.  So really, those are the 5 things. Safety is our 1 priority. We feel confident in the liquidity and financial flexibility of the company. We have confidence in the recovery. We will continue to invest in key strategic areas, and we are very confident we will come out the other end of COVID-19 in a better position than when we started.  Okay. So let's start with safety, and I'll just give you an overview of why I feel so confident here. Interestingly enough, last year, as a part of a broader risk mitigation kind of a planning process that we are going through, crisis management planning process, we actually did put together a comprehensive global pandemic plan. I know it sounds inconceivable that we did this literally months before the pandemic occurred, but we did have it in place. And as a result of that, to the extent possible, we were as ready for COVID-19 as you can be. And we mobilized that plan and the multiple work streams right away, very early on in January, actually. And that's been, from my perspective, a significant game changer for us. And I also think it's our ongoing transformation of ZB that has really been key in this whole process. We already had the means to tackle this because we had a stronger team. We've been able to put a stronger team together over the reshaping over the last 2 years. We have a very active and engaged business right now, and we have a very supportive culture. All those things are paramount to being able to get through a challenge like this, and we move to put new policies in place even before the COVID-19 reached pandemic status.  Very early on in the process, we began to shift immediately to work-from-home policies, no travel policies. We did not allow visitors in our distribution sites or our manufacturing facilities. We didn't want visitors entering the sites where our essential workers were. That just doesn't make any sense, right? We want to keep them as isolated as possible, and we did that right out of the gate. We had no large meetings, and we had broader social distancing practices in those sites that we are continuing to work.  And so again, I really do think that we moved aggressively and took a very proactive stance because we had the road map already laid out through that planning process. I also want to just thank all of our team members and especially our manufacturing, distribution and commercial teams, who have gone just truly above and beyond during this challenging time.  We still have team members who have been out in the hospitals every day. They're still there, making sure that the health care professionals that we have that are out there doing procedures still have what they need to be successful in those surgeries. And it's just impressive, really, truly on the front line to make sure that we move patient care forward.  Our team has also adhered to new safety protocols and has made changes to our sites and production lines and where possible, obviously, making sure that we are doing the work that we do in a safe and effective manner given the guidelines that we have right now for COVID-19. They've also managed temporary facility shutdowns to basically proactively modulate production where we need. And all the while, they've done all of this without disrupting our overall supply chain. So needless to say, I'm really proud of how the ZB team has taken safety so seriously out of the gate and has worked to achieve goals to keep not just our team members safe, but also our customers, our partners and our patients safe as well.  Okay. Moving on to number two and our confidence around the adequate liquidity for the business and financial flexibility. I would tell you just right out of the gate as we saw the challenges associated -- disruption associated with COVID-19, we took very aggressive measures to contain cost and also, obviously, to support the liquidity of the company.  One of the first things that we focused on was making sure that we refinanced our $1.5 billion of debt that came due on April 1 of this year. And then Suky and team went to renegotiating our $1.5 billion revolver and then shortly after that secured an additional $1 billion credit facility as an additional backstop. And so again, just kudos to Suky and his team to make sure they got right out ahead of this and made sure that we had that financial flexibility and liquidity strength in the organization.  Additionally, we've continued to execute on our previously announced restructuring program. As you may remember, this program was focused on streamlining our structure and just driving efficiency throughout the organization with the ultimate intent to allow for margin expansion over time, which we committed to, while also allowing for investment for growth.  Really, the only way that we could have both those things happen in tandem was to be able to put this restructuring plan in place. And actually, having the restructuring plan and the working group in place to move it forward actually helped us to quickly pivot and aggressively cut costs as a result of the COVID-19 challenges using the very work streams and really the mindset that we had in place for this program.  We've also modulated the schedules and the output across our manufacturing facilities, keeping an eye on cash consumption with inventory while also positioning the business for business continuity, right? We need to make sure that we have the inventory that is needed today. And also, we have the inventory for the recovery when it comes.  And finally, we implemented temporary base pay reductions for all of our salaried team members of about 20%. And we did 25% cuts for executive teams and then up to 100% reductions to the annual retainer of our Board of Directors. And as you probably have heard, I've taken personally 100% reduction in my pay during this period. Okay. Moving on to 3, our confidence in the recovery. What I'd tell you just first and foremost, the momentum that we had coming out of 2019 absolutely carried into the early part of the first quarter, obviously, pre COVID-19. But we were performing at or above our expectations pretty much across all businesses and regions.  Now there's no doubt that the pandemic has absolutely changed the landscape for everyone. But for ZB specifically, it has significantly impacted our business, probably more than most, just given our dependence on elective procedures. We have 80-plus percent of our global revenue that comes from elective procedures. That's the bad news. Now the good news is, as I said, our business was strong before the pandemic. And the good news is, we do believe that these patients will, in fact, come back into the funnel. The fact is you can certainly delay these procedures. There's no question about that. But the critical and really often life-changing nature of a knee procedure, a hip procedure, back surgery or other bone and joint procedures make us confident that these patients will ultimately return to the health care system.  And the fact is we've seen that. It's not an exact proxy, but we have seen when natural disasters occur or other market disruptions occur, and patients get deferred, they do, in fact, come back, the large majority of those do come back into the funnel. Now this is obviously significantly different than what we've seen in the past just given the volume of deferred procedures. There are other variables that make it harder to determine when they're going to come back. The fact is even OR capacity will have to be something that we consider in the short term with bringing these patients back, just given the number of patients. We're going to have to think about the access to PPE and/or testing kits. And we're also going to have to think about the psychological viewpoint of a patient on when they're ready to come back.  But I can tell you right now is we've done our own analysis, and we've done an extensive outreach to our customers. The one consistency is that everyone does believe the majority of these patients will come back. The question just becomes over when that's going to happen.  Based on our modeling right now and really our Q1 performance and our April performance, what we would say, if we're trying to put some color to this, is that, clearly, Q2 is going to be the most challenging quarter, and April as a month will be the most difficult month. We truly do believe after April, we're going to see sequential improvement on a month-to-month basis and on a quarterly basis until we get back to normal. But we definitely see April as the most challenging month and then sequential improvement from there.  Okay. Moving on to 4. As I said, we're going to continue to invest in a dedicated and disciplined way in key R&D and commercial projects. We're highly focused on the high-priority, high-growth areas of our business, and we're making investments to continue to drive innovation in those areas.  The fact is when we look at ROSA and/or any other robotics-related initiatives that we have, these are key priorities. And our investment, if anything, will accelerate right now and certainly the focus on these projects. And we're going to continue to build out our dedicated specialty sales teams and other high-value commercial programs. These things will not stop during this time.  In terms of supporting innovative commercial initiatives, we've launched recently the mymobility LE, which is a change to mymobility to make it more limited addition, lower cost version of mymobility, but really built for rapid deployment to help customers and patients respond to the needs of the COVID environment right now. mymobility LE and our exclusive partnership with Apple can be used by surgeons and care teams to actively, but importantly, virtually, support and guide patients preparing for the procedure and recovering from the procedure at home. This is an innovative and really alternative solution to continue delivering pre and post op care and reduce unnecessary in-office and hospital visits. It's perfect for this particular time and providing all the while through this mechanism, mymobility LE, providing real-time data on patient's progress so that surgeons know how that patient is doing.  It offers education. It offers video-guided exercises for rehab programs to be able to do that at home, to not have to have that personal contact with rehabilitation. And it provides direct video, picture and text-based messaging right to the patient, again allowing that patient and surgeon connection to be there, but also allowing that to happen with the new social distancing policies that are in place.  Another great commercial initiative that was put into place was to make sure that when AAOS conference was canceled in March that we immediately got to putting together a virtual, kind of a virtual reality AAOS experience, where health care partners can actually come in to the booth, again, virtually. But through that virtual experience, they can learn about the products that we would have shown at AAOS. They can talk directly with our commercial teams through that virtual experience, and they can even sign up for the trainings that would have been there or other trainings that we're doing online as well.  And I can tell you that out of the gate, this has been very well received by our surgeon partners. We've had over 7,500 site visits in the first 2 weeks alone. So again, we're going to continue to stay focused on investing in those areas that are important and strategic to the organization, and we're going to make sure that we continue to bring innovations that matter right now during the pandemic.  And finally, moving on to the fifth takeaway. We truly do believe that the work we've done over the past 2 years to reposition the company for success absolutely better positions us to be able to not just get through COVID-19, but to be able to emerge on the other side in a better position than when we started it.  This is clearly a challenging time that will test, I think it's obvious, even the best teams and the most innovative companies. And what I know for sure is that over the past 2 years, we have made real progress in transforming our culture, evolving our business strategy, improving our financial performance, and we have vastly improved our manufacturing supply and inventory management.  Our base business is strong, and we have a talented and dedicated global team that positions us very well for this challenge. We believe that this progress and, truthfully, our proactive stance and our financial stability also give us key competitive advantages right now during this challenging time that could open up new opportunities not just to drive innovation, but also grow our business and our share position in the near term.  And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky to get into more financial details.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and remain safe. I'd like to start by saying that our underlying fundamentals remain strong. Recall that in February, we announced a strong close to 2019 with top line results ahead of expectations, leveraged earnings, robust cash generation and continued deleveraging of our balance sheet.  While COVID-19 has had and will continue to have a significant unfavorable impact in the near term, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and to return to a positive trend over time.  Let me turn to first quarter revenues. Net sales were just under $1.8 billion, a reported decrease of 9.7% from the prior year and an operational decrease of 8.9%, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my commentary will be on a constant currency basis. Prior to COVID-19 reaching global scale late in the first quarter, most of our businesses and markets were trending at or ahead of expectations. However, the deferral of elective procedures as a result of hospitals redeploying resources to COVID-19 had a meaningful negative impact on our first quarter performance.  Across ZB, this impact became most pronounced in mid- to late March. Again, revenues for the first quarter were down 8.9% versus the prior year and down approximately 60% in the last 2 weeks of March. That trend extended into the first part of Q2, with April revenues down about 70% versus the prior year as we observe the impact of the pandemic intensify in submarkets. I'll break down the overall revenue trends I just mentioned, starting with regional performance and then move to our businesses. Beginning with Asia Pacific, the region decreased 9.5% in the quarter. We began to see procedure deferrals in early February at varying levels across the region and at varying times during the quarter.  Since it was one of our first markets to be impacted, I'll provide more color on China, which represents about 20% to 25% of the region's revenue. Here, we observed the largest and earliest declines, with procedures down 75% to 85% from early February to mid-March. This 6- to 8-week period represented the peak of deferrals. And since then, procedures in China have steadily increased, exiting the last week of the first quarter at about 40% down. So we saw some positive trend in China in the later part of the quarter. In April, China continued to improve and its averaging procedures being down about 25% with steady weekly improvement.  While China experienced some deep declines, Japan, our largest market in Asia Pacific, did not see a material impact from COVID-19 in the first quarter. However, there has been a modest decline in procedures since the country announced the state of emergency last month. In April, procedures and revenue in Japan are down about 15% and have been stable at that level. We remain cautiously optimistic that deferrals will not approach the levels of China as the Japanese government has not announced nor have we observed or seen a widespread deferral of surgery in the 4 or so weeks since the state of emergency was put in place.  Across all of Asia Pacific, in April, the deferral of procedures led to revenue being down about 25% versus the prior year. Moving to EMEA. The region decreased 11.7% in the quarter. Across EMEA, we saw some variability in the onset and timing of COVID-19, with 2 profiles emerging. One, countries impacted more severely, which represents more than half of the region, including countries like Italy, Spain, France, the U.K. and others, where we saw a significant reduction in procedures starting in mid-March and exiting the final weeks of the quarter down about 80% versus the prior year. Two, countries with a more moderate impact. This represents the remaining portion of the region and includes countries like Germany, Austria, Switzerland, among others. There, we saw reductions of about 60% in the final weeks of Q1. The level of impact in these markets continued into April, with both groups observing further declines.  Overall, in April, we saw EMEA procedures or revenue down about 75% versus the prior year. While we've seen some recent encouraging policy actions in many parts of EMEA, it's still too early to tell what level of impact this will have on revenue uptake in these markets. Lastly, the Americas decreased 7.7%. Here, the COVID-19 impact ramped up materially in mid-March with the U.S. shutdown and with federal and state government's guidance to defer elective procedures. The final 2 weeks of the first quarter, the region saw procedures or revenue declined about 70% versus the prior year.  Within the U.S., states were broadly impacted at about the same level. Through the month of April, we continue to see a decline in procedures with deferral rates of about 75% to 85% and revenue being down about 80% versus the prior year. Most recently, many states are taking policy steps to reopen elective procedures with the vast majority expected to do so by mid-May. It's too early to determine the ramp of procedures in those states, but this is an encouraging sign.  So let's turn to our businesses for Q1. Our global knee business declined 8.3%. Prior to the impact of COVID-19, we saw strong performance in the category driven by improved operational execution and the continued positive launch of Persona Revision. ROSA contributed to the sales early in the first quarter, with COVID-19 negatively impacted overall capital sales. Our hips business declined 9.7% in the first quarter. Underlying performance in hips prior to COVID-19 was solid due largely to continued launch traction for Avenir Complete.  Sports, extremity and trauma sales declined 5.8% in Q1. The first quarter decline was not as pronounced as in knee and hip, primarily due to the trauma/fissure, which is less selective by nature. However, we did experience a softer trauma market due to a generally mild winter and lower activity as a result of the global quarantine.  Looking beyond Q1 for revenue. As you know, we withdrew our 2020 full year guidance on April 6. Impact of COVID-19 continues to be fluid, and there are multiple market dynamics and variables that we're unable to quantify at this time. Given the current environment, we will not be providing updated financial 2020 guidance. But we do want to share information and insights into our business that might provide shaping of our revenue expectations for the remainder of the year.  We expect to see a sequential deepening of procedural deferral rates in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we observed a consolidated revenue decline of about 70% in April when compared to the prior year. And to recap, in April, by region, we saw declines of about 25% for Asia Pacific, about 75% for EMEA and about 80% for the Americas. Within April, we observed fluctuations by market throughout the month, with many remaining stable and some slightly improving their revenue ramp. As a result, we project May to be similar or slightly better than April, with an improving trend in June as countries and states reopen and begin to ramp up elective procedures.  We currently anticipate that the sequential improvement will continue into Q3 and then again into Q4 as procedures return. But the raising level of improvement remains fluid. Also, we do not assume a significant recurrence related to COVID-19 later this year. While we are encouraged by the recent leading indicators, our revenue trend could vary materially from the profile I just provided.  Turning to our P&L and liquidity. We're taking a disciplined and proactive approach to mitigate the earnings impact of the pandemic and to enhance our liquidity profile. However, COVID-19 will continue to put pressure on our earnings and free cash flow profile through the year, driving significant deleveraging versus our prior expectations. In terms of our first quarter results, we reported GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter of $2.46 compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.20 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.70 compared to $1.87 in the prior year.  In addition to the operational drivers that I'll speak to as part of our adjusted results, GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter were negative and lower than the prior year due primarily to goodwill impairment charges related to operating segment changes and to lower future cash flows due to the pandemic. In addition, GAAP results were impacted due to higher litigation expenses and restructuring charges related to the restructuring program we announced earlier this year. For additional commentary on GAAP results, please refer to our first quarter 10-Q to be filed later today. Turning to our adjusted results for the quarter. Earnings per share were lower than the prior year driven by decreased revenue. Adjusted gross margin was 72.7% or 60 basis points higher than the prior year. While gross margin was higher in the first quarter, as previously guided, we expect pressure on overall gross margins in 2020.  Gross margins were not significantly impacted in the first quarter by COVID-19 as the most pronounced impact was not felt until late in the quarter. However, COVID-19 will put additional pressure on gross margins for the remainder of the year due to less favorable mix and lower fixed cost absorption as a result of decreased revenue. Adjusted operating expenses were $831 million or a decline of 7.6% versus the prior year. Key drivers of the lower spending were reduced variable selling expenses related to lower revenues, the early impact of our restructuring program announced earlier this year and additional cost reductions as a proactive measure to deal with the pandemic. We were able to flex quickly on COVID-19-related cost reductions in the first quarter by leveraging the restructuring program already in place. Incremental cost reductions we took in March to deal with the pandemic will have an even larger impact into Q2. Overall, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.1%, 50 basis points lower than the prior year, again, driven by lower revenues.  Moving beyond operating margin. Interest expense of $51 million was down versus the prior year due to debt paydown through 2019. And our adjusted tax rate was 15.7% in the quarter, lower than expected due to the impact of certain favorable discrete items that we do not expect to repeat through the rest of the year.  Moving to cash and liquidity. Given the unprecedented challenges facing us, we have taken a number of steps to enhance our liquidity profile, including securing an additional credit facility backstop, amending covenants for greater operating flexibility and moderating cash expenditures in the near term.  We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $2.4 billion, and we generated approximately $325 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Our ending cash position was higher than normal due to the execution of a $1.5 billion of new senior notes in early March. Those funds were used to term out a $1.5 billion senior note maturity early in the second quarter.  To neutralize for this timing difference, underlying ending cash and marketable securities was about $900 million at the end of the first quarter. In April, we secured an additional $1 billion credit facility that will be in place through this calendar year, and we have our existing $1.5 billion credit facility that was in place prior to COVID-19. Combining cash and our available credit facilities, we have over $3 billion of immediate liquidity available to us in the near term.  The credit facilities will have a gross leverage covenant of 5.75x through 2020 instead of the 4.5x covenant in place prior to COVID-19. Also, both facilities remain untapped. For more details about the new credit facility and the amendment through the existing credit facility, please refer to our Form 8-K filed on April 29.  The steps we have taken should position us well to deal with the near-term challenges and set us up for strength through the recovery. Related to liquidity, our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with what we outlined earlier this year. But in the near term, we will focus our energy on navigating the challenges of the pandemic while strategically prepared to meet demand as end markets recover.  In terms of our P&L for the remainder of 2020, we do want to provide some broad insights to help you think about the rest of the year. Moving forward, the majority of our remaining cost base is fixed in the near term. And as a result of deeper revenue erosion, we expect margins will be significantly impacted in the next few quarters, down from Q1 and negative in the second quarter.  If the revenue trajectory improves in Q3 and Q4 as we project, we anticipate that margins and earnings will also improve. But earnings improvement may lag revenue improvement as we plan to increase our investments to prepare for market recovery.  Free cash flow should have a similar profile to earnings. We do want to remind you that the situation remains fluid, and these comments represent our best estimates at this time.  To summarize, our underlying financial fundamentals remain strong, and we have taken prudent steps to enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity profile. I'm proud of how the ZB team has responded to the crisis. We believe we're well positioned to address this challenge, lead in the recovery phase and accelerate our growth profile over the long term.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan.\nBryan Hanson: Thanks, Suky. And in closing, it's clear that the impact of COVID-19 is real and obviously material for ZB. But we do think it's also clear that ZB is positioned to address the challenge.  And again, if I can leave you with those same 5 things, I just want to make sure that we get these points across as I think you've been able to hear. We absolutely feel confident in our ability to keep our team members safe, and that will remain our 1 priority as an organization. We have a very high level of confidence in our liquidity and financial flexibility to manage through this challenge. We have confidence in the recovery. It's just a question of the timing of that recovery, but a high level of confidence in the patient funnel being there. And we will continue to invest in key R&D and commercial projects. The fifth piece is that we truly do believe that given some of the changes we've put into place as an organization over the past 2 years, we will come through COVID-19 stronger than when we entered it.  What we know is we have the absolute right team at ZB, and I want to thank each and every one of them for the amazing job they're doing right now. But we are highly confident that we're positioned to deliver value to our customers, our patients and importantly, to our shareholders.  And with that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Keri to move into the Q&A portion of the call.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Bryan. [Operator Instructions]. With that, operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.\nChristopher Pasquale: Bryan, I want to start off with -- obviously, not a surprise that the business was weak given everything that happened late in the quarter, but it does look like you lost a little bit of ground in hips and knees this quarter, which really reverses a recent trend of narrowing that gap versus peers. Can you talk a little bit about how you thought the quarter turned out from a competitive standpoint?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. Yes, Chris. I'll tell you, it's -- I don't know that I would agree with the statement, to be honest. I think that you've got such a confusing quarter given day rate differences, given mix of business in certain parts of the world that may or may not have been hit as hard as other parts of the world from the COVID-19 issue.  I think it's really challenging to look at this quarter in particular, truthfully any quarter, but this quarter in particular, and try to draw too much conclusion about either share gain, share loss, that type of thing. What I would say, though, is that we were feeling actually very good about our performance in both hips and knees before COVID-19, again, pretty much in every region.  I was actually looking forward to this earnings call before COVID-19 because I was pretty confident. Based on the trend that we were seeing, everyone was going to be very happy with the performance that we had. So it's very difficult for me to know exactly what's going on with my competitors. But I would say is almost across the board, I'd say the performance is a little better than I expected. And pretty much everybody in their earnings call did reference the fact that they were feeling confident about their business. Now again, it's 1 quarter, but that would indicate that everybody felt that the momentum in Q1 was good. That ultimately bodes well for all of us. So I'd like to see us do well, and I'd like to see our competitors do well. That's actually a good thing, all those rise in those situations. So again, very difficult to be able to draw parallel to what our numbers look like versus somebody else for all the reasons that I mentioned. But the general momentum and the feedback and the messaging that I'm hearing bodes well for the market at least pre COVID-19.\nChristopher Pasquale: That's helpful. And then could you just give us a little bit more color on when you think recon volumes return to year-over-year growth? And should people be thinking about pre COVID expectations is still being a reasonable proxy for where recovery ends up? Or are you baking in some lingering impact from the economic fallout or from your patients perhaps not wanting to engage with the health care system?\nBryan Hanson: Absolutely, Chris. It's tough because, as I said in my prepared remarks, I have a high level of confidence, not just me, by the way. This isn't my assumption. This is us talking to literally thousands of surgeons around the world on a weekly basis to find out how they're feeling about it as well. And there's clearly a lot of confidence around the large majority of patients coming back. Again, there's a lot of question marks on when it's going to happen. As I referenced before, there's a lot more complexity to this particular situation just given the volume of patients that are being deferred. As I mentioned, OR capacity will absolutely be something that we're going to have to consider, particularly in certain parts of the world. This access to PPE and test kits will be a factor. There's no question. And really just when the patient's going to be ready to come back in.  So to be able to put a specific time frame in place is challenging. So what I would tell you is that my confidence is how they're going to come back. And we'll not only get to pre COVID revenue numbers, I believe we'll surpass that. We'll see a positive tailwind come when these patients come back in the funnel, and we'll see extraordinary growth at some point. I just can't give you the specific time.  Generally speaking, as we think about it, as we provided in the script, we would say April is the most difficult, for sure, month that we're going to see. And we're going to see sequential improvement from there until we get back to normal. And then at some point, I would expect, again, extraordinary revenue numbers coming in as that patient funnel comes back into the mix.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Great. I just wanted to see if we could get some thoughts on the potential to move cases to the ASC in an effort to increase capacity over the near term from a recovery standpoint. I guess -- and then what types of cases you see moving there? And then when you're talking to your physicians, when they're thinking about putting or where it's appropriate, when they're thinking about scheduling cases again, what types of cases are being scheduled? Or are there any different dynamics that you're seeing that things being prioritized, complex versus relatively simple procedures? And just the overall timing of that return to volume specifically into Q2.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. I think it's -- again, it's very difficult to say because there's so many moving pieces and parts, but just logical extension argument would suggest that patients may feel, may feel, I want to make sure that I say that, may feel more comfortable coming into an ASC setting versus an acute setting like a hospital. And again, we won't know that for a fact until we actually see the patients come back and get a true assessment of how much of those patients are coming back to the ASC versus the hospital. But one could assume that there would be some desire to not go into an acute facility and feel more comfortable in an ASC setting. And again, we'll know that when it happens.  What I would tell you is that pretty much across the board, our procedures -- most of the procedures can be done in ASC setting, where our big volume comes in. And what we're seeing out of the gate, to be honest, is a higher volume of recovery in Revision cases versus your standard knee cases or hip cases. So clearly, those patients that have a desire to get in given kind of \"a more acute issue\" seem to be coming in first.  But again, it's very difficult to say. It's pretty fluid, as I've suggested, but I would expect, generally speaking, that momentum towards ASC to continue. We don't see whether it accelerates or not. And I would expect those patients that are more acute and have a higher level of desire to get back in to come into the funnel first.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kaila Krum with SunTrust.\nKaila Krum: Can you just speak to any updates on the strategy with your large joint robotic system? You mentioned that you're still investing there, but I'm just curious how or if your commercial approach may have changed for 2020, just given the current backdrop.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. What I would tell you is, first of all, thanks for the question. We're -- we remain very excited about ROSA and just overall robotics and the desire to bring robotics into orthopedics. And there's nothing that we've seen in the short term that at all, in any way, shape or form, changes that viewpoint. We truly do believe robotics is going to be the future of orthopedics.  What I would tell you is just honestly, as Suky mentioned, it had a very little impact for us anyway in Q1. And that's not surprising. It's not even concerning. The fact is most of the sales of a robotics program or capital program in general comes towards the end of the quarter. And I think as everybody knows, a lot of our robotics sales have been in the U.S. And so when the U.S. got hit so hard in the back half of the quarter, it's not surprising that a lot of those opportunities that we had got deferred.  The good news is that we're not seeing cancellation of any of the deals that we had in place. We're seeing deferment of those, and we're continuing to see very strong demand for robotics overall. Still seeing people trying to get queued up for training, which is a very good leading indicator of where robotics is going to go. And so we feel good about it.  We will absolutely flex with our customers. If customers are in challenging situations, remember, we have different ways, as we've said from the very beginning, of placing robotic systems. The real goal for us is to get them placed. And we'll work with our customers if they need flexibility in the way they acquire those systems and place those systems to make sure that we're flexing for their needs. The fact is we've got to remember that the major benefits associated with ROSA or robotics placement isn't necessarily the capital sale upfront. It's nice to have, no question about it, but it's really more around the annuity.  And also, quite frankly, when you do place these systems with the right type of contracting strategy, you also see kind of a by-product effect of better pricing stability because you typically get longer-term contracts in place. But if I just look at the annuity revenue associated with it, you get disposable revenue that is an uptick to the share of wallet you get in every procedure that is dedicated and needed for a ROSA procedure. You get the pull-through of competitive volume just kind of naturally occurs when you get a ROSA system in place, and you also get the service agreement.  So for us, this idea of flexing to help our customers in a time of need is real. We will need to do that, but the strategy holds. We've got to make sure that we're getting ROSA placements in, getting more robotics out, so it can help the patients with better accuracy and, ultimately, certainly helps the overall market growth as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: Could you please spend a minute on what it takes to roll out mymobility, and how you plan on -- or how you expect on seeing this in action as we get back to sort of a new normal? And I'm going to sneak a second question in, which is, when you think about that new normal, when do you think procedures will be back to sort of a stable or relatively normal run rate? This year or next year? Or if you get more granular than that, that would be great.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. I don't have -- I'll just hit the second question first. I don't have specifics on the normal time line as we referenced. I would say it's more likely next year, though, if I was just going to give you a very broad view of when I think it's going to come. It could be earlier than that, but it's very difficult to say. There's just a lot of moving pieces and parts right now.  When I talk about mymobility, I think there's -- in any crisis situation, there's this opportunity to move away from crisis management to crisis optimization. mymobility is a platform that we've had out for a while that has a good traction. But I can tell you the interest in an application like mymobility that allows for virtual interaction with the patient has gone up fivefold since this whole thing has started, with the social distancing requirements. And people really have a significant interest to get it out. That was the reason why we came out with the LE, how do we do this in a way that allows for absolute rapid deployment while still giving most of the characteristics of mymobility to the patient and to the surgeons so they can enjoy it while they're in this unnatural kind of COVID environment.  So the positive news is demand for this type of technology has gone up dramatically. And our team is pivoting very quickly to make sure that we have the right launch of mymobility to be able to take advantage of that and to make sure that we're deploying it in those accounts that are interested as quickly as possible.  So again, I'd rather not have the situation happening right now. But the fact is it is opening up people's eyes to this type of technology, and that benefits us because we already had it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs.\nAmit Hazan: I want to come back to China. They're obviously a couple of months ahead of us in this whole thing, and they've got a patient backlog there too, of course, but utilization seems to kind of still be stuck around down 25% through April. And I'm wondering if you can help us, if this is explained better in your view through the lens of hospital capacity issues or through the patient demand side factors like psychology, and if that at all helps to color what we should expect in the rest of the world.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. I'll take a shot at this just maybe topically. And then, Suky, if you have anything to add, feel free to do that, obviously. What I would tell you is that Suky was referencing what we have seen so far through April in China. And I would say, I'm actually very pleased with the recovery. I would be happy to see every other market that's being impacted by COVID-19 respond in the same way, with the same level of exuberance in the recovery.  If we look past April, just to give some more specifics, and I think it's warranted here just because it is our longest-standing proxy of what could happen. And I'm not saying this will happen. But the fact is we're already suggesting that as we get into June, China could be at 100% of what they were doing prior to COVID-19. And then post that, there's folks there on the ground that would expect us to be above 100%.  So again, we start to see some of that extraordinary growth come from patients coming back in the funnel. I have not heard from the China team a lot of concern around the specific concern of a patient coming back into the funnel. Whether that applies to other markets or not, who knows, but I'm not hearing that as a specific issue at least so far in the China market.  So again, I don't want to read too much into what we're seeing in China because there's a lot of differences that are occurring out the marketplaces. But I'm pretty pleased actually with the recovery that we're seeing in China and the timing of it. I don't know, Suky, if you had anything additional to add?\nSuketu Upadhyay: I think that's a good summary, Bryan. Only color I'd add on top of that in the midst of those numbers, at the deepest part, China was doing about 25% of their normal run rate. Within 2 months, they're up to 75% in April. So we're seeing a pretty steep V there. And again, as Bryan added, we expect that trend to continue over the near term. It's too early to tell if that same shape and pace of recovery will extend into other markets, but we're encouraged by what we saw in China.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Bryan, one on pricing. One of your competitors called out the potential for increased pricing pressure given the situation that hospitals are in. Can you comment on that? What is your expectation going forward?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. What I'd say, Larry, is that I don't -- to my view anyway, I don't see any real difference in pricing pressure. I mean, the fact is we've had austerity measures in the past. We have constant bombardment on pricing pressure every day of our lives, and I could certainly see where people might be looking for more. But the fact is there are competitive forces in place that would -- the pricing doesn't go down unless somebody gets the pricing. And I truly do believe in this situation. You're going to find that pricing will continue to be similar to what we've seen in the past. It's still not an attractive pricing environment. 2% to 3% is what we've always said. But I'd be surprised in the short term if we see anything deviate dramatically from that.  As a matter of fact, as I said before, what we're really focused on right now is leveraging broader contracting, either in concert with ROSA placements or robotic placements or just cross-business contracting using multiple categories, with the idea that we would be able to help our customers in the time of need, have longer-term contracts. And as a result of that longer-term contract, actually have more pricing stability. That will be our focus. I don't want to predict better pricing, but I also don't want to predict worse pricing in the short term here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nRobert Hopkins: Bryan, talking to the whole team, thanks for the details on April, very helpful. Would love to just get your thoughts on 2 things as it relates to expenses. Could you just clarify what percentage of your costs you consider to be fixed? And then as we look forward, maybe hypothetically into next year, if revenues get back to something that approaches 2019 levels, would margins also get back to 2019 levels? Or is there a reason why the recovery in margins may take longer than a recovery in revenues?\nBryan Hanson: Suky, why don't you go ahead and tackle that? And then I've got some color commentary afterwards. I'll provide it.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. So as we said in our earlier remarks, or I said in my earlier remarks, Bob, first of all, thanks for the question. We said more than half of our cost base is fixed in the short term. That breaks out a little bit differently across cost of goods and within OpEx. And cost of goods, it's probably much less than half is fixed. And then as you get into OpEx, I'd say a little bit more than half is fixed. And then the weighted average then takes the overall cost structure as more than half being fixed.  So that's how we think about our overall cost base. We did implement a number of cost-preservation activities in Q1 that will extend into Q2 to help with overall liquidity and earnings. And again, you'll get a full quarter of those into the second quarter. So we do expect that to be a bigger impact.  Having said that, if we do see a solid ramp here in May and into June, we may elect to start to invest even sooner than Q3 against the business to ensure that we're ready from a supply standpoint, from a channel standpoint, from a commercial standpoint to meet the end market recovery.  Relative to margins, we do think it could be slightly delayed versus revenue uptake, primarily because of some of those spending reductions we're taking that we're deferring. We may catch up on in the rest of the year. And then in addition, within cost of goods, some of the fixed overheads ultimately that might fall out as unfavorable variances because of lower revenues could get deferred and be recognized over time in the future. So those are 2 factors that could lead to margins ultimately lagging slightly behind the revenue uptake as we go forward.  It's too early to tell as to when margins could get back to 2019 levels. But as we said, Q2 is probably the low watermark, and then we would expect margins to improve as revenue improves.\nBryan Hanson: Just one additional comment on that. I think Suky's right on the money. But also it's very clear, when revenue comes back, that obviously has a direct and almost immediate impact to margins in a positive way. As we have some deferred expenses, hit that, it could delay it a little bit. But the fact is nothing is better than increased revenue growth to enhance margins.  And remember, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and I believe Suky did as well, we do have our restructuring program in place live and well. And the whole intent behind that restructuring program is to be able to continue to invest for growth, but do so while expanding margins. And we're pretty explicit the last time that we had talked about our goals associated with those margins. And the hope is this gets behind us, and we get right back on track with what we had predicted the last time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lewis: Bryan, just maybe some one broad comment, one related question. The -- this dynamic of the economy, this kind of consensus view that orthopedics is sort of more economically sensitive relative to other elective procedures across broader medical devices. I wouldn't hear a lot of talk about economy on this call. So do you accept that view that recon is sort of more economically sensitive? And sort of related to that -- but I think about your unique businesses, dental, recon and trauma, they're all very different. How do you see the recovery across those 3 different businesses?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. I think I'll hit the second one first. I think, trauma, obviously, will be the one to rebound more quickly. It's been down, obviously, and what you know is people just aren't out. And as a result of not being on, not being active, trauma business just gets hurt. But the fact is, as people start to get to street again and start to move again, we would clearly expect trauma to be the thing that recovers the fastest.  Recon would be next for us. And even the acuity level of those recon patients would kind of dictate who comes first into the funnel. And then dental would clearly be the cleanup in the way that I would look at it, be the last to recover for obvious reasons associated with the dental marketplace.  When I think about the impact that economic downturn has on ortho, I think, in the past, we've seen that it can have an impact. What we're doing when we're modeling this out, David, when you just think about the number of moving pieces and parts, we're assuming that the natural business, the natural growth of the business remains pretty consistent, that you're going to see the typical patient flow that would have been coming in over the rest of this year, over next year when things recover. And then you're going to see that incremental patient flow come because of those deferred patients.  So if anything for me, when I think about 2021 and potentially even beyond, I think we could have an opportunity as a market, which would be a false positive, but I think we could have a situation where you're seeing extraordinary growth during that time rather than depressed growth because of any kind of economic recovery issue. But that's just, again, just my view, based on data points that we're getting from folks that are out there in the world and what they're seeing and then also our own teams.  I would just tell you too, right now, we have an unprecedented amount of outreach to our customers. This is not just us sitting in a room, thinking about what's going on. We literally have thousands of touch points every week to surgeons and customers around the world to get insights. We're loading that through our sales force program, and we're able to use those insights to be able to give us a view of what we should expect. But that's just my personal overview based on those insights that I have right now.\nOperator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Keri Mattox for additional or closing remarks.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Lauren, and thanks, everybody. I know there were some other questions in the queue. Unfortunately, it is right up at 9:30, so we are going to wrap here. Of course, the IR team is available all day today, and we'll be speaking to many of you. If you have additional questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. And thanks so much for joining us today. Stay safe, and be well.\nBryan Hanson: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and those close to you are healthy and remain safe. I'd like to start by saying that our underlying fundamentals remain strong. Recall that in February, we announced a strong close to 2019 with top line results ahead of expectations, leveraged earnings, robust cash generation and continued deleveraging of our balance sheet.  While COVID-19 has had and will continue to have a significant unfavorable impact in the near term, we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges and to return to a positive trend over time.  Let me turn to first quarter revenues. Net sales were just under $1.8 billion, a reported decrease of 9.7% from the prior year and an operational decrease of 8.9%, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my commentary will be on a constant currency basis. Prior to COVID-19 reaching global scale late in the first quarter, most of our businesses and markets were trending at or ahead of expectations. However, the deferral of elective procedures as a result of hospitals redeploying resources to COVID-19 had a meaningful negative impact on our first quarter performance.  Across ZB, this impact became most pronounced in mid- to late March. Again, revenues for the first quarter were down 8.9% versus the prior year and down approximately 60% in the last 2 weeks of March. That trend extended into the first part of Q2, with April revenues down about 70% versus the prior year as we observe the impact of the pandemic intensify in submarkets. I'll break down the overall revenue trends I just mentioned, starting with regional performance and then move to our businesses. Beginning with Asia Pacific, the region decreased 9.5% in the quarter. We began to see procedure deferrals in early February at varying levels across the region and at varying times during the quarter.  Since it was one of our first markets to be impacted, I'll provide more color on China, which represents about 20% to 25% of the region's revenue. Here, we observed the largest and earliest declines, with procedures down 75% to 85% from early February to mid-March. This 6- to 8-week period represented the peak of deferrals. And since then, procedures in China have steadily increased, exiting the last week of the first quarter at about 40% down. So we saw some positive trend in China in the later part of the quarter. In April, China continued to improve and its averaging procedures being down about 25% with steady weekly improvement.  While China experienced some deep declines, Japan, our largest market in Asia Pacific, did not see a material impact from COVID-19 in the first quarter. However, there has been a modest decline in procedures since the country announced the state of emergency last month. In April, procedures and revenue in Japan are down about 15% and have been stable at that level. We remain cautiously optimistic that deferrals will not approach the levels of China as the Japanese government has not announced nor have we observed or seen a widespread deferral of surgery in the 4 or so weeks since the state of emergency was put in place.  Across all of Asia Pacific, in April, the deferral of procedures led to revenue being down about 25% versus the prior year. Moving to EMEA. The region decreased 11.7% in the quarter. Across EMEA, we saw some variability in the onset and timing of COVID-19, with 2 profiles emerging. One, countries impacted more severely, which represents more than half of the region, including countries like Italy, Spain, France, the U.K. and others, where we saw a significant reduction in procedures starting in mid-March and exiting the final weeks of the quarter down about 80% versus the prior year. Two, countries with a more moderate impact. This represents the remaining portion of the region and includes countries like Germany, Austria, Switzerland, among others. There, we saw reductions of about 60% in the final weeks of Q1. The level of impact in these markets continued into April, with both groups observing further declines.  Overall, in April, we saw EMEA procedures or revenue down about 75% versus the prior year. While we've seen some recent encouraging policy actions in many parts of EMEA, it's still too early to tell what level of impact this will have on revenue uptake in these markets. Lastly, the Americas decreased 7.7%. Here, the COVID-19 impact ramped up materially in mid-March with the U.S. shutdown and with federal and state government's guidance to defer elective procedures. The final 2 weeks of the first quarter, the region saw procedures or revenue declined about 70% versus the prior year.  Within the U.S., states were broadly impacted at about the same level. Through the month of April, we continue to see a decline in procedures with deferral rates of about 75% to 85% and revenue being down about 80% versus the prior year. Most recently, many states are taking policy steps to reopen elective procedures with the vast majority expected to do so by mid-May. It's too early to determine the ramp of procedures in those states, but this is an encouraging sign.  So let's turn to our businesses for Q1. Our global knee business declined 8.3%. Prior to the impact of COVID-19, we saw strong performance in the category driven by improved operational execution and the continued positive launch of Persona Revision. ROSA contributed to the sales early in the first quarter, with COVID-19 negatively impacted overall capital sales. Our hips business declined 9.7% in the first quarter. Underlying performance in hips prior to COVID-19 was solid due largely to continued launch traction for Avenir Complete.  Sports, extremity and trauma sales declined 5.8% in Q1. The first quarter decline was not as pronounced as in knee and hip, primarily due to the trauma/fissure, which is less selective by nature. However, we did experience a softer trauma market due to a generally mild winter and lower activity as a result of the global quarantine.  Looking beyond Q1 for revenue. As you know, we withdrew our 2020 full year guidance on April 6. Impact of COVID-19 continues to be fluid, and there are multiple market dynamics and variables that we're unable to quantify at this time. Given the current environment, we will not be providing updated financial 2020 guidance. But we do want to share information and insights into our business that might provide shaping of our revenue expectations for the remainder of the year.  We expect to see a sequential deepening of procedural deferral rates in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we observed a consolidated revenue decline of about 70% in April when compared to the prior year. And to recap, in April, by region, we saw declines of about 25% for Asia Pacific, about 75% for EMEA and about 80% for the Americas. Within April, we observed fluctuations by market throughout the month, with many remaining stable and some slightly improving their revenue ramp. As a result, we project May to be similar or slightly better than April, with an improving trend in June as countries and states reopen and begin to ramp up elective procedures.  We currently anticipate that the sequential improvement will continue into Q3 and then again into Q4 as procedures return. But the raising level of improvement remains fluid. Also, we do not assume a significant recurrence related to COVID-19 later this year. While we are encouraged by the recent leading indicators, our revenue trend could vary materially from the profile I just provided.  Turning to our P&L and liquidity. We're taking a disciplined and proactive approach to mitigate the earnings impact of the pandemic and to enhance our liquidity profile. However, COVID-19 will continue to put pressure on our earnings and free cash flow profile through the year, driving significant deleveraging versus our prior expectations. In terms of our first quarter results, we reported GAAP diluted loss per share for the quarter of $2.46 compared to diluted earnings per share of $1.20 in the prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.70 compared to $1.87 in the prior year.  In addition to the operational drivers that I'll speak to as part of our adjusted results, GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter were negative and lower than the prior year due primarily to goodwill impairment charges related to operating segment changes and to lower future cash flows due to the pandemic. In addition, GAAP results were impacted due to higher litigation expenses and restructuring charges related to the restructuring program we announced earlier this year. For additional commentary on GAAP results, please refer to our first quarter 10-Q to be filed later today. Turning to our adjusted results for the quarter. Earnings per share were lower than the prior year driven by decreased revenue. Adjusted gross margin was 72.7% or 60 basis points higher than the prior year. While gross margin was higher in the first quarter, as previously guided, we expect pressure on overall gross margins in 2020.  Gross margins were not significantly impacted in the first quarter by COVID-19 as the most pronounced impact was not felt until late in the quarter. However, COVID-19 will put additional pressure on gross margins for the remainder of the year due to less favorable mix and lower fixed cost absorption as a result of decreased revenue. Adjusted operating expenses were $831 million or a decline of 7.6% versus the prior year. Key drivers of the lower spending were reduced variable selling expenses related to lower revenues, the early impact of our restructuring program announced earlier this year and additional cost reductions as a proactive measure to deal with the pandemic. We were able to flex quickly on COVID-19-related cost reductions in the first quarter by leveraging the restructuring program already in place. Incremental cost reductions we took in March to deal with the pandemic will have an even larger impact into Q2. Overall, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.1%, 50 basis points lower than the prior year, again, driven by lower revenues.  Moving beyond operating margin. Interest expense of $51 million was down versus the prior year due to debt paydown through 2019. And our adjusted tax rate was 15.7% in the quarter, lower than expected due to the impact of certain favorable discrete items that we do not expect to repeat through the rest of the year.  Moving to cash and liquidity. Given the unprecedented challenges facing us, we have taken a number of steps to enhance our liquidity profile, including securing an additional credit facility backstop, amending covenants for greater operating flexibility and moderating cash expenditures in the near term.  We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $2.4 billion, and we generated approximately $325 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Our ending cash position was higher than normal due to the execution of a $1.5 billion of new senior notes in early March. Those funds were used to term out a $1.5 billion senior note maturity early in the second quarter.  To neutralize for this timing difference, underlying ending cash and marketable securities was about $900 million at the end of the first quarter. In April, we secured an additional $1 billion credit facility that will be in place through this calendar year, and we have our existing $1.5 billion credit facility that was in place prior to COVID-19. Combining cash and our available credit facilities, we have over $3 billion of immediate liquidity available to us in the near term.  The credit facilities will have a gross leverage covenant of 5.75x through 2020 instead of the 4.5x covenant in place prior to COVID-19. Also, both facilities remain untapped. For more details about the new credit facility and the amendment through the existing credit facility, please refer to our Form 8-K filed on April 29.  The steps we have taken should position us well to deal with the near-term challenges and set us up for strength through the recovery. Related to liquidity, our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with what we outlined earlier this year. But in the near term, we will focus our energy on navigating the challenges of the pandemic while strategically prepared to meet demand as end markets recover.  In terms of our P&L for the remainder of 2020, we do want to provide some broad insights to help you think about the rest of the year. Moving forward, the majority of our remaining cost base is fixed in the near term. And as a result of deeper revenue erosion, we expect margins will be significantly impacted in the next few quarters, down from Q1 and negative in the second quarter.  If the revenue trajectory improves in Q3 and Q4 as we project, we anticipate that margins and earnings will also improve. But earnings improvement may lag revenue improvement as we plan to increase our investments to prepare for market recovery.  Free cash flow should have a similar profile to earnings. We do want to remind you that the situation remains fluid, and these comments represent our best estimates at this time.  To summarize, our underlying financial fundamentals remain strong, and we have taken prudent steps to enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity profile. I'm proud of how the ZB team has responded to the crisis. We believe we're well positioned to address this challenge, lead in the recovery phase and accelerate our growth profile over the long term.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan. I think that's a good summary, Bryan. Only color I'd add on top of that in the midst of those numbers, at the deepest part, China was doing about 25% of their normal run rate. Within 2 months, they're up to 75% in April. So we're seeing a pretty steep V there. And again, as Bryan added, we expect that trend to continue over the near term. It's too early to tell if that same shape and pace of recovery will extend into other markets, but we're encouraged by what we saw in China. Yes. So as we said in our earlier remarks, or I said in my earlier remarks, Bob, first of all, thanks for the question. We said more than half of our cost base is fixed in the short term. That breaks out a little bit differently across cost of goods and within OpEx. And cost of goods, it's probably much less than half is fixed. And then as you get into OpEx, I'd say a little bit more than half is fixed. And then the weighted average then takes the overall cost structure as more than half being fixed.  So that's how we think about our overall cost base. We did implement a number of cost-preservation activities in Q1 that will extend into Q2 to help with overall liquidity and earnings. And again, you'll get a full quarter of those into the second quarter. So we do expect that to be a bigger impact.  Having said that, if we do see a solid ramp here in May and into June, we may elect to start to invest even sooner than Q3 against the business to ensure that we're ready from a supply standpoint, from a channel standpoint, from a commercial standpoint to meet the end market recovery.  Relative to margins, we do think it could be slightly delayed versus revenue uptake, primarily because of some of those spending reductions we're taking that we're deferring. We may catch up on in the rest of the year. And then in addition, within cost of goods, some of the fixed overheads ultimately that might fall out as unfavorable variances because of lower revenues could get deferred and be recognized over time in the future. So those are 2 factors that could lead to margins ultimately lagging slightly behind the revenue uptake as we go forward.  It's too early to tell as to when margins could get back to 2019 levels. But as we said, Q2 is probably the low watermark, and then we would expect margins to improve as revenue improves."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "Thanks, Keri. And I think everybody knows that we're in different locations right now, so I'll just apologize upfront for any of the awkward handoffs that we have between each other for this earnings call and any bad cellphone connection and/or dogs barking in the background. I'm sure everybody's used to that by now.  I just also want to say before I get started that I certainly hope that you and your families are healthy and safe and trying to get used to this unusual environment that we're working in and living in right now. I can tell you that I've been home more consecutive days with my family than I have I'm pretty sure in the last 20 years, and I know for sure that they cannot wait for this to be over because they want me to get out of the house. So again, hopefully, you're managing through this as best as possible, certainly gives us an opportunity to learn things about ourselves that we did not know before and our families.  Given the fact that it is so unprecedented when we think about COVID-19 and really just thinking through it, there really is no proxy that you can look back on that would give you the pathway forward as a result of looking at that historic view. There's nothing that compares to this, I mean, when have we ever seen a global pandemic shut basically the world down.  And as a result of the significance of it, obviously, we want to make sure that we spend a lot of time talking about it today on the earnings call. I'll spend time walking through it. Suky will spend time giving his view of it. We'll let you know how it's impacting ZB, what we can give you relative to what we think will happen in the future from here. But the fact is there's going to be a lot of information moving back and forth, particularly in the Q&A, I'm sure.  And I just want to make sure that you walk away from the call with at least these 5 key points because at the end of the day, I truly do believe these will be the most significant and meaningful points that we have throughout the call. And the first one is really that Zimmer Biomet, myself included, have been very focused on ensuring that our 1 priority through all of this has been the safety of our team members. And I'll talk more about this in a minute, but I'm very happy with the momentum that we've picked up here very early to make sure that our team members are safe and the amount of energy that we've put behind this.  The second thing is that we have a high level of confidence that we have adequate liquidity and financial flexibility to manage through this storm. I would tell you that I'm very proud of the work that Suky and his team did to make sure that we backstopped the organization aggressively right out of the gate. And we do have a high level of confidence in our liquidity and financial flexibility as a result.  Number three, we also have a very high level of confidence in the recovery. I'm very sure that a majority of these patients will come back into the funnel. The biggest variable right now is just the timing of that. But just know that we have a high level of confidence the recovery will happen, and many, many of the patients that are being deferred now will come back in the funnel.  The fourth thing is that we will continue as an organization to invest in our key strategic areas, in research and development and commercial projects. This will not deter us from continuing to double down in those key areas, and I'll talk more about that in a minute. It doesn't mean that we won't save money because we have aggressively, but we will be committed to spending money in these key strategic areas.  And the fifth thing is that we are, just given the work we've done over the last 2 years to reshape the company, we are better prepared right now to deal with this challenge than we would have if it was 2 years ago. As a matter of fact, we feel confident that given that reshaping of the company and the position we're in, we cannot only come through COVID-19. We will come through in a better position as a result of the work that we have done.  So really, those are the 5 things. Safety is our 1 priority. We feel confident in the liquidity and financial flexibility of the company. We have confidence in the recovery. We will continue to invest in key strategic areas, and we are very confident we will come out the other end of COVID-19 in a better position than when we started.  Okay. So let's start with safety, and I'll just give you an overview of why I feel so confident here. Interestingly enough, last year, as a part of a broader risk mitigation kind of a planning process that we are going through, crisis management planning process, we actually did put together a comprehensive global pandemic plan. I know it sounds inconceivable that we did this literally months before the pandemic occurred, but we did have it in place. And as a result of that, to the extent possible, we were as ready for COVID-19 as you can be. And we mobilized that plan and the multiple work streams right away, very early on in January, actually. And that's been, from my perspective, a significant game changer for us. And I also think it's our ongoing transformation of ZB that has really been key in this whole process. We already had the means to tackle this because we had a stronger team. We've been able to put a stronger team together over the reshaping over the last 2 years. We have a very active and engaged business right now, and we have a very supportive culture. All those things are paramount to being able to get through a challenge like this, and we move to put new policies in place even before the COVID-19 reached pandemic status.  Very early on in the process, we began to shift immediately to work-from-home policies, no travel policies. We did not allow visitors in our distribution sites or our manufacturing facilities. We didn't want visitors entering the sites where our essential workers were. That just doesn't make any sense, right? We want to keep them as isolated as possible, and we did that right out of the gate. We had no large meetings, and we had broader social distancing practices in those sites that we are continuing to work.  And so again, I really do think that we moved aggressively and took a very proactive stance because we had the road map already laid out through that planning process. I also want to just thank all of our team members and especially our manufacturing, distribution and commercial teams, who have gone just truly above and beyond during this challenging time.  We still have team members who have been out in the hospitals every day. They're still there, making sure that the health care professionals that we have that are out there doing procedures still have what they need to be successful in those surgeries. And it's just impressive, really, truly on the front line to make sure that we move patient care forward.  Our team has also adhered to new safety protocols and has made changes to our sites and production lines and where possible, obviously, making sure that we are doing the work that we do in a safe and effective manner given the guidelines that we have right now for COVID-19. They've also managed temporary facility shutdowns to basically proactively modulate production where we need. And all the while, they've done all of this without disrupting our overall supply chain. So needless to say, I'm really proud of how the ZB team has taken safety so seriously out of the gate and has worked to achieve goals to keep not just our team members safe, but also our customers, our partners and our patients safe as well.  Okay. Moving on to number two and our confidence around the adequate liquidity for the business and financial flexibility. I would tell you just right out of the gate as we saw the challenges associated -- disruption associated with COVID-19, we took very aggressive measures to contain cost and also, obviously, to support the liquidity of the company.  One of the first things that we focused on was making sure that we refinanced our $1.5 billion of debt that came due on April 1 of this year. And then Suky and team went to renegotiating our $1.5 billion revolver and then shortly after that secured an additional $1 billion credit facility as an additional backstop. And so again, just kudos to Suky and his team to make sure they got right out ahead of this and made sure that we had that financial flexibility and liquidity strength in the organization.  Additionally, we've continued to execute on our previously announced restructuring program. As you may remember, this program was focused on streamlining our structure and just driving efficiency throughout the organization with the ultimate intent to allow for margin expansion over time, which we committed to, while also allowing for investment for growth.  Really, the only way that we could have both those things happen in tandem was to be able to put this restructuring plan in place. And actually, having the restructuring plan and the working group in place to move it forward actually helped us to quickly pivot and aggressively cut costs as a result of the COVID-19 challenges using the very work streams and really the mindset that we had in place for this program.  We've also modulated the schedules and the output across our manufacturing facilities, keeping an eye on cash consumption with inventory while also positioning the business for business continuity, right? We need to make sure that we have the inventory that is needed today. And also, we have the inventory for the recovery when it comes.  And finally, we implemented temporary base pay reductions for all of our salaried team members of about 20%. And we did 25% cuts for executive teams and then up to 100% reductions to the annual retainer of our Board of Directors. And as you probably have heard, I've taken personally 100% reduction in my pay during this period. Okay. Moving on to 3, our confidence in the recovery. What I'd tell you just first and foremost, the momentum that we had coming out of 2019 absolutely carried into the early part of the first quarter, obviously, pre COVID-19. But we were performing at or above our expectations pretty much across all businesses and regions.  Now there's no doubt that the pandemic has absolutely changed the landscape for everyone. But for ZB specifically, it has significantly impacted our business, probably more than most, just given our dependence on elective procedures. We have 80-plus percent of our global revenue that comes from elective procedures. That's the bad news. Now the good news is, as I said, our business was strong before the pandemic. And the good news is, we do believe that these patients will, in fact, come back into the funnel. The fact is you can certainly delay these procedures. There's no question about that. But the critical and really often life-changing nature of a knee procedure, a hip procedure, back surgery or other bone and joint procedures make us confident that these patients will ultimately return to the health care system.  And the fact is we've seen that. It's not an exact proxy, but we have seen when natural disasters occur or other market disruptions occur, and patients get deferred, they do, in fact, come back, the large majority of those do come back into the funnel. Now this is obviously significantly different than what we've seen in the past just given the volume of deferred procedures. There are other variables that make it harder to determine when they're going to come back. The fact is even OR capacity will have to be something that we consider in the short term with bringing these patients back, just given the number of patients. We're going to have to think about the access to PPE and/or testing kits. And we're also going to have to think about the psychological viewpoint of a patient on when they're ready to come back.  But I can tell you right now is we've done our own analysis, and we've done an extensive outreach to our customers. The one consistency is that everyone does believe the majority of these patients will come back. The question just becomes over when that's going to happen.  Based on our modeling right now and really our Q1 performance and our April performance, what we would say, if we're trying to put some color to this, is that, clearly, Q2 is going to be the most challenging quarter, and April as a month will be the most difficult month. We truly do believe after April, we're going to see sequential improvement on a month-to-month basis and on a quarterly basis until we get back to normal. But we definitely see April as the most challenging month and then sequential improvement from there.  Okay. Moving on to 4. As I said, we're going to continue to invest in a dedicated and disciplined way in key R&D and commercial projects. We're highly focused on the high-priority, high-growth areas of our business, and we're making investments to continue to drive innovation in those areas.  The fact is when we look at ROSA and/or any other robotics-related initiatives that we have, these are key priorities. And our investment, if anything, will accelerate right now and certainly the focus on these projects. And we're going to continue to build out our dedicated specialty sales teams and other high-value commercial programs. These things will not stop during this time.  In terms of supporting innovative commercial initiatives, we've launched recently the mymobility LE, which is a change to mymobility to make it more limited addition, lower cost version of mymobility, but really built for rapid deployment to help customers and patients respond to the needs of the COVID environment right now. mymobility LE and our exclusive partnership with Apple can be used by surgeons and care teams to actively, but importantly, virtually, support and guide patients preparing for the procedure and recovering from the procedure at home. This is an innovative and really alternative solution to continue delivering pre and post op care and reduce unnecessary in-office and hospital visits. It's perfect for this particular time and providing all the while through this mechanism, mymobility LE, providing real-time data on patient's progress so that surgeons know how that patient is doing.  It offers education. It offers video-guided exercises for rehab programs to be able to do that at home, to not have to have that personal contact with rehabilitation. And it provides direct video, picture and text-based messaging right to the patient, again allowing that patient and surgeon connection to be there, but also allowing that to happen with the new social distancing policies that are in place.  Another great commercial initiative that was put into place was to make sure that when AAOS conference was canceled in March that we immediately got to putting together a virtual, kind of a virtual reality AAOS experience, where health care partners can actually come in to the booth, again, virtually. But through that virtual experience, they can learn about the products that we would have shown at AAOS. They can talk directly with our commercial teams through that virtual experience, and they can even sign up for the trainings that would have been there or other trainings that we're doing online as well.  And I can tell you that out of the gate, this has been very well received by our surgeon partners. We've had over 7,500 site visits in the first 2 weeks alone. So again, we're going to continue to stay focused on investing in those areas that are important and strategic to the organization, and we're going to make sure that we continue to bring innovations that matter right now during the pandemic.  And finally, moving on to the fifth takeaway. We truly do believe that the work we've done over the past 2 years to reposition the company for success absolutely better positions us to be able to not just get through COVID-19, but to be able to emerge on the other side in a better position than when we started it.  This is clearly a challenging time that will test, I think it's obvious, even the best teams and the most innovative companies. And what I know for sure is that over the past 2 years, we have made real progress in transforming our culture, evolving our business strategy, improving our financial performance, and we have vastly improved our manufacturing supply and inventory management.  Our base business is strong, and we have a talented and dedicated global team that positions us very well for this challenge. We believe that this progress and, truthfully, our proactive stance and our financial stability also give us key competitive advantages right now during this challenging time that could open up new opportunities not just to drive innovation, but also grow our business and our share position in the near term.  And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky to get into more financial details. Thanks, Suky. And in closing, it's clear that the impact of COVID-19 is real and obviously material for ZB. But we do think it's also clear that ZB is positioned to address the challenge.  And again, if I can leave you with those same 5 things, I just want to make sure that we get these points across as I think you've been able to hear. We absolutely feel confident in our ability to keep our team members safe, and that will remain our 1 priority as an organization. We have a very high level of confidence in our liquidity and financial flexibility to manage through this challenge. We have confidence in the recovery. It's just a question of the timing of that recovery, but a high level of confidence in the patient funnel being there. And we will continue to invest in key R&D and commercial projects. The fifth piece is that we truly do believe that given some of the changes we've put into place as an organization over the past 2 years, we will come through COVID-19 stronger than when we entered it.  What we know is we have the absolute right team at ZB, and I want to thank each and every one of them for the amazing job they're doing right now. But we are highly confident that we're positioned to deliver value to our customers, our patients and importantly, to our shareholders.  And with that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Keri to move into the Q&A portion of the call. Yes. Yes, Chris. I'll tell you, it's -- I don't know that I would agree with the statement, to be honest. I think that you've got such a confusing quarter given day rate differences, given mix of business in certain parts of the world that may or may not have been hit as hard as other parts of the world from the COVID-19 issue.  I think it's really challenging to look at this quarter in particular, truthfully any quarter, but this quarter in particular, and try to draw too much conclusion about either share gain, share loss, that type of thing. What I would say, though, is that we were feeling actually very good about our performance in both hips and knees before COVID-19, again, pretty much in every region.  I was actually looking forward to this earnings call before COVID-19 because I was pretty confident. Based on the trend that we were seeing, everyone was going to be very happy with the performance that we had. So it's very difficult for me to know exactly what's going on with my competitors. But I would say is almost across the board, I'd say the performance is a little better than I expected. And pretty much everybody in their earnings call did reference the fact that they were feeling confident about their business. Now again, it's 1 quarter, but that would indicate that everybody felt that the momentum in Q1 was good. That ultimately bodes well for all of us. So I'd like to see us do well, and I'd like to see our competitors do well. That's actually a good thing, all those rise in those situations. So again, very difficult to be able to draw parallel to what our numbers look like versus somebody else for all the reasons that I mentioned. But the general momentum and the feedback and the messaging that I'm hearing bodes well for the market at least pre COVID-19. Absolutely, Chris. It's tough because, as I said in my prepared remarks, I have a high level of confidence, not just me, by the way. This isn't my assumption. This is us talking to literally thousands of surgeons around the world on a weekly basis to find out how they're feeling about it as well. And there's clearly a lot of confidence around the large majority of patients coming back. Again, there's a lot of question marks on when it's going to happen. As I referenced before, there's a lot more complexity to this particular situation just given the volume of patients that are being deferred. As I mentioned, OR capacity will absolutely be something that we're going to have to consider, particularly in certain parts of the world. This access to PPE and test kits will be a factor. There's no question. And really just when the patient's going to be ready to come back in.  So to be able to put a specific time frame in place is challenging. So what I would tell you is that my confidence is how they're going to come back. And we'll not only get to pre COVID revenue numbers, I believe we'll surpass that. We'll see a positive tailwind come when these patients come back in the funnel, and we'll see extraordinary growth at some point. I just can't give you the specific time.  Generally speaking, as we think about it, as we provided in the script, we would say April is the most difficult, for sure, month that we're going to see. And we're going to see sequential improvement from there until we get back to normal. And then at some point, I would expect, again, extraordinary revenue numbers coming in as that patient funnel comes back into the mix. Yes. I think it's -- again, it's very difficult to say because there's so many moving pieces and parts, but just logical extension argument would suggest that patients may feel, may feel, I want to make sure that I say that, may feel more comfortable coming into an ASC setting versus an acute setting like a hospital. And again, we won't know that for a fact until we actually see the patients come back and get a true assessment of how much of those patients are coming back to the ASC versus the hospital. But one could assume that there would be some desire to not go into an acute facility and feel more comfortable in an ASC setting. And again, we'll know that when it happens.  What I would tell you is that pretty much across the board, our procedures -- most of the procedures can be done in ASC setting, where our big volume comes in. And what we're seeing out of the gate, to be honest, is a higher volume of recovery in Revision cases versus your standard knee cases or hip cases. So clearly, those patients that have a desire to get in given kind of \"a more acute issue\" seem to be coming in first.  But again, it's very difficult to say. It's pretty fluid, as I've suggested, but I would expect, generally speaking, that momentum towards ASC to continue. We don't see whether it accelerates or not. And I would expect those patients that are more acute and have a higher level of desire to get back in to come into the funnel first. Yes. What I would tell you is, first of all, thanks for the question. We're -- we remain very excited about ROSA and just overall robotics and the desire to bring robotics into orthopedics. And there's nothing that we've seen in the short term that at all, in any way, shape or form, changes that viewpoint. We truly do believe robotics is going to be the future of orthopedics.  What I would tell you is just honestly, as Suky mentioned, it had a very little impact for us anyway in Q1. And that's not surprising. It's not even concerning. The fact is most of the sales of a robotics program or capital program in general comes towards the end of the quarter. And I think as everybody knows, a lot of our robotics sales have been in the U.S. And so when the U.S. got hit so hard in the back half of the quarter, it's not surprising that a lot of those opportunities that we had got deferred.  The good news is that we're not seeing cancellation of any of the deals that we had in place. We're seeing deferment of those, and we're continuing to see very strong demand for robotics overall. Still seeing people trying to get queued up for training, which is a very good leading indicator of where robotics is going to go. And so we feel good about it.  We will absolutely flex with our customers. If customers are in challenging situations, remember, we have different ways, as we've said from the very beginning, of placing robotic systems. The real goal for us is to get them placed. And we'll work with our customers if they need flexibility in the way they acquire those systems and place those systems to make sure that we're flexing for their needs. The fact is we've got to remember that the major benefits associated with ROSA or robotics placement isn't necessarily the capital sale upfront. It's nice to have, no question about it, but it's really more around the annuity.  And also, quite frankly, when you do place these systems with the right type of contracting strategy, you also see kind of a by-product effect of better pricing stability because you typically get longer-term contracts in place. But if I just look at the annuity revenue associated with it, you get disposable revenue that is an uptick to the share of wallet you get in every procedure that is dedicated and needed for a ROSA procedure. You get the pull-through of competitive volume just kind of naturally occurs when you get a ROSA system in place, and you also get the service agreement.  So for us, this idea of flexing to help our customers in a time of need is real. We will need to do that, but the strategy holds. We've got to make sure that we're getting ROSA placements in, getting more robotics out, so it can help the patients with better accuracy and, ultimately, certainly helps the overall market growth as well. Yes. I don't have -- I'll just hit the second question first. I don't have specifics on the normal time line as we referenced. I would say it's more likely next year, though, if I was just going to give you a very broad view of when I think it's going to come. It could be earlier than that, but it's very difficult to say. There's just a lot of moving pieces and parts right now.  When I talk about mymobility, I think there's -- in any crisis situation, there's this opportunity to move away from crisis management to crisis optimization. mymobility is a platform that we've had out for a while that has a good traction. But I can tell you the interest in an application like mymobility that allows for virtual interaction with the patient has gone up fivefold since this whole thing has started, with the social distancing requirements. And people really have a significant interest to get it out. That was the reason why we came out with the LE, how do we do this in a way that allows for absolute rapid deployment while still giving most of the characteristics of mymobility to the patient and to the surgeons so they can enjoy it while they're in this unnatural kind of COVID environment.  So the positive news is demand for this type of technology has gone up dramatically. And our team is pivoting very quickly to make sure that we have the right launch of mymobility to be able to take advantage of that and to make sure that we're deploying it in those accounts that are interested as quickly as possible.  So again, I'd rather not have the situation happening right now. But the fact is it is opening up people's eyes to this type of technology, and that benefits us because we already had it. Yes. I'll take a shot at this just maybe topically. And then, Suky, if you have anything to add, feel free to do that, obviously. What I would tell you is that Suky was referencing what we have seen so far through April in China. And I would say, I'm actually very pleased with the recovery. I would be happy to see every other market that's being impacted by COVID-19 respond in the same way, with the same level of exuberance in the recovery.  If we look past April, just to give some more specifics, and I think it's warranted here just because it is our longest-standing proxy of what could happen. And I'm not saying this will happen. But the fact is we're already suggesting that as we get into June, China could be at 100% of what they were doing prior to COVID-19. And then post that, there's folks there on the ground that would expect us to be above 100%.  So again, we start to see some of that extraordinary growth come from patients coming back in the funnel. I have not heard from the China team a lot of concern around the specific concern of a patient coming back into the funnel. Whether that applies to other markets or not, who knows, but I'm not hearing that as a specific issue at least so far in the China market.  So again, I don't want to read too much into what we're seeing in China because there's a lot of differences that are occurring out the marketplaces. But I'm pretty pleased actually with the recovery that we're seeing in China and the timing of it. I don't know, Suky, if you had anything additional to add? Yes. What I'd say, Larry, is that I don't -- to my view anyway, I don't see any real difference in pricing pressure. I mean, the fact is we've had austerity measures in the past. We have constant bombardment on pricing pressure every day of our lives, and I could certainly see where people might be looking for more. But the fact is there are competitive forces in place that would -- the pricing doesn't go down unless somebody gets the pricing. And I truly do believe in this situation. You're going to find that pricing will continue to be similar to what we've seen in the past. It's still not an attractive pricing environment. 2% to 3% is what we've always said. But I'd be surprised in the short term if we see anything deviate dramatically from that.  As a matter of fact, as I said before, what we're really focused on right now is leveraging broader contracting, either in concert with ROSA placements or robotic placements or just cross-business contracting using multiple categories, with the idea that we would be able to help our customers in the time of need, have longer-term contracts. And as a result of that longer-term contract, actually have more pricing stability. That will be our focus. I don't want to predict better pricing, but I also don't want to predict worse pricing in the short term here. Suky, why don't you go ahead and tackle that? And then I've got some color commentary afterwards. I'll provide it. Just one additional comment on that. I think Suky's right on the money. But also it's very clear, when revenue comes back, that obviously has a direct and almost immediate impact to margins in a positive way. As we have some deferred expenses, hit that, it could delay it a little bit. But the fact is nothing is better than increased revenue growth to enhance margins.  And remember, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and I believe Suky did as well, we do have our restructuring program in place live and well. And the whole intent behind that restructuring program is to be able to continue to invest for growth, but do so while expanding margins. And we're pretty explicit the last time that we had talked about our goals associated with those margins. And the hope is this gets behind us, and we get right back on track with what we had predicted the last time. Yes. I think I'll hit the second one first. I think, trauma, obviously, will be the one to rebound more quickly. It's been down, obviously, and what you know is people just aren't out. And as a result of not being on, not being active, trauma business just gets hurt. But the fact is, as people start to get to street again and start to move again, we would clearly expect trauma to be the thing that recovers the fastest.  Recon would be next for us. And even the acuity level of those recon patients would kind of dictate who comes first into the funnel. And then dental would clearly be the cleanup in the way that I would look at it, be the last to recover for obvious reasons associated with the dental marketplace.  When I think about the impact that economic downturn has on ortho, I think, in the past, we've seen that it can have an impact. What we're doing when we're modeling this out, David, when you just think about the number of moving pieces and parts, we're assuming that the natural business, the natural growth of the business remains pretty consistent, that you're going to see the typical patient flow that would have been coming in over the rest of this year, over next year when things recover. And then you're going to see that incremental patient flow come because of those deferred patients.  So if anything for me, when I think about 2021 and potentially even beyond, I think we could have an opportunity as a market, which would be a false positive, but I think we could have a situation where you're seeing extraordinary growth during that time rather than depressed growth because of any kind of economic recovery issue. But that's just, again, just my view, based on data points that we're getting from folks that are out there in the world and what they're seeing and then also our own teams.  I would just tell you too, right now, we have an unprecedented amount of outreach to our customers. This is not just us sitting in a room, thinking about what's going on. We literally have thousands of touch points every week to surgeons and customers around the world to get insights. We're loading that through our sales force program, and we're able to use those insights to be able to give us a view of what we should expect. But that's just my personal overview based on those insights that I have right now. Thanks, everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zimmer Biomet Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 7, 2022. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q4 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: All right. Great. Thanks, Keri, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm going to just give you an outline of how we want the call to proceed this morning. I'm going to spend the first part of the discussion briefly talking about our fourth quarter results, and I'm also going to spend a little bit of time talking about what we're seeing so far in 2022. I know it's early, but I want to give you a sense of what we're seeing already and then just speak more broadly about our views of 2022 as a whole. And then I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who's going to provide more detail on fourth quarter; and obviously, more detail on our guidance going forward. And then finally, it will come back to me before we move to Q&A. I just got a few things I want to close out the prepared remarks with, and then we'll again jump into Q&A. Okay. So first, let's start with Q4, and I'm going to break this into really three categories. The first will be around COVID impact in Q4 and how it compared to our expectations. The second will be around VBP impact and again, how that compared to our expectations. And then finally, just performance outside of those environmental impacts and how we performed there. Okay. So let's take a step back first. I think that will help. Just when we gave our updated Q4 guidance on our Q3 earnings call back in November, we actually outlined our expectations around how COVID and staffing pressure would likely impact our fourth quarter results, and unfortunately our assumptions largely played out in the quarter. As you probably remember, we felt that the pressure from the end of Q3 would continue into Q4. And thus, the overall pressure from COVID and staffing would actually accelerate from Q3 to Q4. And really, the big reason this played out, of course, we know now is because of the Omicron surge that occurred towards the end of the fourth quarter. And as many have already stated, a lot of that impact truly came in December itself. So, what's interesting about this surge, though, is that even though the overall impact of COVID was about what we expected, the way it manifested was different, right? So, ICU capacity was definitely a factor, but we did not see it as the primary driver of cancellations of procedures during the quarter. And so, what we actually saw was more cancellations that occurred due to really either the patient or staffing member being diagnosed with COVID or actually having been around someone with COVID, and they were quarantining as a result and couldn't show up for the procedure. So that was really the shift that we saw in the quarter. So, the overall impact was about what we expected, but the way, again, it manifested in the numbers was slightly different. Okay, so transitioning from there to VBP. Remember again on our Q3 call, we discussed what we thought the impact of China hip and knee VBP would be in our fourth quarter results. And we actually - we were largely right on how that played out. And so, our expected headwind in large joints was in line with the expectations that we had and also what we communicated to you. So that was pretty much in check when we think about large joints. Now what changed during the quarter, actually even post the quarter was that on January 24, the Chinese government announced that it was formally nationalizing one of its provincial trauma VBP tenders, and that was kind of new to us. But based on that confirmation from the Chinese government and really just our knowledge of how the VBP process will work from here, we did take a sales reserve in the fourth quarter, which obviously results then in a negative Q4 impact to both our net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. And what I'd say is that even though this trauma VBP adjustment came earlier than we anticipated, it is pretty consistent with the overall scale of the impact and consistent with our expectations and what we've been talking about more recently. Now, I would say looking forward, the good news is we have a lot more visibility now. We're a lot smarter on the topic, and we understand what the impact of VBP will now be on our 2022 business. And that has been included in our guidance, which Suky's going to talk about in just a minute. Okay, so now looking past VBP and COVID in the fourth quarter, I'm very proud of the team when we focus on the things we can control. ZB's business execution against the challenging backdrop has been strong. Our strength of our team right now, that\u2019s kind of one ZB culture, is as evident as it's ever been, and I think more important than ever. And the team has really been able to move our strategy forward even in these challenging times. And a few proof points to be able to point at, the team was able to drive continued strong demand and momentum for ROSA, and that is globally, not just in the U.S. but globally. We actually more than doubled the number of installed ROSAs in 2021 versus our cumulative total at the end of 2020. That's a pretty significant jump up, and again, speaks to the momentum that we have in robotics and orthopedics. And those ROSAs are paying off. In the fourth quarter, those installed ROSAs allowed us to reach 10% in total knee procedure penetration in the U.S. for the first time as a company. That's a huge milestone for the organization, and it's just the beginning of this ROSA journey for us. The team also delivered a successful limited launch of the world's first and really only smart knee, the Persona iQ. Now it's early. Obviously, early days. We're in limited launch right now, as I said. But the launch trajectory feels great. The feedback is good, and we're looking forward to a full launch later this year. And then finally, and I think importantly, the team continues to execute in large joints across the board, driving again above-market performance in Q4 in the U.S. for both knees and hips versus 2019. Okay. So, let's transition from Q4 and talk about what we're seeing so far in early 2022. And I'm going to speak specifically about COVID and staffing challenges. What I would tell you is that the challenges that we saw in Q4, in particular in December, are unfortunately continuing into January. And as a practice, and I think prudently so, our team is continuing to build our financial models using what I'm going to call a recency bias in those models. And as a result of that, we're expecting that December and really now January pressure in COVID and staffing will continue through Q1. So, what we're basically saying is that overall, we anticipate that Q1 will likely be more pressured than Q4 was. And so what does that mean for our outlook for the full year? Again, we're going to follow that same approach. We're going to look at 2022 in a similar way, actually, in a very similar way in the way we gave guidance for Q4 of 2021. Until we see a fundamental shift in the current state and what's happening today in the environment, we are projecting that the COVID pressure will continue throughout the year and will be -- actually follow a similar peak and valley trend that we saw in 2021. As I'm sure you can appreciate, given that about 80% of our revenues come from elective procedures, ZB must be highly attuned to this topic. And trust me, we are. We're highly focused in this area, and that has been captured in our assumptions for guidance. And with that, I'm going to transition to Suky to give you again more detail on Q4 and also our 2022 guidance. Okay, Suky?\nSuky Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. For this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 3 topics: first, our Q4 results, including commentary on the impact of COVID; second, how that translates into full year '22 financial guidance that we provided this morning; and third, I'll provide a brief update on our longer-term outlook. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter 2021 and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. We've also provided changes versus the fourth quarter of 2019 or prepandemic results as we feel it is an important comparison. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $2.04 billion, a reported decline of 2.3% and a constant currency decline of 0.8% or down 4.4% versus '19. On a consolidated basis, we were about flat through November versus 2019 and declined in December due to the Omicron variant surge. Expectations for the fourth quarter had contemplated the impact of China VBP in hip and knee, and that was largely in line with expectations. Separately, we booked the sales adjustment related to channel inventory for China VBP in trauma of approximately $30 million, triggered in part by the Chinese government's announcement relating to a national trauma VBP, which was made on January 24. This adjustment was about a 650 basis point headwind to S.E.T. category growth and about a 150 basis point drag on consolidated Q4 growth. In short, excluding the impact of the China VBP on our S.E.T. results, the quarter was generally in line with the assumptions that we provided on our third quarter call and broadly consistent with the midpoint of our implied fourth quarter guidance range. The Americas declined 1.5% in the fourth quarter, down 1.9% versus 2019, with the U.S. declining 2.3% or down 2.4 versus 2019. The impact of Omicron late in the quarter, in tandem with lingering hospital staffing challenges, drove lower regional results. EMEA grew 17.3% or down 3% versus '19. The region experienced positive growth versus '19 earlier in the quarter, but quickly decelerated with the emergence of Omicron. Lastly, Asia Pacific declined 17.5% or down 15.1% versus '19 driven primarily by price adjustments on channel inventory ahead of hip, knee and trauma VBP as well as some negative impact from a spike in COVID cases starting in December in markets like Japan and Australia. Now turning to our business category performance in the fourth quarter. The global knee business increased 0.4% or down 3.9% versus 2019 with U.S. knees declining 5.2% or 3.9% versus '19. In the quarter, China VBP had a negative impact on knee growth of about 250 basis points. Our global hip business declined 2.8% or down 6% versus '19, with U.S. hips declining 4.4% or 3% versus '19. VBP impact on hip was about 700 basis points in the quarter. Our sports, extremity and trauma category decreased 4.3% or down 6.2 versus '19. The sequential deceleration was due to a softer market due to COVID and the impact of China National VBP in trauma, as discussed earlier. Excluding the impact of trauma VBP in the quarter, S.E.T. was growing low single digits versus 2020 and about flat versus '19 on an underlying basis. The dental and spine category declined 3% or down 3.8% versus '19, with dental posting growth and spine declining primarily due to continued pressure from COVID. Finally, our other category grew 14.1% or up 1.9% versus '19. Inside this category, we saw ongoing demand for ROSA Knee as well as increased revenues from the launch of our ROSA Partial Knee and hip applications. Moving on to our P&L. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.40 compared to our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.59 in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by lower revenue, a debt extinguishment loss recognized on our bond tender offer, litigation-related charges and restructuring charges that we incurred in Q4 to continue to address pressures on revenue from COVID and the stranded costs associated with the spin. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.95 represented a decline from $2.11 in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease was primarily from lower revenues in tandem with lower gross margins due to COVID-19 and the impact of China VBP in both recon and trauma, which were partially offset by targeted reductions in SG&A and a slightly lower tax rate. In addition, FX was a modest headwind to earnings per share in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 69.1%. Fourth quarter gross margin was pressured due to lower manufacturing volumes and the impact of China VBP. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 70.7% and in line with prior commentary. Our adjusted operating expenses of $882 million declined year-over-year. Inside of that, we continue to invest in R&D and commercial infrastructure across priority areas like S.E.T., robotics and data and informatics, which are being funded by accelerated improvements in efficiency across other areas of SG&A. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 25.9%, down versus the prior year, but in line with the prior quarter. The adjusted tax rate was 14.4% in the quarter. Q4 and full year tax rates were favorable to our expectations due to some discrete onetime items in the quarter. Turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $366 million, and free cash flows totaled $224 million with an ending cash and cash equivalents balance of just $480 million. We continue to make good progress on delevering the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $400 million, bringing the total debt reduction in '21 to approximately $900 million, excluding the effects of foreign currency on non-U.S. denominated debt. Moving to our financial outlook for 2022. We are issuing '22 financial guidance based on the following key assumptions. COVID and customer staffing pressures are expected to continue throughout 2022. We expect the COVID and staffing pressures that we saw in December to accelerate into the first quarter of this year with the first half of 2022 being more pressured than the second half. We do not see China VBP as a material impact to growth in '22 versus '21, but we expect variability by quarter with more pressure in the first half. Furthermore, we anticipate completing the spin of our dental and spine businesses in the near term. And as such, the guidance we are providing is only for RemainCo Zimmer Biomet. For the first quarter, ZimVie will be reported as discontinued operations, and we expect to provide pro forma 2021 information for RemainCo on or around our first quarter earnings call. While we do not have full P&L restatements available at this time, for comparison, we have provided our unaudited net sales estimate of $6.827 billion for RemainCo Zimmer Biomet. Against this backdrop, our current expectations for the full year 2022 financial outlook are reported revenue growth in the range of negative 4% to 0 versus 2021 with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 200 basis points. This translates to negative 2% to positive 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating profit margin of 26.5% to 27.5%, adjusted tax rate of 16% to 16.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $6.80 and free cash flow of $700 million to $800 million. Inside of that guidance, we expect Q1 revenue to be flat to up slightly versus the first quarter 2021 due to headwinds from COVID and the impact of VBP being somewhat offset by the easier comp relative to the first quarter of last year and a roughly 130 basis point selling day tailwind that will largely be reversed in the fourth quarter. We expect approximately $160 million of net interest expense and approximately 212 million average shares outstanding for the year. We remain committed to our investment grade rating and expect to pay down $750 million of debt maturing in the second quarter of this year. Now turning to our longer-term outlook. With the ZimVie spin transaction nearing completion, we are also taking this opportunity to update our long-term margin expectations. Given the prolonged impact COVID-19 is having on our business, we are removing our target of at least 30% adjusted operating profit margin exiting 2023. However, we do expect to improve margins over the long term as we will continue to make targeted investments in our business to enhance top line growth while also accelerating cost savings to fund those investments. In summary, the macro environment presents challenges, but our underlying business fundamentals remain strong as we continue to execute successfully against what we can control. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJoshJennings: Good morning, thanks, for taking the questions. Just wanted to start off on '22 -- 2022 revenue guidance and just make sure I understand the impact of VBP that you're baking into the range. I know you don't usually break out guidance for specific regions. But anything you can do to just help us think about what's baked in for Americas and EMEA versus Asia Pac into that down 4 to flat on a constant currency basis for 2022? And then just as a follow-up on the operating margin guidance, just the trajectory. I know as these pressures are in play, you've taken another look at that in that 30% target. But just as you're moving through these transformation programs and looking at regional profitability, infrastructure in smaller markets and other areas of cost reductions, I mean, how do you balance that with the top line growth projections? Is there any risk that you're going to be impacting revenue growth over the next couple of years by pursuing these transformation programs? Thanks for taking the questions.\nBryanHanson: Yes. Maybe, I'll just start real quick on that last portion of it, and then I'll pass it over to you, Suky. We actually feel more confident in our ability to invest for growth in the business because of the transformation programs. The transformation programs are not specifically associated with R&D and investment in those key growth drivers for us. They're more focused on finding efficiencies that do not impact our ability to spend in those growth areas. So they really actually bring more confidence that we'll be able to spend on the things that are actually going to drive growth in the future. But outside of that, I'm going to push it over to you for the other questions.\nSukyUpadhyay: Yes. So Josh, thanks for the question. Regarding revenue guidance, so we talked some of the overarching assumptions in that guide on negative 2 to 2 on an ex-FX basis for the full year revenue is really around the concept of we expect COVID to continue for the full year and the impact of COVID on elective procedures and staffing shortages, again, to really be with us for the entirety of 2022. Now what we're saying is, broadly, we would expect to see procedural volumes consistent with 2021. And that's in the backdrop of COVID actually accelerating in the first quarter, right, where we expect the first quarter on an underlying basis to be down. So, we do expect to see some recovery in the later quarters within the year. Specifically, inside of that, the your question to VBP, we don't see VBP as a material headwind or tailwind at this time relative to large joints or trauma, given the charges that we've taken in the fourth quarter of 2021. Now, I would say that the cadence of that by quarter is going to be definitely different, even though it's not a full year headwind or tailwind. It will definitely be more pressured in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. So that's how we think about VBP. Now I think your other question was regarding how do we see regional performance in that flattish growth. We're not going to comment on regional color at this time. There's a lot more that's got to play out relative to COVID and the recovery by region before we're going to talk about that. So, we'll give you more color as we get into the -- further into the first quarter on our first quarter call. But right now, consolidated level, we expect it at our midpoint to be about flat.\nJoshJennings: Great, Thanks for the detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijayKumar: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. My first one, Suky, is on the EPS guidance here. The base of Zimmer, right, ex the spin, I just want to make sure I have the right numbers. I'm getting to maybe something [indiscernible] $0.13 of earnings in 2019, 665 (ph) earnings on a comparable basis for the last year, fiscal '21. One, can you just walk us through the bridge [Technical difficulty] fiscal '22 guidance of 650 at the midpoint? What is the cause of line from '19 perhaps volumes maybe [Technical difficulty]\nBryanHanson: Vijay, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you're a little staccato. You're not coming in really well so we can't capture your question. I don't know if -- maybe if you can go on, if you're on a speaker, something, maybe you can change it. We can't hear you really well.\nKeriMattox: Yes, Vijay, it sounds like your line is just not a good connection. Maybe you can get back in the queue. Sorry about that.\nBryanHanson: Are you still there?\nVijayKumar: Yes. Sorry, guys. Can you hear me now?\nKeriMattox: Much better. Go ahead.\nVijayKumar: Yes. Apologies for the bad connection. But Suky, maybe on just EPS guidance, what is the comparable earnings in fiscal '19 and '21? I'm getting to 714 of earnings or 715 [indiscernible] 660 in '21. Maybe walk us through the bridge from '19 what caused the declines? And year-on-year versus '21, the guide implies flattish earnings, that bridge would be helpful.\nSukyUpadhyay: Yes, sure. So, thanks for the question, Vijay. So first of all, I'm not really going to bridge back to 2019. By the time we get through 2022, we'll effectively be in 3 years removed from that in an COVID environment. So, it's really difficult to draw a lot of comparisons. But here's how I would think about how we arrived at our operating margin and our guide ultimately for EPS. And so, if you use 2021 as a starting point, we ended the year at 26% on adjusted operating margins. From there, we've got some tailwinds and some headwinds. Starting with the headwinds. We have been talking about incremental pressure coming in to 2022 really from 2 dynamics. One was the China VBP, and while the overall revenue impact will be roughly the same as what we saw in 2021, there is a greater margin impact in 2022 because the composition of that revenue downside between the years is a little bit different. The second headwind that we're seeing is really around inflationary input costs. Things like energy costs, metals, labor, freight, these are definitely being impacted and felt within our company. So if you put those 2 things together, that's roughly about 100 basis points, maybe slightly more. So using our '21 exit of 26% and those headwinds, you would normally arrive at about a 25% adjusted operating margin for 2022. However, we do have some tailwinds. We have the spin. And as we've talked about, prior to the spin, we said that, that would be about 125 basis points accretive to operating margins. It's actually a little bit higher, more like 150 basis points even after netting out stranded costs. And then we have another element. We've been deploying some additional restructuring activities within the company because of the continued pressure of COVID. That's going to be a tailwind of about 50 basis points. So when you add that spin accretion plus the other efficiency programs of 50 basis points, that's what gets you from an underlying 25% operating margin in 2022 up to a 27% at our midpoint. So hopefully, that gives you the big building blocks. Again, headwinds being VBP and input costs, tailwinds being spin and other efficiency.\nVijayKumar: That's helpful, Suky. Just one last one. What are you assuming for TSA revenues? I understand the stranded cost, I think, $70 million, $75 million-ish. Are there any offset from TSA that's being assumed in the guide?\nSukyUpadhyay: Yes. We will get some TSA income. We're structuring those pretty much on a cost -- with a slight cost plus. But because we do not see them as core to our business or recurring, we're actually going to be non-GAAP-ing that benefit. So we do not have any benefit in our earnings per share related to TSA income.\nVijayKumar: So just -- I mean, TSA should be equal to the stranded cost rate, 75-ish, Suky?\nSukyUpadhyay: I wouldn't say it's a complete 1 for 1 there, Vijay. It will be substantially lower than those stranded costs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbieMarcus: Great. Two for me. Maybe I'll just ask them both upfront. One, as it relates to the guide, you sort of touched on this, it's flat at the midpoint in a COVID environment. Bryan, should we be thinking that closer to that mid-single-digit growth is off the table as long as a COVID environment still exists? And then second question, as I think about RemainCo, how do we think about it if there's any way to give us before the full pro formas are out. Gross margin was a bit disappointing in the quarter. How do we think about the components of operating margin in 2022? Is it much more SG&A-driven? Or are there gross margin improvements as well?\nBryanHanson: Great. Okay. So I'll start with the question around COVID and our growth rate. And I think it would probably be pretty obvious to most. If we continue to see COVID pressure and staffing pressure kind of at the rate that we're seeing today, yes, it would be very challenging, obviously, for the company to get to mid-single digits. That wouldn't be something that we think is possible in an intense COVID environment. What we do believe is when COVID gets behind us that we absolutely have the building blocks to get there. But in a COVID environment, just given the pressure on elective procedures and given the fact that we have 80% of our revenue built into those elective procedures, it's just not a pathway to get there.\nSukyUpadhyay: And Robbie, on your question related to the composition of the 27% adjusted operating margin or midpoint, it's going to be primarily driven by SG&A. The way we see overall gross margin is, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we ended 2021 at or about our guide, which was roughly in line with the back half of 2020, so just below 71%. From there into 2022 on adjusted gross margins, you've got, of course, some headwinds, tailwinds. The headwinds being the VBP margin pressure I just spoke about with Vijay as well as the input cost inflation that we're seeing, again, that I just talked about. In addition, lower volumes will also be a slight headwind. Those will be partially offset by some accretion that we see related to the spin. But net-net, I would expect gross margins year-over-year from '21 to '22 to be down. So the bulk of our improvement in adjusted operating margins from '21 into '22, again, will be primarily driven through SG&A.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Company. .\nStevenLichtman: Bryan, on ROSA, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pipeline you see ahead. How are you seeing '22 placement opportunities versus '21? And where are we in terms of the build out of the opportunity to pull through of knee implants following those ROSA placements?\nBryanHanson: Yes. So the -- I would say that the pipeline is really strong. I mean that's one of the things that has been a positive surprise during this COVID pressure. There has not been a reduction in demand on robotics, which is, to be honest, when we first started, I thought it would be the case, but we just haven't seen it. We've seen continued pipeline gets stronger. And what we're finding is that, that pull-through is already happening. We always talk about are we placing robotic systems in a competitive account or a friendly account. What I always go back to is every account for the most part has some competitive flavor to it. It's not always homogeneous. So even in those accounts that we would consider our platinum accounts, when we place a capital system there, a ROSA system there, we absolutely have an opportunity to convert a competitive surgeon because there will be a competitive surgeon that exists in that platinum account. So that's what's exciting about it is the demand is strong. We continue to see it move in the right direction, and that pull-through is already happening. A big proof point to that is just the fact that in the U.S., we reached that 10% of total knees being done robotically. It doesn't sound like much because I know one of our competitors is much further along than that. But that feels like a pretty good start. And the fact is it's just the beginning of the journey. So yes, so the demand is strong, and I would tell you that the pull-through is real, and it's continuing.\nStevenLichtman: Great. And then just a follow-up on cash. You're clear on the debt pay down expectations near term. Will M&A be muted as a result? Do you still see opportunities for tuck-in deals?\nBryanHanson: Yes. Unfortunately, as we get into the Phase III of our transformation, a big part of Phase III, as we've always talked about, is active portfolio management. And COVID has definitely put a dent in our ability to leverage as much cash as we were hoping to leverage to move that forward. At the same time, even in a pretty cash-constrained environment, we've done a good job of continuing our strategy there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a number of deals, either M&A or partnerships, to ensure that we're building scale in those important faster-growth areas. But we just have not had the amount of firepower we would like, and certainly that pressure is going to continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarryBiegelsen: Bryan, just 2 for me, one on Persona iQ, one on the ASC strategy. Can you talk about what impact you expect Persona iQ to have to revenue in 2022? And the pricing strategy, just remind us again of kind of if you -- well, if you're planning to resubmit for the new tech add-on payment. And if not, why? And then just second on the ASC strategy. Just talk -- you've talked about being under-indexed there. What's the plan to change that? And can you grow at or above market in recon before you address this? Or will it be a headwind to growth in the near term?\nBryanHanson: Sure. So maybe I'll start with the ASC. And believe me, we are already shifting our focus here. We had planned to do it anyway. But obviously, with the results of COVID and pushing more patients to the ASC, we put that plan on steroids. We built a, I guess, first and foremost, a direct selling organization to ensure that we're contracting effectively in that setting. That was almost 0 to 100 people in a relatively short period of time fully dedicated to contracting in the ASC setting. That was probably the first big step. Also driving compensation, right? So operating mechanisms to drive focus there and also compensation to drive focus there. The other thing that we're doing is to make sure that we're filling our product gaps that will give us more presence inside the ASC. That would be like the Relign acquisition in sports, where we had that gap in capital, would be like Incisive where we got booms and lights to be able to give more infrastructure to the ASC. So those are the things that we're doing right now to be able to get further traction in the ASC, and we're making progress. Do we have more work to do? There's no question. But when I look at our growth in the ASC and I look at our expanding size of our business in ASC, I know that what we're doing today is actually working. So that's ASC. On the iQ side, I'll hit maybe the reimbursement question first. We're going to pursue everything we possibly can to try to get incremental reimbursement, but we're not counting on any of it. So our plan today assumes no incremental reimbursement that this would be captured under the DRG that exists today. And that even in that, we've built a plan that we think is very favorable to the company. And from a revenue standpoint, maybe you can take a step back, iQ really helps us in what I'm going to define as 3 different ways. One is the obvious revenue contribution that we can get. And that can come through a mix benefit because it's going to be a higher-priced item versus a standard implant. But it can also come from competitive conversions. Now that's going to be biased to the back half, that revenue impact because we're not going to move to full launch until the back half, but revenue is clearly one of the variables that are going to help us with iQ. Second one is brand reputation, and this matters. This is going to be able to solidify the fact that we are an innovator in our space. And this matters even if a surgeon is not ready for iQ yet. They want to be married, if you will, to a company that's going to be a leader from an innovation standpoint in their space. So it does matter when people are making decisions on who they're going to be linked to whether you're innovative or not. So that brand reputation is important to us. And the third one is differentiation. This is going to help us differentiate our ZBEdge ecosystem, that robotics and data ecosystem. I truly do believe that robotics decisions from our customers will be influenced by the ecosystem around robotics, not just robotics by itself. Remember, robotics just does what you tell it. The data collection will eventually tell you what you should do. And then the robotic system could do it for you. We would just make sure that you deliver on it. So that's the way I think about the impact of iQ, not just revenue, but brand reputation and differentiation as well.\nOperator: Next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.\nMattTaylor: So I wanted to ask one about operating margins longer term. Obviously, you changed the timing of the '23 goal. Could you just talk about the trajectory of margins that you foresee occurring with your forward outlook? And Suky, I know you've talked about margins as being largely revenue dependent. Maybe talk about the importance of revenue growth for driving margins higher and then also some of the things that you're doing with regards to regional profitability and ERP and how those can play into margin growth going forward as well?\nSukyUpadhyay: Yes, sure. So thanks, Matt, for the question. You're right. We did remove our 30% target by the end of '23 because of the ongoing challenges of COVID and the lack of revenue growth. And if you recall, that margin was largely predicated on 3 building blocks. One of the main one was revenue growth, which obviously we're just not seeing come through as we've been talking about. I think longer term, we still do have the opportunity in the near term to expand margins. We're not going to size that at this time because we do still think it's largely going to be revenue dependent because we have to balance in the mix of efficiency that we're seeing across the company and that we're driving forward with the right level of investment against the business for long-term growth because we do see COVID eventually it's temporal. And we want to make sure that we can continue to invest against the very strong pipeline we have in commercial execution to make sure that we can grow value over time not only in a pandemic world, but most importantly, in the post-pandemic world. Some of the key drivers that I would say beyond revenue growth that can help drive margin expansion in the near term is our establishment of global business services or large shared service regional centers, which we planned for in 2020 and actually implemented in '21. That's going to be a key component of that incremental margin expansion I talked about in '22. But then beyond that, the ability to leverage those beachheads are going to be important. You're right, we're making investments into ERP. Those are generally longer term in nature to actually play through and to get those benefits. So I would see that those benefits coming in post 2023. In addition, we continue to look at and our supply chain is always looking at opportunities to optimize and rationalize our overall manufacturing footprint, but also to continue to combat input cost rises through very aggressive procurement. So those are some of the levers I would think of as in the near term in the absence of revenue growth, but no doubt revenue growth is going to be the key driver to meaningful margin expansion over the mid and long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nRickWise: Maybe going back to COVID. Again, it's hard to ask this question because I know there's a million moving pieces. But as you're reflecting on the sort of early headlines of COVID headwinds clearly easing in the Northeast, I mean, new cases are down dramatically. How are you thinking about how the recovery, the post-COVID recovery unfolds relative to backlog and sort of delayed procedure volumes? Just how are you thinking about it now as you see the reality start to unfold?\nBryanHanson: Yes. So I'll give you a sense of how we built it into our forecast and the guidance that Suky just referenced. We actually try not to get too caught up into this whole concept of the cases are dropping from a COVID standpoint because we're still seeing cancellations that are as high as we've seen in a long time. And so there seems to be other reasons, as I referenced in the prepared remarks, on why we're seeing cancellations versus just ICU beds being taken up by COVID patients. So we really, at this point, are assuming that the 2022 impact from COVID will look a lot like the '21. Maybe different timing of peaks and valleys, but we expect at this point until we see something that tells us that it's going to be different that you're going to continue to see a peak come down like we're seeing now, and then it's going to go right back up given the new variant. That's the assumption that we have throughout 2022. Now if we set that assumption aside, and we say that we see a peak come down into a valley, if you will, and it never comes back, then that -- completely different game. That gives us an opportunity then to get back to those growth rates that we're seeing back in Q4 2019. Remember, those growth rates we saw back in Q4 2019 about 3.2% or so, that was really before Vitality index was picking up for us. That was just on the beginning of that Vitality index moving north. So that would be an exciting environment for us. There's no question about it. But just know that what we built into our guidance is that '22 from an overall impact standpoint is going to look a lot like '21 when it comes to COVID and staffing pressures.\nRickWise: Got you. And on ROSA, again, I mean, clearly, you had a terrific year despite some of the challenges. Where are we with the partial knee rollout? Where are we with the hip rollout both launched last year? And maybe as part of your comment, Bryan, about the new product pipeline being stronger than ever, I don't know whether there's a ROSA component there. What's next? What's coming? What are your priorities now to keep this momentum going?\nBryanHanson: Yes. So ROSA overall, as I've said before, our primary knee is going really well. The pipeline is as strong as it's been. The pull-through is there. The penetration in our overall procedures is coming up, moving in the direction that we had hoped. I think it will leave and unlock more value when COVID subsides because that is obviously impacting our ability to get procedures even in those accounts where we have ROSA, but it's definitely moving in the right direction. Partial is the same thing. I'll just step back there, too. The partial knee application was important one for us because I think as most people know, we have a very high market share position in partial knee. So to be able to bring a robotic platform with that application is really important for us, and we have a lot of opportunity then to go to those accounts that are using our partial knee and try to move them to robotics. And the hip is going well, too. It's really kind of a combination of ROSA Hip and Avenir Complete. One of the fastest growth subcategories of hip, I think everybody knows now, is direct anterior approach. And both of those, the Avenir Complete as well as the ROSA application that we launched first goes directly at that fast-growth submarket. Now later this year, we also have another application that we're going to launch in hip that will go after the posterior approach. So we'll have everything locked up from a hip standpoint. But those are the things that we're pretty excited about. Stepping back from that, just ROSA, I feel really good. I'm not going to get into a lot of the things we're launching that we haven't talked about already, but just some of the things we talked about a lot. Persona Revision, I mean, this is one that has been driving really strong growth for us for 2 years, and we expect that to continue. It's not just the Revision conversion. It's the universe of primary needs that are still competitive where they're using us for revision. We're going after that business, and there's a real opportunity, again, in the hundreds of millions of dollars for us. And then when you look at outside of ROSA, iQ. We're just getting started up Persona iQ, and I talked about the 3 different ways that can bring value. I absolutely expect that to be a true provider of revenue for us. And the ZBEdge just in total. ZBEdge is getting a lot of traction. It's creating brand awareness for this company to be a leading-edge organization, and that does drive revenue growth for us. So those are just a few of the things that we have that we're excited about. And we talked about it, so I'll talk about it again. We have a cementless Persona coming that has a different form factor. They should remove all stops for us to be able to move cementless forward. That has been nascent for us. It's a real opportunity. We're below 10% penetration in cementless, but we have all kinds of headroom associated with that. And that new form factor coming later this year will open that door as well. So a lot to be excited about for sure. As I referenced before, the pipeline is strong, and we expect our Vitality index to continue to move in the right direction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.\nChrisPasquale: Suky, I want to start just following up on the VBP impact to make sure we're thinking about this right. Are you saying that the dollar impact is going to be the same in '22 versus '21 across hips and knees, and now trauma is included in that as well. But it's just going to be spread out differently throughout the year. And maybe just help us with how the impact was recognized in '21. Did you have anything in the third quarter? Is it really all packed into the fourth quarter?\nSukyUpadhyay: Yes. Good question. So we do see, to your first point, overall, the revenue impact, top line impact against recon or large joints and trauma being roughly about the same year-over-year. So again, no material headwind, tailwind based on where we stand today. The impact, I said, will be different by quarter. So you really didn't have any impact in Q1 to Q2 of 2021. And so therefore, you've got pricing impact in the first half of this year, '22, which is being compared to a non-VBP first half of '21. So the pressure is going to be more acute on that year-over-year comparison. As you move to the second half, you had a modest level of impact in the third quarter around some inventory contraction, but not material. The really big impact was mostly in Q4. If you think about all the numbers that we provided to you today in some of our earlier commentary, it was worth roughly about 400 basis points of growth in the fourth quarter. So that's where you're going to feel the biggest impact in 2022. This year, it will be more of a tailwind for us because we won't have to cross over that one time that we took in '21. So again, sorry, Chris, a lot of numbers there, if there's that in any way, it's confusing. I can help clarify.\nBryanHanson: The one thing I will say from a dollar standpoint relative to revenue, there's that consistency and differences in quarterization of it, but that's consistent. But in margin, it will be more of a negative impact in 2022. And as Suky referenced before, about 50 bps of headwind for us and margin profile due to VBP in 2022.\nChrisPasquale: That is helpful. And then, Bryan, I just wanted to follow up on the cementless opportunity. This was really alongside robotics. One of the things you guys were highlighting a few years ago is a significant potential mix driver for you across the hip and knee businesses. And it seems like it's gotten off to a much slower start here than we would have thought at that time. What was it about the prior Persona cementless that really didn't allow you to gain as much traction there as you were hoping? And how does this next version fix that?\nBryanHanson: Yes, it is that, actually. We -- again, we have a form factor that we felt confident with that was already kind of in the mix. But when we get it out there in the -- and surgeons look at it, they don't feel as comfortable with the design that we want on a go-forward basis. And remember, when you're talking cementless, you want to make sure that you really get good contact between the implant and the bone. And as a result of that, we've changed the design of that connection, if you will. And that talking to surgeons already about the design that's going to be coming, they have a lot more confidence in the safety of that connection. That's the reason why we changed the form factor. So it's not so much our inability to sell cementless in concert in particular with robotics, it's more around that form factor and the confidence people have in that form factor to get the feel that they're looking for. And we feel very confident about what we're going to be launching later this year. And again, I look at it to say as much as I'm frustrated by the fact that we have not had the right design, I know one is coming. And I'd probably rather be at the 10% now, and I think of future growth opportunities and be able to increase that penetration over time when we do launch that product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shagun Singh with RBC.\nShagunSingh: I was just wondering if you can talk about trends exiting January and into early February, especially since the U.S. it appears to have occurred around January 13, even though there were regional variations and they continue to be. You did call out seeing more cancellations and also that COVID pressures will continue throughout the year. So I'm just trying to figure out if you can provide more color and if your guidance is realistic or conservative.\nSukyUpadhyay: Yes, Shagun. Thanks for the question. This is Suky. So as we said, we provided, I think, pretty good color on Q1, where we expect it to be about flattish, but that includes a 130 basis point tailwind from selling days. So on an underlying basis, it's really down year-over-year. January was definitely more pressure than what we saw in December exiting 2021. And we continue to see very high cancellation rates coming into the beginning part of February. So we think what we've seen so far continues to support that first quarter color that I talked about. And I think it's important to note that while Omicron cases maybe in some markets starting to -- people are characterizing that as plateauing, there is still a residual effect on staffing shortages, which, in some part, are linked to Omicron. But there are other factors that are driving staffing shortages. So just because we see a decrease in overall Omicron cases does not mean you're going to see a one-for-one reduction in staffing shortages, which continues to be a headwind for us. So short story, everything that we're seeing so far in January and the very beginning of February continues to support that first quarter call we provided.\nSukyUpadhyay: I got it. And then just one other question on operating margins. Maybe you can help us with the cadence if you haven't touched on it. And I'm especially curious with respect to the 150 basis points benefit from the spin. How should we think about the time line there for you to achieve that, especially given the context that you do have higher corporate cost allocations in the near term?\nSukyUpadhyay: Sure. So on the margin case, it's really -- our margin is very correlated and linked to revenue. And so as we said, revenue will be more pressured in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, especially because of the pressure we're seeing in the first quarter. And so we would expect margins to follow that same cadence. It will be more pressured in the first half, most acutely in the first quarter not atypical from what we saw in 2021 regarding seasonality and the impact of COVID. So that's how we see the cadence of that operating margin, again, most acute down in Q1 and then recovery as we move through the rest of the year with revenue recovery as we talked about. Relative to the spin, I think you're going to see that 150 basis points start to manifest relatively quickly here in 2022. We have already started to attack some of those corporate stranded costs and are going to continue to fight our way through that. But that's how we see operating margins so far.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.\nMattMiksic: Just one question if I could on the strength in EMEA knees was one question that I thought would be worth flushing out if you have just a minute, and I'll just leave it at that.\nBryanHanson: Yes. I would just say that we see almost right now that EMEA seems to be ahead of schedule relative to what we're seeing in the U.S. and other parts of the world. I'm not sure why that is. But you did see some relief that we saw in EMEA because you did see a kind of that downward trend in Omicron. And also, you're seeing some policy shifts, which I think is going to be really important on a go-forward basis where you've got countries like the U.K. and Spain and others that are looking at this to say, \"Listen, Omicron is acting more like an endemic phase now, and we're going to change some of our restrictions associated with COVID.\" And I think that those policy changes are going to be an important factor in COVID eventually getting behind us. It's not just COVID itself, but it's going to have to be these policy shifts that we're seeing kind of led right now by Europe. That would be something we'd like to see across the world actually. But that's the only thing I could probably point out is that just a little bit ahead of the curve in COVID impact than the rest of the world.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session.\nEnd ofQ&A:\nKeri Mattox: Yes. No, thank you. I think it was the last question. I can jump in here and just close out. So thank you, everybody, for joining.

            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. For this morning's call, I'm going to focus on 3 topics: first, our Q4 results, including commentary on the impact of COVID; second, how that translates into full year '22 financial guidance that we provided this morning; and third, I'll provide a brief update on our longer-term outlook. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter 2021 and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. We've also provided changes versus the fourth quarter of 2019 or prepandemic results as we feel it is an important comparison. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $2.04 billion, a reported decline of 2.3% and a constant currency decline of 0.8% or down 4.4% versus '19. On a consolidated basis, we were about flat through November versus 2019 and declined in December due to the Omicron variant surge. Expectations for the fourth quarter had contemplated the impact of China VBP in hip and knee, and that was largely in line with expectations. Separately, we booked the sales adjustment related to channel inventory for China VBP in trauma of approximately $30 million, triggered in part by the Chinese government's announcement relating to a national trauma VBP, which was made on January 24. This adjustment was about a 650 basis point headwind to S.E.T. category growth and about a 150 basis point drag on consolidated Q4 growth. In short, excluding the impact of the China VBP on our S.E.T. results, the quarter was generally in line with the assumptions that we provided on our third quarter call and broadly consistent with the midpoint of our implied fourth quarter guidance range. The Americas declined 1.5% in the fourth quarter, down 1.9% versus 2019, with the U.S. declining 2.3% or down 2.4 versus 2019. The impact of Omicron late in the quarter, in tandem with lingering hospital staffing challenges, drove lower regional results. EMEA grew 17.3% or down 3% versus '19. The region experienced positive growth versus '19 earlier in the quarter, but quickly decelerated with the emergence of Omicron. Lastly, Asia Pacific declined 17.5% or down 15.1% versus '19 driven primarily by price adjustments on channel inventory ahead of hip, knee and trauma VBP as well as some negative impact from a spike in COVID cases starting in December in markets like Japan and Australia. Now turning to our business category performance in the fourth quarter. The global knee business increased 0.4% or down 3.9% versus 2019 with U.S. knees declining 5.2% or 3.9% versus '19. In the quarter, China VBP had a negative impact on knee growth of about 250 basis points. Our global hip business declined 2.8% or down 6% versus '19, with U.S. hips declining 4.4% or 3% versus '19. VBP impact on hip was about 700 basis points in the quarter. Our sports, extremity and trauma category decreased 4.3% or down 6.2 versus '19. The sequential deceleration was due to a softer market due to COVID and the impact of China National VBP in trauma, as discussed earlier. Excluding the impact of trauma VBP in the quarter, S.E.T. was growing low single digits versus 2020 and about flat versus '19 on an underlying basis. The dental and spine category declined 3% or down 3.8% versus '19, with dental posting growth and spine declining primarily due to continued pressure from COVID. Finally, our other category grew 14.1% or up 1.9% versus '19. Inside this category, we saw ongoing demand for ROSA Knee as well as increased revenues from the launch of our ROSA Partial Knee and hip applications. Moving on to our P&L. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.40 compared to our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.59 in the fourth quarter of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by lower revenue, a debt extinguishment loss recognized on our bond tender offer, litigation-related charges and restructuring charges that we incurred in Q4 to continue to address pressures on revenue from COVID and the stranded costs associated with the spin. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.95 represented a decline from $2.11 in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease was primarily from lower revenues in tandem with lower gross margins due to COVID-19 and the impact of China VBP in both recon and trauma, which were partially offset by targeted reductions in SG&A and a slightly lower tax rate. In addition, FX was a modest headwind to earnings per share in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 69.1%. Fourth quarter gross margin was pressured due to lower manufacturing volumes and the impact of China VBP. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 70.7% and in line with prior commentary. Our adjusted operating expenses of $882 million declined year-over-year. Inside of that, we continue to invest in R&D and commercial infrastructure across priority areas like S.E.T., robotics and data and informatics, which are being funded by accelerated improvements in efficiency across other areas of SG&A. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 25.9%, down versus the prior year, but in line with the prior quarter. The adjusted tax rate was 14.4% in the quarter. Q4 and full year tax rates were favorable to our expectations due to some discrete onetime items in the quarter. Turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $366 million, and free cash flows totaled $224 million with an ending cash and cash equivalents balance of just $480 million. We continue to make good progress on delevering the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $400 million, bringing the total debt reduction in '21 to approximately $900 million, excluding the effects of foreign currency on non-U.S. denominated debt. Moving to our financial outlook for 2022. We are issuing '22 financial guidance based on the following key assumptions. COVID and customer staffing pressures are expected to continue throughout 2022. We expect the COVID and staffing pressures that we saw in December to accelerate into the first quarter of this year with the first half of 2022 being more pressured than the second half. We do not see China VBP as a material impact to growth in '22 versus '21, but we expect variability by quarter with more pressure in the first half. Furthermore, we anticipate completing the spin of our dental and spine businesses in the near term. And as such, the guidance we are providing is only for RemainCo Zimmer Biomet. For the first quarter, ZimVie will be reported as discontinued operations, and we expect to provide pro forma 2021 information for RemainCo on or around our first quarter earnings call. While we do not have full P&L restatements available at this time, for comparison, we have provided our unaudited net sales estimate of $6.827 billion for RemainCo Zimmer Biomet. Against this backdrop, our current expectations for the full year 2022 financial outlook are reported revenue growth in the range of negative 4% to 0 versus 2021 with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 200 basis points. This translates to negative 2% to positive 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating profit margin of 26.5% to 27.5%, adjusted tax rate of 16% to 16.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.40 to $6.80 and free cash flow of $700 million to $800 million. Inside of that guidance, we expect Q1 revenue to be flat to up slightly versus the first quarter 2021 due to headwinds from COVID and the impact of VBP being somewhat offset by the easier comp relative to the first quarter of last year and a roughly 130 basis point selling day tailwind that will largely be reversed in the fourth quarter. We expect approximately $160 million of net interest expense and approximately 212 million average shares outstanding for the year. We remain committed to our investment grade rating and expect to pay down $750 million of debt maturing in the second quarter of this year. Now turning to our longer-term outlook. With the ZimVie spin transaction nearing completion, we are also taking this opportunity to update our long-term margin expectations. Given the prolonged impact COVID-19 is having on our business, we are removing our target of at least 30% adjusted operating profit margin exiting 2023. However, we do expect to improve margins over the long term as we will continue to make targeted investments in our business to enhance top line growth while also accelerating cost savings to fund those investments. In summary, the macro environment presents challenges, but our underlying business fundamentals remain strong as we continue to execute successfully against what we can control. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan. Yes. So Josh, thanks for the question. Regarding revenue guidance, so we talked some of the overarching assumptions in that guide on negative 2 to 2 on an ex-FX basis for the full year revenue is really around the concept of we expect COVID to continue for the full year and the impact of COVID on elective procedures and staffing shortages, again, to really be with us for the entirety of 2022. Now what we're saying is, broadly, we would expect to see procedural volumes consistent with 2021. And that's in the backdrop of COVID actually accelerating in the first quarter, right, where we expect the first quarter on an underlying basis to be down. So, we do expect to see some recovery in the later quarters within the year. Specifically, inside of that, the your question to VBP, we don't see VBP as a material headwind or tailwind at this time relative to large joints or trauma, given the charges that we've taken in the fourth quarter of 2021. Now, I would say that the cadence of that by quarter is going to be definitely different, even though it's not a full year headwind or tailwind. It will definitely be more pressured in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. So that's how we think about VBP. Now I think your other question was regarding how do we see regional performance in that flattish growth. We're not going to comment on regional color at this time. There's a lot more that's got to play out relative to COVID and the recovery by region before we're going to talk about that. So, we'll give you more color as we get into the -- further into the first quarter on our first quarter call. But right now, consolidated level, we expect it at our midpoint to be about flat. Yes, sure. So, thanks for the question, Vijay. So first of all, I'm not really going to bridge back to 2019. By the time we get through 2022, we'll effectively be in 3 years removed from that in an COVID environment. So, it's really difficult to draw a lot of comparisons. But here's how I would think about how we arrived at our operating margin and our guide ultimately for EPS. And so, if you use 2021 as a starting point, we ended the year at 26% on adjusted operating margins. From there, we've got some tailwinds and some headwinds. Starting with the headwinds. We have been talking about incremental pressure coming in to 2022 really from 2 dynamics. One was the China VBP, and while the overall revenue impact will be roughly the same as what we saw in 2021, there is a greater margin impact in 2022 because the composition of that revenue downside between the years is a little bit different. The second headwind that we're seeing is really around inflationary input costs. Things like energy costs, metals, labor, freight, these are definitely being impacted and felt within our company. So if you put those 2 things together, that's roughly about 100 basis points, maybe slightly more. So using our '21 exit of 26% and those headwinds, you would normally arrive at about a 25% adjusted operating margin for 2022. However, we do have some tailwinds. We have the spin. And as we've talked about, prior to the spin, we said that, that would be about 125 basis points accretive to operating margins. It's actually a little bit higher, more like 150 basis points even after netting out stranded costs. And then we have another element. We've been deploying some additional restructuring activities within the company because of the continued pressure of COVID. That's going to be a tailwind of about 50 basis points. So when you add that spin accretion plus the other efficiency programs of 50 basis points, that's what gets you from an underlying 25% operating margin in 2022 up to a 27% at our midpoint. So hopefully, that gives you the big building blocks. Again, headwinds being VBP and input costs, tailwinds being spin and other efficiency. Yes. We will get some TSA income. We're structuring those pretty much on a cost -- with a slight cost plus. But because we do not see them as core to our business or recurring, we're actually going to be non-GAAP-ing that benefit. So we do not have any benefit in our earnings per share related to TSA income. I wouldn't say it's a complete 1 for 1 there, Vijay. It will be substantially lower than those stranded costs. And Robbie, on your question related to the composition of the 27% adjusted operating margin or midpoint, it's going to be primarily driven by SG&A. The way we see overall gross margin is, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we ended 2021 at or about our guide, which was roughly in line with the back half of 2020, so just below 71%. From there into 2022 on adjusted gross margins, you've got, of course, some headwinds, tailwinds. The headwinds being the VBP margin pressure I just spoke about with Vijay as well as the input cost inflation that we're seeing, again, that I just talked about. In addition, lower volumes will also be a slight headwind. Those will be partially offset by some accretion that we see related to the spin. But net-net, I would expect gross margins year-over-year from '21 to '22 to be down. So the bulk of our improvement in adjusted operating margins from '21 into '22, again, will be primarily driven through SG&A. Yes, sure. So thanks, Matt, for the question. You're right. We did remove our 30% target by the end of '23 because of the ongoing challenges of COVID and the lack of revenue growth. And if you recall, that margin was largely predicated on 3 building blocks. One of the main one was revenue growth, which obviously we're just not seeing come through as we've been talking about. I think longer term, we still do have the opportunity in the near term to expand margins. We're not going to size that at this time because we do still think it's largely going to be revenue dependent because we have to balance in the mix of efficiency that we're seeing across the company and that we're driving forward with the right level of investment against the business for long-term growth because we do see COVID eventually it's temporal. And we want to make sure that we can continue to invest against the very strong pipeline we have in commercial execution to make sure that we can grow value over time not only in a pandemic world, but most importantly, in the post-pandemic world. Some of the key drivers that I would say beyond revenue growth that can help drive margin expansion in the near term is our establishment of global business services or large shared service regional centers, which we planned for in 2020 and actually implemented in '21. That's going to be a key component of that incremental margin expansion I talked about in '22. But then beyond that, the ability to leverage those beachheads are going to be important. You're right, we're making investments into ERP. Those are generally longer term in nature to actually play through and to get those benefits. So I would see that those benefits coming in post 2023. In addition, we continue to look at and our supply chain is always looking at opportunities to optimize and rationalize our overall manufacturing footprint, but also to continue to combat input cost rises through very aggressive procurement. So those are some of the levers I would think of as in the near term in the absence of revenue growth, but no doubt revenue growth is going to be the key driver to meaningful margin expansion over the mid and long term. Yes. Good question. So we do see, to your first point, overall, the revenue impact, top line impact against recon or large joints and trauma being roughly about the same year-over-year. So again, no material headwind, tailwind based on where we stand today. The impact, I said, will be different by quarter. So you really didn't have any impact in Q1 to Q2 of 2021. And so therefore, you've got pricing impact in the first half of this year, '22, which is being compared to a non-VBP first half of '21. So the pressure is going to be more acute on that year-over-year comparison. As you move to the second half, you had a modest level of impact in the third quarter around some inventory contraction, but not material. The really big impact was mostly in Q4. If you think about all the numbers that we provided to you today in some of our earlier commentary, it was worth roughly about 400 basis points of growth in the fourth quarter. So that's where you're going to feel the biggest impact in 2022. This year, it will be more of a tailwind for us because we won't have to cross over that one time that we took in '21. So again, sorry, Chris, a lot of numbers there, if there's that in any way, it's confusing. I can help clarify. Yes, Shagun. Thanks for the question. This is Suky. So as we said, we provided, I think, pretty good color on Q1, where we expect it to be about flattish, but that includes a 130 basis point tailwind from selling days. So on an underlying basis, it's really down year-over-year. January was definitely more pressure than what we saw in December exiting 2021. And we continue to see very high cancellation rates coming into the beginning part of February. So we think what we've seen so far continues to support that first quarter color that I talked about. And I think it's important to note that while Omicron cases maybe in some markets starting to -- people are characterizing that as plateauing, there is still a residual effect on staffing shortages, which, in some part, are linked to Omicron. But there are other factors that are driving staffing shortages. So just because we see a decrease in overall Omicron cases does not mean you're going to see a one-for-one reduction in staffing shortages, which continues to be a headwind for us. So short story, everything that we're seeing so far in January and the very beginning of February continues to support that first quarter call we provided. I got it. And then just one other question on operating margins. Maybe you can help us with the cadence if you haven't touched on it. And I'm especially curious with respect to the 150 basis points benefit from the spin. How should we think about the time line there for you to achieve that, especially given the context that you do have higher corporate cost allocations in the near term? Sure. So on the margin case, it's really -- our margin is very correlated and linked to revenue. And so as we said, revenue will be more pressured in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, especially because of the pressure we're seeing in the first quarter. And so we would expect margins to follow that same cadence. It will be more pressured in the first half, most acutely in the first quarter not atypical from what we saw in 2021 regarding seasonality and the impact of COVID. So that's how we see the cadence of that operating margin, again, most acute down in Q1 and then recovery as we move through the rest of the year with revenue recovery as we talked about. Relative to the spin, I think you're going to see that 150 basis points start to manifest relatively quickly here in 2022. We have already started to attack some of those corporate stranded costs and are going to continue to fight our way through that. But that's how we see operating margins so far."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "All right. Great. Thanks, Keri, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I'm going to just give you an outline of how we want the call to proceed this morning. I'm going to spend the first part of the discussion briefly talking about our fourth quarter results, and I'm also going to spend a little bit of time talking about what we're seeing so far in 2022. I know it's early, but I want to give you a sense of what we're seeing already and then just speak more broadly about our views of 2022 as a whole. And then I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who's going to provide more detail on fourth quarter; and obviously, more detail on our guidance going forward. And then finally, it will come back to me before we move to Q&A. I just got a few things I want to close out the prepared remarks with, and then we'll again jump into Q&A. Okay. So first, let's start with Q4, and I'm going to break this into really three categories. The first will be around COVID impact in Q4 and how it compared to our expectations. The second will be around VBP impact and again, how that compared to our expectations. And then finally, just performance outside of those environmental impacts and how we performed there. Okay. So let's take a step back first. I think that will help. Just when we gave our updated Q4 guidance on our Q3 earnings call back in November, we actually outlined our expectations around how COVID and staffing pressure would likely impact our fourth quarter results, and unfortunately our assumptions largely played out in the quarter. As you probably remember, we felt that the pressure from the end of Q3 would continue into Q4. And thus, the overall pressure from COVID and staffing would actually accelerate from Q3 to Q4. And really, the big reason this played out, of course, we know now is because of the Omicron surge that occurred towards the end of the fourth quarter. And as many have already stated, a lot of that impact truly came in December itself. So, what's interesting about this surge, though, is that even though the overall impact of COVID was about what we expected, the way it manifested was different, right? So, ICU capacity was definitely a factor, but we did not see it as the primary driver of cancellations of procedures during the quarter. And so, what we actually saw was more cancellations that occurred due to really either the patient or staffing member being diagnosed with COVID or actually having been around someone with COVID, and they were quarantining as a result and couldn't show up for the procedure. So that was really the shift that we saw in the quarter. So, the overall impact was about what we expected, but the way, again, it manifested in the numbers was slightly different. Okay, so transitioning from there to VBP. Remember again on our Q3 call, we discussed what we thought the impact of China hip and knee VBP would be in our fourth quarter results. And we actually - we were largely right on how that played out. And so, our expected headwind in large joints was in line with the expectations that we had and also what we communicated to you. So that was pretty much in check when we think about large joints. Now what changed during the quarter, actually even post the quarter was that on January 24, the Chinese government announced that it was formally nationalizing one of its provincial trauma VBP tenders, and that was kind of new to us. But based on that confirmation from the Chinese government and really just our knowledge of how the VBP process will work from here, we did take a sales reserve in the fourth quarter, which obviously results then in a negative Q4 impact to both our net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. And what I'd say is that even though this trauma VBP adjustment came earlier than we anticipated, it is pretty consistent with the overall scale of the impact and consistent with our expectations and what we've been talking about more recently. Now, I would say looking forward, the good news is we have a lot more visibility now. We're a lot smarter on the topic, and we understand what the impact of VBP will now be on our 2022 business. And that has been included in our guidance, which Suky's going to talk about in just a minute. Okay, so now looking past VBP and COVID in the fourth quarter, I'm very proud of the team when we focus on the things we can control. ZB's business execution against the challenging backdrop has been strong. Our strength of our team right now, that's kind of one ZB culture, is as evident as it's ever been, and I think more important than ever. And the team has really been able to move our strategy forward even in these challenging times. And a few proof points to be able to point at, the team was able to drive continued strong demand and momentum for ROSA, and that is globally, not just in the U.S. but globally. We actually more than doubled the number of installed ROSAs in 2021 versus our cumulative total at the end of 2020. That's a pretty significant jump up, and again, speaks to the momentum that we have in robotics and orthopedics. And those ROSAs are paying off. In the fourth quarter, those installed ROSAs allowed us to reach 10% in total knee procedure penetration in the U.S. for the first time as a company. That's a huge milestone for the organization, and it's just the beginning of this ROSA journey for us. The team also delivered a successful limited launch of the world's first and really only smart knee, the Persona iQ. Now it's early. Obviously, early days. We're in limited launch right now, as I said. But the launch trajectory feels great. The feedback is good, and we're looking forward to a full launch later this year. And then finally, and I think importantly, the team continues to execute in large joints across the board, driving again above-market performance in Q4 in the U.S. for both knees and hips versus 2019. Okay. So, let's transition from Q4 and talk about what we're seeing so far in early 2022. And I'm going to speak specifically about COVID and staffing challenges. What I would tell you is that the challenges that we saw in Q4, in particular in December, are unfortunately continuing into January. And as a practice, and I think prudently so, our team is continuing to build our financial models using what I'm going to call a recency bias in those models. And as a result of that, we're expecting that December and really now January pressure in COVID and staffing will continue through Q1. So, what we're basically saying is that overall, we anticipate that Q1 will likely be more pressured than Q4 was. And so what does that mean for our outlook for the full year? Again, we're going to follow that same approach. We're going to look at 2022 in a similar way, actually, in a very similar way in the way we gave guidance for Q4 of 2021. Until we see a fundamental shift in the current state and what's happening today in the environment, we are projecting that the COVID pressure will continue throughout the year and will be -- actually follow a similar peak and valley trend that we saw in 2021. As I'm sure you can appreciate, given that about 80% of our revenues come from elective procedures, ZB must be highly attuned to this topic. And trust me, we are. We're highly focused in this area, and that has been captured in our assumptions for guidance. And with that, I'm going to transition to Suky to give you again more detail on Q4 and also our 2022 guidance. Okay, Suky? Yes. Maybe, I'll just start real quick on that last portion of it, and then I'll pass it over to you, Suky. We actually feel more confident in our ability to invest for growth in the business because of the transformation programs. The transformation programs are not specifically associated with R&D and investment in those key growth drivers for us. They're more focused on finding efficiencies that do not impact our ability to spend in those growth areas. So they really actually bring more confidence that we'll be able to spend on the things that are actually going to drive growth in the future. But outside of that, I'm going to push it over to you for the other questions. Vijay, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you're a little staccato. You're not coming in really well so we can't capture your question. I don't know if -- maybe if you can go on, if you're on a speaker, something, maybe you can change it. We can't hear you really well. Are you still there? Great. Okay. So I'll start with the question around COVID and our growth rate. And I think it would probably be pretty obvious to most. If we continue to see COVID pressure and staffing pressure kind of at the rate that we're seeing today, yes, it would be very challenging, obviously, for the company to get to mid-single digits. That wouldn't be something that we think is possible in an intense COVID environment. What we do believe is when COVID gets behind us that we absolutely have the building blocks to get there. But in a COVID environment, just given the pressure on elective procedures and given the fact that we have 80% of our revenue built into those elective procedures, it's just not a pathway to get there. Yes. So the -- I would say that the pipeline is really strong. I mean that's one of the things that has been a positive surprise during this COVID pressure. There has not been a reduction in demand on robotics, which is, to be honest, when we first started, I thought it would be the case, but we just haven't seen it. We've seen continued pipeline gets stronger. And what we're finding is that, that pull-through is already happening. We always talk about are we placing robotic systems in a competitive account or a friendly account. What I always go back to is every account for the most part has some competitive flavor to it. It's not always homogeneous. So even in those accounts that we would consider our platinum accounts, when we place a capital system there, a ROSA system there, we absolutely have an opportunity to convert a competitive surgeon because there will be a competitive surgeon that exists in that platinum account. So that's what's exciting about it is the demand is strong. We continue to see it move in the right direction, and that pull-through is already happening. A big proof point to that is just the fact that in the U.S., we reached that 10% of total knees being done robotically. It doesn't sound like much because I know one of our competitors is much further along than that. But that feels like a pretty good start. And the fact is it's just the beginning of the journey. So yes, so the demand is strong, and I would tell you that the pull-through is real, and it's continuing. Yes. Unfortunately, as we get into the Phase III of our transformation, a big part of Phase III, as we've always talked about, is active portfolio management. And COVID has definitely put a dent in our ability to leverage as much cash as we were hoping to leverage to move that forward. At the same time, even in a pretty cash-constrained environment, we've done a good job of continuing our strategy there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've done a number of deals, either M&A or partnerships, to ensure that we're building scale in those important faster-growth areas. But we just have not had the amount of firepower we would like, and certainly that pressure is going to continue. Sure. So maybe I'll start with the ASC. And believe me, we are already shifting our focus here. We had planned to do it anyway. But obviously, with the results of COVID and pushing more patients to the ASC, we put that plan on steroids. We built a, I guess, first and foremost, a direct selling organization to ensure that we're contracting effectively in that setting. That was almost 0 to 100 people in a relatively short period of time fully dedicated to contracting in the ASC setting. That was probably the first big step. Also driving compensation, right? So operating mechanisms to drive focus there and also compensation to drive focus there. The other thing that we're doing is to make sure that we're filling our product gaps that will give us more presence inside the ASC. That would be like the Relign acquisition in sports, where we had that gap in capital, would be like Incisive where we got booms and lights to be able to give more infrastructure to the ASC. So those are the things that we're doing right now to be able to get further traction in the ASC, and we're making progress. Do we have more work to do? There's no question. But when I look at our growth in the ASC and I look at our expanding size of our business in ASC, I know that what we're doing today is actually working. So that's ASC. On the iQ side, I'll hit maybe the reimbursement question first. We're going to pursue everything we possibly can to try to get incremental reimbursement, but we're not counting on any of it. So our plan today assumes no incremental reimbursement that this would be captured under the DRG that exists today. And that even in that, we've built a plan that we think is very favorable to the company. And from a revenue standpoint, maybe you can take a step back, iQ really helps us in what I'm going to define as 3 different ways. One is the obvious revenue contribution that we can get. And that can come through a mix benefit because it's going to be a higher-priced item versus a standard implant. But it can also come from competitive conversions. Now that's going to be biased to the back half, that revenue impact because we're not going to move to full launch until the back half, but revenue is clearly one of the variables that are going to help us with iQ. Second one is brand reputation, and this matters. This is going to be able to solidify the fact that we are an innovator in our space. And this matters even if a surgeon is not ready for iQ yet. They want to be married, if you will, to a company that's going to be a leader from an innovation standpoint in their space. So it does matter when people are making decisions on who they're going to be linked to whether you're innovative or not. So that brand reputation is important to us. And the third one is differentiation. This is going to help us differentiate our ZBEdge ecosystem, that robotics and data ecosystem. I truly do believe that robotics decisions from our customers will be influenced by the ecosystem around robotics, not just robotics by itself. Remember, robotics just does what you tell it. The data collection will eventually tell you what you should do. And then the robotic system could do it for you. We would just make sure that you deliver on it. So that's the way I think about the impact of iQ, not just revenue, but brand reputation and differentiation as well. Yes. So I'll give you a sense of how we built it into our forecast and the guidance that Suky just referenced. We actually try not to get too caught up into this whole concept of the cases are dropping from a COVID standpoint because we're still seeing cancellations that are as high as we've seen in a long time. And so there seems to be other reasons, as I referenced in the prepared remarks, on why we're seeing cancellations versus just ICU beds being taken up by COVID patients. So we really, at this point, are assuming that the 2022 impact from COVID will look a lot like the '21. Maybe different timing of peaks and valleys, but we expect at this point until we see something that tells us that it's going to be different that you're going to continue to see a peak come down like we're seeing now, and then it's going to go right back up given the new variant. That's the assumption that we have throughout 2022. Now if we set that assumption aside, and we say that we see a peak come down into a valley, if you will, and it never comes back, then that -- completely different game. That gives us an opportunity then to get back to those growth rates that we're seeing back in Q4 2019. Remember, those growth rates we saw back in Q4 2019 about 3.2% or so, that was really before Vitality index was picking up for us. That was just on the beginning of that Vitality index moving north. So that would be an exciting environment for us. There's no question about it. But just know that what we built into our guidance is that '22 from an overall impact standpoint is going to look a lot like '21 when it comes to COVID and staffing pressures. Yes. So ROSA overall, as I've said before, our primary knee is going really well. The pipeline is as strong as it's been. The pull-through is there. The penetration in our overall procedures is coming up, moving in the direction that we had hoped. I think it will leave and unlock more value when COVID subsides because that is obviously impacting our ability to get procedures even in those accounts where we have ROSA, but it's definitely moving in the right direction. Partial is the same thing. I'll just step back there, too. The partial knee application was important one for us because I think as most people know, we have a very high market share position in partial knee. So to be able to bring a robotic platform with that application is really important for us, and we have a lot of opportunity then to go to those accounts that are using our partial knee and try to move them to robotics. And the hip is going well, too. It's really kind of a combination of ROSA Hip and Avenir Complete. One of the fastest growth subcategories of hip, I think everybody knows now, is direct anterior approach. And both of those, the Avenir Complete as well as the ROSA application that we launched first goes directly at that fast-growth submarket. Now later this year, we also have another application that we're going to launch in hip that will go after the posterior approach. So we'll have everything locked up from a hip standpoint. But those are the things that we're pretty excited about. Stepping back from that, just ROSA, I feel really good. I'm not going to get into a lot of the things we're launching that we haven't talked about already, but just some of the things we talked about a lot. Persona Revision, I mean, this is one that has been driving really strong growth for us for 2 years, and we expect that to continue. It's not just the Revision conversion. It's the universe of primary needs that are still competitive where they're using us for revision. We're going after that business, and there's a real opportunity, again, in the hundreds of millions of dollars for us. And then when you look at outside of ROSA, iQ. We're just getting started up Persona iQ, and I talked about the 3 different ways that can bring value. I absolutely expect that to be a true provider of revenue for us. And the ZBEdge just in total. ZBEdge is getting a lot of traction. It's creating brand awareness for this company to be a leading-edge organization, and that does drive revenue growth for us. So those are just a few of the things that we have that we're excited about. And we talked about it, so I'll talk about it again. We have a cementless Persona coming that has a different form factor. They should remove all stops for us to be able to move cementless forward. That has been nascent for us. It's a real opportunity. We're below 10% penetration in cementless, but we have all kinds of headroom associated with that. And that new form factor coming later this year will open that door as well. So a lot to be excited about for sure. As I referenced before, the pipeline is strong, and we expect our Vitality index to continue to move in the right direction. The one thing I will say from a dollar standpoint relative to revenue, there's that consistency and differences in quarterization of it, but that's consistent. But in margin, it will be more of a negative impact in 2022. And as Suky referenced before, about 50 bps of headwind for us and margin profile due to VBP in 2022. Yes, it is that, actually. We -- again, we have a form factor that we felt confident with that was already kind of in the mix. But when we get it out there in the -- and surgeons look at it, they don't feel as comfortable with the design that we want on a go-forward basis. And remember, when you're talking cementless, you want to make sure that you really get good contact between the implant and the bone. And as a result of that, we've changed the design of that connection, if you will. And that talking to surgeons already about the design that's going to be coming, they have a lot more confidence in the safety of that connection. That's the reason why we changed the form factor. So it's not so much our inability to sell cementless in concert in particular with robotics, it's more around that form factor and the confidence people have in that form factor to get the feel that they're looking for. And we feel very confident about what we're going to be launching later this year. And again, I look at it to say as much as I'm frustrated by the fact that we have not had the right design, I know one is coming. And I'd probably rather be at the 10% now, and I think of future growth opportunities and be able to increase that penetration over time when we do launch that product. Yes. I would just say that we see almost right now that EMEA seems to be ahead of schedule relative to what we're seeing in the U.S. and other parts of the world. I'm not sure why that is. But you did see some relief that we saw in EMEA because you did see a kind of that downward trend in Omicron. And also, you're seeing some policy shifts, which I think is going to be really important on a go-forward basis where you've got countries like the U.K. and Spain and others that are looking at this to say, \"Listen, Omicron is acting more like an endemic phase now, and we're going to change some of our restrictions associated with COVID.\" And I think that those policy changes are going to be an important factor in COVID eventually getting behind us. It's not just COVID itself, but it's going to have to be these policy shifts that we're seeing kind of led right now by Europe. That would be something we'd like to see across the world actually. But that's the only thing I could probably point out is that just a little bit ahead of the curve in COVID impact than the rest of the world."

Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. If you have a question, please press [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President. Didn't Investor Relations Chief Operating Officer, please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Brian Hanson, our Chairman, President, and CEO, and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please, refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q3 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan.\nBryan Hanson : All right. Great. Thanks, Keri, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Let me just start with the things that I'm happy about when it comes to Q3. First of all, I'm happy on our progress with our new product introductions, they're going quite well. Our execution on recent M&A is going as planned, if not better. Our commercial focus in our discipline is as good as I've seen it and I'm very happy with our growth versus our key competitors in both large joints and inset, particularly when it comes to the U.S. The team, in my view, continues to drive results in the areas under our control. And as a result, I continue to be proud of them for doing so. Alternatively, Q3 was also a quarter with unexpected negative environmental impacts, that are for the most part, out of our control.  Q3 brought greater COVID pressure than I think anybody expected: 1. more customer staffing shortages, certainly than we expected; and 2. an earlier China VBP impact than we anticipated. And this resulted in Q3 revenues that were lower than we had projected. And unfortunately, we expect these pressure points to continue into Q4. And as a result, we need to update our 2021 financial guidance. And really, the view we have with the fourth quarter. As we look forward, until we see a fundamental shift in these trends, we're just going to assume that these pressure points aren't going away; but will be with us into Q4 and possibly into early 2022. Let's just start by taking a look at COVID and staffing concerns kind of together because I believe they're somewhat related.  As I think most of us know by now, that there was a significant Delta variant surge in Q3 that drove more COVID pressure than, again, I think anybody expected. We previously thought COVID pressure would lessen through the back half of the year; but instead, while procedures did seasonally step-up in September, it wasn't by as much as we expected. Again, due to the enhanced COVID and staffing pressures. And as a result, September was our least attractive month relative to growth and until we see a real shift COVID and staffing related recovery, we're projecting that the pressure we saw in September will continue through the end of the year. That's a view of COVID. We think about China BPP, the process in China is moving forward. And although it's still fluid, we are getting more clarity on what it will mean this year and in 2022. And our assumption going into the process was that DBP would pose no more than a 1% risk in terms of impact, 2 ZBS, overall revenue.  And although for a number of reasons, the overall impact will likely be greater than what we originally anticipated. We do believe that sizing this at around 1% of revenue impact is still accurate. That is the right way to size it. That said, the timing of the revenue impact has definitely shifted forward. And we now expect that much of this impact will be felt in 2021. And there are a few factors that are driving the shift into 2021: 1. is around current year inventory reductions by distributors; and 2. is around just ongoing negotiations we have with our distributor partners that are beginning to include price concessions on existing inventory; and 3. unfortunately, what we're now seeing patients differ their surgeries until after the lower BVP pricing is in effect.  Apparently, even though China achieves near universal public medical coverage, there are out-of-pocket expenses that increase or decrease, based on implant pricing. And this is substantial enough for patients to defer their procedures. And so, clearly in summary, although we feel very good about our execution in the areas we can control these macro environmental issues continue to mute our overall performance. And these are fluid. These issues for sure they are fluid, but we've done our best to incorporate our current view of their impact in our revised guidance. And I think that's a pretty good segue to move to Suky section where he is going to focus on Q3 financial performance. And I think very importantly, our forward-looking guidance. Okay, Suky.\nSuky Upadhyay : Thanks, Bryan. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to briefly discuss our Q3 results and updates that we've made to our full-year 2021 financial guidance. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about Q3 '21 and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. We've also provided comparisons to the third quarter of 2019, as we feel that performance to pre -pandemic results as an important comparator. Net sales in the third quarter were $1.924 billion, a reported decrease of 0.3% and a decrease of 0.8% on a constant currency basis. When compared to 2019, net sales increased 0.4%. On a consolidated basis, as Bryan mentioned, we were growing through August, but then declined in September, as we saw Delta variant cases and staffing shortage increases. In short, there was a seasonal step-up in procedural volumes for the quarter, but the recovery has not taken hold as fast as we thought it would, especially in our hip and knee businesses.  The America's declined 3.2% or flat versus 2019. The U.S. declined 4.4% or up 0.1% versus 2019. Lower U.S. performance in September was the key driver to lower consolidated results. EMEA grew 5.9% or up 0.3% versus 2019. This is the first time the region posted positive growth since the start of the pandemic. In the quarter, we saw an improving trend across a number of markets -- however, the UK, France, Spain, and most emerging markets continue to be challenged, despite higher vaccination rates. Lastly, Asia-Pacific grew 0.5% or up 1.5% versus 2019. While we did see growth versus 2019, it decelerated versus what we observed in the first half of the year. This was driven in part by pricing adjustments [Indiscernible] channel inventory as we continue to negotiate with our distributor partners ahead of DBP implementation in tandem with continuing COVID pressure throughout the region, especially in Japan, and Australia, and New Zealand.  Turning to business performance in the third quarter, the Global Knee business declined 0.7% or down 1% versus 2019. In the U.S., Knee declined 5.3% or down 0.7% versus '19. Our global Hip business declined 6.6% or down 2.4% versus 2019. And the U.S. Hips declined 11.3% or down 2.4% versus '19. The sports extremity and trauma category increased 4.2% or 7.7% versus 19 driven by continuing commercial specialization, new product introductions, and the contribution from strategic acquisitions we added to this portfolio in 2020. Our dental and spine category declined 6.1% were down 2% versus 2019, The dental business posted good growth in the quarter and continued to benefit from strong execution and market recovery, while the spine business declined when compared to 2020 and 2019, due to increase in COVID pressure throughout the quarter.  Finally, our Other category grew 15.4% or down 1.1% versus 2019. Inside this category, we saw ongoing demand for ROSA Knee, as well as increased revenues from the launch of our ROSA Partial Knee and Hip applications. Moving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.69 lower than our GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.16 in the third quarter of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by cost of goods and higher spending related to litigation, our spin-off and R&D. In addition, our share count was up versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of a $1.81 was flat compared to the prior year, even though sales were down. We implemented targeted reductions in SG&A, which in tandem with a slightly lower tax rate helped offset higher investments in R&D and a higher share count.  Adjusted gross margin of 70.3 was just below the prior year and the results were slightly below our expectations due to lower volumes in tandem with less favorable product and geographic mix. Our adjusted operating expenses of $852 million were in line with the prior year and stepped down sequentially versus the second quarter. In spite of that, we continue to ramp up investment in R&D and commercial infrastructure across priority growth areas like [Indiscernible], Robotics, and Data and Informatics. And we are offsetting those increases with improvements in efficiency across other areas of SG&A. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.1%, largely in line with the prior year and prior quarter. The adjusted tax rate of 15.8% in the quarter was in line with our expectations.  Turning to cash and liquidity, we had operating cash flows of $433 million, and free cash flow totaled $307 million with an ending cash and cash equivalents balance of just over $900 million. We continue to make good progress on deleveraging the balance sheet and pay down another $300 million of debt totaling $500 million of debt paydown for 2021 to date. Moving to our financial guidance. We've updated our full-year 2021 outlook based on 2 factors: 1. COVID and customer staffing pressure is continuing at levels higher than previously expected. And while we expect procedure volumes to seasonally improve into the fourth quarter, we are taking a cautious approach and currently assuming that the more acute pressure we saw in September will continue through the fourth quarter; and 2. as Bryan mentioned, we now know more about the dynamics leading up to the implementation of the China BVP and project that it will have a bigger impact on the fourth quarter than originally assumed.  The impact across inventory reductions, price write-downs on existing inventory, and a new factor which is patients deferring their procedures have increased the impact of VBP and the timing of that impact. As a result, our current projections for Q4 VBP impact is about 300 basis points of headwind to our consolidated results. But the situation remains fluid and we will continue to update you as the implementation of VBP unfolds. For the full year, we now expect reported revenue growth to be 11.3% to 12.5% versus 2020 with an FX impact of about a 140 basis points of tailwind for the year. While we are taking steps to further reduce spending in the fourth quarter as a response to our lower revenue outlook, we're reducing our adjusted operating margin projections to be 26% to 26.5% for the full-year. Our updated full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance is now in the range of $7.32 to $7.47. Our adjusted tax rate projection is unchanged at 16% to 16.5%. And finally, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion.  This updated full-year 2021 guidance range implies that Q4 constant currency revenue growth will be between -2.3% and +1.8% versus Q4 2020. And we project Q4 adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.90 to $2.05. We kept a wider range of potential Q4 outcomes in our guidance to account for the uncertainty around COVID surges, customer [Indiscernible] pressure, and VBP implementation. As a note, we do believe that COVID pressure, including the related staffing shortages will continue to mute pandemic recovery as we move into 2022. Additionally, as we mentioned earlier, VBP is expected to reduce 2022 consolidated revenues by about 100 basis points. That impact will be felt in our large joint segments and will [Indiscernible] impact gross margins as we move forward. To respond to this, we are accelerating transformation and efficiency efforts to help offset these headwinds. In summary, the macro environment presents challenges, but our underlying business fundamentals remain strong as we continue to execute successfully against what we can control. With that, I will turn the call back over to Bryan.\nBryan Hanson: All right. Great. Thanks Suky. And to close out our prepared remarks, I'm going to talk about what ZB can control -- our strategy and our execution -- and that's why I have such confidence in our long-term growth projections. The ZB team remains intensely focused on creating value and, most Importantly, delivering on our mission. Our underlying business is strong and overall, we're pleased with our performance in Large Joints and S.E.T. versus market. This is a significant shift for ZB versus where we were just a few years ago and an important driver of our ongoing growth. Our innovation is in full stride, and that's a big part of this. We're going to enter 2022 with a new product pipeline of more than 20 anticipated product launches across the next two years. And of course, this is incremental to a number of new products we recently launched, including, but certainly not limited to ROSA Partial Knee, ROSA Hip, and Persona IQ, which is the first smart knee implant in the world. We're very excited about this launch.  And we continue to see strong ROSA placements, increased robotic penetration into our accounts. I think most importantly, just more robotic procedures as a percentage of our overall procedure base. And ROSA is even more attractive because it's a key component of our ZBEdge suite of truly integrated solutions. And that -- it really does help to tie pre, intra, and post-op data together with the goal of changing patient care. And finally, we are accelerating our corporate transformation. We're making great progress on the planned spin-off of our spine and dental business. We just recently appointed a new CFO and other key leadership team members for [Indiscernible]. And we continue to be strategic and selective in our active portfolio management process, and [Indiscernible] key assets over the past year that have helped us to better compete, and more importantly to win across robotics and data, dental, S.E.T., [Indiscernible], and the broader ASC market. We're reinvesting in our business for sure, but we're also advancing efficiency programs designed to streamline and improve how we operate, and very importantly, drive savings.  All of this forward momentum plus ZB 's differentiated portfolio, the expected value creation of our plans [Indiscernible] transaction, and our ability to execute really does give us continued confidence in our path to grow revenue in the mid-single digits and to deliver a 30% operating margin by the end of 2023. And I can tell you, this is clearly a time of significant challenge in market pressures. Particularly given the fact that we have such a dependence on elective procedures; there's no doubt about that, but this is also a time of significant opportunity for Zimmer Biomet. And we look forward to delivering for our team members, delivering for our shareholders and most importantly, the customers and patients that we serve. And with that I'm going to turn it back over to Keri to begin the Q&A session. Keri.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Bryan. Before we start the Q&A session, just a reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will now begin the question and answer session. One moment please for the first question. Our first question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Suky, I really appreciate the guidance for the fourth quarter. [Indiscernible] maybe $200 million or so ahead of where you're landing for the fourth quarter and the top-line $0.40 or so below consensus in terms of EPS line. And so, just I'd love to understand specifically where you see the greatest Delta, between your previous expectations from a product segment and recovery standpoint. It sounds like VBP is maybe 3/4 of that $200 million. But outside of that, where you see an impact that we should be thinking about from a guidance perspective.\nSuky Upadhyay : Yeah, so thanks for the question, Ryan. Absolutely, our Q4 implied is lower than where we were when we last provided guidance in August and updated in September. And if you remember that guidance is predicated on COVID not worsening and actually starting to see things recover and improve. And as we came into the third quarter, the early part of third quarter, we actually saw some positive momentum with some modest growth in the first two months. But then as we came into September, we saw -- while we saw elective procedures increase in September, as they generally do seasonally, that pressure from COVID and from staffing shortages was greater than expected, such that the growth wasn't there; and we just didn't get to 2019 levels. So you really have to think about recalibrating the third quarter as then you move into the rest of the year because those much lower than we thought.  And then our original guidance suggested that Q4 would be at about market growth or slightly better. That clearly is not what we saw in September and so what we're doing is we're taking that September trend, which was down, and we're carrying that forward into the fourth quarter. So that, I would say, is the largest component of our takedown for our rest of year guidance and for Q4 specifically. In addition to that, there's been some incremental additional pressure due to VBP -- we had always assumed that there would be some inventory dynamics that we accounted for within our forward-looking guidance range.  But what we're seeing now is slightly bigger impact primarily driven by this notion of we're seeing in-market, and from our local teams are telling us that patients are beginning to defer their procedures until the implementation so they can secure a lower out-of-pocket. So I would really pull back and say that the biggest component is due to that headwind due to COVID. And instead of the fourth quarter growing, as we originally thought, that pressure that we're seeing in September we're assuming that continues for the rest of the year and that really is your biggest deviation.\nRyan Zimmerman: Okay. I appreciate that color and then just from a margin perspective, stick with you Suky. Longer-term margins -- you obviously talked about 30% adjusted operating margins. The street's assuming about 26.7% in '22, just given the dynamics today and the expectations, how does that sit with you today from that perspective, where consensus is at right now. What is your view of a normalized operating margin and call it a steady-state, normalized operating environment, because you do have some operating expenses and fluctuation as a result of some of these dynamics.\nSuky Upadhyay : Yes. Great, great question. So I'll try and unpack that. First of all, we see next year as a bridge year to that 30% operating margin. But I -- you really have to step back and there are a lot of moving parts into 2022. And I'll just try and break that down one-by-one and help give you some additional color. First of all, like I said about 3Q going into 4Q, as you think about '21 on to '22 you got to recalibrate the starting point, right? We're going to be on a lower revenue base because the pressure that we're projecting to see in the fourth quarter. And then from that, we would expect this COVID pressure to continue at least until the early part of '22, right? So revenue will be pressured. We believe in at least the early part of '22; that's one overarching assumption. And then margin largely follows revenue, especially for our Company from a leverage standpoint and the ability to get profit off of our fixed cost base.  But from there, as we move into operating margin, there's a number of moving parts. I would say first inside of operating margin, you have gross margin. The way I've always talked about gross margin sort of in the mid-term is the take the second half of 2020 and kind of think about gross margins being stable from there. It could be slightly up or down in any given quarter, but largely stable to the back half of 20. We still think that that's the right starting point, but what we have to watch out for now is the impact of BVP, and what that does as a headwind. And also, what we're seeing like many of our peers in our sector is some inflationary pressure on cost of goods and input, costs and labor costs. So we're just got to watch those headwinds. Look, our teams are working really hard to help offset those.  But that's still a moving target for us and something that we got to continue to put a little bit more rigor on, and obviously we will give more detail when we give guidance at the end of the 4th quarter. Then within operating margin as well, the 2nd key component is SG&A. I'm really proud of what the team has done already this year to respond to lower revenues and lower margins, because all the factors I talked about. And quite frankly, we're accelerating our transformation journey and we're doing that in a number of ways. 1. We're looking at regional profitability and we're looking at restructuring a number of markets that are just below where our expectations would be. We're looking at other areas of our cost base and accelerating our Global Business Services strategy.  And there are other structural type initiatives that we're taking inside of SG&A to help some of those revenue and gross margin headwinds that I talked about. So those are some of the moving parts. I'm not going to get into exactly what '22 looks like yet. I think we got to let a lot more play out in the rest of this year, especially around COVID before we can give you a more detailed view of '22. But hopefully, you've gotten some good color there to help you start on '22.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks, Ryan. Our next question comes from Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley.\nDrew Ranieri: Hi, Bryan and Suky. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just to go off of the previous question, but more so on your long-range plan. Suky, you're mentioning that you're pulling forward some initiatives, but just how are you thinking about your long-range growth right now at margin targets. Maybe help us better understand if any of the composition has really changed in reaching that 30% operating margin. It's about a 400 basis points of expansion, it looks like. But any more that you can provide there?\nSuky Upadhyay : So maybe what I'll do is I'll start off with the components that we've defined as what we need to see for growth rates. And then you can take it from there on the up margin piece. First of all, when we think about this 4% to 5% growth that we're trying to accomplish, we've been pretty clear on what we need to see to make that happen. First and foremost, we need to see above-market growth in our biggest franchise, which is Knee. And we've been able to prove that over the past six quarters or so that we were able to get a trend in that direction.\nBryan Hanson : Second, is we need to be at market growth in Hip trending to above-market growth as we get ROSA traction, which is now in the market. New to the market, but now in the market. And then we needed to be in that mid-single digit growth rate for [Indiscernible], if not to the upper end of that. And so, those are the areas that we're really focusing on we believe are the building blocks as we get into 2023 to get that 4% to 5% revenue growth. We still believe that that is absolutely possible for this organization since that's kind of the topline view, which should be a big component obviously, of driving that operating margin that we're projecting in 2023 as well. So Suky, I'll pass it to you for that.\nSuky Upadhyay : Yeah, I think that's one of the key components, and we're consistent on how we think about that operating margin expansion. That's largely leverage-driven, right? We talked about gross margins being stable. I've talked about some headwinds are we're going to look to offset over time and then SG&A becoming a lot more efficient, and the ability to reinvest that back against that higher growth, which gives us that leverage to 30% operating margin. In addition, through active portfolio management, we now also have the spin, which is going to create a tailwind for us from an operating margin standpoint as well, so feel good about that. We still think we have all the right building blocks in place to get to that 30% operating margin run rate as we exit 2023.\nBryan Hanson : All of this obviously assumes that when we're in 2023, that COVID is in the rearview mirror and no longer a headwind, obviously.\nDrew Ranieri: Great. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, just on Persona IQ. Bryan, you just launched the product, but would love to get your initial feedback on what you're hearing in the field and maybe if you could set expectations of how a launch should progress over the next 12 months. I mean, would you be disappointed if it wasn't like 5% of your total Knee implants, but just any flavor would be helpful. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson : So I'm kind of -- I'm looking at my COO right now across the table and I just gave him a new target of 5% to get IQ and [Indiscernible] implants. He is a little worried about that. But what I would tell you though, all tongue and cheek aside, we're very excited about IQ; this is the first of its kind. It's good to bring technology to the market that literally is new-to-market. And that's exactly what we have. And although we're excited about IQ by itself, it's a really important variable in a much broader equation which we call ZBEdge. Because now what we're focused on in ZBEdge is to be able to collect data before, during and after the procedure and is a really important reason for that, because as that data lake increases, what we're going to be able to do is to predict what kind of care we should provide for the patient.  Here's what I know, every time I'm out talking to a surgeon, I don't care how good they are, or what their capability is. They always have a patient, patients that look perfect. They did all the right cuts. They have -- the image looks fantastic. The tissue balancing was perfect, but that patient is not happy. And they don't know why. I don't know why. But as we collect this data and again, the data later gets larger, we're going to be able to predict why and be able to change that outcome. That's the intent here. And why that's really important -- is because when we can do that, you got patients sitting on the sideline right now that would enter the funnel, but are afraid to because they don't believe they're going to get the satisfaction they're looking for. If we can change that paradigm, we can get more patients into the funnel. That's good for everybody in this base. So IQ is very attractive to us, but it's a part of a bigger equation. And I could tell you from IQ perspective, we're in a very limited launch. We want to learn as much as we can as fast as we can. We do have some supply constraints here.  And that will put a little bit of a damper on how we're going to roll this out. Microchips are tough to come by. It's not impacting us in ROSA because you're talking in hundreds. When you move to IQ, you're talking thousands. And so it is going to get in the way, in the short-term that we're again -- we're trying to work through it, but that is going to put a damper on our launch. The demand is great, there's a lot of noise around this and people are very interested, so that's a good sign. We've got to work through the supply constraints and move this forward, but overall, we're very happy.\nDrew Ranieri: Thanks for taking the questions..\nKeri Mattox: Thanks and Loren, can we move to the next question in queue, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs.\nAmit Hazan: Thanks and good morning. I just want to maybe first to get a clarification on the China situation. I'd love a little bit more color on what you're thinking now in terms of your share within the China market going forward, but also whether you're contemplating spine and trauma in the new impact. And then perhaps most importantly, why would next year be a 100-basis-point impact given that you're already seeing pretty significant impact this year.\nBryan Hanson : I'll start with the impact. No matter what happens in this base year, we're still predicting a 1% shift to whatever revenue assumptions you've had in 2022. So if you look at growth rate from '21 to '22, that's going to change because you can have more in your base. But the actual impact to consolidate revenues is still 1% in '22. So that's why we're looking at it. And let's say 1% sounds like I know exactly, Just know there's still some variability here. Could be a little more, could be a little less, but I think the right way to model it is 1%. Remembering again that even though it's 1% of consolidated revenue, it's all in large joints. Okay. If I think about our share position in China, we look great -- I just give you a factoid. Just as an example, if you look at our Asia-Pacific 's, not specifically China, but gives you some context here. If you look at our Asia-Pacific Knee business -- the revenue that we do on an annual basis, i's bigger than all 3 of our major competitors' OUS Knee business.  That gives you some sense for our market share inside of Asia-Pacific and inside of China. So this is a pretty important market for us. Here's what's great though when we think about share position going forward; even though it's not as an attractive market now because of the margin profile of the business in large joints, we won every one of the categories. There are eight categories. Number 1, it may be an unattractive space but you still got to win. And the first step in winning is you got to be in play. And we're in play in every one of the categories. We're the only multinational Company to do that. Number 2 now is going to be negotiating with distributors. So we get the best distributors to be able to get the most share at the best margin. And that's exactly what we're focused on right now.  So that gives you a sense for how we're feeling about it. And when I think about trauma spine, it's too early. What I'd say on trauma, there's a provincial tender that just went through; its 12 provinces tender that we think [Indiscernible] at least hearing rumors could end up being a national tender, kind of transition to a national tender, but we don't have any sense for when that would occur. But anyway, that's our sense for China, our share position and [Indiscernible].\nAmit Hazan: And then I want to focus on [Indiscernible] share with my second question. Just [Indiscernible] -- obviously important for investors. And I think that one of the things that investors have a harder time understanding now is just the fluctuations in share quarter-to-quarter, especially in the U.S. market. And so the question is really whether anything is changing in the way you sell the product. Is there more end-of-quarter selling? What is it that you're seeing or doing differently now that makes it more difficult for all of us to assess whether you're gaining share on a -- kind of consistent basis? I know, like you said, there's been more quarters of share gains than not in the last 6. But still investors are, I think, uncertain as to where that's going because of some of that fluctuations. So what can you do to help us understand what's happening on a quarterly basis that's changed in this COVID era?\nBryan Hanson : Well, what I would say is there's nothing that I would point out for us. I mean, we're conducting business the way we always have. My sense is probably everybody else's too. I think what's happening is just there's a lot of variability in the market because of COVID. You think about it, I mean, COVID is surging at different times in different states in the U.S. different cities in the U.S.. It all kind of depends on your mix in those states. And that's just looking at the U.S. is even broader than that and more volatile outside the U.S. So I think the challenge in seeing these individual quarters have these odd deltas between competitors is not necessarily because competitors are doing anything different. It's because the market dynamics are very different. That's why I continuously look at trends even in these turbulent times, the trend typically tell us a story because it neutralizing some of that variation. But I don't think it's anything that anybody is doing differently. I just think that the market is creating a much more challenging environment to look at consistency from Company to Company.\nAmit Hazan: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Amit. Lauren, (ph) can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Just 2 in particular. The first one has to do with the month of October -- it sounds like you're taking September and applying that, but we have a whole other month of data in between -- is there anything you can share with us on how that is looking or how it looked?\nBryan Hanson : So what I'm -- without giving specifics, we haven't seen anything in October that we'd indicate that this logic that we're using is incorrect.\nJoanne Wuensch: Okay. And then the other category which [Indiscernible] ROSA, could you share a little bit of color on how that launch is going in terms of utilization, halo effect to other products, competitive accounts, anything that flushes that out a bit would be appreciated. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson : Yeah. You know, essentially because in these turbulent and challenging times, you always look for things that you're excited about. And our innovation pipeline is one that I'm very excited about, and at the center of that is ROSA. There's no question that we continue to deliver on our expectations there, if not above. And I will just go back to the design characteristics that we put into place. We've really took our time to make sure that we learned from who went first and we designed a robotic system that surgeons really wanted and that's translating into demand and that continues. The fact is, surgeons don't want to change the flow of their procedure. And we have created a robotic system that keeps it as close as possible to non-robotic procedure.  We make [Indiscernible] time neutral to be able to use robotics at the same amount of time it would take to do a non-robotic procedure, including all the accuracy though involved in it. And we made sure that we didn't change the standard of care relative imaging. We don't have to CT scan, people don't use it otherwise and they can use the typical imaging that they would use for a procedure. All those things combined with the best implant that we have in Persona is what's driving traction right now. And we are absolutely seeing strong demand, which is continuing for us. We're seeing deeper penetration as a result of that into our accounts; in competitive accounts as well.  And what's really important about that is with all these placements now in place, remember that pull-through that you're asking about the commitment of volume is being muted by COVID. So in the COVID, the [Indiscernible] has gone, those units that we have in place will actually increase their overall input and not just in the disposable price point that you have with robotic procedures, but also the pull-through of competitive business. So we're very excited about where we are with ROSA. We know that we've got the right design in place, and we're seeing great traction.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you.\nBryan Hanson : Sure.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Joanne.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Two for me as well. First on -- you talked a little bit about accelerating some of the transformation programs. Just wondering if you can maybe break that down a little bit more granularly. What specifically have you accelerated, and then maybe what costs do you expect to unlock over the course of the next 15 or 12-15 months?\nBryan Hanson : So thanks for the question. We're still in the planning phase of that and we'll have a lot more detail around that on our fourth quarter call as we come into 2022. But the key areas for us are really around, as I talked about earlier, accelerating our view of market profitability and regional profitability -- how we ultimately go to market, what's our infrastructure in a lot of our smaller markets and just making sure that investments are in fact aligned to growth and opportunity. So I would say that's one. The second area is we looked across our organization. We looked at how we're structured relative to benchmark and where we had outliers, where we had higher costs; we're looking to take actions to make ourselves more efficient, either through just restructuring and de -layering and/or accelerating moving resources to our highly capable Global Business Services that we have in lower-cost countries. So, those are probably the 2 key areas.  I think the 3rd structural area we're looking at is continued consolidation of our ERP systems, which is going to give us a better global process orientation, which could yield savings over time. And then of course we're always actively looking at site rationalization to help with gross margin. And I'm really excited about where the team is moving with pricing improvements going forward. Again, we're going to provide more detail as those become more refined, both on the contribution but also the relative cost to those when we give our fourth quarter earnings.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you and then maybe Bryan on maybe some of the bigger picture longer-term initiatives you talked about. I mean, you talked a lot of ZBEdge in my mobility and we've got Persona IQ and I understand that IQ is going to be a slower roll out, but maybe just help us understand where you are as far as commercialized in some of these initiatives that you talked about the long-term perspective. I'm just trying to really put some goalposts around expectations for investors as far as, when we'll actually start to see the materially impact your business and be a driver or a competitive differentiator.\nBryan Hanson : Yeah. I think you're already seeing some of this and the nice thing is we're just in the forefront of that innovation pipeline. Here's what's interesting. I think one of the most important things about that 5 quarters out of the last 6 where we've been above market in Knee, isn't necessarily the amount that we've been above-market or just even those 6 quarters. It's looking at the trend break that you're seeing from ZB -- and what do I mean by that -- if you go beyond those 6 quarters and you look at the 20+ quarters that ZB has been a Company, we did not have one quarter as a Company above-market in Knees -- not 1 quarter in more than 20 quarters. So that as a significant reflection of the transformation taking hold. And it's a reflection of the transformation taking hold when we're at the -- just the beginning of the innovation cycle. We're only about a mid-single-digit vitality index right now.  Our strap plan would indicate that's going to triple over the strap plan period. That's a dramatic tailwind that we expect to see in our innovation pipeline which is a big part of why we believe this is sustainable. If you look at specifically in Knees and the execution is definitely better than we've seen before. Our compensation structure is now focused on growth rather than just maintaining business and our operating mechanisms are as good as I've ever seen. There's clearly no more supply issues anymore. It's all around innovation now. And innovation still drives from Persona Revision that is still getting conversions on the revision side. But most importantly now, it gives you a beachhead with customers that are using our Revision System in somebody else's total Knee -- guaranteed we're going to be pursuing that total Knee business, and that's bigger than the revision business.  You still have ROSA Knee that's just getting started. We've got a lot of headroom in ROSA Knee and that continues to pace very well. ROSA Partial just launched. Remember, at Partial, we have a very large share position. So even if we didn't get competitive business which we certainly are going to try, we have a mixed benefit associated with that in those partial procedures. Persona IQ just starting as we talked about before, and ZBEdge is exciting and then in 2022, we've got a new form factor for our Persona Cementless, which is going to remove all stops for us to be able to pursue a conversion to Cementless Knee. So all those things just give you a lot of shots on goal to continue to drive strong performance in Knee.\nKyle Rose: Great. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson : Sure.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Kyle. Loren can we go to the next question in queue, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam Broido Kodatsky with Truist.\nSam Broido Kodatsky: Hi, thanks for taking the questions and I'll just ask both of mine. So when we think about that September pressure continuing into the fourth quarter with the two components being COVID staff shortages. I think the general thinking is that COVID is getting a bit better here. So should we take that to mean staff shortages are becoming a bigger portion of the problem into the fourth quarter. And then as a follow-up to that, a little bit harder to predict when those staff pressures ease up. So how long do you think about those impacting volumes and what are you looking forward to indicate that the pressure from staff shortages is easy. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson : So I guess either one of you and I can answer this. But what I will tell you is that it's probably a bit of a conservative approach to look at September and then assume that that's going to continue through. A lot of indicators would say it's going to get better. The combination of COVID pressure and staffing. But, here's what we've learned. Every time I try to use an external view of when COVID is going to get better, we seem to be wrong. And so I'm not going to go with that. I'm going to go with what we're actually seeing in the marketplace and what we're seeing in the marketplace is consistency. Not always the same mix of pressures between COVID and staffing, but consistency in the overall pressure in October that we saw in September. And so I've learned my lesson. I'm not going to try to predict this anymore until I actually see proof in the marketplace that we're seeing firsthand that we're bending that curve. We would expect this to continue into 2020. Your guess is as good as -- others have tried to predict when this is going to stop; your guess is as good as ours. We truly do believe this will float into 2020. We don't know how far but we do believe it's going to float into 2022.\nSuky Upadhyay : And Sam, this is Suky. Just to build on what Bryan said, I think the labor shortage is the toughest component to really try and read because it's unprecedented. And it's not just at the nurse level. It's really throughout the hospital setting. What we do know through survey data -- this is not sophistically relevant, so please don't run too far with it but over half of the physicians that have reported in the third quarter have stated that they've suffered from staff shortages. And when those particular physicians have that challenge, they're doing about 10% fewer procedures than they normally would do. So that's very real. And we're also seeing that that impact is greater in the hospital setting than it is in the ASC setting. And as you know, we've got a more prominent share in the hospital setting, so I think it more disproportionately impacts us. Because of those, we're taking the approach until we see substantial, durable improvement, we're going to continue to take a view that this is lingering with us. But again, hopefully it's a conservative view, as Bryan said. Hopefully it lifts sooner than we all expect and we're better off, but that's how we're thinking about it.\nKeri Mattox: And Sam, did you have another follow-up? I think that was 2 questions in 1, but anything that close out there?\nSam Broido Kodatsky: Yeah. Sorry. That wasn't my tail. Thank you\nKeri Mattox: Great Lauren, can we have the next question on queue then?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.\nMike Matson: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to start with the M&A. I thought you would have done more by now. Are multiples too high, are you waiting to get through all this COVID uncertainty? Do you need to de -lever the Balance Sheet more? Or is there some other reason that you haven't gotten more active in terms of acquisition?\nBryan Hanson : Yes. So clearly, we would like to do more too, but I got to be honest with you if you think about the COVID pressure from an EBITDA standpoint. And you look at the debt leverage ratio that's created for us, the fact that we've done as much as we have with the limited firepower we do have, is pretty impressive. I'd actually give the team high complements to be able to select targets, get creative in the way that we pay for those targets, even in an environment with high multiples and bringing technologies that are absolutely fundamental to success inside of S.E.T for instance. Our A&E acquisition helps us in our Thoracic space, which is a big growth area for us that we're focused on. The relying technology that we brought in, filled that significant gaps we had in sports and that gives you the ability then to leverage that full portfolio.  And even Omni Suite, which is not overly exciting when you talk about blooms and lights, but it gives us bigger presence in the ASC market. All those things happened in concert with a relationship with Canary for its smart implants -- long-term smart implants beyond just Knee during the time that we just didn't have a lot of firepower. We absolutely expect over the next 5 years to increase that firepower, particularly as COVID gets behind us, and we will then flex more muscle in this area. But, I would say the opposite -- I would say that we did more than I think would have been expected, given the firepower we had.\nMike Matson: Okay, that's helpful, and then just looking at -- in the recon category, it looks like your Hips were down substantially more than your Knees in the quarter and I thought that Hips were somewhat less elective and maybe would have been less affected by the COVID wave than Knee is. Is that really just a reflection of the new products and ROSA Knee side or is there something else going on there?\nBryan Hanson : Yes. So that is a switch because what we have seen in the past and I think everybody has seen that the Knee procedures were lagging behind Hip mainly because you've got 2 factors. Number 1, it really hurts when you got a hip procedure issue. And there is some trauma related to it as well. But I think what you're finding is that that initial wave was where backlog was being consumed at a faster pace with Hip. And some of that has caught up is my view on it. And then the Knee procedures now are -- patients have really been waiting. You got patients that have been out there for a year that are finally coming in to get a procedure. And so I truly do believe these patients have waited as long as they could from a pain threshold standpoint. But now we're entering the market where a lot of those that had significant pain with Hip or trauma were already in the funnel. That's the only thing I can predict, it's the only thing I can see why it's happening. We'll see what happens next quarter, but that's what I think is happening right now.\nMike Matson: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Sure.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Mike. Lauren can we go to the next question in queue, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Suky, on the 100 basis points impact from China next year, is it fair to assume that since its price pretty much just dropped through the bottom line as well?\nBryan Hanson : That's the right way to think about it, Robbie.\nRobbie Marcus: Got it. So second question, does that hinder your ability to get to your operating margin target at all in 2023? Since I imagine that probably wasn't included. And then just two quick clarifications. If you could let us know what the M&A and selling day benefit was in the quarter. Appreciate it. Thanks.\nBryan Hanson : Sure. So on the operating margin point, it certainly does add another headwind to get to that 30%. But when we put that 30% aspiration out, there were two big components that we had not contemplated. One was the BPS you just mentioned, but the other was the active portfolio management and the spin of the spine and dental business, which will be margin accretive. We think that those two largely offset one another. So again, that's another reason why we're even in the backdrop of this headwind still confident in our ability to deliver that exit run rate at the end of 2023. Relative to day rate, there is no meaningful headwind, tailwind relative to the day rate. And that's going to be true for the full year as well. And then on the M&A contribution, I would put it in the low single-digits. So if you think about M&A, if you looked at S.E.T. by itself, which is about 20% of our overall revenue, it's in the neighborhood of about 300 bps of benefit. So probably less than a percent for the overall consolidated results. But in S.E.T., it helps by about 300 basis points.\nRobbie Marcus: Great, thanks a lot.\nBryan Hanson : Sure.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Robbie. Lauren, we have time for a few more questions. Can we go to the next one in the queue?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.\nMatt Taylor: Thanks for taking my question, guys. Bryan, I just wanted to ask you about what you're seeing in the marketplace and predicting COVID -- I know it's very challenging -- what about the last year would help, I guess inform you what we could see for 2022, in terms of how things could start to come back. We have had [Indiscernible] been closed and after the [Indiscernible] in the early part of the year, we saw a strong 2Q in the fields more muted this time in terms of the comeback. Do you think the delta is [Indiscernible] or is there something else going on in terms of what we've seen so far?\nBryan Hanson : It's just so hard to predict, every time I think I've got it nailed because I'm looking at trends from the past. I'm wrong, But what I would tell you is I do believe it has been so far and we more recently putting a combination of those two. The Delta surges are absolutely real, and that is impacting capacity in the hospitals less so on the ASC, but definitely the hospital. And staffing surges are very real again, as Suky referenced more in the hospital than the ASC. But both of those things are contributing what we typically look at though, and we still. We still look at starts when is the patient enter the funnel? And usually takes from the time they do to the time to get a procedure 4 to 5 weeks. That seems to be extending now because you've got more people that are entering the funnel, I believe.  But here's the thing, we're just not seeing those stats change north versus more than what seasonality would allow. So seasonality is occurring, procedures are increasing. August to September was better, procedurally speaking. We expect the fourth quarter to be better than the third quarter, but that's being muted by these pressures associated with COVID and staffing. And so that's the reason why we're changing the guidance. It's not that procedures aren't increasing, they are. They're just not increasing nearly at the clip we would expect because of these pressures. I wish I could [Indiscernible]. I don't have a better answer, unfortunately.\nMatt Taylor: Sure. There's a lot of [Indiscernible] certainly, but I guess I wanted your view on how much of the staffing is related to COVID. In other words, conceptually, if in 2022 COVID really wanes, do you think there's going to be ongoing staffing issues in the second half of the year or post normalization?\nBryan Hanson : It's challenging to say because there are multiple components associated with it. Some -- what people are saying is that, is this mandate for vaccinations that is driving some of this change? So if that were to be changed, if say vaccination requirements change because COVID starts to leave the pressure point, maybe. But I don't know, I think that although they may have started because of the COVID challenges, just because of COVID vaccination pressures, whatever it may be -- I don't know that they're going to work in sync. That's just my guess because I have no idea. But my guess is they're somewhat disconnected now, and you may see lingering staffing beyond COVID.\nMatt Taylor: Thanks Bryan.\nBryan Hanson : Sure.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Matt. Lauren, can we got to the next question in the queue, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Imron Zafar with Deutsche Bank.\nImron Zafar: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could comment on how you're thinking about blended implant ASPS in the U.S. over the next couple of years in large joints. Obviously, a lot of moving parts with new products, higher mix of Robotics, maybe ASPS versus inpatient, case mix, things like that. Just [Indiscernible] -- how you're thinking about implant ASPS over the next couple of years. Thanks.\nBryan Hanson : So I'd answer that in 2 ways. First and foremost, we're going to focus on is pricing discipline in the organization. And so if I just take everything else out of the equation, we look to be able to mute some of the pricing impact that we've been experiencing as an organization for a long time. So that up by itself could obviously help from an ASP standpoint just by doing better job on the pricing front, that's one area. Separate from that, a big focus for us is mix benefit. The fact is when we think about share of wallet in a procedure, a lot of the technologies we're launching actually do have an effect of taking up the amount of money you make per procedure. And so if I think about Robotics, you've got a premium.  Every time somebody uses a Robotic procedure in that procedure. We think about Cementless, you get a premium every time somebody uses it. We think about Mymobility. Every time somebody uses it, you get a premium in that procedure. So we would actually expect as we get deeper penetration in these key areas of technology -- Persona IQ is another one. As we get deeper technology penetration, we would expect the ASP that we capture inside of an existing procedure to go up and actually be a tailwind for market growth.\nImron Zafar: Okay, great, thanks. And then secondly, can you just talk about your latest views on the opportunity internationally for ROSA, what your latest thoughts are and timing in key international markets? Thanks.\nBryan Hanson : Yeah. I'd say we've been very happy actually, with our ability to get traction with robotics very early on outside the U.S. A lot of times, we see a nice split between our U.S. business and our OUS business. I truly do believe in certain markets, specifically Asia-Pacific. We have an opportunity to surpass anybody in the robotics space. If we continue with the trends that we're seeing, we could be the number one share player in robotics pretty quickly in Asia-Pacific, and not in the too far distance in EMEA. It could take a little longer in the U.S., but those are the way we look at it. We don't want to just get presence in the U.S., we want to make sure that we're getting traction in OUS as well. And so far, we've seen that.\nImron Zafar: Thank you very much.\nBryan Hanson : Sure.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Imron. [Indiscernible], I think we have time for maybe one last question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.\nKeri Mattox: Anthony, do we have you on the line?\nAnthony Petrone: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to double back on staffing. It seems like there's a number of headwinds as it relates to staffing, whether it be just staff burnout, turnover, just in terms of personnel from healthcare services to industry. And we also heard early retirements could be a big trend in 4Q. So when you think about sort of the stack of headwinds out there, how deep into 2022 do you think some of these trends could last and what do you think that could mean in terms of throughput for ortho recon specifically? And then the quick follow-up would be just on as we navigate the next few quarters, just a recap on pricing for both hips and knees. Thanks again.\nBryan Hanson : Yes. So again, I think it's really challenging to try to project when staffing concerns are going to end. I think what's interesting about it is just the fact that there are staffing concerns is driving a whole new sub-market for nurses and other folks because you can leave the hospital you're in and you can become a traveling nurse and you can get paid a lot more than you're getting paid inside of the hospital you're at. And so if you're willing to take that flexibility, you're willing to travel, you can get paid a lot more. So it's creating a whole new sub market for nurses, which is exacerbating the problem. I just can't predict it. I'd love to be able to for you, but I'm definitely assuming it's going to happen -- continue to happen in 2022. I just -- I can't say with any accuracy when it would stop. And could you just repeat the second question you had?\nAnthony Petrone: Apologies just as we sort of navigate this period here with some of the Delta headwinds in staffing and in particular staffing with some inflationary pressure in hospitals, just how you think that will translate to pricing, as we head into next year.\nBryan Hanson : I got you. That's a good question because if you think about it, as people are having to pay for traveling nurses, they're paying a lot more, too, and they're trying to retain their talent in this market, which also cost s more. But this is nothing new. I mean, hospitals get pressured all the time in their margin. And they pressure us all the time from a pricing standpoint. So no matter what the pressure they're feeling, there's going to be really no change associated with how much pressure they put on us for pricing. And so I don't predict any real change in our pricing dynamics as a result of this. As we've said before, I actually would predict over the five-year strap plan to reduce the pricing impact for a number of reasons. Number 1, just better pricing discipline as an organization and number 2, better contracting skills as we contract, particularly with ROSA in place, in multi-category contracting, we can stabilize our pricing. There's clearly going to be headwinds and there's clearly going to be people looking for better pricing. There' s no question about that. I don't believe this particular variable will change the dynamic there though.\nOperator: That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Keri Mattox for any additional or closing remarks.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Lauren, and thanks everyone for your questions today. Of course, we'll be speaking to many of you today, tomorrow and throughout the next couple of weeks. If you have questions and need more information, please don't hesitate to reach out to the IR team anytime. Thanks so much for joining.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, Bryan. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to briefly discuss our Q3 results and updates that we've made to our full-year 2021 financial guidance. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about Q3 '21 and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. We've also provided comparisons to the third quarter of 2019, as we feel that performance to pre -pandemic results as an important comparator. Net sales in the third quarter were $1.924 billion, a reported decrease of 0.3% and a decrease of 0.8% on a constant currency basis. When compared to 2019, net sales increased 0.4%. On a consolidated basis, as Bryan mentioned, we were growing through August, but then declined in September, as we saw Delta variant cases and staffing shortage increases. In short, there was a seasonal step-up in procedural volumes for the quarter, but the recovery has not taken hold as fast as we thought it would, especially in our hip and knee businesses.  The America's declined 3.2% or flat versus 2019. The U.S. declined 4.4% or up 0.1% versus 2019. Lower U.S. performance in September was the key driver to lower consolidated results. EMEA grew 5.9% or up 0.3% versus 2019. This is the first time the region posted positive growth since the start of the pandemic. In the quarter, we saw an improving trend across a number of markets -- however, the UK, France, Spain, and most emerging markets continue to be challenged, despite higher vaccination rates. Lastly, Asia-Pacific grew 0.5% or up 1.5% versus 2019. While we did see growth versus 2019, it decelerated versus what we observed in the first half of the year. This was driven in part by pricing adjustments [Indiscernible] channel inventory as we continue to negotiate with our distributor partners ahead of DBP implementation in tandem with continuing COVID pressure throughout the region, especially in Japan, and Australia, and New Zealand.  Turning to business performance in the third quarter, the Global Knee business declined 0.7% or down 1% versus 2019. In the U.S., Knee declined 5.3% or down 0.7% versus '19. Our global Hip business declined 6.6% or down 2.4% versus 2019. And the U.S. Hips declined 11.3% or down 2.4% versus '19. The sports extremity and trauma category increased 4.2% or 7.7% versus 19 driven by continuing commercial specialization, new product introductions, and the contribution from strategic acquisitions we added to this portfolio in 2020. Our dental and spine category declined 6.1% were down 2% versus 2019, The dental business posted good growth in the quarter and continued to benefit from strong execution and market recovery, while the spine business declined when compared to 2020 and 2019, due to increase in COVID pressure throughout the quarter.  Finally, our Other category grew 15.4% or down 1.1% versus 2019. Inside this category, we saw ongoing demand for ROSA Knee, as well as increased revenues from the launch of our ROSA Partial Knee and Hip applications. Moving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.69 lower than our GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.16 in the third quarter of 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by cost of goods and higher spending related to litigation, our spin-off and R&D. In addition, our share count was up versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of a $1.81 was flat compared to the prior year, even though sales were down. We implemented targeted reductions in SG&A, which in tandem with a slightly lower tax rate helped offset higher investments in R&D and a higher share count.  Adjusted gross margin of 70.3 was just below the prior year and the results were slightly below our expectations due to lower volumes in tandem with less favorable product and geographic mix. Our adjusted operating expenses of $852 million were in line with the prior year and stepped down sequentially versus the second quarter. In spite of that, we continue to ramp up investment in R&D and commercial infrastructure across priority growth areas like [Indiscernible], Robotics, and Data and Informatics. And we are offsetting those increases with improvements in efficiency across other areas of SG&A. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.1%, largely in line with the prior year and prior quarter. The adjusted tax rate of 15.8% in the quarter was in line with our expectations.  Turning to cash and liquidity, we had operating cash flows of $433 million, and free cash flow totaled $307 million with an ending cash and cash equivalents balance of just over $900 million. We continue to make good progress on deleveraging the balance sheet and pay down another $300 million of debt totaling $500 million of debt paydown for 2021 to date. Moving to our financial guidance. We've updated our full-year 2021 outlook based on 2 factors: 1. COVID and customer staffing pressure is continuing at levels higher than previously expected. And while we expect procedure volumes to seasonally improve into the fourth quarter, we are taking a cautious approach and currently assuming that the more acute pressure we saw in September will continue through the fourth quarter; and 2. as Bryan mentioned, we now know more about the dynamics leading up to the implementation of the China BVP and project that it will have a bigger impact on the fourth quarter than originally assumed.  The impact across inventory reductions, price write-downs on existing inventory, and a new factor which is patients deferring their procedures have increased the impact of VBP and the timing of that impact. As a result, our current projections for Q4 VBP impact is about 300 basis points of headwind to our consolidated results. But the situation remains fluid and we will continue to update you as the implementation of VBP unfolds. For the full year, we now expect reported revenue growth to be 11.3% to 12.5% versus 2020 with an FX impact of about a 140 basis points of tailwind for the year. While we are taking steps to further reduce spending in the fourth quarter as a response to our lower revenue outlook, we're reducing our adjusted operating margin projections to be 26% to 26.5% for the full-year. Our updated full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance is now in the range of $7.32 to $7.47. Our adjusted tax rate projection is unchanged at 16% to 16.5%. And finally, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion.  This updated full-year 2021 guidance range implies that Q4 constant currency revenue growth will be between -2.3% and +1.8% versus Q4 2020. And we project Q4 adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.90 to $2.05. We kept a wider range of potential Q4 outcomes in our guidance to account for the uncertainty around COVID surges, customer [Indiscernible] pressure, and VBP implementation. As a note, we do believe that COVID pressure, including the related staffing shortages will continue to mute pandemic recovery as we move into 2022. Additionally, as we mentioned earlier, VBP is expected to reduce 2022 consolidated revenues by about 100 basis points. That impact will be felt in our large joint segments and will [Indiscernible] impact gross margins as we move forward. To respond to this, we are accelerating transformation and efficiency efforts to help offset these headwinds. In summary, the macro environment presents challenges, but our underlying business fundamentals remain strong as we continue to execute successfully against what we can control. With that, I will turn the call back over to Bryan. Yeah, so thanks for the question, Ryan. Absolutely, our Q4 implied is lower than where we were when we last provided guidance in August and updated in September. And if you remember that guidance is predicated on COVID not worsening and actually starting to see things recover and improve. And as we came into the third quarter, the early part of third quarter, we actually saw some positive momentum with some modest growth in the first two months. But then as we came into September, we saw -- while we saw elective procedures increase in September, as they generally do seasonally, that pressure from COVID and from staffing shortages was greater than expected, such that the growth wasn't there; and we just didn't get to 2019 levels. So you really have to think about recalibrating the third quarter as then you move into the rest of the year because those much lower than we thought.  And then our original guidance suggested that Q4 would be at about market growth or slightly better. That clearly is not what we saw in September and so what we're doing is we're taking that September trend, which was down, and we're carrying that forward into the fourth quarter. So that, I would say, is the largest component of our takedown for our rest of year guidance and for Q4 specifically. In addition to that, there's been some incremental additional pressure due to VBP -- we had always assumed that there would be some inventory dynamics that we accounted for within our forward-looking guidance range.  But what we're seeing now is slightly bigger impact primarily driven by this notion of we're seeing in-market, and from our local teams are telling us that patients are beginning to defer their procedures until the implementation so they can secure a lower out-of-pocket. So I would really pull back and say that the biggest component is due to that headwind due to COVID. And instead of the fourth quarter growing, as we originally thought, that pressure that we're seeing in September we're assuming that continues for the rest of the year and that really is your biggest deviation. Yes. Great, great question. So I'll try and unpack that. First of all, we see next year as a bridge year to that 30% operating margin. But I -- you really have to step back and there are a lot of moving parts into 2022. And I'll just try and break that down one-by-one and help give you some additional color. First of all, like I said about 3Q going into 4Q, as you think about '21 on to '22 you got to recalibrate the starting point, right? We're going to be on a lower revenue base because the pressure that we're projecting to see in the fourth quarter. And then from that, we would expect this COVID pressure to continue at least until the early part of '22, right? So revenue will be pressured. We believe in at least the early part of '22; that's one overarching assumption. And then margin largely follows revenue, especially for our Company from a leverage standpoint and the ability to get profit off of our fixed cost base.  But from there, as we move into operating margin, there's a number of moving parts. I would say first inside of operating margin, you have gross margin. The way I've always talked about gross margin sort of in the mid-term is the take the second half of 2020 and kind of think about gross margins being stable from there. It could be slightly up or down in any given quarter, but largely stable to the back half of 20. We still think that that's the right starting point, but what we have to watch out for now is the impact of BVP, and what that does as a headwind. And also, what we're seeing like many of our peers in our sector is some inflationary pressure on cost of goods and input, costs and labor costs. So we're just got to watch those headwinds. Look, our teams are working really hard to help offset those.  But that's still a moving target for us and something that we got to continue to put a little bit more rigor on, and obviously we will give more detail when we give guidance at the end of the 4th quarter. Then within operating margin as well, the 2nd key component is SG&A. I'm really proud of what the team has done already this year to respond to lower revenues and lower margins, because all the factors I talked about. And quite frankly, we're accelerating our transformation journey and we're doing that in a number of ways. 1. We're looking at regional profitability and we're looking at restructuring a number of markets that are just below where our expectations would be. We're looking at other areas of our cost base and accelerating our Global Business Services strategy.  And there are other structural type initiatives that we're taking inside of SG&A to help some of those revenue and gross margin headwinds that I talked about. So those are some of the moving parts. I'm not going to get into exactly what '22 looks like yet. I think we got to let a lot more play out in the rest of this year, especially around COVID before we can give you a more detailed view of '22. But hopefully, you've gotten some good color there to help you start on '22. So maybe what I'll do is I'll start off with the components that we've defined as what we need to see for growth rates. And then you can take it from there on the up margin piece. First of all, when we think about this 4% to 5% growth that we're trying to accomplish, we've been pretty clear on what we need to see to make that happen. First and foremost, we need to see above-market growth in our biggest franchise, which is Knee. And we've been able to prove that over the past six quarters or so that we were able to get a trend in that direction. Yeah, I think that's one of the key components, and we're consistent on how we think about that operating margin expansion. That's largely leverage-driven, right? We talked about gross margins being stable. I've talked about some headwinds are we're going to look to offset over time and then SG&A becoming a lot more efficient, and the ability to reinvest that back against that higher growth, which gives us that leverage to 30% operating margin. In addition, through active portfolio management, we now also have the spin, which is going to create a tailwind for us from an operating margin standpoint as well, so feel good about that. We still think we have all the right building blocks in place to get to that 30% operating margin run rate as we exit 2023. And Sam, this is Suky. Just to build on what Bryan said, I think the labor shortage is the toughest component to really try and read because it's unprecedented. And it's not just at the nurse level. It's really throughout the hospital setting. What we do know through survey data -- this is not sophistically relevant, so please don't run too far with it but over half of the physicians that have reported in the third quarter have stated that they've suffered from staff shortages. And when those particular physicians have that challenge, they're doing about 10% fewer procedures than they normally would do. So that's very real. And we're also seeing that that impact is greater in the hospital setting than it is in the ASC setting. And as you know, we've got a more prominent share in the hospital setting, so I think it more disproportionately impacts us. Because of those, we're taking the approach until we see substantial, durable improvement, we're going to continue to take a view that this is lingering with us. But again, hopefully it's a conservative view, as Bryan said. Hopefully it lifts sooner than we all expect and we're better off, but that's how we're thinking about it."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "All right. Great. Thanks, Keri, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Let me just start with the things that I'm happy about when it comes to Q3. First of all, I'm happy on our progress with our new product introductions, they're going quite well. Our execution on recent M&A is going as planned, if not better. Our commercial focus in our discipline is as good as I've seen it and I'm very happy with our growth versus our key competitors in both large joints and inset, particularly when it comes to the U.S. The team, in my view, continues to drive results in the areas under our control. And as a result, I continue to be proud of them for doing so. Alternatively, Q3 was also a quarter with unexpected negative environmental impacts, that are for the most part, out of our control.  Q3 brought greater COVID pressure than I think anybody expected: 1. more customer staffing shortages, certainly than we expected; and 2. an earlier China VBP impact than we anticipated. And this resulted in Q3 revenues that were lower than we had projected. And unfortunately, we expect these pressure points to continue into Q4. And as a result, we need to update our 2021 financial guidance. And really, the view we have with the fourth quarter. As we look forward, until we see a fundamental shift in these trends, we're just going to assume that these pressure points aren't going away; but will be with us into Q4 and possibly into early 2022. Let's just start by taking a look at COVID and staffing concerns kind of together because I believe they're somewhat related.  As I think most of us know by now, that there was a significant Delta variant surge in Q3 that drove more COVID pressure than, again, I think anybody expected. We previously thought COVID pressure would lessen through the back half of the year; but instead, while procedures did seasonally step-up in September, it wasn't by as much as we expected. Again, due to the enhanced COVID and staffing pressures. And as a result, September was our least attractive month relative to growth and until we see a real shift COVID and staffing related recovery, we're projecting that the pressure we saw in September will continue through the end of the year. That's a view of COVID. We think about China BPP, the process in China is moving forward. And although it's still fluid, we are getting more clarity on what it will mean this year and in 2022. And our assumption going into the process was that DBP would pose no more than a 1% risk in terms of impact, 2 ZBS, overall revenue.  And although for a number of reasons, the overall impact will likely be greater than what we originally anticipated. We do believe that sizing this at around 1% of revenue impact is still accurate. That is the right way to size it. That said, the timing of the revenue impact has definitely shifted forward. And we now expect that much of this impact will be felt in 2021. And there are a few factors that are driving the shift into 2021: 1. is around current year inventory reductions by distributors; and 2. is around just ongoing negotiations we have with our distributor partners that are beginning to include price concessions on existing inventory; and 3. unfortunately, what we're now seeing patients differ their surgeries until after the lower BVP pricing is in effect.  Apparently, even though China achieves near universal public medical coverage, there are out-of-pocket expenses that increase or decrease, based on implant pricing. And this is substantial enough for patients to defer their procedures. And so, clearly in summary, although we feel very good about our execution in the areas we can control these macro environmental issues continue to mute our overall performance. And these are fluid. These issues for sure they are fluid, but we've done our best to incorporate our current view of their impact in our revised guidance. And I think that's a pretty good segue to move to Suky section where he is going to focus on Q3 financial performance. And I think very importantly, our forward-looking guidance. Okay, Suky. All right. Great. Thanks Suky. And to close out our prepared remarks, I'm going to talk about what ZB can control -- our strategy and our execution -- and that's why I have such confidence in our long-term growth projections. The ZB team remains intensely focused on creating value and, most Importantly, delivering on our mission. Our underlying business is strong and overall, we're pleased with our performance in Large Joints and S.E.T. versus market. This is a significant shift for ZB versus where we were just a few years ago and an important driver of our ongoing growth. Our innovation is in full stride, and that's a big part of this. We're going to enter 2022 with a new product pipeline of more than 20 anticipated product launches across the next two years. And of course, this is incremental to a number of new products we recently launched, including, but certainly not limited to ROSA Partial Knee, ROSA Hip, and Persona IQ, which is the first smart knee implant in the world. We're very excited about this launch.  And we continue to see strong ROSA placements, increased robotic penetration into our accounts. I think most importantly, just more robotic procedures as a percentage of our overall procedure base. And ROSA is even more attractive because it's a key component of our ZBEdge suite of truly integrated solutions. And that -- it really does help to tie pre, intra, and post-op data together with the goal of changing patient care. And finally, we are accelerating our corporate transformation. We're making great progress on the planned spin-off of our spine and dental business. We just recently appointed a new CFO and other key leadership team members for [Indiscernible]. And we continue to be strategic and selective in our active portfolio management process, and [Indiscernible] key assets over the past year that have helped us to better compete, and more importantly to win across robotics and data, dental, S.E.T., [Indiscernible], and the broader ASC market. We're reinvesting in our business for sure, but we're also advancing efficiency programs designed to streamline and improve how we operate, and very importantly, drive savings.  All of this forward momentum plus ZB 's differentiated portfolio, the expected value creation of our plans [Indiscernible] transaction, and our ability to execute really does give us continued confidence in our path to grow revenue in the mid-single digits and to deliver a 30% operating margin by the end of 2023. And I can tell you, this is clearly a time of significant challenge in market pressures. Particularly given the fact that we have such a dependence on elective procedures; there's no doubt about that, but this is also a time of significant opportunity for Zimmer Biomet. And we look forward to delivering for our team members, delivering for our shareholders and most importantly, the customers and patients that we serve. And with that I'm going to turn it back over to Keri to begin the Q&A session. Keri. Second, is we need to be at market growth in Hip trending to above-market growth as we get ROSA traction, which is now in the market. New to the market, but now in the market. And then we needed to be in that mid-single digit growth rate for [Indiscernible], if not to the upper end of that. And so, those are the areas that we're really focusing on we believe are the building blocks as we get into 2023 to get that 4% to 5% revenue growth. We still believe that that is absolutely possible for this organization since that's kind of the topline view, which should be a big component obviously, of driving that operating margin that we're projecting in 2023 as well. So Suky, I'll pass it to you for that. All of this obviously assumes that when we're in 2023, that COVID is in the rearview mirror and no longer a headwind, obviously. So I'm kind of -- I'm looking at my COO right now across the table and I just gave him a new target of 5% to get IQ and [Indiscernible] implants. He is a little worried about that. But what I would tell you though, all tongue and cheek aside, we're very excited about IQ; this is the first of its kind. It's good to bring technology to the market that literally is new-to-market. And that's exactly what we have. And although we're excited about IQ by itself, it's a really important variable in a much broader equation which we call ZBEdge. Because now what we're focused on in ZBEdge is to be able to collect data before, during and after the procedure and is a really important reason for that, because as that data lake increases, what we're going to be able to do is to predict what kind of care we should provide for the patient.  Here's what I know, every time I'm out talking to a surgeon, I don't care how good they are, or what their capability is. They always have a patient, patients that look perfect. They did all the right cuts. They have -- the image looks fantastic. The tissue balancing was perfect, but that patient is not happy. And they don't know why. I don't know why. But as we collect this data and again, the data later gets larger, we're going to be able to predict why and be able to change that outcome. That's the intent here. And why that's really important -- is because when we can do that, you got patients sitting on the sideline right now that would enter the funnel, but are afraid to because they don't believe they're going to get the satisfaction they're looking for. If we can change that paradigm, we can get more patients into the funnel. That's good for everybody in this base. So IQ is very attractive to us, but it's a part of a bigger equation. And I could tell you from IQ perspective, we're in a very limited launch. We want to learn as much as we can as fast as we can. We do have some supply constraints here.  And that will put a little bit of a damper on how we're going to roll this out. Microchips are tough to come by. It's not impacting us in ROSA because you're talking in hundreds. When you move to IQ, you're talking thousands. And so it is going to get in the way, in the short-term that we're again -- we're trying to work through it, but that is going to put a damper on our launch. The demand is great, there's a lot of noise around this and people are very interested, so that's a good sign. We've got to work through the supply constraints and move this forward, but overall, we're very happy. I'll start with the impact. No matter what happens in this base year, we're still predicting a 1% shift to whatever revenue assumptions you've had in 2022. So if you look at growth rate from '21 to '22, that's going to change because you can have more in your base. But the actual impact to consolidate revenues is still 1% in '22. So that's why we're looking at it. And let's say 1% sounds like I know exactly, Just know there's still some variability here. Could be a little more, could be a little less, but I think the right way to model it is 1%. Remembering again that even though it's 1% of consolidated revenue, it's all in large joints. Okay. If I think about our share position in China, we look great -- I just give you a factoid. Just as an example, if you look at our Asia-Pacific 's, not specifically China, but gives you some context here. If you look at our Asia-Pacific Knee business -- the revenue that we do on an annual basis, i's bigger than all 3 of our major competitors' OUS Knee business.  That gives you some sense for our market share inside of Asia-Pacific and inside of China. So this is a pretty important market for us. Here's what's great though when we think about share position going forward; even though it's not as an attractive market now because of the margin profile of the business in large joints, we won every one of the categories. There are eight categories. Number 1, it may be an unattractive space but you still got to win. And the first step in winning is you got to be in play. And we're in play in every one of the categories. We're the only multinational Company to do that. Number 2 now is going to be negotiating with distributors. So we get the best distributors to be able to get the most share at the best margin. And that's exactly what we're focused on right now.  So that gives you a sense for how we're feeling about it. And when I think about trauma spine, it's too early. What I'd say on trauma, there's a provincial tender that just went through; its 12 provinces tender that we think [Indiscernible] at least hearing rumors could end up being a national tender, kind of transition to a national tender, but we don't have any sense for when that would occur. But anyway, that's our sense for China, our share position and [Indiscernible]. Well, what I would say is there's nothing that I would point out for us. I mean, we're conducting business the way we always have. My sense is probably everybody else's too. I think what's happening is just there's a lot of variability in the market because of COVID. You think about it, I mean, COVID is surging at different times in different states in the U.S. different cities in the U.S.. It all kind of depends on your mix in those states. And that's just looking at the U.S. is even broader than that and more volatile outside the U.S. So I think the challenge in seeing these individual quarters have these odd deltas between competitors is not necessarily because competitors are doing anything different. It's because the market dynamics are very different. That's why I continuously look at trends even in these turbulent times, the trend typically tell us a story because it neutralizing some of that variation. But I don't think it's anything that anybody is doing differently. I just think that the market is creating a much more challenging environment to look at consistency from Company to Company. So what I'm -- without giving specifics, we haven't seen anything in October that we'd indicate that this logic that we're using is incorrect. Yeah. You know, essentially because in these turbulent and challenging times, you always look for things that you're excited about. And our innovation pipeline is one that I'm very excited about, and at the center of that is ROSA. There's no question that we continue to deliver on our expectations there, if not above. And I will just go back to the design characteristics that we put into place. We've really took our time to make sure that we learned from who went first and we designed a robotic system that surgeons really wanted and that's translating into demand and that continues. The fact is, surgeons don't want to change the flow of their procedure. And we have created a robotic system that keeps it as close as possible to non-robotic procedure.  We make [Indiscernible] time neutral to be able to use robotics at the same amount of time it would take to do a non-robotic procedure, including all the accuracy though involved in it. And we made sure that we didn't change the standard of care relative imaging. We don't have to CT scan, people don't use it otherwise and they can use the typical imaging that they would use for a procedure. All those things combined with the best implant that we have in Persona is what's driving traction right now. And we are absolutely seeing strong demand, which is continuing for us. We're seeing deeper penetration as a result of that into our accounts; in competitive accounts as well.  And what's really important about that is with all these placements now in place, remember that pull-through that you're asking about the commitment of volume is being muted by COVID. So in the COVID, the [Indiscernible] has gone, those units that we have in place will actually increase their overall input and not just in the disposable price point that you have with robotic procedures, but also the pull-through of competitive business. So we're very excited about where we are with ROSA. We know that we've got the right design in place, and we're seeing great traction. Sure. So thanks for the question. We're still in the planning phase of that and we'll have a lot more detail around that on our fourth quarter call as we come into 2022. But the key areas for us are really around, as I talked about earlier, accelerating our view of market profitability and regional profitability -- how we ultimately go to market, what's our infrastructure in a lot of our smaller markets and just making sure that investments are in fact aligned to growth and opportunity. So I would say that's one. The second area is we looked across our organization. We looked at how we're structured relative to benchmark and where we had outliers, where we had higher costs; we're looking to take actions to make ourselves more efficient, either through just restructuring and de -layering and/or accelerating moving resources to our highly capable Global Business Services that we have in lower-cost countries. So, those are probably the 2 key areas.  I think the 3rd structural area we're looking at is continued consolidation of our ERP systems, which is going to give us a better global process orientation, which could yield savings over time. And then of course we're always actively looking at site rationalization to help with gross margin. And I'm really excited about where the team is moving with pricing improvements going forward. Again, we're going to provide more detail as those become more refined, both on the contribution but also the relative cost to those when we give our fourth quarter earnings. Yeah. I think you're already seeing some of this and the nice thing is we're just in the forefront of that innovation pipeline. Here's what's interesting. I think one of the most important things about that 5 quarters out of the last 6 where we've been above market in Knee, isn't necessarily the amount that we've been above-market or just even those 6 quarters. It's looking at the trend break that you're seeing from ZB -- and what do I mean by that -- if you go beyond those 6 quarters and you look at the 20+ quarters that ZB has been a Company, we did not have one quarter as a Company above-market in Knees -- not 1 quarter in more than 20 quarters. So that as a significant reflection of the transformation taking hold. And it's a reflection of the transformation taking hold when we're at the -- just the beginning of the innovation cycle. We're only about a mid-single-digit vitality index right now.  Our strap plan would indicate that's going to triple over the strap plan period. That's a dramatic tailwind that we expect to see in our innovation pipeline which is a big part of why we believe this is sustainable. If you look at specifically in Knees and the execution is definitely better than we've seen before. Our compensation structure is now focused on growth rather than just maintaining business and our operating mechanisms are as good as I've ever seen. There's clearly no more supply issues anymore. It's all around innovation now. And innovation still drives from Persona Revision that is still getting conversions on the revision side. But most importantly now, it gives you a beachhead with customers that are using our Revision System in somebody else's total Knee -- guaranteed we're going to be pursuing that total Knee business, and that's bigger than the revision business.  You still have ROSA Knee that's just getting started. We've got a lot of headroom in ROSA Knee and that continues to pace very well. ROSA Partial just launched. Remember, at Partial, we have a very large share position. So even if we didn't get competitive business which we certainly are going to try, we have a mixed benefit associated with that in those partial procedures. Persona IQ just starting as we talked about before, and ZBEdge is exciting and then in 2022, we've got a new form factor for our Persona Cementless, which is going to remove all stops for us to be able to pursue a conversion to Cementless Knee. So all those things just give you a lot of shots on goal to continue to drive strong performance in Knee. Sure. So I guess either one of you and I can answer this. But what I will tell you is that it's probably a bit of a conservative approach to look at September and then assume that that's going to continue through. A lot of indicators would say it's going to get better. The combination of COVID pressure and staffing. But, here's what we've learned. Every time I try to use an external view of when COVID is going to get better, we seem to be wrong. And so I'm not going to go with that. I'm going to go with what we're actually seeing in the marketplace and what we're seeing in the marketplace is consistency. Not always the same mix of pressures between COVID and staffing, but consistency in the overall pressure in October that we saw in September. And so I've learned my lesson. I'm not going to try to predict this anymore until I actually see proof in the marketplace that we're seeing firsthand that we're bending that curve. We would expect this to continue into 2020. Your guess is as good as -- others have tried to predict when this is going to stop; your guess is as good as ours. We truly do believe this will float into 2020. We don't know how far but we do believe it's going to float into 2022. Yes. So clearly, we would like to do more too, but I got to be honest with you if you think about the COVID pressure from an EBITDA standpoint. And you look at the debt leverage ratio that's created for us, the fact that we've done as much as we have with the limited firepower we do have, is pretty impressive. I'd actually give the team high complements to be able to select targets, get creative in the way that we pay for those targets, even in an environment with high multiples and bringing technologies that are absolutely fundamental to success inside of S.E.T for instance. Our A&E acquisition helps us in our Thoracic space, which is a big growth area for us that we're focused on. The relying technology that we brought in, filled that significant gaps we had in sports and that gives you the ability then to leverage that full portfolio.  And even Omni Suite, which is not overly exciting when you talk about blooms and lights, but it gives us bigger presence in the ASC market. All those things happened in concert with a relationship with Canary for its smart implants -- long-term smart implants beyond just Knee during the time that we just didn't have a lot of firepower. We absolutely expect over the next 5 years to increase that firepower, particularly as COVID gets behind us, and we will then flex more muscle in this area. But, I would say the opposite -- I would say that we did more than I think would have been expected, given the firepower we had. Yes. So that is a switch because what we have seen in the past and I think everybody has seen that the Knee procedures were lagging behind Hip mainly because you've got 2 factors. Number 1, it really hurts when you got a hip procedure issue. And there is some trauma related to it as well. But I think what you're finding is that that initial wave was where backlog was being consumed at a faster pace with Hip. And some of that has caught up is my view on it. And then the Knee procedures now are -- patients have really been waiting. You got patients that have been out there for a year that are finally coming in to get a procedure. And so I truly do believe these patients have waited as long as they could from a pain threshold standpoint. But now we're entering the market where a lot of those that had significant pain with Hip or trauma were already in the funnel. That's the only thing I can predict, it's the only thing I can see why it's happening. We'll see what happens next quarter, but that's what I think is happening right now. Sure. That's the right way to think about it, Robbie. Sure. So on the operating margin point, it certainly does add another headwind to get to that 30%. But when we put that 30% aspiration out, there were two big components that we had not contemplated. One was the BPS you just mentioned, but the other was the active portfolio management and the spin of the spine and dental business, which will be margin accretive. We think that those two largely offset one another. So again, that's another reason why we're even in the backdrop of this headwind still confident in our ability to deliver that exit run rate at the end of 2023. Relative to day rate, there is no meaningful headwind, tailwind relative to the day rate. And that's going to be true for the full year as well. And then on the M&A contribution, I would put it in the low single-digits. So if you think about M&A, if you looked at S.E.T. by itself, which is about 20% of our overall revenue, it's in the neighborhood of about 300 bps of benefit. So probably less than a percent for the overall consolidated results. But in S.E.T., it helps by about 300 basis points. Sure. It's just so hard to predict, every time I think I've got it nailed because I'm looking at trends from the past. I'm wrong, But what I would tell you is I do believe it has been so far and we more recently putting a combination of those two. The Delta surges are absolutely real, and that is impacting capacity in the hospitals less so on the ASC, but definitely the hospital. And staffing surges are very real again, as Suky referenced more in the hospital than the ASC. But both of those things are contributing what we typically look at though, and we still. We still look at starts when is the patient enter the funnel? And usually takes from the time they do to the time to get a procedure 4 to 5 weeks. That seems to be extending now because you've got more people that are entering the funnel, I believe.  But here's the thing, we're just not seeing those stats change north versus more than what seasonality would allow. So seasonality is occurring, procedures are increasing. August to September was better, procedurally speaking. We expect the fourth quarter to be better than the third quarter, but that's being muted by these pressures associated with COVID and staffing. And so that's the reason why we're changing the guidance. It's not that procedures aren't increasing, they are. They're just not increasing nearly at the clip we would expect because of these pressures. I wish I could [Indiscernible]. I don't have a better answer, unfortunately. It's challenging to say because there are multiple components associated with it. Some -- what people are saying is that, is this mandate for vaccinations that is driving some of this change? So if that were to be changed, if say vaccination requirements change because COVID starts to leave the pressure point, maybe. But I don't know, I think that although they may have started because of the COVID challenges, just because of COVID vaccination pressures, whatever it may be -- I don't know that they're going to work in sync. That's just my guess because I have no idea. But my guess is they're somewhat disconnected now, and you may see lingering staffing beyond COVID. Sure. So I'd answer that in 2 ways. First and foremost, we're going to focus on is pricing discipline in the organization. And so if I just take everything else out of the equation, we look to be able to mute some of the pricing impact that we've been experiencing as an organization for a long time. So that up by itself could obviously help from an ASP standpoint just by doing better job on the pricing front, that's one area. Separate from that, a big focus for us is mix benefit. The fact is when we think about share of wallet in a procedure, a lot of the technologies we're launching actually do have an effect of taking up the amount of money you make per procedure. And so if I think about Robotics, you've got a premium.  Every time somebody uses a Robotic procedure in that procedure. We think about Cementless, you get a premium every time somebody uses it. We think about Mymobility. Every time somebody uses it, you get a premium in that procedure. So we would actually expect as we get deeper penetration in these key areas of technology -- Persona IQ is another one. As we get deeper technology penetration, we would expect the ASP that we capture inside of an existing procedure to go up and actually be a tailwind for market growth. Yeah. I'd say we've been very happy actually, with our ability to get traction with robotics very early on outside the U.S. A lot of times, we see a nice split between our U.S. business and our OUS business. I truly do believe in certain markets, specifically Asia-Pacific. We have an opportunity to surpass anybody in the robotics space. If we continue with the trends that we're seeing, we could be the number one share player in robotics pretty quickly in Asia-Pacific, and not in the too far distance in EMEA. It could take a little longer in the U.S., but those are the way we look at it. We don't want to just get presence in the U.S., we want to make sure that we're getting traction in OUS as well. And so far, we've seen that. Sure. Yes. So again, I think it's really challenging to try to project when staffing concerns are going to end. I think what's interesting about it is just the fact that there are staffing concerns is driving a whole new sub-market for nurses and other folks because you can leave the hospital you're in and you can become a traveling nurse and you can get paid a lot more than you're getting paid inside of the hospital you're at. And so if you're willing to take that flexibility, you're willing to travel, you can get paid a lot more. So it's creating a whole new sub market for nurses, which is exacerbating the problem. I just can't predict it. I'd love to be able to for you, but I'm definitely assuming it's going to happen -- continue to happen in 2022. I just -- I can't say with any accuracy when it would stop. And could you just repeat the second question you had? I got you. That's a good question because if you think about it, as people are having to pay for traveling nurses, they're paying a lot more, too, and they're trying to retain their talent in this market, which also cost s more. But this is nothing new. I mean, hospitals get pressured all the time in their margin. And they pressure us all the time from a pricing standpoint. So no matter what the pressure they're feeling, there's going to be really no change associated with how much pressure they put on us for pricing. And so I don't predict any real change in our pricing dynamics as a result of this. As we've said before, I actually would predict over the five-year strap plan to reduce the pricing impact for a number of reasons. Number 1, just better pricing discipline as an organization and number 2, better contracting skills as we contract, particularly with ROSA in place, in multi-category contracting, we can stabilize our pricing. There's clearly going to be headwinds and there's clearly going to be people looking for better pricing. There' s no question about that. I don't believe this particular variable will change the dynamic there though."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, August 3, 2021.  Following today's presentation, there will be question and answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q2 earnings release which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: All right. Great. Thanks, Carrie, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our call this morning. As we're all aware, obviously, given the news recently, COVID is still very much with us, and we're watching it very closely, as you can imagine. But given that, even we've seen some real progress since our last call, and I think that's obvious to everybody. The world has not returned to normalcy yet, but travel is returning. We have more team members in our offices, and I am personally looking forward to attending the AAOS meeting in about a month in San Diego. So really looking forward to that meeting. We have a lot of great technology that we're going to be able to showcase there and just really happy it's going to be a person again, finally. I want to thank, in that same vein, thank our team again for their dedication to safety, and really just across the board, their commitment to making all of our ZB manufacturing facilities and offices as safe as we possibly can. You, our team members are the driving force for this progress that we've seen in our own facilities and certainly in our communities as well. Also, I want to say that I hope in our investor community that you're continuing to stay safe and have been hopefully able to travel over the last few months to see family and friends. This is an opportunity for us to take advantage of some travel as we begin to turn to more of a normal environment, of course, not there yet, and we know this isn't happening consistently anyway in all regions. But overall, we are encouraged and we're doing our part to keep this moving forward. And every single day, we are supporting our customers and patients that they serve. We're doing this safely, obviously, but this is a big focus for us as a mission-driven organization to be there for our customers so they can complete the procedures that they have, and we can make sure that the patients receive the care that they deserve. And with that, I think it's a good lead into our Q2 call. Today, I'm just going to spend here in the beginning, just a few minutes on a couple of quick remarks, and then I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who's going to get right into a deeper view of our Q2 results. And I think most importantly, our 2021 guidance view on a go-forward basis. And then I'll come back to close out the call with some updates on our active portfolio management and product and pipeline highlights. I'll wait to do that after he provides the guidance information. So just to set him up a little bit, overall, let me just say that our performance in the quarter improved meaningfully from the first quarter of this year, and that was pretty much across all regions and product categories. And as recovery from the global pandemic continued to take hold, we saw that recovery in our procedure is also moving in the right direction. While we certainly anticipate some ongoing COVID pressure, we currently think it's going to be manageable by hospitals, and we expect that the recovery will continue to build sequentially throughout the second half of 2021. Again, not out of the wood yet, but we do believe, thanks to the hospital's ability to better manage these COVID patients and the vaccine rollout continuing, we believe it will be manageable through the back half of the year, again, moving in the right direction. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Suky for our financial update, and then I'll be back with you in a few minutes to close out the call before the Q&A.\nSuky Upadhyay : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. For this morning's call, I'm going to discuss our Q2 results, walk through the updates we've made to our full year 2021 financial guidance and provide color around our current expectations for the third and fourth quarter. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter 2021 and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. Also, I'll provide constant currency revenue growth versus 2019 as we think that is a more relevant comparison for this quarter. Net sales in the second quarter were $2.027 billion, a reported increase of 65.3% and an increase of 60.7% on a constant currency basis versus the same period in 2020. When compared to the second quarter of 2019, net sales were flat on a constant currency basis, and we did not have a material impact from selling days. Overall, consolidated and regional results were slightly better than the expectations we provided on our last quarterly call, with growth versus 2019 in the Americas and Asia-Pacific and sequential improvement in EMEA. For the quarter, the Americas increased 68.3% or up 1.9% versus 2019. We continue to see variability by country within the region with the U.S. growing 66.2% or 3.3% versus 2019. EMEA grew 80.5% or down 7.3% versus 2019, with continued COVID pressure being a factor. We did see improvement in EMEA as we moved through the quarter, and we expect that trend to continue through the back half of this year. Lastly, Asia-Pacific grew 24.4% or 2.8% versus 2019 in spite of some unexpected headwinds. While the region has been largely stable in recent quarters, it was impacted late in the second quarter by channel inventory contraction in our knee and hip categories within China. in advance of the rollout of volume-based procurement or VBP. In addition, we saw a resurgence and increase of COVID-19 in a number of markets, including Japan. Despite these headwinds, the region continued to post growth. Turning to our business categories. The global knee business increased 72.2% or down 6.3% versus 2019. In the U.S., knees increased 77% or was flat versus 2019. While we are seeing sequential improvement in the recovery of procedural volumes in large joints, the path back to normalized market growth is taking a bit longer than most expected. Still, we continue to be encouraged by the team's execution and ongoing strong momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee. Our global hip business increased 39.9% or down 2.8% versus 2019. In the U.S., hip grew 46.6% or up 3.1% versus 2019. Strong demand and favorable feedback continues for the Avenir Complete Hip, which continued adoption for both gold and platinum accounts. The sports, extremities and trauma category increased 53% or up 10.8% versus 2019, driven by solid growth in sports medicine, CMFT and upper extremities. We continue to see strong surgeon registrations of the Signature One surgical planning system for shoulder procedures. Our dental and spine category grew 69.4% or up 0.8% versus '19, fueled by recovery in dental. New products and better commercial execution drove growth in the quarter with strong contributions from implants and digital solutions in our dental business. Finally, our other category grew 105.9% or up 7.5% versus '19. This reflects the ongoing demand for ROSA Robotics and strong capital purchases in the quarter. We saw improvements both sequentially versus Q2 2020 in units sold as well as increased revenues from software due to the launch of our partial knee application. Moving on to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.67. Our reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $1 in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in year-over-year GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue, offset by normalized spending levels and IPRD investments within the quarter. In addition, the second quarter of 2020 had some onetime GAAP charges that did not repeat. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.90 was significantly higher than the prior year, driven as expected by the recovery of elective procedures since the pandemic trough in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted gross margin was 71.7% and in line with expectations. Our adjusted operating expenses of $923 million stepped up sequentially versus the first quarter due to higher variable selling expenses related to higher sales and increased discretionary spending to support investments in commercial infrastructure and innovation through R&D. Improved revenue performance and stable gross margins more than offset higher spending to drive 26.2% operating margins, a slight improvement over the first quarter of this year. The adjusted tax rate of 16.5% in the quarter was in line with our expectations. Turning to cash and liquidity. For the quarter, operating cash flows were $453.9 million, and free cash flow was robust at $358.7 million, and we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of just over $1 billion. We continue to make good progress on deleveraging the balance sheet and expect to make another $300 million in debt repayments in the third quarter.  Moving to our financial guidance. As noted in this morning's press release, we have updated our full year 2021 outlook. We are tightening our guidance range to better reflect our year-to-date performance and a more informed view of the potential impact of COVID. There are some key assumptions that underpin our 2021 financial guidance. We assume no worsening of elective procedure trends due to COVID and that procedure volume recovery continues in the second half of the year, but recovery may not be linear by region and/or by product category. We also expect to see seasonality impact to the third and fourth quarter as we have observed in prior years. With the narrowing of our guidance range, we are now expecting reported revenue growth to be 14.5% to 16.5% versus 2020, with the impact of foreign currency unchanged at about 150 basis points of a tailwind for the full year. On a constant currency basis, compared to 2019, we expect Q3 to grow sequentially over Q2 and for that improvement to continue in the fourth quarter. Turning to the P&L. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share is now in the range of $7.65 to $7.95, and we have narrowed our adjusted operating margin projection to be 26.5% to 27% for the full year. Our updated EPS guidance reflects our performance to date, our expectation of improved growth in the second half and that discretionary operating expenses remained consistent with Q2 through the balance of the year. While operating margins are expected to decline sequentially in the third quarter, in line with lower sales revenue and steady investment levels versus the second quarter, we expect overall second half operating margins to be stronger than first half operating margins. Our adjusted tax rate projection is unchanged at 16% to 16.5% for the full year. And finally, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We will continue to update you on market dynamics and financial expectations as we move through the remainder of the year. To summarize, our performance in Q2 was slightly better than our expectations that we have communicated to you through the second quarter. While we anticipate some ongoing COVID pressure, we have more confidence in the momentum of the recovery and our ability to execute against that backdrop. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan.\nBryan Hanson: All right. Thanks, Suky. And I'm going to now just hit three topics before we move to Q&A. First, I want to talk about execution in some of the product and pipeline highlights that we have under that category; second, I'm going to talk about our progress against active portfolio management, which is a big effort for us, obviously; and then third is innovation. And inside of that innovation, how we believe we're going to be able to drive attractive long-term growth that ultimately will deliver value to you, our shareholders. So let's start with our team's execution. And I've said this before, and I'll continue to say it, that the things that ZB was able to directly control over the past year, 1.5 years, the team -- they've executed against it, they delivered against it. And I'm very proud of the team for doing that during a time of significant turbulence around them. And in Q2, in the recent weeks, we've hit key milestones with our ZB products and our solutions. ROSA for Partial Knee was approved back in April, as we've talked about before. And our first patient surgery was actually performed early in the quarter, and we've continued to see good traction with that technology so far and great feedback so far. And it's important for us because partial knees, I think most of you know, is a market where ZB has a sizable market share position. So we're very excited about the possibilities here, not just from a revenue standpoint, but also the potential impact for patients in the surgery area. And then if I just look at ROSA overall, we did see another strong quarter in Q2 of market demand and traction with ROSA total knee as well with placement momentum broadly continuing across the world, not just in the U.S. but internationally as well. And that's important. We want to see strength in the U.S., but we want to see that OUS, and we did get to see that kind of mix again in Q2. We also saw capital expenses for our customers being much stronger in Q2 and as a result of that, we saw a shift back to upfront sales of ROSA. So more of those happened in Q2 than what we would typically see. And again, that just speaks to the strength of capital budgets and people's desire to acquire in that way. But what is clear is that there's a real focus for hospitals to be bringing in robotic systems for their ORs whether they buy them outright or they get them through other arrangements. Either way, that momentum, that demand is very real. And ROSA continues to be a cornerstone, one of the key ones, of our ZB Edge suite of connected solutions. And our forward-looking robotics pipeline is going to be robust as a result of that because that's a big part of our strategy. So again, a lot of enthusiasm on what that will mean in coming years in terms of expansion of indications. and overall robotics penetration for ZB. Also in the quarter, we saw a revision continue its very strong momentum. Again, this is a great tip of the spear product for us, where we can go in and get competitive conversions and revision but also use those competitive conversions for access to the typical total knee as well for that surgeon. So very exciting, not just on the revision side but also opening the door to a much larger opportunity to get their typical knee conversion as well. We're also excited about adding another key variable to our ZB Edge portfolio of connected technologies, and that is our Persona iQ, which will be the first and only smart implant on the market. And we certainly still have to get FDA approval on that. We're working diligently with them to help with any information they need to move that forward, and we're certainly hoping to receive approval in the relatively short term. But ultimately, again, that time line is up to the FDA. And it's important for us because it takes the Persona implant, which is that known and trusted design in an implant and it combines it with Canary Medical's tibial extension, which has the sensor technology in it. And the combination of those 2 things will now inside the body, give us an opportunity to measure the range of motion of that patient, step count, walking speed and other mobility metrics that we believe are going to be indicators of post-surgery progress. So again, helping us close the loop in those connected technologies that we have in Zedge -- So more to come when we hear back from the FDA. But once we do get that approval, we would look to limited launch the technology for a quarter or two and then post that time frame, move into full launch. Okay. So let's move to my second topic that is on active portfolio management and our efforts around active portfolio management. We have the ZB portfolio management strategy in place. We have the right process in place, and we have definitely built our capabilities to move this forward over the last 1.5 years to 2 years. So we're excited about this phase of the organization. And we're focused, as we said before, on mission-centric M&A that is WAMGR-accretive. So in other words, weighted average market growth accretive to the organization. And you've seen us move this forward already with the selective tuck-in acquisitions that we did late last year that really illustrate our strategy at work. These are smaller deals, again, tuck-in size deals that were designed to fill portfolio gaps and better position us as an organization in high-growth, high-priority markets like sports medicine, ASC and sternal closure where we truly do believe we have a right to win in attractive markets with strong profitability. And of course, there's the planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental businesses that is fully underway and on track. We continue to be encouraged by the energy and the momentum around NewCo. As CEO of Vafa Jamali, builds out his team and refines his corporate strategy, and we believe creates two independent and even stronger companies that is going to maximize value for not just our customers, but also for you, our shareholders. All right. And that brings me to the last topic that we have before we move to the Q&A, and that's going to be around innovation. And really inside of innovation, how we see our ability to drive attractive long-term growth that will ultimately deliver value to all of our stakeholders, including you, obviously, our shareholders. We are focused on evolving ZB from what I would define as a metal and plastic provider of implants into a leading med tech innovator. And we have a lot of shots on goal across a number of programs to do this, including a number of robotics launches over the near term, smart implants that we have today, but also the technology road map that we have in smart implants. New functionality with mymobility and really just the broader ZB edge ecosystem of those connected technologies that are going to help us drive mix benefit and share of wallet benefit, but also competitive conversions. And I've mentioned before, more than 70% of our new product development investment is directed towards ZB edge and those connected technologies inside of ZB edge. And our exclusive partnership with Apple continues to be productive and collaborative. And we forged several other tech alliances that we know are going to drive future innovation that will benefit patients. And I believe this fundamental shift is coming for ZB and for our core markets with technology advancements, potentially changing the care paradigm for patients in the future, and that's really what our focus is. So the momentum is real on the innovation front. And we think it will ultimately allow us to drive long-term growth that is very attractive to us and to you. And most importantly, it also gives ZB the chance to really change the lives of patients around the world. All right. Let me close by saying that I continue to be highly confident in the ZB team and our business momentum. While there continues to be uncertainty due to the global pandemic that we cannot control, I truly believe that we are ready and well positioned for success. And our strategy is absolutely working. The transformation of our business is well underway, and I'm excited about the value we can drive for our shareholders on a go-forward basis. Now I also want to make sure that I take the time to thank the entire ZB team. Your dedication to safety is critical and your focus on delivering on our mission is unmatched and you do it daily. I remain incredibly proud of what we're accomplishing and what we're accomplishing together.  And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Keri for our Q&A session. Keri?\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Bryan. [Operator Instructions]. With that, operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen. \nJosh Jennings: Bryan, I was hoping you could just share how internally your team has been tracking Zimmer Biomet's U.S. hip and knee market share and any breakout of the progress in the De novo revision segments would be helpful. And then as you think about your revenue growth acceleration journey post spin, do you envision the introduction of enabling and sensor technologies driving that positive mix shift and expanding or accelerating U.S. knee and hip WAMGR up into the mid-single digits? Or how do you see the U.S. large joint markets growth evolving in the next coming years?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. No problem, Josh. Let me start maybe with the second part of your question because I would say beyond sensors, just what we define as ZB edge, which is the interconnected technologies that actually do full data for the patient journey. We really do believe that those technologies, including robotics, sensors in the body, mymobility, OrthoIntel, so on and so forth, will absolutely bend the curve when it comes to growth rate in knees and hips in other areas as well because we would proliferate those beyond just knees and hips. So just I do believe that, that technology, which is being absorbed by the folks in orthopedics right now does provide us an opportunity to enhance our growth rate as an organization for two reasons: one, because I do believe that we can get that share of wallet benefit or mix benefit for procedure; and two, I really do believe it sets us up to take share from the competition because it's unique to us. So yes, on the second question, I see that as being able to enhance our growth rate. When I think about the share, I'm pretty focused on this, as you would imagine. This is something that in a turbulent market, we got to pay attention to it. And when I think about the last five quarters that we've seen we just had abnormally large spreads between the top and the bottom player in large joints. This speaks to just a very turbulent market that we're experiencing because of COVID. And inside of this, I'm ultra focused on share gains or losses because it's the very thing that would tell us whether we're performing well versus our competition because the market itself is difficult to understand. And I'm focused on this in regular times, but I'm ultra focused on it during turbulent times. And that said, in a normal market, I try not to get too excited or depleted based on any individual quarter performance. There's just too many variables inside of an individual quarter, particularly now. But what I do is to take a look at a rolling four quarters, and that's the way we do it every time we see results out. When I think about the rolling four quarters, particularly prior to Q2, we definitely took share in our large joint market. We didn't beat every competitor every quarter, but every quarter over the four quarters preceding Q2, we were ahead of market in both knees and hips. And that obviously gives us confidence as we move forward. So I really try to look at it with the data that's provided from the major companies that is public to all of us, and I just track that over a four quarter rolling period to determine whether we are we're not taking share. And I do believe that even though it's been positive for us over those five quarters, I do believe the technology that we're launching is going to enhance that going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Bryan, both of my questions into one. Back to your prior comments here on share gains versus the market. But I guess, discrete is focused more on near-term sequential trends here. Why would Zimmer perhaps be seeing different trends versus your peers? I think you made some comments about the backlog burn being a little bit slower, et cetera. Maybe put that in perspective for us? And my second question is, your ROSA, I think one of the key advantages of the system is ease of use, the higher throughput. Given there is a backlog, are you seeing increased traction here or customers appreciating this speed advantage of ROSA? And what does that translate to a total installed base or share gains perhaps for Zimmer?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. So maybe I'll start with the ROSA throughput. And as you probably remember, we spent a lot of time thinking about the design characteristics of ROSA is one of the primary things we want to focus on is to make sure that we did not disrupt the surgical flow and certainly did not want to add time to the surgical procedure. And that has benefited us. There's no question. I mean, to me, it wouldn't matter whether we're in a COVID environment or a non-COVID environment. That is something that our surgeons are pursuing. And they very much appreciate the fact that it's not disrupting their flow, and it's not dramatically increasing any the times to do procedures. So that is a benefit for us for sure. And again, I don't think it really matters whether you're in a COVID environment or not, that's just a benefit. One of the things relative to share gains that you talked about and our view on backlog, I don't know that our outlook and what we've described is really any different than anyone else who plays in large joints like us with such a significant share position. It seems pretty consistent with -- to me anyway. If I think about the deferred patients, I'd just say that like most people at this point, that just becomes more challenging now as time continues to be added to the equation. It's just unprecedented right now that what we're dealing with, just given how long this has gone on. And there are just too many variables in my view, just to really size this appropriately, and I think anyone would probably say this now. But that said, we still believe that there's been no structural shift in the disease state. That's what we've been saying all along. And as a result of that, there's got to be a sizable deferred patient population out there. And when we originally analyzed what we thought would happen with that deferred population, we looked at Q3 of last year. And we assume that when -- based on what we saw in Q3, that when the vaccine was available, you would have a pretty significant return of deferred patients relatively quickly. And again, that's what we saw in parts of Q3 last year when the virus was subsiding. So we just assumed that would happen this year. Now fast forward today, the vaccine is here, and we've got more current data and more data points that are playing out right now. And this doesn't seem to be materializing for anybody. And as such, our current thinking is that deferred patient demand will like become at a more gradual pace and probably be more consistent over a longer-term period of time as a result. I think that's really what we're contemplating by the way. When you think about the midpoint of the revenue range that we just provided, the implied range for the back half of the year, but actually at the top of that range, as I think most people would say, we would need to see a change in the current pacing of that recovery. So in other words, you'd have to see it reflect an increase in deferred patient demand that would also be matched by capacity increases to get to that top end of the range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.\nAnthony Petrone: Hope everyone is doing well. And maybe just a quick follow-up on backlog. Is it safe to assume, Bryan, that it's still sort of at least a $700 million opportunity and that perhaps could certainly extend into 2022, but maybe even beyond a bit. It sounds like perhaps that's where you're headed. And then a few quick follow-ups on Persona iQ does sound to us from our checks that there is pent-up demand for the sensing capability. So a few questions here. Do you need to be standardize on ZB edge to take full advantage of the implantable recorder? And will Persona iQ actually drive additional surgeon reimbursement over time?\nBryan Hanson: Sure. So maybe I'll start with the backlog just because it's maybe a simpler answer. I just -- I don't want to try to size it because I think it's gone on too long. And as I said before, I just don't know how you look at this unprecedented situation and try to put a size to it. All I would say is that based on our assumption of no structural change in the disease data, it's got to be big. I'll just -- I'll leave it at that, but I don't want to try to size it. And yes, my current thinking is based on the data points that are available to us, is that it's likely going to be a slower role with that deferred patient group coming in. And that would indicate that this should take a while for us to work through it. That could change at any time, but that's the data points that we have right now. Relative to iQ, I'm glad that you're hearing there's pent-up demand because certainly, we're feeling that as well, and we're getting excited about the launch, the pending launch. And we still obviously cannot market the technology because we don't have FDA approval, but we do believe that, that should be coming soon. And yes, we're excited about it, but you do not actually need to have the full ZB edge infrastructure to take advantage of it. What we would like to see people do is to have mymobility and the Persona iQ combined because we believe the combination of the data collection between those 2 is extremely beneficial, but you don't really even need that. But that would be the goal for us to have that move in concert and be able to have the mymobility in concert with the iQ implant. And we do feel that all the components are there for remote patient monitoring. That's the whole idea behind this. Through mymobility, through iQ is to be able to remote patient monitor. And as a result of that input provided, be able to make decisions on what you do or don't want to do with the patient. And so we believe that we have what would be required for a surgeon to get a reimbursement for RPM. That's the way we're looking at it today. At the end of the day, that's not our decision on whether it happens or not, but we do believe we have the components to make that available to surgeons.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer.\nSteven Lichtman: I'll ask my two upfront. Bryan, you talked about the momentum sequentially in ROSA. Obviously, we saw that in the reported numbers. As we think about the implant pull-through opportunities, can you give us a sense of what percent of placements are going to accounts that are competitive accounts or ones where you have low share. And then, Suky, just as a follow-up on gross margin in the first half an ahead of the second half of 2020. Do you see upside to your original expectations for 2021 on gross margin, which I think was to be about in line with the second half of last year?\nBryan Hanson: Great. So I'll go ahead and start with the ROSA question, and then Suky, I'll pass it off to you. I would just say that, yes, again, we're excited about the traction we're seeing. And as the way I look at this, it's not just the traction that we're seeing with ROSA, I'm excited because there seems to be a significant openness in orthopedics for technology. And that's really important, I think, for two major reasons. One, because I truly do believe the technology is going to change the care paradigm for patients. You're going to get better outcomes as a result of it. And when you have that happening, I believe more patients will enter the funnel because they're going to have higher confidence in the procedure. Remember, there's still 20% of me patients that are not happy with the outcome. And if we can reduce that through technology, I believe you've got patients sitting on the side that would enter the funnel, which is good for everybody, patient included. So I'm very happy to see momentum in ROSA, but I'm even happier to see technology adoption in orthopaedics overall. And when we think about our placements, it's interesting because we focus in two major areas. We spend most of our time in platinum accounts and gold accounts. And both of those would just be very large accounts. The difference between the 2 would be platinum. We have a higher share position. And in gold, we have a lower share position. But those are the two areas that we concentrate mostly with ZB edge and ROSA. Now what's interesting about that though is even when we go into that platinum account, it's very rare that we would have a homogeneous new usage in the account. So even when we get a platinum customer that is using us in knee, to move into ROSA, we typically get competitive conversions to ROSA because you have competitive surgeons in those accounts. And of course, in gold accounts, you get the same thing. So it's almost every placement that we have very rarely otherwise, provides an opportunity for us to get a competitive conversion. And hopefully, that helps with the way we're thinking about ROSA.\nSuky Upadhyay : Yes. Stephen, it's Suky. You're right. When we talked about gross margin for 2021, we talked about it being stable to back half of 2020, right? We said it may not be the same for each quarter because there are a lot of variables that impact gross margin. But we said broadly that it would be in line or stable. And that comes off with many years of declining gross margins. So it's a good first step and in actually seeing that stability. First half fortunately was a little bit better than the back half of last year, and so we're encouraged by that. We expect the second half of this year to be pretty much in line with the second half of last year, so very consistent with how we've previously guided. When you average those two together, the first half of this year being a little stronger in the second half being in line, that would suggest that the full year should be slightly better than what we saw in the back half of last year. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing there. I do want to just thank and recognize the supply chain team as well as the commercial team for a lot of great efforts on our cost down initiatives, looking more strategically at P&L and really looking for opportunities to become more efficient in our cost of goods just overall. So seeing some good progress so far. So we're encouraged, and that's how we thought about it, and that's what's baked into our guidance moving forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Suky, I just want to make sure I'm understanding the second half revenue guidance and cadence. When I look back before 2020, the last five or six years, Q3 is typically down about 6%. And Q4 is typically up about 11% sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Based on your comments earlier, I thought I heard you say Q3 would be down maybe 3% but Q4 would be up, call it, 14% to 15% to kind of get to your midpoint of your guidance. So it's better than kind of we've historically seen. Can you comment on July trends? And am I right to think that you expect a little bit better seasonality in the second half of 2021 versus what you've typically seen?\nSuky Upadhyay : Yes, absolutely. So my comments earlier in the call were really versus 2019. And so that's kind of where I'll play for this answer. We do expect to see seasonality on an absolute basis, Q3 generally tends to be lower in absolute sales other than Q4, and we expect that to play through for the second half of this year as well. We do expect half of this year as well. We do expect versus '19, where Q2 was about flat, as we mentioned earlier for the third quarter to step up. And as you suggested, that is a little bit better than what we've seen underpins the continued recovery, which ultimately underpins our guide for the back half of the year. And then again, for that to step up again sequentially in Q4, again, all versus 2019. So that's how we currently see it. And again, it's pretty much based on that continued recovery that we've already seen in Q2. What we've seen early on in Q3, we're not going to talk about individual or specific months as we move through the rest of this year. But so far, what we've seen in July underpins and supports what we've provided earlier today.\nBryan Hanson: Suky, let me just add some color to that. I just -- when I think about what Suky just referenced that we've got a pretty significant assumption in our guidance range that says COVID pressure doesn't get worse and the recovery builds through the second half. But we didn't just assume that. There are some proof points that we're seeing, and that might speak to your question, Larry, maybe a little more. There's really kind of two things that we're seeing that would give us confidence in that assumption. And the first one is that even with the recent virus surges that are all over the news, I mean, you can't look at the news any time during the day and not see something about the virus surge, but it doesn't seem to be translating into the same significant revenue disruption that we've seen in the past and certainly not helping us, but it's not translating into that same kind of revenue disruption we've seen in the past. So -- and I believe that's likely because we've got more vaccines out there, obviously, which is impacting the way people feel when they get sick. But also, I just think that hospitals seem to be managing this patient population better. And the second kind of proof point for us when we thought about this as an assumption inside the guidance range, is that the vaccine is available. I mean let's face it. It's available globally anywhere. Anybody who wants it can get it. And I truly do believe even though it stalled a bit in certain parts of the world, I do believe as people get more educated on the Delta variant and the risk associated with that. That may be a good motivator for people to come in that have been waiting to actually get the vaccine. And so those are kind of the proof points that we have that give us confidence that we should see the continued recovery in the back half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.\nChris Pasquale: Two Questions. Just trying to understand some of the moving pieces in the quarter a little bit better. First, can you quantify at all the impact of the China inventory drawdowns? It did seem like Asia Pacific was the source of the shortfall versus consensus in hips and knees this quarter. So it would be great to just understand magnitudes there a little bit better. And then can you put any numbers around the ROSA contribution this quarter. The other revenue line was a big upside driver. Just be helpful to know how much of that came from increased system volume versus that shift in the preference between placements and upfront purchases for your customers?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. So maybe Suky, why don't I take a shot at the ROSA piece and then I'll pass it to you on VBP impact. But on the ROSA side, I probably don't want to speak specifically to the dollar amount, but obviously, it was a big enough shift for us to talk about it. So that might help you kind of size it in your mind. But what I would tell you is that the way I think about it, is in a normal quarter, what we would typically see is better than 50% of our placements being done through a long-term contract, which is -- we actually like that because it does link us to the customer, and it usually has a competitive pull-through commitment as a result of that arrangement. And in this quarter, we just saw that flip. The higher than 50% move to upfront purchases which is different than what we've seen in the past. What I don't know for sure is that that's going to continue. I mean clearly, there were budgets that were available to people, they flexed those budgets that could continue. Hey, I'm happy either way we place ROSA. We're going to be very flexible with our customers as we go forward and make sure that we're there to support them. Our preference, as I've said in the past, is those long-term contracts, but I'll take an upfront sale as well. So hopefully, that helps on the ROSA side and then Suky, I'll pass it to you on the VBP impact.\nSuky Upadhyay : Yes, sure. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, as we noted, Asia-Pacific sales were impacted in the quarter really by two things. One is the VBP impact that we talked about, which was essentially some distributors taking some inventory contraction ahead of VBP. And the second was we did see surges late in the second quarter in some of our larger markets like Japan and Australia and New Zealand that also slowed some of our growth down. And that hit pretty much across both of those VBP as well as slowdowns in our recon business. But it was encouraging that despite those headwinds that we were able to manage through that and actually grow the region a little bit ahead of expectation. And we would expect that growth to continue in the back half of this year. Regarding China VBP, for competitive reasons, we're not going to size that. It was a contributor. We're not the only contributor in that performance in Asia-Pacific, as I mentioned. I think the important thing is how do we think about this going forward? We've looked at VBP and done a number of scenarios based on what we know at this time. Again, the final rules, pricing and volumes aren't expected to be issued for let's call it another few months, but that timing has been shifting around, so it could continue to shift. But based on what we know today, we don't expect there to be a material impact from inventory change going forward. And that's what's represented in our guidance moving forward. But again, we're going to learn a lot more about VBP over the coming months, and we'll update you as we learn more. But again, it was great to see that Asia-Pacific did grow through that. And I would say also, fundamentally within China, we're seeing very strong demand. And so obviously, that was the first market to be impacted by COVID-19, and it was the first market to recover, and we continue to see good strength and progression in that market. And as you know, we're a leader within China and expect to maintain that leadership position as we move forward.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Miksic: I have one on S.E.T and just a follow-up on ROSA, if I could. So on S.E.T, Bryan, or Suky, if you could provide some color on sort of the components within that business that was driving some of the strength, at least upside to our estimates trauma, was it extremities? Was it sports is a little smaller, but was that where you saw some of the strength? And as I mentioned, I have one follow-up on ROSA.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, that's one of the highlights that I saw in the quarter. Clearly, we are heavily penetrated when we think about our overall revenue in large joints. And as I think everybody has been saying and recognizing large joints have just been a little slower to recover than some of the other categories that we have. And what I've been very happy to see is our strength in said, and we believe that, that's going to continue through the back half of the year, pretty across the board, we showed good performance. Standouts for us were sports, the upper extremities business for sure was solid, trauma was solid for us. And of course, when we look at our CMFT business, our thoracic business was quite strong as well. So we're excited to see that the tuck-in acquisition that we did in CMFT is playing out the way we expected. And then some of the acquisitions that we did that were really just product launches, filling out gaps that we had in sports and also in the ASC, they're also providing benefits right now. And that was the whole idea, right, to fill out that product portfolio. As a result of that, have a fight and have a right to fight and win. And that's playing out right now. So we're feeling good about the strength in S.E.T, probably have more confidence now in that being able to continue on a go-forward basis just given what we have in the portfolio. So very happy to see that strength in S.E.T, and we would expect that to continue.\nMatt Miksic: And just a follow-up on ROSA. So I don't think many of the other folks putting robots into the field are seeing the kind of shift back to capital that you're seeing. It seems like it's been pretty stable. And I'm wondering maybe if you could talk a little bit about the mix of accounts, maybe the mix of ASCs or the larger centers. And if there's any change in the mix that might be driving some of that preference for cash payment versus commitment to long-term contracts?\nBryan Hanson: Yes, sure. Really, no dramatic shift. I mean even if I think about U.S., OUS, for instance, we typically do, it's not always exactly this way, but if I look at the number of quarters and just kind of aggregate them, we typically do kind of a 70-30 split U.S., OUS, and that was pretty consistent in this quarter. For us, again, we did see that shift. We believe that it's mainly because people have more budget right now on the capital side. I don't see a shift in our customer base that drove it. So nothing that just stands out for me. It's just more that there was capital available. People like to flex the capital when they have it. And some customers just don't want the long-term contractual obligation, bringing a piece of capital in, they'd just rather buy it. And so I think that's really the corporate, there's nothing beyond that, that I've seen. Now we'll certainly pay attention to it as we go forward, but nothing that was disruptive in any way relative to mix that would have changed that change in placements.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel.\nRick Wise: Bryan, maybe just to start with M&A, you obviously highlighted that M&A remains a top priority. And I heard you about the WAMGR accretive and you listed some areas. How do we think about the next 6, 12, 18 months? Do you feel like you have a lot of targets. Do you feel like you have a lot of opportunities? Do you feel like you're moving faster? And the points you mentioned about robots and smart implants, et cetera, et cetera. I mean do we envision that it's more about acquiring enabling technologies or incremental technologies that enable you to achieve that? Or no, you're ready for something larger freestanding to accelerate? And then I'll ask a second question.\nBryan Hanson: Okay. Maybe just quickly here, and I'm going to pass it to Suky because at the end of the day, the M&A strategy is only as good as the funding for it. So obviously, we're both focused on moving this forward. But let me maybe pass it to Suky. He can give you the same color I would on what we're looking for from an M&A standpoint, but also give some color on how we're feeling about our firepower there. So Suky?\nSuky Upadhyay : Yes, absolutely. So we continue to build out, I think, an attractive pipeline of potential tuck-in targets. Very consistent with what Bryan said earlier about things that are mission-centric where we have the right to win, strategically makes sense, financially are strong and have a low level of synergy disruption and very consistent with sort of the deals we did at the back end of 2020, which so far through the integration process, we're very pleased with how those are progressing. So we're going to continue to look at opportunities very similar to those. And the good thing is our firepower continues to build. And with the recovery of the pandemic, we're seeing our EBITDA improved significantly. We've turned the corner on the second quarter of 2020, which was a cliff for us, as you know, a trough, if you will, on EBITDA. And with a rolling 12-month EBITDA number as we sunset the second quarter of 2020, we're seeing a pretty big step up in our EBITDA number and a nice improvement in our overall leverage ratio. When you combine that with the debt paydown we've done so far, the debt paydown we're committing to in the back half of this year, and the over $1 billion on the balance sheet, we feel we're in a stronger position than we have been for the last 15 months to And so I feel really good about where we are and how we're moving forward on that. I would also say, another big component of that is our spin transaction. We're really pleased with how the team has been progressing on that. We've made significant progress with our tax private letter ruling, great progress with our carve-out financials and our 10x, which we hope to file in the not-too-distant future with the SEC on a private basis. Good progress from BofA in formulating this go-forward strategy and building out his team. So just overall, really, really impressed with how the team has handled this in the backdrop of also integrating those transactions we did at the back end of last year. So that muscle, that capability that we've been building over the last couple of years is really playing out to our benefit right now.\nRick Wise: Got you. Go ahead, Bryan. Go ahead.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, just going to say, and you are right, I mean the two areas where we're spending a lot of time right now when we look at targets and are pulling that bolt-in of targets, it would be around enabling technology. A great example of that is what we did with Canary in that relationship that's been created, and that's going to then obviously spin out IQ for knee, but also sensors and other areas and body as well. And then we'd be looking at near adjacencies very much like what you've seen recently from us in sports to ASC, thoracic areas that we feel confident we have a right to win. They are accretive to our overall weighted average market growth and they're profitable. Those are the things that we're looking at today. And as Suky said, the firepower opens up and we'll begin to flex that firepower in those areas.\nRick Wise: I just as a follow-up, I was reflecting, Bryan, on your comment about -- specifically about revision where you said capability now opening the door to competitive conversions. I was reflecting just that maybe you could flesh out your comments here. I mean, I get it that revision specifically will help, but -- so Persona iQ so well continuing rollout of ROSA, et cetera, et cetera. Just my question is, as we reflect on the next 6, 12 or 18 months, what should we imagine? What are you thinking about as the biggest driver of competitive conversions and share gain, is it these incremental products? Is it the totality of everything? Is it something about execution? Just trying to understand where you'd have us focus on thinking about that kind of a concept?\nBryan Hanson: Can you hear me okay? What I would tell you is that the -- that's kind of the beauty of the situation why my confidence is high that we're going to continue to see share gains as we have over the last four quarters spot. That's because we just have so many shots on goal. If you think about knee in particular, we already have ROSA out, and that's getting great traction ROSA Partial was just launched. Persona revision has been out for a while, but the momentum is still very strong. And there is that spin-off opportunity to get the typical total knee. You still have mymobility driving conversions. You haven't even launched Persona iQ yet. So all of these give us an opportunity to create a differentiated environment for our customer and provide the opportunity for not only that share gain or mix gain, but also competitive conversions. And specifically on revision, the reason why I bring it up is typically in somebody's practice, you get about 10% of the overall revenue associated with provision, and it's more like 90% comes from your typical total knee. And many times, we use that revision as a tip of the spear to convert a surgeon that is a competitive surgeon because they love the revision system. And that gets us in the house then to try to pursue that much larger portion of the business, which is your standard knee. So that's why I keep going back to that, we have significant dollars now that we're paying attention to, where we have a revision customer that is using a competitive total knee system, and that gives us a great opportunity and kind of a hunting ground to go to, to get those conversions, but it's certainly not the only area that would give us the opportunity to take share. It's pretty much all of these.\nKeri Mattox: Lauren, we probably have time for maybe one more question.\nOperator: Up next, we have Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: Thanks here. So Bryan, just a little bit more on the knee side of things. When I look at your numbers, I know what you're saying about over the last several quarters, you're trending in the right direction. But when I look at the last two, it seems like things have flattened out a little bit. If not, you're actually down a little bit on the knee side in terms of share. And so I'm just wondering, especially in the U.S., that's actually down versus '19 here in Q2. Are there things that are impacting you specifically because you are the biggest player in the market? Are there some higher volume accounts that are on vacation? Are you in bigger COVID hot spots more training on the partial knee side that has slowed things down a little bit for you guys versus what we've seen from some of your peers?\nBryan Hanson: It's so hard to say. And that's why I was referencing before when I look at share gain or loss, I never look at and spend too much time on a specific quarter, even when things are typical. But in these crazy times, so many things can impact your performance versus the market. So again, I try not to get too worked up about any given quarter. It could be. I mean the fact is share right now in a specific part of the country for instance, can be meaningful to whether you do better or worse than the competition because that particular state or county could be challenged by COVID more than others. So there's always those things that could impact a specific quarter. That's why when I look at over a four quarter period of time that usually eliminates those hotspots. And that's why I feel more confident and more comfortable with more of that trend, which -- through that trend basically eliminates the noise, I'm going to put air quotes around the \"noise\" of a specific quarter. That's why I still feel confident that we're in good shape that we have all these shots on goal that we should continue to take share. But hey, I'm disappointed. I look at the quarter, I don't really care what the reason is. I want to win every single quarter and this one we didn't. But again, I'll look more at the trend and take more from that on the prediction of share taking in the future. And I would just say in a nutshell, I believe that we're going to be net share takers.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: And then just really quickly on ROSA placements. I think you mentioned more -- a better trend line on the OUS side. So can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing internationally as far as ROSA placements go? And then here in the states, there's been some talk about some moving into ASCs. And just in terms of ROSA placements, what are you seeing in terms of where these things are going higher volume accounts that you're getting into inpatient or even in the ASC or even on the ASC side of things?\nBryan Hanson: Yes, that's a nice thing. I feel really good about our distribution. We're taking advantage of momentum in the ASC. The ASC absolutely loves the fact that we're an efficient robotic system that they're all about efficiency in the ASC. So there's been a benefit for us there for sure. We've seen it in the hospital as well. We've seen it around the globe in Europe, Middle East and Africa as well as Asia-Pacific. So I'm just very pleased with the distribution of the technology across pretty much all sites of care and around the globe. And again, we focus our attention, not always, but let's call it, 80-plus percent of the time in those larger accounts. We're spending our time in those goals and platinum accounts because that's where the big payback is if you're going to spend the time. So again, the distribution has been good. I mean it's been across settings, across region, and we've been focused on the larger accounts for sure.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Matt for the question. And I think that brings us to 9:30. Bryan, I'll turn it back over to you just for any closing remarks before we wrap up.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. Thanks, Keri. I wouldn't mind making a couple of comments here. And first of all, thanks for spending time with us here this morning. I just want to say, and I think this is probably obvious to everybody. We certainly have an outsized dependence on elective procedures versus really any of our med tech peers or competitors, particularly large cap companies. We're just an outsized impact there. And as a result, we're very sensitive to COVID ebbs and flows. And we spend a lot of time as you would imagine, analyzing this. And we try to remain prudent in our expectation setting as a result. And because we've seen it. We've seen it first hand that COVID can move our business pretty rapidly given that dependence on electric procedures. And this has been what was reflected in the updated guidance and why our implied range for the back half is still pretty wide because again, there are things that can happen here to move us up or down pretty rapidly because of that dependence on elective procedures. Now relative to Q2 specifically, and Suky said this before, even with some of the unexpected challenges that we had in the quarter, hey, we delivered better-than-expected results, which I think speaks to two very important things. Number one, and this is more short term, but it's important, the recovery from COVID is moving in the right direction. Now it's definitely not happening the way we anticipated. I don't think it is for anybody. But it's moving in the right direction, nonetheless. And the two, and I think this is important, not just for now, but the long term, our team continues to execute and deliver against the things we can control and both of these things were deeply considered in our updated guidance. And this gives us confidence that continued recovery through the back half of the year is going to happen. And we see a path to end 2020 at 4% to 5% organic growth, at 4% to 5% we've been talking about without the need for any material benefit from clearing the deferred patient queue. And I got to say, given where we started just a few years ago, and with COVID in between, with very flat to negative growth with consistent share losses as a company. I for one, is super proud of the team for putting ZB in this position. And I look forward to not just talking about it, but delivering it for you our customers and our patients. Okay. With that, we'll go ahead and end the call, and we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating in today's conference call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. For this morning's call, I'm going to discuss our Q2 results, walk through the updates we've made to our full year 2021 financial guidance and provide color around our current expectations for the third and fourth quarter. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter 2021 and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. Also, I'll provide constant currency revenue growth versus 2019 as we think that is a more relevant comparison for this quarter. Net sales in the second quarter were $2.027 billion, a reported increase of 65.3% and an increase of 60.7% on a constant currency basis versus the same period in 2020. When compared to the second quarter of 2019, net sales were flat on a constant currency basis, and we did not have a material impact from selling days. Overall, consolidated and regional results were slightly better than the expectations we provided on our last quarterly call, with growth versus 2019 in the Americas and Asia-Pacific and sequential improvement in EMEA. For the quarter, the Americas increased 68.3% or up 1.9% versus 2019. We continue to see variability by country within the region with the U.S. growing 66.2% or 3.3% versus 2019. EMEA grew 80.5% or down 7.3% versus 2019, with continued COVID pressure being a factor. We did see improvement in EMEA as we moved through the quarter, and we expect that trend to continue through the back half of this year. Lastly, Asia-Pacific grew 24.4% or 2.8% versus 2019 in spite of some unexpected headwinds. While the region has been largely stable in recent quarters, it was impacted late in the second quarter by channel inventory contraction in our knee and hip categories within China. in advance of the rollout of volume-based procurement or VBP. In addition, we saw a resurgence and increase of COVID-19 in a number of markets, including Japan. Despite these headwinds, the region continued to post growth. Turning to our business categories. The global knee business increased 72.2% or down 6.3% versus 2019. In the U.S., knees increased 77% or was flat versus 2019. While we are seeing sequential improvement in the recovery of procedural volumes in large joints, the path back to normalized market growth is taking a bit longer than most expected. Still, we continue to be encouraged by the team's execution and ongoing strong momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee. Our global hip business increased 39.9% or down 2.8% versus 2019. In the U.S., hip grew 46.6% or up 3.1% versus 2019. Strong demand and favorable feedback continues for the Avenir Complete Hip, which continued adoption for both gold and platinum accounts. The sports, extremities and trauma category increased 53% or up 10.8% versus 2019, driven by solid growth in sports medicine, CMFT and upper extremities. We continue to see strong surgeon registrations of the Signature One surgical planning system for shoulder procedures. Our dental and spine category grew 69.4% or up 0.8% versus '19, fueled by recovery in dental. New products and better commercial execution drove growth in the quarter with strong contributions from implants and digital solutions in our dental business. Finally, our other category grew 105.9% or up 7.5% versus '19. This reflects the ongoing demand for ROSA Robotics and strong capital purchases in the quarter. We saw improvements both sequentially versus Q2 2020 in units sold as well as increased revenues from software due to the launch of our partial knee application. Moving on to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.67. Our reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $1 in the second quarter of 2020. The increase in year-over-year GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue, offset by normalized spending levels and IPRD investments within the quarter. In addition, the second quarter of 2020 had some onetime GAAP charges that did not repeat. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.90 was significantly higher than the prior year, driven as expected by the recovery of elective procedures since the pandemic trough in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted gross margin was 71.7% and in line with expectations. Our adjusted operating expenses of $923 million stepped up sequentially versus the first quarter due to higher variable selling expenses related to higher sales and increased discretionary spending to support investments in commercial infrastructure and innovation through R&D. Improved revenue performance and stable gross margins more than offset higher spending to drive 26.2% operating margins, a slight improvement over the first quarter of this year. The adjusted tax rate of 16.5% in the quarter was in line with our expectations. Turning to cash and liquidity. For the quarter, operating cash flows were $453.9 million, and free cash flow was robust at $358.7 million, and we ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of just over $1 billion. We continue to make good progress on deleveraging the balance sheet and expect to make another $300 million in debt repayments in the third quarter.  Moving to our financial guidance. As noted in this morning's press release, we have updated our full year 2021 outlook. We are tightening our guidance range to better reflect our year-to-date performance and a more informed view of the potential impact of COVID. There are some key assumptions that underpin our 2021 financial guidance. We assume no worsening of elective procedure trends due to COVID and that procedure volume recovery continues in the second half of the year, but recovery may not be linear by region and/or by product category. We also expect to see seasonality impact to the third and fourth quarter as we have observed in prior years. With the narrowing of our guidance range, we are now expecting reported revenue growth to be 14.5% to 16.5% versus 2020, with the impact of foreign currency unchanged at about 150 basis points of a tailwind for the full year. On a constant currency basis, compared to 2019, we expect Q3 to grow sequentially over Q2 and for that improvement to continue in the fourth quarter. Turning to the P&L. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share is now in the range of $7.65 to $7.95, and we have narrowed our adjusted operating margin projection to be 26.5% to 27% for the full year. Our updated EPS guidance reflects our performance to date, our expectation of improved growth in the second half and that discretionary operating expenses remained consistent with Q2 through the balance of the year. While operating margins are expected to decline sequentially in the third quarter, in line with lower sales revenue and steady investment levels versus the second quarter, we expect overall second half operating margins to be stronger than first half operating margins. Our adjusted tax rate projection is unchanged at 16% to 16.5% for the full year. And finally, our free cash flow estimates remain in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We will continue to update you on market dynamics and financial expectations as we move through the remainder of the year. To summarize, our performance in Q2 was slightly better than our expectations that we have communicated to you through the second quarter. While we anticipate some ongoing COVID pressure, we have more confidence in the momentum of the recovery and our ability to execute against that backdrop. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bryan. Yes. Stephen, it's Suky. You're right. When we talked about gross margin for 2021, we talked about it being stable to back half of 2020, right? We said it may not be the same for each quarter because there are a lot of variables that impact gross margin. But we said broadly that it would be in line or stable. And that comes off with many years of declining gross margins. So it's a good first step and in actually seeing that stability. First half fortunately was a little bit better than the back half of last year, and so we're encouraged by that. We expect the second half of this year to be pretty much in line with the second half of last year, so very consistent with how we've previously guided. When you average those two together, the first half of this year being a little stronger in the second half being in line, that would suggest that the full year should be slightly better than what we saw in the back half of last year. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing there. I do want to just thank and recognize the supply chain team as well as the commercial team for a lot of great efforts on our cost down initiatives, looking more strategically at P&L and really looking for opportunities to become more efficient in our cost of goods just overall. So seeing some good progress so far. So we're encouraged, and that's how we thought about it, and that's what's baked into our guidance moving forward. Yes, absolutely. So my comments earlier in the call were really versus 2019. And so that's kind of where I'll play for this answer. We do expect to see seasonality on an absolute basis, Q3 generally tends to be lower in absolute sales other than Q4, and we expect that to play through for the second half of this year as well. We do expect half of this year as well. We do expect versus '19, where Q2 was about flat, as we mentioned earlier for the third quarter to step up. And as you suggested, that is a little bit better than what we've seen underpins the continued recovery, which ultimately underpins our guide for the back half of the year. And then again, for that to step up again sequentially in Q4, again, all versus 2019. So that's how we currently see it. And again, it's pretty much based on that continued recovery that we've already seen in Q2. What we've seen early on in Q3, we're not going to talk about individual or specific months as we move through the rest of this year. But so far, what we've seen in July underpins and supports what we've provided earlier today. Yes, sure. Thanks, Bryan. Yes, as we noted, Asia-Pacific sales were impacted in the quarter really by two things. One is the VBP impact that we talked about, which was essentially some distributors taking some inventory contraction ahead of VBP. And the second was we did see surges late in the second quarter in some of our larger markets like Japan and Australia and New Zealand that also slowed some of our growth down. And that hit pretty much across both of those VBP as well as slowdowns in our recon business. But it was encouraging that despite those headwinds that we were able to manage through that and actually grow the region a little bit ahead of expectation. And we would expect that growth to continue in the back half of this year. Regarding China VBP, for competitive reasons, we're not going to size that. It was a contributor. We're not the only contributor in that performance in Asia-Pacific, as I mentioned. I think the important thing is how do we think about this going forward? We've looked at VBP and done a number of scenarios based on what we know at this time. Again, the final rules, pricing and volumes aren't expected to be issued for let's call it another few months, but that timing has been shifting around, so it could continue to shift. But based on what we know today, we don't expect there to be a material impact from inventory change going forward. And that's what's represented in our guidance moving forward. But again, we're going to learn a lot more about VBP over the coming months, and we'll update you as we learn more. But again, it was great to see that Asia-Pacific did grow through that. And I would say also, fundamentally within China, we're seeing very strong demand. And so obviously, that was the first market to be impacted by COVID-19, and it was the first market to recover, and we continue to see good strength and progression in that market. And as you know, we're a leader within China and expect to maintain that leadership position as we move forward. Yes, absolutely. So we continue to build out, I think, an attractive pipeline of potential tuck-in targets. Very consistent with what Bryan said earlier about things that are mission-centric where we have the right to win, strategically makes sense, financially are strong and have a low level of synergy disruption and very consistent with sort of the deals we did at the back end of 2020, which so far through the integration process, we're very pleased with how those are progressing. So we're going to continue to look at opportunities very similar to those. And the good thing is our firepower continues to build. And with the recovery of the pandemic, we're seeing our EBITDA improved significantly. We've turned the corner on the second quarter of 2020, which was a cliff for us, as you know, a trough, if you will, on EBITDA. And with a rolling 12-month EBITDA number as we sunset the second quarter of 2020, we're seeing a pretty big step up in our EBITDA number and a nice improvement in our overall leverage ratio. When you combine that with the debt paydown we've done so far, the debt paydown we're committing to in the back half of this year, and the over $1 billion on the balance sheet, we feel we're in a stronger position than we have been for the last 15 months to And so I feel really good about where we are and how we're moving forward on that. I would also say, another big component of that is our spin transaction. We're really pleased with how the team has been progressing on that. We've made significant progress with our tax private letter ruling, great progress with our carve-out financials and our 10x, which we hope to file in the not-too-distant future with the SEC on a private basis. Good progress from BofA in formulating this go-forward strategy and building out his team. So just overall, really, really impressed with how the team has handled this in the backdrop of also integrating those transactions we did at the back end of last year. So that muscle, that capability that we've been building over the last couple of years is really playing out to our benefit right now."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "All right. Great. Thanks, Carrie, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our call this morning. As we're all aware, obviously, given the news recently, COVID is still very much with us, and we're watching it very closely, as you can imagine. But given that, even we've seen some real progress since our last call, and I think that's obvious to everybody. The world has not returned to normalcy yet, but travel is returning. We have more team members in our offices, and I am personally looking forward to attending the AAOS meeting in about a month in San Diego. So really looking forward to that meeting. We have a lot of great technology that we're going to be able to showcase there and just really happy it's going to be a person again, finally. I want to thank, in that same vein, thank our team again for their dedication to safety, and really just across the board, their commitment to making all of our ZB manufacturing facilities and offices as safe as we possibly can. You, our team members are the driving force for this progress that we've seen in our own facilities and certainly in our communities as well. Also, I want to say that I hope in our investor community that you're continuing to stay safe and have been hopefully able to travel over the last few months to see family and friends. This is an opportunity for us to take advantage of some travel as we begin to turn to more of a normal environment, of course, not there yet, and we know this isn't happening consistently anyway in all regions. But overall, we are encouraged and we're doing our part to keep this moving forward. And every single day, we are supporting our customers and patients that they serve. We're doing this safely, obviously, but this is a big focus for us as a mission-driven organization to be there for our customers so they can complete the procedures that they have, and we can make sure that the patients receive the care that they deserve. And with that, I think it's a good lead into our Q2 call. Today, I'm just going to spend here in the beginning, just a few minutes on a couple of quick remarks, and then I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who's going to get right into a deeper view of our Q2 results. And I think most importantly, our 2021 guidance view on a go-forward basis. And then I'll come back to close out the call with some updates on our active portfolio management and product and pipeline highlights. I'll wait to do that after he provides the guidance information. So just to set him up a little bit, overall, let me just say that our performance in the quarter improved meaningfully from the first quarter of this year, and that was pretty much across all regions and product categories. And as recovery from the global pandemic continued to take hold, we saw that recovery in our procedure is also moving in the right direction. While we certainly anticipate some ongoing COVID pressure, we currently think it's going to be manageable by hospitals, and we expect that the recovery will continue to build sequentially throughout the second half of 2021. Again, not out of the wood yet, but we do believe, thanks to the hospital's ability to better manage these COVID patients and the vaccine rollout continuing, we believe it will be manageable through the back half of the year, again, moving in the right direction. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Suky for our financial update, and then I'll be back with you in a few minutes to close out the call before the Q&A. All right. Thanks, Suky. And I'm going to now just hit three topics before we move to Q&A. First, I want to talk about execution in some of the product and pipeline highlights that we have under that category; second, I'm going to talk about our progress against active portfolio management, which is a big effort for us, obviously; and then third is innovation. And inside of that innovation, how we believe we're going to be able to drive attractive long-term growth that ultimately will deliver value to you, our shareholders. So let's start with our team's execution. And I've said this before, and I'll continue to say it, that the things that ZB was able to directly control over the past year, 1.5 years, the team -- they've executed against it, they delivered against it. And I'm very proud of the team for doing that during a time of significant turbulence around them. And in Q2, in the recent weeks, we've hit key milestones with our ZB products and our solutions. ROSA for Partial Knee was approved back in April, as we've talked about before. And our first patient surgery was actually performed early in the quarter, and we've continued to see good traction with that technology so far and great feedback so far. And it's important for us because partial knees, I think most of you know, is a market where ZB has a sizable market share position. So we're very excited about the possibilities here, not just from a revenue standpoint, but also the potential impact for patients in the surgery area. And then if I just look at ROSA overall, we did see another strong quarter in Q2 of market demand and traction with ROSA total knee as well with placement momentum broadly continuing across the world, not just in the U.S. but internationally as well. And that's important. We want to see strength in the U.S., but we want to see that OUS, and we did get to see that kind of mix again in Q2. We also saw capital expenses for our customers being much stronger in Q2 and as a result of that, we saw a shift back to upfront sales of ROSA. So more of those happened in Q2 than what we would typically see. And again, that just speaks to the strength of capital budgets and people's desire to acquire in that way. But what is clear is that there's a real focus for hospitals to be bringing in robotic systems for their ORs whether they buy them outright or they get them through other arrangements. Either way, that momentum, that demand is very real. And ROSA continues to be a cornerstone, one of the key ones, of our ZB Edge suite of connected solutions. And our forward-looking robotics pipeline is going to be robust as a result of that because that's a big part of our strategy. So again, a lot of enthusiasm on what that will mean in coming years in terms of expansion of indications. and overall robotics penetration for ZB. Also in the quarter, we saw a revision continue its very strong momentum. Again, this is a great tip of the spear product for us, where we can go in and get competitive conversions and revision but also use those competitive conversions for access to the typical total knee as well for that surgeon. So very exciting, not just on the revision side but also opening the door to a much larger opportunity to get their typical knee conversion as well. We're also excited about adding another key variable to our ZB Edge portfolio of connected technologies, and that is our Persona iQ, which will be the first and only smart implant on the market. And we certainly still have to get FDA approval on that. We're working diligently with them to help with any information they need to move that forward, and we're certainly hoping to receive approval in the relatively short term. But ultimately, again, that time line is up to the FDA. And it's important for us because it takes the Persona implant, which is that known and trusted design in an implant and it combines it with Canary Medical's tibial extension, which has the sensor technology in it. And the combination of those 2 things will now inside the body, give us an opportunity to measure the range of motion of that patient, step count, walking speed and other mobility metrics that we believe are going to be indicators of post-surgery progress. So again, helping us close the loop in those connected technologies that we have in Zedge -- So more to come when we hear back from the FDA. But once we do get that approval, we would look to limited launch the technology for a quarter or two and then post that time frame, move into full launch. Okay. So let's move to my second topic that is on active portfolio management and our efforts around active portfolio management. We have the ZB portfolio management strategy in place. We have the right process in place, and we have definitely built our capabilities to move this forward over the last 1.5 years to 2 years. So we're excited about this phase of the organization. And we're focused, as we said before, on mission-centric M&A that is WAMGR-accretive. So in other words, weighted average market growth accretive to the organization. And you've seen us move this forward already with the selective tuck-in acquisitions that we did late last year that really illustrate our strategy at work. These are smaller deals, again, tuck-in size deals that were designed to fill portfolio gaps and better position us as an organization in high-growth, high-priority markets like sports medicine, ASC and sternal closure where we truly do believe we have a right to win in attractive markets with strong profitability. And of course, there's the planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental businesses that is fully underway and on track. We continue to be encouraged by the energy and the momentum around NewCo. As CEO of Vafa Jamali, builds out his team and refines his corporate strategy, and we believe creates two independent and even stronger companies that is going to maximize value for not just our customers, but also for you, our shareholders. All right. And that brings me to the last topic that we have before we move to the Q&A, and that's going to be around innovation. And really inside of innovation, how we see our ability to drive attractive long-term growth that will ultimately deliver value to all of our stakeholders, including you, obviously, our shareholders. We are focused on evolving ZB from what I would define as a metal and plastic provider of implants into a leading med tech innovator. And we have a lot of shots on goal across a number of programs to do this, including a number of robotics launches over the near term, smart implants that we have today, but also the technology road map that we have in smart implants. New functionality with mymobility and really just the broader ZB edge ecosystem of those connected technologies that are going to help us drive mix benefit and share of wallet benefit, but also competitive conversions. And I've mentioned before, more than 70% of our new product development investment is directed towards ZB edge and those connected technologies inside of ZB edge. And our exclusive partnership with Apple continues to be productive and collaborative. And we forged several other tech alliances that we know are going to drive future innovation that will benefit patients. And I believe this fundamental shift is coming for ZB and for our core markets with technology advancements, potentially changing the care paradigm for patients in the future, and that's really what our focus is. So the momentum is real on the innovation front. And we think it will ultimately allow us to drive long-term growth that is very attractive to us and to you. And most importantly, it also gives ZB the chance to really change the lives of patients around the world. All right. Let me close by saying that I continue to be highly confident in the ZB team and our business momentum. While there continues to be uncertainty due to the global pandemic that we cannot control, I truly believe that we are ready and well positioned for success. And our strategy is absolutely working. The transformation of our business is well underway, and I'm excited about the value we can drive for our shareholders on a go-forward basis. Now I also want to make sure that I take the time to thank the entire ZB team. Your dedication to safety is critical and your focus on delivering on our mission is unmatched and you do it daily. I remain incredibly proud of what we're accomplishing and what we're accomplishing together.  And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Keri for our Q&A session. Keri? Yes. No problem, Josh. Let me start maybe with the second part of your question because I would say beyond sensors, just what we define as ZB edge, which is the interconnected technologies that actually do full data for the patient journey. We really do believe that those technologies, including robotics, sensors in the body, mymobility, OrthoIntel, so on and so forth, will absolutely bend the curve when it comes to growth rate in knees and hips in other areas as well because we would proliferate those beyond just knees and hips. So just I do believe that, that technology, which is being absorbed by the folks in orthopedics right now does provide us an opportunity to enhance our growth rate as an organization for two reasons: one, because I do believe that we can get that share of wallet benefit or mix benefit for procedure; and two, I really do believe it sets us up to take share from the competition because it's unique to us. So yes, on the second question, I see that as being able to enhance our growth rate. When I think about the share, I'm pretty focused on this, as you would imagine. This is something that in a turbulent market, we got to pay attention to it. And when I think about the last five quarters that we've seen we just had abnormally large spreads between the top and the bottom player in large joints. This speaks to just a very turbulent market that we're experiencing because of COVID. And inside of this, I'm ultra focused on share gains or losses because it's the very thing that would tell us whether we're performing well versus our competition because the market itself is difficult to understand. And I'm focused on this in regular times, but I'm ultra focused on it during turbulent times. And that said, in a normal market, I try not to get too excited or depleted based on any individual quarter performance. There's just too many variables inside of an individual quarter, particularly now. But what I do is to take a look at a rolling four quarters, and that's the way we do it every time we see results out. When I think about the rolling four quarters, particularly prior to Q2, we definitely took share in our large joint market. We didn't beat every competitor every quarter, but every quarter over the four quarters preceding Q2, we were ahead of market in both knees and hips. And that obviously gives us confidence as we move forward. So I really try to look at it with the data that's provided from the major companies that is public to all of us, and I just track that over a four quarter rolling period to determine whether we are we're not taking share. And I do believe that even though it's been positive for us over those five quarters, I do believe the technology that we're launching is going to enhance that going forward. Yes. So maybe I'll start with the ROSA throughput. And as you probably remember, we spent a lot of time thinking about the design characteristics of ROSA is one of the primary things we want to focus on is to make sure that we did not disrupt the surgical flow and certainly did not want to add time to the surgical procedure. And that has benefited us. There's no question. I mean, to me, it wouldn't matter whether we're in a COVID environment or a non-COVID environment. That is something that our surgeons are pursuing. And they very much appreciate the fact that it's not disrupting their flow, and it's not dramatically increasing any the times to do procedures. So that is a benefit for us for sure. And again, I don't think it really matters whether you're in a COVID environment or not, that's just a benefit. One of the things relative to share gains that you talked about and our view on backlog, I don't know that our outlook and what we've described is really any different than anyone else who plays in large joints like us with such a significant share position. It seems pretty consistent with -- to me anyway. If I think about the deferred patients, I'd just say that like most people at this point, that just becomes more challenging now as time continues to be added to the equation. It's just unprecedented right now that what we're dealing with, just given how long this has gone on. And there are just too many variables in my view, just to really size this appropriately, and I think anyone would probably say this now. But that said, we still believe that there's been no structural shift in the disease state. That's what we've been saying all along. And as a result of that, there's got to be a sizable deferred patient population out there. And when we originally analyzed what we thought would happen with that deferred population, we looked at Q3 of last year. And we assume that when -- based on what we saw in Q3, that when the vaccine was available, you would have a pretty significant return of deferred patients relatively quickly. And again, that's what we saw in parts of Q3 last year when the virus was subsiding. So we just assumed that would happen this year. Now fast forward today, the vaccine is here, and we've got more current data and more data points that are playing out right now. And this doesn't seem to be materializing for anybody. And as such, our current thinking is that deferred patient demand will like become at a more gradual pace and probably be more consistent over a longer-term period of time as a result. I think that's really what we're contemplating by the way. When you think about the midpoint of the revenue range that we just provided, the implied range for the back half of the year, but actually at the top of that range, as I think most people would say, we would need to see a change in the current pacing of that recovery. So in other words, you'd have to see it reflect an increase in deferred patient demand that would also be matched by capacity increases to get to that top end of the range. Sure. So maybe I'll start with the backlog just because it's maybe a simpler answer. I just -- I don't want to try to size it because I think it's gone on too long. And as I said before, I just don't know how you look at this unprecedented situation and try to put a size to it. All I would say is that based on our assumption of no structural change in the disease data, it's got to be big. I'll just -- I'll leave it at that, but I don't want to try to size it. And yes, my current thinking is based on the data points that are available to us, is that it's likely going to be a slower role with that deferred patient group coming in. And that would indicate that this should take a while for us to work through it. That could change at any time, but that's the data points that we have right now. Relative to iQ, I'm glad that you're hearing there's pent-up demand because certainly, we're feeling that as well, and we're getting excited about the launch, the pending launch. And we still obviously cannot market the technology because we don't have FDA approval, but we do believe that, that should be coming soon. And yes, we're excited about it, but you do not actually need to have the full ZB edge infrastructure to take advantage of it. What we would like to see people do is to have mymobility and the Persona iQ combined because we believe the combination of the data collection between those 2 is extremely beneficial, but you don't really even need that. But that would be the goal for us to have that move in concert and be able to have the mymobility in concert with the iQ implant. And we do feel that all the components are there for remote patient monitoring. That's the whole idea behind this. Through mymobility, through iQ is to be able to remote patient monitor. And as a result of that input provided, be able to make decisions on what you do or don't want to do with the patient. And so we believe that we have what would be required for a surgeon to get a reimbursement for RPM. That's the way we're looking at it today. At the end of the day, that's not our decision on whether it happens or not, but we do believe we have the components to make that available to surgeons. Great. So I'll go ahead and start with the ROSA question, and then Suky, I'll pass it off to you. I would just say that, yes, again, we're excited about the traction we're seeing. And as the way I look at this, it's not just the traction that we're seeing with ROSA, I'm excited because there seems to be a significant openness in orthopedics for technology. And that's really important, I think, for two major reasons. One, because I truly do believe the technology is going to change the care paradigm for patients. You're going to get better outcomes as a result of it. And when you have that happening, I believe more patients will enter the funnel because they're going to have higher confidence in the procedure. Remember, there's still 20% of me patients that are not happy with the outcome. And if we can reduce that through technology, I believe you've got patients sitting on the side that would enter the funnel, which is good for everybody, patient included. So I'm very happy to see momentum in ROSA, but I'm even happier to see technology adoption in orthopaedics overall. And when we think about our placements, it's interesting because we focus in two major areas. We spend most of our time in platinum accounts and gold accounts. And both of those would just be very large accounts. The difference between the 2 would be platinum. We have a higher share position. And in gold, we have a lower share position. But those are the two areas that we concentrate mostly with ZB edge and ROSA. Now what's interesting about that though is even when we go into that platinum account, it's very rare that we would have a homogeneous new usage in the account. So even when we get a platinum customer that is using us in knee, to move into ROSA, we typically get competitive conversions to ROSA because you have competitive surgeons in those accounts. And of course, in gold accounts, you get the same thing. So it's almost every placement that we have very rarely otherwise, provides an opportunity for us to get a competitive conversion. And hopefully, that helps with the way we're thinking about ROSA. Suky, let me just add some color to that. I just -- when I think about what Suky just referenced that we've got a pretty significant assumption in our guidance range that says COVID pressure doesn't get worse and the recovery builds through the second half. But we didn't just assume that. There are some proof points that we're seeing, and that might speak to your question, Larry, maybe a little more. There's really kind of two things that we're seeing that would give us confidence in that assumption. And the first one is that even with the recent virus surges that are all over the news, I mean, you can't look at the news any time during the day and not see something about the virus surge, but it doesn't seem to be translating into the same significant revenue disruption that we've seen in the past and certainly not helping us, but it's not translating into that same kind of revenue disruption we've seen in the past. So -- and I believe that's likely because we've got more vaccines out there, obviously, which is impacting the way people feel when they get sick. But also, I just think that hospitals seem to be managing this patient population better. And the second kind of proof point for us when we thought about this as an assumption inside the guidance range, is that the vaccine is available. I mean let's face it. It's available globally anywhere. Anybody who wants it can get it. And I truly do believe even though it stalled a bit in certain parts of the world, I do believe as people get more educated on the Delta variant and the risk associated with that. That may be a good motivator for people to come in that have been waiting to actually get the vaccine. And so those are kind of the proof points that we have that give us confidence that we should see the continued recovery in the back half. Yes. So maybe Suky, why don't I take a shot at the ROSA piece and then I'll pass it to you on VBP impact. But on the ROSA side, I probably don't want to speak specifically to the dollar amount, but obviously, it was a big enough shift for us to talk about it. So that might help you kind of size it in your mind. But what I would tell you is that the way I think about it, is in a normal quarter, what we would typically see is better than 50% of our placements being done through a long-term contract, which is -- we actually like that because it does link us to the customer, and it usually has a competitive pull-through commitment as a result of that arrangement. And in this quarter, we just saw that flip. The higher than 50% move to upfront purchases which is different than what we've seen in the past. What I don't know for sure is that that's going to continue. I mean clearly, there were budgets that were available to people, they flexed those budgets that could continue. Hey, I'm happy either way we place ROSA. We're going to be very flexible with our customers as we go forward and make sure that we're there to support them. Our preference, as I've said in the past, is those long-term contracts, but I'll take an upfront sale as well. So hopefully, that helps on the ROSA side and then Suky, I'll pass it to you on the VBP impact. Yes, that's one of the highlights that I saw in the quarter. Clearly, we are heavily penetrated when we think about our overall revenue in large joints. And as I think everybody has been saying and recognizing large joints have just been a little slower to recover than some of the other categories that we have. And what I've been very happy to see is our strength in said, and we believe that, that's going to continue through the back half of the year, pretty across the board, we showed good performance. Standouts for us were sports, the upper extremities business for sure was solid, trauma was solid for us. And of course, when we look at our CMFT business, our thoracic business was quite strong as well. So we're excited to see that the tuck-in acquisition that we did in CMFT is playing out the way we expected. And then some of the acquisitions that we did that were really just product launches, filling out gaps that we had in sports and also in the ASC, they're also providing benefits right now. And that was the whole idea, right, to fill out that product portfolio. As a result of that, have a fight and have a right to fight and win. And that's playing out right now. So we're feeling good about the strength in S.E.T, probably have more confidence now in that being able to continue on a go-forward basis just given what we have in the portfolio. So very happy to see that strength in S.E.T, and we would expect that to continue. Yes, sure. Really, no dramatic shift. I mean even if I think about U.S., OUS, for instance, we typically do, it's not always exactly this way, but if I look at the number of quarters and just kind of aggregate them, we typically do kind of a 70-30 split U.S., OUS, and that was pretty consistent in this quarter. For us, again, we did see that shift. We believe that it's mainly because people have more budget right now on the capital side. I don't see a shift in our customer base that drove it. So nothing that just stands out for me. It's just more that there was capital available. People like to flex the capital when they have it. And some customers just don't want the long-term contractual obligation, bringing a piece of capital in, they'd just rather buy it. And so I think that's really the corporate, there's nothing beyond that, that I've seen. Now we'll certainly pay attention to it as we go forward, but nothing that was disruptive in any way relative to mix that would have changed that change in placements. Okay. Maybe just quickly here, and I'm going to pass it to Suky because at the end of the day, the M&A strategy is only as good as the funding for it. So obviously, we're both focused on moving this forward. But let me maybe pass it to Suky. He can give you the same color I would on what we're looking for from an M&A standpoint, but also give some color on how we're feeling about our firepower there. So Suky? Yes, just going to say, and you are right, I mean the two areas where we're spending a lot of time right now when we look at targets and are pulling that bolt-in of targets, it would be around enabling technology. A great example of that is what we did with Canary in that relationship that's been created, and that's going to then obviously spin out IQ for knee, but also sensors and other areas and body as well. And then we'd be looking at near adjacencies very much like what you've seen recently from us in sports to ASC, thoracic areas that we feel confident we have a right to win. They are accretive to our overall weighted average market growth and they're profitable. Those are the things that we're looking at today. And as Suky said, the firepower opens up and we'll begin to flex that firepower in those areas. Can you hear me okay? What I would tell you is that the -- that's kind of the beauty of the situation why my confidence is high that we're going to continue to see share gains as we have over the last four quarters spot. That's because we just have so many shots on goal. If you think about knee in particular, we already have ROSA out, and that's getting great traction ROSA Partial was just launched. Persona revision has been out for a while, but the momentum is still very strong. And there is that spin-off opportunity to get the typical total knee. You still have mymobility driving conversions. You haven't even launched Persona iQ yet. So all of these give us an opportunity to create a differentiated environment for our customer and provide the opportunity for not only that share gain or mix gain, but also competitive conversions. And specifically on revision, the reason why I bring it up is typically in somebody's practice, you get about 10% of the overall revenue associated with provision, and it's more like 90% comes from your typical total knee. And many times, we use that revision as a tip of the spear to convert a surgeon that is a competitive surgeon because they love the revision system. And that gets us in the house then to try to pursue that much larger portion of the business, which is your standard knee. So that's why I keep going back to that, we have significant dollars now that we're paying attention to, where we have a revision customer that is using a competitive total knee system, and that gives us a great opportunity and kind of a hunting ground to go to, to get those conversions, but it's certainly not the only area that would give us the opportunity to take share. It's pretty much all of these. It's so hard to say. And that's why I was referencing before when I look at share gain or loss, I never look at and spend too much time on a specific quarter, even when things are typical. But in these crazy times, so many things can impact your performance versus the market. So again, I try not to get too worked up about any given quarter. It could be. I mean the fact is share right now in a specific part of the country for instance, can be meaningful to whether you do better or worse than the competition because that particular state or county could be challenged by COVID more than others. So there's always those things that could impact a specific quarter. That's why when I look at over a four quarter period of time that usually eliminates those hotspots. And that's why I feel more confident and more comfortable with more of that trend, which -- through that trend basically eliminates the noise, I'm going to put air quotes around the \"noise\" of a specific quarter. That's why I still feel confident that we're in good shape that we have all these shots on goal that we should continue to take share. But hey, I'm disappointed. I look at the quarter, I don't really care what the reason is. I want to win every single quarter and this one we didn't. But again, I'll look more at the trend and take more from that on the prediction of share taking in the future. And I would just say in a nutshell, I believe that we're going to be net share takers. Yes, that's a nice thing. I feel really good about our distribution. We're taking advantage of momentum in the ASC. The ASC absolutely loves the fact that we're an efficient robotic system that they're all about efficiency in the ASC. So there's been a benefit for us there for sure. We've seen it in the hospital as well. We've seen it around the globe in Europe, Middle East and Africa as well as Asia-Pacific. So I'm just very pleased with the distribution of the technology across pretty much all sites of care and around the globe. And again, we focus our attention, not always, but let's call it, 80-plus percent of the time in those larger accounts. We're spending our time in those goals and platinum accounts because that's where the big payback is if you're going to spend the time. So again, the distribution has been good. I mean it's been across settings, across region, and we've been focused on the larger accounts for sure. Yes. Thanks, Keri. I wouldn't mind making a couple of comments here. And first of all, thanks for spending time with us here this morning. I just want to say, and I think this is probably obvious to everybody. We certainly have an outsized dependence on elective procedures versus really any of our med tech peers or competitors, particularly large cap companies. We're just an outsized impact there. And as a result, we're very sensitive to COVID ebbs and flows. And we spend a lot of time as you would imagine, analyzing this. And we try to remain prudent in our expectation setting as a result. And because we've seen it. We've seen it first hand that COVID can move our business pretty rapidly given that dependence on electric procedures. And this has been what was reflected in the updated guidance and why our implied range for the back half is still pretty wide because again, there are things that can happen here to move us up or down pretty rapidly because of that dependence on elective procedures. Now relative to Q2 specifically, and Suky said this before, even with some of the unexpected challenges that we had in the quarter, hey, we delivered better-than-expected results, which I think speaks to two very important things. Number one, and this is more short term, but it's important, the recovery from COVID is moving in the right direction. Now it's definitely not happening the way we anticipated. I don't think it is for anybody. But it's moving in the right direction, nonetheless. And the two, and I think this is important, not just for now, but the long term, our team continues to execute and deliver against the things we can control and both of these things were deeply considered in our updated guidance. And this gives us confidence that continued recovery through the back half of the year is going to happen. And we see a path to end 2020 at 4% to 5% organic growth, at 4% to 5% we've been talking about without the need for any material benefit from clearing the deferred patient queue. And I got to say, given where we started just a few years ago, and with COVID in between, with very flat to negative growth with consistent share losses as a company. I for one, is super proud of the team for putting ZB in this position. And I look forward to not just talking about it, but delivering it for you our customers and our patients. Okay. With that, we'll go ahead and end the call, and we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thanks so much."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zimmer Biomet First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 4, 2021. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me virtually today are Bryan Hanson, our President and CEO; and CFO, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q1 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: Alright, great. Thanks, Kerry, and I also want to say thanks to everyone for joining us this morning for our call. And before we actually get into the Q1 numbers and our guidance, I just want to take a second to say that I certainly hope that all of you and your families are continuing to stay safe. We're obviously very pleased to see that so many people now have access -- full access to the COVID-19 vaccinations, and that adoption has been pretty strong so far. Now, of course, we'd like to see this even more broadly on a worldwide basis, but it certainly feels like we're making really important progress toward moving forward. And ultimately, as a result of that moving hopefully on from the pandemic. Now it's not over, and I think all of us realize that. But I for one feel more optimistic than ever that we're coming out, I think on the other side of COVID-19. And with that, much better days ahead. And I guess with that, probably it's a good lead into our Q1 call. Q1 was a stronger quarter than we initially expected, and I'm pretty excited to discuss it with you, Whenever you have a good quarter, obviously earnings calls are a lot more fun. So clearly, we're excited about this one. And I'm going to try to keep my remarks relatively brief, this way I know you're kind of laughing at that because it's not always easy for me to do that.  But I'm going to try to keep it brief, and that'll give Suky an opportunity to walk you through which you're really interested in, which is the financial results for the quarter, and really how that translates into our expectations for the full year 2021 guidance, and I also want to make sure that we leave time for questions, obviously. So I'm just going to stick to really three topics as a result. Number one, I want to talk about the COVID recovery just briefly, and our execution inside of that recovery. And then ZB's ongoing transformation and our progress against that, and that will be the second topic, and the third topic would just be around her long-term growth strategy just reiterating our position there and how we believe that's going to drive value for our shareholders and stakeholders overall. So let's start with navigating COVID and how we're executing inside of it. COVID clearly is not over, just as I stated a minute ago. I'm very confident, we're going to continue to have surprises ahead and disruptions ahead, but based on what we saw at the end of Q1 and what we're seeing in the beginning of Q2 and coupling that with the just the pace of vaccine rollouts right now, we're clearly moving in the right direction. I don't think anybody can argue against that, and it's that shift toward what I would define as more stability. And I know it's on a relative basis when I talk about stability here, but that shift towards more stability really enabled us to give you the full year 2021 financial guidance. Now inside of that guidance, there's going to be some important assumptions about trends and recovery timing that underpin our outlook. And Suky is going to get into more of that in just a few minutes. But overall, it feels good, feels good to have better insight into the broader market and greater confidence in what the rest of 2021 should look like for our business. Now as we start to return to a more normal environment, I'm going to put \"normal environment in air quotes given the situation right now,\u201d but when that happens, we expect that part of what we'll see is a pretty significant tailwind from the backlog of patients that has built up over the last year or more. Now, how fast that happens, how fast we work through that backlog, especially across certain regions is something we're going to have to pay attention to. You\u2019re going to have to watch and track, but we absolutely believe that the vast majority of those patients who put off an elective procedure will come back into the funnel, and that's going to provide a significant tailwind well into 2022, and I for one cannot wait for that tailwind. And I can tell you that ZB is ready for them. They're ready for those patients, and we're ready to be able to help our customers, care for those patients. Speaking of being ready, as I've said to you before, the things that ZB was able to directly control over the past year, I truly think the team has executed against, and I'm very proud of the ZB team for how they stood up and delivered against a backdrop of a whole lot of things that were absolutely out of their control. And I know I talk a lot about the importance of our talent, our mission, our culture here at ZB, and I can say that each word is absolutely critical for us in 2020 and continue to be in 2021 and well beyond. And with that in mind, we've made some additional changes to our leadership team here very recently. We've added a Chief Transformation Officer, again, to help us with all the transformation that we're going to continue to have as an organization. We've appointed a new Chief Human Resource Officer to help us move our talent agenda forward, one of the key areas of focus for me as we move forward as an organization, and promoting Sang Yi to Group President of Asia Pacific, he's now going to have some responsibilities of certain projects, OUS. He brings a real disciplined execution mindset, and he can absolutely help us outside of Asia Pacific. And then expanding Ivan Tornos' role as a Chief Operating Officer with the added leadership now of EMEA, which is a region that he has had deep responsibility for in the past and knows very, very well. And I know it can bring us value in that region. So, I can tell you this continued focus on talent and development is not just contained to the executive ranks. Our entire ZB organization is hyper-focused on our people, on really getting the right team members in the right roles and giving them the tools and support, and really the opportunities to drive their performance, to develop and excel. And it's working, I can tell you, this focus on talent is working and I believe it is going to continue to set us apart from the competition. And in addition to the foundation built by our team members, our mission, our culture, our core business momentum is stronger than ever. The team's execution continues to be on point. Our market momentum is building, our commercial competence is higher than ever. And I can tell right now, we are very excited about the R&D innovation pipeline that we still have coming. That's an important part of our revenue growth.  Throughout Q1, and even in recent weeks, we've hit key milestones with our ZB products and our innovation. The application for partial knee now is available for ROSA, we just approved by the FDA. We've actually already had our first procedure using that application last week with very good results. And this is just the latest addition to our ROSA Robotics program, our platform here. And it's also another launch inside of our ZBEdge suite of integrated digital and robotic technologies. Again, something we truly do believe will set us apart from the competition. So if I just look at ROSA overall in the quarter, we continue to see strong market demand and traction with our ROSA platform. The Q4 performance was fantastic, and that continued right into Q1, both in the U.S. and internationally. And our forward-looking robotics pipeline is very robust. And I can tell you that given our market share in partial knee, the partial application is only going to serve to bolster that going forward. For Persona Revision, another strong performance, this continues to move forward in an amazing way. Q1 was ahead of our expectations. And it is another example of a tip of the spear product that we have that as we make the conversion of revision, we also have the opportunity then to go after the standard new business as well. So again, still exciting opportunities there for revision. And then our Signature ONE planner for shoulder procedures, again demonstrated a very strong sequential growth from Q4. We're actually up 65% over Q4, when we look at registrations, again, that's a pretty significant move. And again, this provides that stickiness with our customers in that procedure. But, it also provides a mixed benefit wherever that pre-surgical planning is used. As we come into Q2 and the rest of 2021, ZB has additional innovation that's coming, and it's pretty exciting innovation with our anticipated launch of Persona-IQ and also ROSA hip later in the year. And I can tell you for Persona-IQ, the initial feedback from evaluating surgeons has been very positive. And I can tell you that they're interested in being able to capture data from inside the body. And this is unique, they've not been able to do this before. And then ultimately, remotely monitoring those data and the hope would be that using that information to change the way that we care for patients. So the excitement around this is very strong from our surgeons. And we can tell that the momentum is going to be strong when we do get regulatory approval. So all that to say the momentum on the innovation front is real here at ZB. This will allow us multiple shots on goal across a number of innovations, again with multiple robotics launches, continuing success with Persona Revision, Persona-IQ, new iterations of mymobility, and just really the broader ZBEdge ecosystem to drive mixed benefit for sure, but also competitive conversions.  And ultimately, we really believe change the way that we care for patients, change the treatment paradigm for patients. That's really what it's about. It's about driving the mission of this organization, truthfully to remove pain from patients around the world and improve the quality of their life. And we truly do believe ZBEdge can help us do that. Okay, so let's move to the second topic that I have for you this morning. And that's the continued transformation of ZB. Now, you've heard me talk about the three phases of transformation. The first was winning the hearts and the minds of the organization of the team members, and really dealing with the execution challenges that we had that we spent a lot of time on in the first year. And then second was moving to that longer-term, firm strategy for the organization that would drive innovation, it really building the structure around that strategy and the operating mechanisms to ensure that we move it forward. And then third, where we are now is the portfolio transformation. And truly, that is where we sit, that is squarely where we are positioned today in Phase 3 of these three phases. And we have the ZB portfolio management strategy and process in place. And we have definitely built out our capabilities to move forward in this space. We're focused on what we're going to define as mission centric M&A, that is whenever repeated, that would absolutely increase our weighted average market growth and does not disrupt our best-in-class margin profile. And as you've seen, we've moved this forward already, with selected tuck-in acquisitions that we did last year. And that really does illustrate the strategy of work. And those deals were smaller, no question they're smaller. And they're relatively immaterial when it comes to the initial revenue that we acquired. But they're absolutely designed to fill portfolio gaps and better position us in high growth markets.  Those high priority markets and sub-markets, where ZB has a path to leadership. And we believe a right to win in markets like sports medicine, ASC, and in the sternal closure market for us. And each of these deals gives us a gap filling, and we believe differentiated product portfolio to drive growth. And that's important to growth, but also to drive additional confidence in our S.E.T. business category. And of course, inside of this active portfolio management phase, there's a planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental business that we discussed back in Q4. That process of creating two independent, even stronger companies is on track. It's early days, obviously, but it is on track. And as you saw from our Q1 results, we do not believe it's causing distraction or disruption in our business. In fact, it's more of the opposite.  We've seen significant energy in the business to kind of jelling in the business, as a new co-team starts to come together, under CEO Vafa Jamali, and they begin to build out their own strategy and their focus. So again, it's early days, but we're very happy with the progress so far of the spin. Alright, so that brings me to my third and final topic this morning that really around our ZB plan to drive long-term growth in ultimately deliver value as a result of that growth. And I can tell you that we remain fully committed and confident in ZB's long-term growth and margin expansion expectations. We've said before, and we'll say it again, that the spin-off of NewCo actually serves to de-risk and potentially accelerate our path to mid-single digit growth, and a best-in-class 30% operating margin profile by the end of 2023. And we're confident that throughout this process, and as we achieve this growth and margin profile, we're also going to have the flexibility to reinvest for growth. And that is a key thing for us. We've got to continue to be disciplined, but ultimately invest for growth in this business. And that's what we will continue to do. Now to get these growth levels and to achieve our top quartile performance in TSR, which I think you probably remember, is one of our strategic pillars. Now we're going to continue to execute in our priority growth areas. And just as a reminder, that means that we expect to drive above market growth sustainably in these, we plan to grow hips consistently at market, but then later this year, above market rates when we launch the ROSA hip application, and we expect to stabilize first and foremost, but also drive focus. And then ultimately, through that focus drive our S.E.T. business at the higher end of market rates there. We're also very focused on driving change for ZB, a real evolution of the company from a metal and plastic provider of implants to a leading med tech innovator. Think of us as a high-tech company that happens to be in med tech. And that's the ZB brand that we're looking for that brand evolution of this company. And I can tell you that already, more than 70% of our product development dollars are being spent in this area, being spent on ZBEdge, that ecosystem of connected technologies. Now, we're always going to be an implant company. And that's the center of the universe for this company. But the ZBEdge ecosystem around it is a way that we can differentiate ourselves versus the competition. And we already have exclusive relationships to help us here. We have relationships already with Apple, and several other tech companies that we truly do believe will drive future innovation that will delight our customers and ultimately benefit patients. And I believe fundamentally, that this shift is coming not only for us, this technology shift not only for us, but for the entire market that we play in them. And I truly do believe that the technology advancements potentially can reshape the growth curve of these markets. I'll say that, again, I think the technology advancements that we're seeing and the value they bring can reshape the growth curve of the markets that we play in. And I think very importantly, also change the care paradigm for our customers and their patients. Alright, let me close by saying that I continue to be highly confident in ZB team, and in our business momentum. I truly believe that we are well-positioned for success and our strategy is working. Our transformation is well underway. And I'm excited about the value that we can drive for our shareholders on a go forward basis, I truly am. And before I hand it off to Suky, I just want to take a minute to say thank you, truly thank you to the entire ZB team. Your vigilance and dedication to our safety protocols over the past year or so has been absolutely critical. And you're focused on our mission, our strategy, and really just how you show up and execute every day, it's unmatched in my view. It truly is unmatched. You are what makes us ZB, I truly believe that. And what makes me confident who really is that we can absolutely continue to deliver on all fronts. Okay, so with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky. He's going to give you more financial details on the quarter and obviously most importantly, our expectations looking forward. Okay, Suky?\nSuky Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan mentioned, our underlying fundamentals remain strong, as does our confidence in our outlook. For this morning's call, I'm going to focus on three topics. First, our Q1 results, including commentary on the impact of COVID, second, how that translates into our full year 2021 financial guidance that we provided this morning, and third, how ZB is positioned for long-term growth in 2022 and beyond. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about Q1, 2021, and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. Net sales in the first quarter were $1.847 billion, reported increase of 3.6% and a constant currency increase of 80 basis points, versus the same period in 2020. It's important to note that we had one fewer selling day resulting in approximately 150 basis point headwind to consolidated revenue growth. Overall, consolidated and regional results were better than our initial expectations, as vaccine adoption continued to ramp up, and pandemic pressure eased across most markets in March versus January and February. First, the Americas increased 1%. We continue to see variability by country, and while the region was in decline for most of the quarter, a sharp increase in U.S. procedures in March drove regional growth. As expected, the EMEA region was hardest hit by COVID-19, decreasing 10.3%, with all sub-markets in decline. While we did see some recovery or decrease in COVID pressure as we move through the quarter, some markets continue to operate under recently enacted restrictions and actions that are limiting the near-term recovery of elective procedures. So, we're continuing to monitor uptake very closely, and expect that recovery in EMEA will lag other regions by one to two quarters. Lastly, Asia Pacific grew 15.5% with solid year-over-year growth across our three largest markets. Overall, we've seen a stabilization around COVID cases and surges in the region, but, we continue to see some significant delays and recovery across India and other smaller markets. Turning to our business performance in Q1. Before jumping in, let me call out that we've updated our product category reporting to provide visibility into NewCo, to align products to categories based on how we internally evaluate performance of those businesses. Also, we have adjusted our historic reporting of revenue for these changes to assist in year-over-year comparisons. First, our ROSA Robotics capital revenue has been moved from the knees category to the other category. And, our disposable revenue associated with robotic knee procedures have been moved from the other category into the knee category. This will allow us to more clearly indicate to investors the growth of our base knee business, and sets us up for reporting once we launch ROSA Hip, which is currently expected in the second-half of 2021. We've also broken out our global spine and dental revenues this quarter in conjunction with NewCo reporting. And as a result, CMFT is now included within S.E.T. The global knee business declined 5.2% versus Q1, 2020, negatively impacted by ongoing pressure from COVID. Inside of that, we continue to see strong momentum from Persona and from ROSA Knee. Our global hip business increased 0.3%. Both the Americas and Asia Pacific continue their growth trends increasing 0.9% and 11.2%, respectively. We continue to see strong demand and favorable feedback on the Avenir Complete Hip with adoption from both gold and platinum accounts. Sports, extremity and trauma increased 7.2%, driven by solid growth in upper extremities, trauma and CMFT. In S.E.T., we continue to see strong surge in registrations of the Signature ONE surgical planning system for soldier procedures. Our dental and spine segment grew 9.6% fuelled by outpaced recovery, especially in dental. New products and better commercial execution also drove growth in the quarter, with strong contributions from implants and digital solutions in our dental business, and from Mobi-C and Tether within spine. Finally, our other category was down 2.5%. As mentioned earlier, this quarter our other category includes the contribution of ROSA Knee capital sales. Moving on to the P&L. In the first quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.94 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.71. Our reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $2.46 last year. The increase in year-over-year GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue in the current period in tandem with prior year goodwill and product liability related charges. On an adjusted basis, EPS was up about 60 basis points, driven by higher revenues with operating margins down slightly compared to 2020, and a higher share count. The adjusted tax rate of 16% in the quarter was better than expected, driven by the realization of excess stock compensation benefits and other smaller discrete items. Turning to cash and liquidity, overall operating cash flows were $247 million and free cash flow totaled $137 million for the first quarter. We paid down an additional $200 million of debt, and ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $724 million. We continue to make good progress with another quarter of delivering the balance sheet. Moving to our full year outlook and financial guidance. While we continue to see pressure due to the global pandemic, vaccine rollout and adoption is approaching meaningful levels, translating into a reduction of infection surges and hospitalizations in most markets. This increased stability gives us greater confidence that we'll return to normalize market growth in our key markets within the year, and also begin to see deferred patients re-enter as an added tailwind. As a result, today, we provided financial guidance based on our latest expectations, and that is underpinned by two key assumptions. First, current vaccine adoption trends continue to strengthen, driving a decrease in the number of new COVID-19 cases through 2021. And second, hospitals increased capacity to work through some portion of patient backlog this year. Against that backdrop, our current expectations for full year 2021 financial results are: reported revenue growth of 14% to 17% versus 2020, with an expected foreign currency exchange tailwind of approximately 150 basis points, adjusted operating profit margins of 26.5% 27.5% and adjusted tax rate of 16% to 16.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.60 to $8, and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Inside of that guidance, we expect to see seasonality in revenues in '21, that begins to resemble pre-COVID cadence. Additionally, our investments in R&D and key commercial initiatives will increase throughout the year. However, we do expect operating margins to improve as we exit 2021, as a result of higher revenues. Net interest expense is expected to step up about 5% versus 2020. And we expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be about 211 million shares for the full year. Of course, we will continue to update you on market dynamics and financial expectations, as we move through the year. Let me now turn to our long-term growth profile. We continue to expect our structural organic revenue growth rate to accelerate to the mid-single digit range, with adjusted operating margins of at least 30%, as we exit 2023. We're confident in our expectations, are a result of the following proof points. First, we have been delivering consistent strong performance versus the market. Second, we have the best new product pipeline in the company's history that will complement an already robust portfolio. And third, our global team members continue to ramp up execution across our strategic priorities. In addition, our previously announced transformation initiatives are progressing well, and the addition of a Chief Transformation Officer has the potential to drive even greater investment opportunity for growth, while maintaining a leading margin profile. To summarize, we are pleased with our better than expected revenue performance in Q1. While we anticipate or prepare for ongoing short-term market uncertainty due to COVID, and remain sensitive to ongoing challenges in a number of markets. From a financial standpoint, we believe the worst of the pandemic is behind us, and look forward to improving results as we execute on our strategy. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Suky. [Operator Instructions] With that operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.\nMike Matson: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, I wanted to start with the backlog that you mentioned. If your sales were down about 12% in 2020, does that equal to 12% around $1 billion for the backlog? And then, where do you think the capacity is among surgeons and hospitals to address that, and how much have you factored into your guidance for this year?\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. So, thanks for the question. So, I would say it's not as simple math as that, but it's pretty close. Because you've got to remember, certain portions of our business would not have patients that would have a disease state that continues to \u2013 [indiscernible] to deal with, and so not all of our revenue then is linked to procedures that have been deferred. But, if I take those that are, and we also have kind of a percentage that we would assume will drop out of the funnel, we still have a very sizable backlog, hundreds of millions of dollars. So maybe not quite the number you're referencing, but the math logic makes sense when you peel out some of those old pieces. Now relative to the cadence or speed at which we're going to digest those patients it is difficult to predict. I mean, we've never experienced anything of this size and magnitude in global impact. And so, I don't know that I have a perfect proxy to determine how quickly we can actually work through that backlog of patients, but my general feeling is easy to look at just historical views of this, although much smaller and different. It's usually 12-months to 18-months, you typically work through a backlog funnel. My guess is it will take at least that long, given the size and the magnitude of the backlog that we're talking about here. And it's going to be different. It's going to be different depending on where you are in the world. Certain places in the world will move that backlog through much faster, and other places will go a lot slower, because the incentives are not there just to be able to digest again that patient flow as quickly. So again, I guess the takeaway is, it should be a very large backlog of patients. That will be pretty substantial dollars for us to be able to take advantage of this tailwind, but the timing of that, the speed at which we work through is, we're just not sure yet.\nMike Matson: Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Thank you, and thanks for taking the questions and I appreciate those prepared remarks, Bryan. There is a lot to unpack in there. But for now, I'll keep my questions a little bit short-term just given how confusing an environment it is. When Stryker reported, they said their hip and knee results for April were kind of already rebounding to up mid-single digits year-over-year. And I'm just curious directionally, if you're seeing sort of a similar thing here in the first part of the second quarter.\nBryan Hanson: Maybe what I'll do is toss that one over to Suky, as he's going to give more color around either guidance or just what we're seeing going forward. So, Suky, do you want to take that one?\nSuky Upadhyay: Sure. Hey, Bob, good morning. So, before I get into Q2, I think it's important to reflect on Q1 for a moment. Versus 2020, we were up just under 100 basis points versus the prior year, better than our commentary earlier in the quarter where we expected to be down low-to-mid-single digits, and that was really because of the sharp uptake, as I talked about in March, primarily in the U.S., and we saw greater stabilization, faster stabilization in Asia Pacific than we expected. That more than offset a lingering headwind or below expectations for EMEA. Versus 2020, things get a little bit choppy because of the comparisons to prior year and COVID. But if you look at Q1 versus 2019, we were down and that implies about 8%. And as we exited March, we were also down versus 2019. Now, our guidance moving forward when compared to 2019, assumes sequential improvement in growth rate in Q2, Q3, and Q4. So far as we've entered into Q2, we've got confidence in that shaping for Q2. We expect to exit the second quarter at about 2019 levels, not for the full quarter but as we exit. And inside of that, we expect Asia Pacific to be above Q2 of 2019, the Americas about flat-to-slightly up, and EMEA continuing to lag. And again, the early start that we've seen so far in the second quarter, gives us positive proof points and confidence that we'll see that sequential step up in the second quarter.\nBob Hopkins: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just for a quick follow-up, can you give us an update on the timing for Persona-iQ and your thoughts there in the U.S., and timing of that approval and launch?\nBryan Hanson: Yeah, sure. We're actually waiting for the FDA approval right now. We're ready to go, obviously we're prepared and ready to launch. We've worked through our commercialization strategy. We did a really nice job about complements team here in getting a third-party engagement to do a pretty comprehensive survey of what we could expect upon commercialization price points, what people are willing to pay for it, and how interested people are for the data capture, and using that data from a remote patient monitoring perspective. So, I think we're really well-prepared for the commercialization. But at the end of the day, you can't do anything until you get the FDA approval. So that's what we're waiting on. And when we get that, we'll be moving forward. My guess is, we'll be able to launch this over the next handful of months. But what I would just emphasize is right, this is a unique launch for us, it's first of its kind. We're going to take our time. We're going to do a limited launch this year. I wouldn't expect material revenue in 2021. The full launch would really come towards the end of 2021 or 2022. But we really want to make sure that we're concentrating on a few customers, going deep with those customers, really understanding data capturing the value that it brings, and then from there going in a more widespread way. Now, if we pick up information quickly and our confidence level grows more quickly than we're expecting, then you could see a difference this year than what I'm predicting right now, but I would think about it as launch this year, obviously, more limited in the way we would do that launch, and then a more aggressive launch, more full launch as we come into 2022.\nBob Hopkins: Great. Thanks, Bryan. Thanks, Suky.\nBryan Hanson: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Wittes with Northland Capital.\nJason Wittes: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe follow-up on Persona-IQ. You actually mentioned, I think, 70% of your innovation pipeline is IT data-driven. I assume Persona-IQ is part of that. I'm just curious in terms of how you see that playing into the marketplace, which is simply share gains, ASP gains. And then related to that, if you look at traditional ortho implants, they take about a year or so before they really impact the revenue line. Is that the kind of time I mean, you kind of laid that timeline out for Persona-IQ, but for some of the other products in the pipe should we expect it takes about a year or so plus gestation, before it really matters, I guess?\nBryan Hanson: For us, I think it matters right out of the gate. To me, I look at this as first of all, absolutely, IQ was part of that stand that I talked about for the ZB ecosystem, right. And I think about ZBEdge, it is a very unique part of it, too. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're an implant company. This is where our bread and butter is for sure. But what we want to do is, we want to elevate beyond that to make sure that we've got an ecosystem around it. And IQ, although extremely important in that is a variable in the overall equation. You still got mymobility that we connect with IQ, which would connect with ROSA. And OrthoIntel is kind of a backdrop to that, and would allow us to be able to collect data on a patient before surgery, interactively post-surgery, and then be able to use those data ultimately to change the way we care for the patient. And that's what's so exciting about it. And so, I think you can't really compare this to a typical knee implant or another implant. And the timeline it might take up to drive real traction or materiality in the market, because it's that unique. It really is a connection point to this broader capability that just does not exist today. So it'll be interesting to see. We've got a pretty, pretty ambitious plan that we have in front of us. And the feedback so far from our valuating surgeons has been very strong.  And just generally in the marketplace, this desire to have data and be able to use the data to have better insights to be able to provide different care, better care is real. And ultimately, what we're so excited about is, as we collect data right out of the gate, we're first to market obviously with a smart implant. But as we collect data, we'll stay out ahead of folks, because that data is really where the magic is.  The implant is interesting. You can listen to it right away. But as you collect a certain amount of data over a period of time, that is actually what provides the insights that are going to matter in the future. And so that gives us an opportunity to stay ahead. So we're very excited about it. It is part of that R&D spend. And we believe that it has the opportunity to have a better ramping curves than in a typical implant, just because it's so unique.\nJason Wittes: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, you guys mentioned in your guidance you prefaced on the fact the idea that the hospitals are going to be able to increase capacity. I guess, have they indicated that months COVID clears, they're ready to basically double up or what have you? And should we assume that is something that really happens towards the late third, fourth quarter in terms of when we might see that bump?\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. So, what I would say is that it really varies depending on which customer you're talking to, what part of the world you're talking to them in. But, Suky maybe you could just provide a little more color on that, just to give a view of how we're thinking about the back half, and our view of how much backlog or not come through in the back half.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yeah. Sure, Bryan. So Q2, again, we expect to be sort of a transitional quarter as we get into the back half of the year, guidance assumes sort of normalized growth rates to historic levels, or '19 levels. Inside of that, we would expect if you looked at sort of the midpoint of our guidance range, that, first of all, we expect COVID to continue to linger in many markets within the second-half of the year. But broadly offsetting that will be some additional capacity that comes through hospital systems and other markets to basically net that out. And that's not uncommon. We saw that in the third quarter of last year, when we look at our results as COVID was stabilizing, you saw hospitals actually increased their capacity to start to bring that backlog through. So again, at the midpoint of our range, we kind of assumed that lingering COVID is out there in certain markets, but that's offset by additional capacity in other markets. So net-net, you're effectively keeping your backlog steady. For the bottom end of our range, we assume that COVID has a bigger impact than that backlog pulled through. And at the upper end of our range, we assume that backlog capacity, more than exceeds the COVID pressure that we expect to see lingering through the second-half of the year. So that's kind of how we see, again, we did see those proof points in the third quarter of last year. And as we expect to see, pull-through through this year and the backlog we expect it to resemble very much what we saw in the third quarter of last year.\nJason Wittes: Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I wanted to go to the spine and the dental segment if possible. I don't think I heard specifics on one versus the other, other than dental kind of led that growth. So Bryan, any way to break that out for us? And then in the cervical disk space, you called out Mobi-C. You are seeing some good traction from a 10% competitor in the space. You got a new two level approval from another competitor. Just what's your outlook on the cervical disc side that would be helpful as well? Thanks.\nBryan Hanson: Yeah, absolutely. I won't give specifics between the two businesses, but just know that both businesses did better than we expected in the quarter. Dental definitely was a stronger of the two. But, we know we're excited about seeing that progress. And it was a big, important quarter for us. Because, remember, this is really the first full quarter, when the organization knew about the spin, really understood the spin. And there was always that risk, obviously, when you announce something like that, there could be some disruption. As you can tell, we're not seeing disruption, if anything, we're actually seeing momentum, which is great. But, I would say on the cervical disk side, I kind of like the idea of others entering the market, because ultimately, I truly do believe that cervical disc is a better way to go in fusion. So if we have more people entering the space talking about it, I think we've got an opportunity to convert more of the businesses out there today in fusion, that's really the target. If we can increase the size of the cervical market, that's a good thing for everybody, good thing for patients, good thing for the overall business. And it's an area we're going to continue to focus on. We're going to make sure that we shore up the customers that we have today, but we're going to continue to sell, and proactively get conversions. Another big opportunity for us in spine is the Tether. I mean, it really is a unique technology for us, it helps scoliosis patients in a way that they cannot get otherwise. And that product is on fire, it's doing a great job. And it's extremely mission-centric to the organization. So that just kind of gives you a general overview. Again, happy with both businesses, dental was stronger in the quarter, but spine did also well.\nJeff Johnson: Fair enough. And then maybe a quick follow up on IQ. Any timelines on actual reimbursement pathway on the monitoring side, just how to think about that getting reimbursed? And is that really going to be the rate limiting factor uptake of that product? Or do you think you could without monitoring reimbursement still sell the IQ product? Thanks.\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. I think it would be nice to have for sure. In reality, it already exists. So, we believe that it will be something that people will be able to access, but we're going to make sure that we get smarter on that topic and help our customers understanding that detail as well. We don't believe it's the requirement though for uptake, I really do believe that people see this as an opportunity to capture the data, and through the data, be able to provide better care. A couple things that I would say about that is, this is just the beginning. We've had a very strong relationship with Canary. It's a relationship that will go on for many, many years. And, it's not just -- it's going to be for hip, it's going to be for shoulder, there's going to be a whole pipeline of technologies that will launch.  This is just the beginning of the beginning, if you will, for sensors. And this idea of a closed loop is being able to have mymobility applications in each of the areas that we play, having smart implants, as well, having ROSA applications, having OrthoIntel that connects the dots across those, that is something that, ZBEdge ecosystem that we're going to use in each of the areas that we play. So we're pretty excited about it. And so, I guess, to sum it up to say, the remote patient monitoring reimbursement is a great thing to have, and I think it's warranted, but it's not the reason why we believe we're going to get up thinking this. We truly do believe it's the data capture and what that data can tell us what's going to drive it.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Congrats on a really nice quarter. Maybe just two quick ones for me. One, you did the restatement, and I think it helps give us a little more clarity. But, there was a bit of movement out of knees and into other and other into knees. I was wondering if you give us any sort of net number on what ROSA was? And then I'll just ask the follow-up as well. Really strong operating income results, but free cash flow and operating cash flow came in a bit lower than I was thinking. Any color there and how that should progress over the year? Thanks.\nBryan Hanson: So Suky, maybe I'll toss that one over to you, and then maybe I'll take the follow-up.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yeah, sure. So on the restatement, first of all, good to talk to you, Robbie. We did do it to provide a little bit more color into what's happening in our base knee business. So you've captured the moving parts correctly. We provide a lot of detail as to what those comparisons are. We're not going to break it down much further. But if there are additional questions after this, our IR team is happy to go through any additional quarterly breakdown. But overall, we think that that's a good move, especially in the backdrop of -- we hope are going to be some expanding and growing indications for ROSA Robotics. So this will help clarify what's actually happening in those underlying indications relative to based business and capital sales. Cash flow, overall, operating cash flows were about $245 million, with free cash flow about $145 million. It was a little bit lower than we had last year. Remember, that first quarter is seasonally lower than other quarters throughout the year. That's primarily because we have a lot of big payments that have in the first quarter around prior year rebates, as well as employee bonuses. There are a number of other things that happened in the first quarter that seasonally make that number lower. In this quarter, two key things. One is we built some excess inventory. So working capital was higher. We do see a market recovery coming later this year. And we want to make sure that we've got a sufficient supply to meet that market demand. So one, we think that that was the right move. Secondly, from a working capital standpoint, receivables were a bit lower than expected. If you remember, we had a pretty low fourth quarter of last year, that income or that cash comes in the first quarter of this year. And because of those lower sales, you're seeing less cash receipts in the first quarter of this year. So again, not out of expectation for us, first quarter is generally lower. And those are some of the moving parts inside and inventory being a piece because we are excited about the recovery that's coming. We will, as you can see from our guidance, expect a step up in overall cash flow through the rest of the year.  I'd say it's more bias towards the second-half of the year. And it's really predicated on two things, higher earnings relative to greater sales in the back half of the year, as we've talked about on our revenue guidance. And the second thing is we would expect to see some improvements in working capital, and bringing those inventories down for the rest of the year, as we worked down that inventory we built this year in anticipation of the market recovery. So hopefully that gives you some additional color on free cash flow.\nRobbie Marcus: Yeah, that's great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you more about your recovery assumptions. I think you mentioned that expected Europe or EMEA to trail in recovery by a couple of quarters. Can you talk about what's informing that view? And when you mentioned, areas taking longer to go through the backlog, is that also Europe/EMEA?\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. Just quickly maybe hit that backlog, recovery and Suky I'll turn it over to you. Yeah, Europe is typically one just based on the healthcare model there, that is a little slower to work through backlogs. The incentives just are not the same as you have in say, the U.S., for instance. So we would expect that to be a little slower in capturing the backlog. But interestingly enough, just because it's running behind probably will have one of the biggest backlogs as a percentage, right, help you look at the overall backlog versus the revenue in that region. And it will likely take the longest to work through just based on what we just said. But Suky, outside of that maybe you can provide more color on our thinking, on why we believe it's going to be lagging behind.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yeah, I think you summarized it well, Bryan as major is the vaccination rates are a bit slower than we had originally expected. Outside of that, outside of a EMEA, we also expect a few markets throughout Latin America, as well as the Asia Pacific to continue to lag, just based on so far the vaccination trend that we've been seeing. Hopefully, the vaccinations begin, the vaccines begin to roll out as robustly as they have in the U.S. globally. But until then, we expect COVID to continue to have a lingering impact on elective procedures.\nMatt Taylor: Great. And then, just wanted to ask on hips. You talked about the ROSA Hip launch later in the year, and that potentially driving you to your goal of above market performance. Can you talk about how sharp you expect the inflection to be and how quickly that can happen? Or any color on how much you think you can outgrow the market once you have that application?\nBryan Hanson: Yeah, thanks. It's interesting, because I referenced that for sure, but actually, if you go back three or four quarters, we probably already in a share taking mode for hip. So just want to make sure that I give a complement to the team there. Having here complete has been a great launch. But just the portfolio that we had before once it gets fly out of the way, that team is really executing well. So I don't want to discount the fact that if you do look at the last three or four quarters, and you look at the other players in the market, we've done well versus the overall market. The confidence though in sustaining that goes up with a ROSA Hip application. So it's more of the confidence in being able to sustain what's already happened and potentially even buoy it further. And our goal here would be able to launch that in the back half. Again, the good news is we have a lot more experience with ROSA now, so our confidence level to go more to almost an immediate full launches there. So you're going to see a lot less time spent in limited launch for either partial or ROSA Hip. And we did -- we are going to a tailwind -- a significant tailwind for some time to come.\nMatt Taylor: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you. Bryan, first question, I think I've heard you mentioned when you're talking about Persona-IQ, how excited you are about the platform there, and that you guys have a multi-year kind of vision strategically with Canary, including into hip and shoulder. My understanding was you were only exclusively for now partnered on knees. But did something change? And are you guys more exclusively focused now in other areas as well?\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. We've done a lot of work with Bill and team over Canary. A great, great team over there, by the way, just really good people. And, yeah, we've solidified a very long-term relationship, basically, perpetual, with proprietary use of the technology in all areas that we play, all areas that we placed. So we are excited to be able to start to work on a very robust pipeline of technology. We've got to look at miniaturization, we've got to look at battery consumption, we've got to look at different form factors that would allow us to use the sensor in other implants. And that's something that we're going to be heavily concentrating on. And so, it's much broader than just knee [ph]. And the two organizations work really well together. And we're excited about the opportunity.\nRichard Newitter: Great, congratulations on that. And then just to follow-up on ROSA Hip. Thanks to the revenue contribution commentary. But just, I guess more philosophically, we've seen robotics uptake in hip your competitor just be slower, is a little bit different type of value proposition. I'm curious, one, are you noticing a mindset shift amongst the customer base with respect to how they're perceiving robotics and hips that would suggest runway for you, as you're launching are different from what maybe your competitor experienced earlier on in there launch of the hip? Or is there something that ROSA does, specifically with robotics that's different there?\nBryan Hanson: I think, it's probably a little bit of both, potentially. I mean, if I think about it, the way I would think about this is in hip, you've got pretty good outcomes right now. It's different than -- you still have most people that get hip procedure that that ultimately feel like, they don't remember having it, because it functions pretty well. Whereas a knee is we always talk about really good 20% of patients that are a little frustrated with the outcome, because they don't get exactly what they expected. But on the hip side, because of that, most surgeons don't want to disrupt their flow, right. They don't want to take more time to do a procedure. And the key things that we do for ROSA perspective is to try to keep that pick -- that surgeon flow, that procedure flow, pretty consistent with what they're used to, and not as a result of that change the amount of time it takes to do a hip procedure. And I think that will be a very important differentiator here. We're not going to change the time needed to do this. A couple other things that will be different about this is it is a painless application of robotics to be a first that we'll see in hip. We don't have to place these pins basically drill into the bone of the leg, to be able to have the robot know where the body is in space. So that's going to be unique to us. The other thing that we're going to focus on here is the application out of the gate is going to be for direct anterior approach, which we know is the fastest growth subcategory hip right now. And it's a challenging procedure, because you don't have great visualization. And it's difficult as a result of that it\u2019s a tough placement right. We're going to make both of those things easier through the ROSA application that we have. So we think the Avenir Complete implants, we think with this ROSA application, not taking more time to be able to do this the, painless application, and being able to allow people to see where they can see and place the cup where they need to place, it is going to be a big deal. That's what we're betting on.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you very much.\nBryan Hanson: Sure.\nKeri Mattox: So Lauren, I think we have time for maybe one or two final questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, guys. Liza Garcia [ph] for Steve Beuchaw. Just a quick one on Signature ONE planner, that was a meaningful sequential uptick. And so, I'm just wondering if you could talk about that, relative to your targets. And then also, if you could speak to ROSA Robotic placements in the quarter? And maybe I know, you said they were strong, but maybe if you could detail a little bit on the geographic trends there that you saw? Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Okay. So maybe I'll start quickly with that. We had a really strong quarter, again, as a reference pretty similar to what we saw in Q4 of last year. And I think, I want to be a little cautious there, because those are two exceptional quarters, and I feel very confident in our pipeline, but I wouldn't necessarily say that that becomes a new trend. And those are great, great quarters, for sure. And again, the pipeline is strong. And I would say that my confidence level is extremely high that the overall placements this year will definitely be more than last year. But I just don't want people to think that those quarters are going to be every quarter from here on out, even though the pipeline is pretty strong at this point. From a geographic mix standpoint, we continue to see really good traction OUS. So I've been very pleased with that, Asia Pacific in particular, but also Europe, Middle East and Africa. So it's been a good distribution around the world of robotic placements, which is one of the key things we wanted to concentrate on. So really strong quarter, the pipeline is very strong, Partial and ROSA Hip are going to help us with that, obviously. And that geographic distribution is a positive for us. On the Signature ONE planner, yeah, I mean, we're excited about it. I mean, until every single procedure uses pre-surgical planning, we're not finished. We truly do believe it is a better way to care for patients. If you don't know what you're getting into relative to the anatomy, how can you be as prepared as you should be to be able to do the procedure. So we want to make it easier for a surgeon to be fully prepared for that patient, knowing what they're going to deal with when they're in surgery. And pre-surgical planning allows that to happen.  And the real benefit to us is that, number one, we feel the mission of the organization because we're going to do a better procedure, we truly believe that. And number two, we get that sidebar benefit of mix that more revenue per procedure, because if you know the anatomy challenging you're going to be dealing with, you're probably going to be able to get augments ahead of time and you're going to be able to ensure that you've got guides that you're going to need, and that's incremental spend, appropriate spend but incremental spend in the procedure. So that's the benefit for us. But just know that, no matter what the increases that we talked about on a quarterly basis, sequentially, until we get 100% penetration, we're absolutely not finished there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks so much.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Liza. And Lauren, I think we have time for one final question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: Good morning, guys. And thanks for squeezing me in here. When I look at the strong first quarter of back into the implied EPS guidance for the rest of the year is generally in line as to your expectations. I believe that like you mentioned 2Q as a transient quarter. So are there any inventory pull forward or regional impact that can have a large impact on 2Q EPS estimates, in which case 2Q EPS comes down, the back half year goes up? Or has history generally modeled in the cadence of 2021 in the right way?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yeah. So, Pito thanks for the question. One of the comments I made earlier in my prepared remarks are about the seasonality and we're going to start to see that resembled war, pre-COVID cadence than what we saw in 2020. So, we would expect, again, Q2 to resemble that Q2, and Q4 tend to be our stronger quarters from a revenue perspective. These tend to see a little bit of seasonality and a dip in the third quarter. And we think that that's the same shaping for this year, perhaps not as pronounced as you would see in a undisturbed pre-COVID environment. But again, beginning to resemble what we experienced in 2019. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more on shaping of our revenue and our P&L cadence as we move through the year.\nPito Chickering: A quick follow-up question for you on ROSA. What's the breakdown between sales and leases in the first quarter? And I assume lease revenues are now located in the other revenues, how much lease revenue was there in the first quarter? Thanks so much.\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. We don't want to provide specific breakdown of that next, but just know that we got multiple ways that you can place robotics and we track based on what the customer demand or need is. And we usually don't give any specific dollars, relative to what we can do with ROSA in a specific quarter. But again, I'll just reiterate the fact that, that it was a positive quarter for us, ROSA. And it was a big benefit. And again, the most important thing isn't really the either the quarter that these are placed, it's the tailwind that they create on a go forward basis, because now you've got an opportunity to be able to build revenue around those robotic systems. And what we do when we place these, you get a commitment to competitive conversions.  But what we're finding is attracting this is that whatever we thought we were going to get, we actually get more. And a lot of times, it's not even in the knee business, it's in other businesses that just kind of come to it. It's almost like a halo effect that occurs in the product category. So, it's always important, we concentrate on obviously what happens in the quarter. But more than anything, it's the annuity value of this that occurs post that placement. And I'm just going to say, maybe with a quick close here, I know we get an alpha spec over to you care of it to close it out, but I just want to make sure that every focus a little bit of attention, I know that there's a ton of focus right now on trying to predict the exact moment that the pandemic is behind us and as a result of that the impact on 2021. And it's important, believe me, we're spending a lot of time on it too. But in reality, that's kind of the short-term thinking right now, in where I'm spending more of my time that organization is spending more of our time is, what does this look like post the pandemic, when it truly is fully behind us. And I kind of think of it in a few ways, number one, right out of the gate, the obvious thing is, we're going to have a backlog of patients that's kind of buoy the market growth for some period of time. I said before, I can't predict the amount of time it is, but there's clearly going to be at least a year or more of this backlog that when the pandemic has gone, it's going to be able to get this kind of extraordinary growth in the marketplace. And that's exciting, although not obviously sustainable beyond that. But there are other things that we're looking at now that truly give us a view that we could potentially reshape the curve of these large joint growth markets. And, big things for us kind of threefold. And the way I think about it, is there's no question is technology revolution is happening in orthopedics. We're going to help drive it, but others are doing it as well. And when that occurs, you're going to get a mixed benefit, you're going to see revenue premiums for every procedure, as this technology is adopted. If you think about that over a five year period of time, as you get higher adoption, that clearly has an opportunity to drive up the growth rates of the market. Now, we got to do it, until you actually get it done, it doesn't happen. But the fact is, we see a pathway through technology advancements to be able to bend the curve of these growth markets. The other thing that does too in my view or could do is that there's some hurdles associated with having this type of an ecosystem, this connected ecosystem. And that's going to create barriers to entry into the space where there really wasn't a lot before. And that gives you the byproduct benefit of longer-term contracts, deeper relationships with your customers, and probably better pricing stability. So those are something else that we're looking at with this technology. And I think the third one, I think, very important as we get better outcomes for patients and the confidence level goes up for these procedures, I truly do believe there are patients on the sidelines today that should be getting the procedure but are fearful of it. When they start to hear better outcomes, more technology, you may see some of those patients out of the funnel. Again, all these things are potential building blocks. As we think about the future of orthopedics, it can make the space much more attractive. We got to deliver on it. They're not guaranteed. We got to make sure that it happens. But that's where we're focusing our attention now to make those things a reality. So, I just want to leave you with those thoughts, because that's an exciting future, I believe for orthopedics. Keri, I'll turn it back to you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Bryan. I'm sure we'll be talking to many of you today for calls and follow-up questions. If you do have them, please don't hesitate to reach out to the IR Team. We're always available over phone or email. Lauren, I'll turn it back over to you to close out.\nOperator: Thank you, again, for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan mentioned, our underlying fundamentals remain strong, as does our confidence in our outlook. For this morning's call, I'm going to focus on three topics. First, our Q1 results, including commentary on the impact of COVID, second, how that translates into our full year 2021 financial guidance that we provided this morning, and third, how ZB is positioned for long-term growth in 2022 and beyond. Moving forward, unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about Q1, 2021, and how it compares to the same period in 2020. And my revenue and P&L commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted basis. Net sales in the first quarter were $1.847 billion, reported increase of 3.6% and a constant currency increase of 80 basis points, versus the same period in 2020. It's important to note that we had one fewer selling day resulting in approximately 150 basis point headwind to consolidated revenue growth. Overall, consolidated and regional results were better than our initial expectations, as vaccine adoption continued to ramp up, and pandemic pressure eased across most markets in March versus January and February. First, the Americas increased 1%. We continue to see variability by country, and while the region was in decline for most of the quarter, a sharp increase in U.S. procedures in March drove regional growth. As expected, the EMEA region was hardest hit by COVID-19, decreasing 10.3%, with all sub-markets in decline. While we did see some recovery or decrease in COVID pressure as we move through the quarter, some markets continue to operate under recently enacted restrictions and actions that are limiting the near-term recovery of elective procedures. So, we're continuing to monitor uptake very closely, and expect that recovery in EMEA will lag other regions by one to two quarters. Lastly, Asia Pacific grew 15.5% with solid year-over-year growth across our three largest markets. Overall, we've seen a stabilization around COVID cases and surges in the region, but, we continue to see some significant delays and recovery across India and other smaller markets. Turning to our business performance in Q1. Before jumping in, let me call out that we've updated our product category reporting to provide visibility into NewCo, to align products to categories based on how we internally evaluate performance of those businesses. Also, we have adjusted our historic reporting of revenue for these changes to assist in year-over-year comparisons. First, our ROSA Robotics capital revenue has been moved from the knees category to the other category. And, our disposable revenue associated with robotic knee procedures have been moved from the other category into the knee category. This will allow us to more clearly indicate to investors the growth of our base knee business, and sets us up for reporting once we launch ROSA Hip, which is currently expected in the second-half of 2021. We've also broken out our global spine and dental revenues this quarter in conjunction with NewCo reporting. And as a result, CMFT is now included within S.E.T. The global knee business declined 5.2% versus Q1, 2020, negatively impacted by ongoing pressure from COVID. Inside of that, we continue to see strong momentum from Persona and from ROSA Knee. Our global hip business increased 0.3%. Both the Americas and Asia Pacific continue their growth trends increasing 0.9% and 11.2%, respectively. We continue to see strong demand and favorable feedback on the Avenir Complete Hip with adoption from both gold and platinum accounts. Sports, extremity and trauma increased 7.2%, driven by solid growth in upper extremities, trauma and CMFT. In S.E.T., we continue to see strong surge in registrations of the Signature ONE surgical planning system for soldier procedures. Our dental and spine segment grew 9.6% fuelled by outpaced recovery, especially in dental. New products and better commercial execution also drove growth in the quarter, with strong contributions from implants and digital solutions in our dental business, and from Mobi-C and Tether within spine. Finally, our other category was down 2.5%. As mentioned earlier, this quarter our other category includes the contribution of ROSA Knee capital sales. Moving on to the P&L. In the first quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.94 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.71. Our reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $2.46 last year. The increase in year-over-year GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue in the current period in tandem with prior year goodwill and product liability related charges. On an adjusted basis, EPS was up about 60 basis points, driven by higher revenues with operating margins down slightly compared to 2020, and a higher share count. The adjusted tax rate of 16% in the quarter was better than expected, driven by the realization of excess stock compensation benefits and other smaller discrete items. Turning to cash and liquidity, overall operating cash flows were $247 million and free cash flow totaled $137 million for the first quarter. We paid down an additional $200 million of debt, and ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $724 million. We continue to make good progress with another quarter of delivering the balance sheet. Moving to our full year outlook and financial guidance. While we continue to see pressure due to the global pandemic, vaccine rollout and adoption is approaching meaningful levels, translating into a reduction of infection surges and hospitalizations in most markets. This increased stability gives us greater confidence that we'll return to normalize market growth in our key markets within the year, and also begin to see deferred patients re-enter as an added tailwind. As a result, today, we provided financial guidance based on our latest expectations, and that is underpinned by two key assumptions. First, current vaccine adoption trends continue to strengthen, driving a decrease in the number of new COVID-19 cases through 2021. And second, hospitals increased capacity to work through some portion of patient backlog this year. Against that backdrop, our current expectations for full year 2021 financial results are: reported revenue growth of 14% to 17% versus 2020, with an expected foreign currency exchange tailwind of approximately 150 basis points, adjusted operating profit margins of 26.5% 27.5% and adjusted tax rate of 16% to 16.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.60 to $8, and free cash flow of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Inside of that guidance, we expect to see seasonality in revenues in '21, that begins to resemble pre-COVID cadence. Additionally, our investments in R&D and key commercial initiatives will increase throughout the year. However, we do expect operating margins to improve as we exit 2021, as a result of higher revenues. Net interest expense is expected to step up about 5% versus 2020. And we expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be about 211 million shares for the full year. Of course, we will continue to update you on market dynamics and financial expectations, as we move through the year. Let me now turn to our long-term growth profile. We continue to expect our structural organic revenue growth rate to accelerate to the mid-single digit range, with adjusted operating margins of at least 30%, as we exit 2023. We're confident in our expectations, are a result of the following proof points. First, we have been delivering consistent strong performance versus the market. Second, we have the best new product pipeline in the company's history that will complement an already robust portfolio. And third, our global team members continue to ramp up execution across our strategic priorities. In addition, our previously announced transformation initiatives are progressing well, and the addition of a Chief Transformation Officer has the potential to drive even greater investment opportunity for growth, while maintaining a leading margin profile. To summarize, we are pleased with our better than expected revenue performance in Q1. While we anticipate or prepare for ongoing short-term market uncertainty due to COVID, and remain sensitive to ongoing challenges in a number of markets. From a financial standpoint, we believe the worst of the pandemic is behind us, and look forward to improving results as we execute on our strategy. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. Sure. Hey, Bob, good morning. So, before I get into Q2, I think it's important to reflect on Q1 for a moment. Versus 2020, we were up just under 100 basis points versus the prior year, better than our commentary earlier in the quarter where we expected to be down low-to-mid-single digits, and that was really because of the sharp uptake, as I talked about in March, primarily in the U.S., and we saw greater stabilization, faster stabilization in Asia Pacific than we expected. That more than offset a lingering headwind or below expectations for EMEA. Versus 2020, things get a little bit choppy because of the comparisons to prior year and COVID. But if you look at Q1 versus 2019, we were down and that implies about 8%. And as we exited March, we were also down versus 2019. Now, our guidance moving forward when compared to 2019, assumes sequential improvement in growth rate in Q2, Q3, and Q4. So far as we've entered into Q2, we've got confidence in that shaping for Q2. We expect to exit the second quarter at about 2019 levels, not for the full quarter but as we exit. And inside of that, we expect Asia Pacific to be above Q2 of 2019, the Americas about flat-to-slightly up, and EMEA continuing to lag. And again, the early start that we've seen so far in the second quarter, gives us positive proof points and confidence that we'll see that sequential step up in the second quarter. Yeah. Sure, Bryan. So Q2, again, we expect to be sort of a transitional quarter as we get into the back half of the year, guidance assumes sort of normalized growth rates to historic levels, or '19 levels. Inside of that, we would expect if you looked at sort of the midpoint of our guidance range, that, first of all, we expect COVID to continue to linger in many markets within the second-half of the year. But broadly offsetting that will be some additional capacity that comes through hospital systems and other markets to basically net that out. And that's not uncommon. We saw that in the third quarter of last year, when we look at our results as COVID was stabilizing, you saw hospitals actually increased their capacity to start to bring that backlog through. So again, at the midpoint of our range, we kind of assumed that lingering COVID is out there in certain markets, but that's offset by additional capacity in other markets. So net-net, you're effectively keeping your backlog steady. For the bottom end of our range, we assume that COVID has a bigger impact than that backlog pulled through. And at the upper end of our range, we assume that backlog capacity, more than exceeds the COVID pressure that we expect to see lingering through the second-half of the year. So that's kind of how we see, again, we did see those proof points in the third quarter of last year. And as we expect to see, pull-through through this year and the backlog we expect it to resemble very much what we saw in the third quarter of last year. Yeah, sure. So on the restatement, first of all, good to talk to you, Robbie. We did do it to provide a little bit more color into what's happening in our base knee business. So you've captured the moving parts correctly. We provide a lot of detail as to what those comparisons are. We're not going to break it down much further. But if there are additional questions after this, our IR team is happy to go through any additional quarterly breakdown. But overall, we think that that's a good move, especially in the backdrop of -- we hope are going to be some expanding and growing indications for ROSA Robotics. So this will help clarify what's actually happening in those underlying indications relative to based business and capital sales. Cash flow, overall, operating cash flows were about $245 million, with free cash flow about $145 million. It was a little bit lower than we had last year. Remember, that first quarter is seasonally lower than other quarters throughout the year. That's primarily because we have a lot of big payments that have in the first quarter around prior year rebates, as well as employee bonuses. There are a number of other things that happened in the first quarter that seasonally make that number lower. In this quarter, two key things. One is we built some excess inventory. So working capital was higher. We do see a market recovery coming later this year. And we want to make sure that we've got a sufficient supply to meet that market demand. So one, we think that that was the right move. Secondly, from a working capital standpoint, receivables were a bit lower than expected. If you remember, we had a pretty low fourth quarter of last year, that income or that cash comes in the first quarter of this year. And because of those lower sales, you're seeing less cash receipts in the first quarter of this year. So again, not out of expectation for us, first quarter is generally lower. And those are some of the moving parts inside and inventory being a piece because we are excited about the recovery that's coming. We will, as you can see from our guidance, expect a step up in overall cash flow through the rest of the year.  I'd say it's more bias towards the second-half of the year. And it's really predicated on two things, higher earnings relative to greater sales in the back half of the year, as we've talked about on our revenue guidance. And the second thing is we would expect to see some improvements in working capital, and bringing those inventories down for the rest of the year, as we worked down that inventory we built this year in anticipation of the market recovery. So hopefully that gives you some additional color on free cash flow. Yeah, I think you summarized it well, Bryan as major is the vaccination rates are a bit slower than we had originally expected. Outside of that, outside of a EMEA, we also expect a few markets throughout Latin America, as well as the Asia Pacific to continue to lag, just based on so far the vaccination trend that we've been seeing. Hopefully, the vaccinations begin, the vaccines begin to roll out as robustly as they have in the U.S. globally. But until then, we expect COVID to continue to have a lingering impact on elective procedures. Yeah. So, Pito thanks for the question. One of the comments I made earlier in my prepared remarks are about the seasonality and we're going to start to see that resembled war, pre-COVID cadence than what we saw in 2020. So, we would expect, again, Q2 to resemble that Q2, and Q4 tend to be our stronger quarters from a revenue perspective. These tend to see a little bit of seasonality and a dip in the third quarter. And we think that that's the same shaping for this year, perhaps not as pronounced as you would see in a undisturbed pre-COVID environment. But again, beginning to resemble what we experienced in 2019. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more on shaping of our revenue and our P&L cadence as we move through the year."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "Alright, great. Thanks, Kerry, and I also want to say thanks to everyone for joining us this morning for our call. And before we actually get into the Q1 numbers and our guidance, I just want to take a second to say that I certainly hope that all of you and your families are continuing to stay safe. We're obviously very pleased to see that so many people now have access -- full access to the COVID-19 vaccinations, and that adoption has been pretty strong so far. Now, of course, we'd like to see this even more broadly on a worldwide basis, but it certainly feels like we're making really important progress toward moving forward. And ultimately, as a result of that moving hopefully on from the pandemic. Now it's not over, and I think all of us realize that. But I for one feel more optimistic than ever that we're coming out, I think on the other side of COVID-19. And with that, much better days ahead. And I guess with that, probably it's a good lead into our Q1 call. Q1 was a stronger quarter than we initially expected, and I'm pretty excited to discuss it with you, Whenever you have a good quarter, obviously earnings calls are a lot more fun. So clearly, we're excited about this one. And I'm going to try to keep my remarks relatively brief, this way I know you're kind of laughing at that because it's not always easy for me to do that.  But I'm going to try to keep it brief, and that'll give Suky an opportunity to walk you through which you're really interested in, which is the financial results for the quarter, and really how that translates into our expectations for the full year 2021 guidance, and I also want to make sure that we leave time for questions, obviously. So I'm just going to stick to really three topics as a result. Number one, I want to talk about the COVID recovery just briefly, and our execution inside of that recovery. And then ZB's ongoing transformation and our progress against that, and that will be the second topic, and the third topic would just be around her long-term growth strategy just reiterating our position there and how we believe that's going to drive value for our shareholders and stakeholders overall. So let's start with navigating COVID and how we're executing inside of it. COVID clearly is not over, just as I stated a minute ago. I'm very confident, we're going to continue to have surprises ahead and disruptions ahead, but based on what we saw at the end of Q1 and what we're seeing in the beginning of Q2 and coupling that with the just the pace of vaccine rollouts right now, we're clearly moving in the right direction. I don't think anybody can argue against that, and it's that shift toward what I would define as more stability. And I know it's on a relative basis when I talk about stability here, but that shift towards more stability really enabled us to give you the full year 2021 financial guidance. Now inside of that guidance, there's going to be some important assumptions about trends and recovery timing that underpin our outlook. And Suky is going to get into more of that in just a few minutes. But overall, it feels good, feels good to have better insight into the broader market and greater confidence in what the rest of 2021 should look like for our business. Now as we start to return to a more normal environment, I'm going to put \"normal environment in air quotes given the situation right now,\u201d but when that happens, we expect that part of what we'll see is a pretty significant tailwind from the backlog of patients that has built up over the last year or more. Now, how fast that happens, how fast we work through that backlog, especially across certain regions is something we're going to have to pay attention to. You're going to have to watch and track, but we absolutely believe that the vast majority of those patients who put off an elective procedure will come back into the funnel, and that's going to provide a significant tailwind well into 2022, and I for one cannot wait for that tailwind. And I can tell you that ZB is ready for them. They're ready for those patients, and we're ready to be able to help our customers, care for those patients. Speaking of being ready, as I've said to you before, the things that ZB was able to directly control over the past year, I truly think the team has executed against, and I'm very proud of the ZB team for how they stood up and delivered against a backdrop of a whole lot of things that were absolutely out of their control. And I know I talk a lot about the importance of our talent, our mission, our culture here at ZB, and I can say that each word is absolutely critical for us in 2020 and continue to be in 2021 and well beyond. And with that in mind, we've made some additional changes to our leadership team here very recently. We've added a Chief Transformation Officer, again, to help us with all the transformation that we're going to continue to have as an organization. We've appointed a new Chief Human Resource Officer to help us move our talent agenda forward, one of the key areas of focus for me as we move forward as an organization, and promoting Sang Yi to Group President of Asia Pacific, he's now going to have some responsibilities of certain projects, OUS. He brings a real disciplined execution mindset, and he can absolutely help us outside of Asia Pacific. And then expanding Ivan Tornos' role as a Chief Operating Officer with the added leadership now of EMEA, which is a region that he has had deep responsibility for in the past and knows very, very well. And I know it can bring us value in that region. So, I can tell you this continued focus on talent and development is not just contained to the executive ranks. Our entire ZB organization is hyper-focused on our people, on really getting the right team members in the right roles and giving them the tools and support, and really the opportunities to drive their performance, to develop and excel. And it's working, I can tell you, this focus on talent is working and I believe it is going to continue to set us apart from the competition. And in addition to the foundation built by our team members, our mission, our culture, our core business momentum is stronger than ever. The team's execution continues to be on point. Our market momentum is building, our commercial competence is higher than ever. And I can tell right now, we are very excited about the R&D innovation pipeline that we still have coming. That's an important part of our revenue growth.  Throughout Q1, and even in recent weeks, we've hit key milestones with our ZB products and our innovation. The application for partial knee now is available for ROSA, we just approved by the FDA. We've actually already had our first procedure using that application last week with very good results. And this is just the latest addition to our ROSA Robotics program, our platform here. And it's also another launch inside of our ZBEdge suite of integrated digital and robotic technologies. Again, something we truly do believe will set us apart from the competition. So if I just look at ROSA overall in the quarter, we continue to see strong market demand and traction with our ROSA platform. The Q4 performance was fantastic, and that continued right into Q1, both in the U.S. and internationally. And our forward-looking robotics pipeline is very robust. And I can tell you that given our market share in partial knee, the partial application is only going to serve to bolster that going forward. For Persona Revision, another strong performance, this continues to move forward in an amazing way. Q1 was ahead of our expectations. And it is another example of a tip of the spear product that we have that as we make the conversion of revision, we also have the opportunity then to go after the standard new business as well. So again, still exciting opportunities there for revision. And then our Signature ONE planner for shoulder procedures, again demonstrated a very strong sequential growth from Q4. We're actually up 65% over Q4, when we look at registrations, again, that's a pretty significant move. And again, this provides that stickiness with our customers in that procedure. But, it also provides a mixed benefit wherever that pre-surgical planning is used. As we come into Q2 and the rest of 2021, ZB has additional innovation that's coming, and it's pretty exciting innovation with our anticipated launch of Persona-IQ and also ROSA hip later in the year. And I can tell you for Persona-IQ, the initial feedback from evaluating surgeons has been very positive. And I can tell you that they're interested in being able to capture data from inside the body. And this is unique, they've not been able to do this before. And then ultimately, remotely monitoring those data and the hope would be that using that information to change the way that we care for patients. So the excitement around this is very strong from our surgeons. And we can tell that the momentum is going to be strong when we do get regulatory approval. So all that to say the momentum on the innovation front is real here at ZB. This will allow us multiple shots on goal across a number of innovations, again with multiple robotics launches, continuing success with Persona Revision, Persona-IQ, new iterations of mymobility, and just really the broader ZBEdge ecosystem to drive mixed benefit for sure, but also competitive conversions.  And ultimately, we really believe change the way that we care for patients, change the treatment paradigm for patients. That's really what it's about. It's about driving the mission of this organization, truthfully to remove pain from patients around the world and improve the quality of their life. And we truly do believe ZBEdge can help us do that. Okay, so let's move to the second topic that I have for you this morning. And that's the continued transformation of ZB. Now, you've heard me talk about the three phases of transformation. The first was winning the hearts and the minds of the organization of the team members, and really dealing with the execution challenges that we had that we spent a lot of time on in the first year. And then second was moving to that longer-term, firm strategy for the organization that would drive innovation, it really building the structure around that strategy and the operating mechanisms to ensure that we move it forward. And then third, where we are now is the portfolio transformation. And truly, that is where we sit, that is squarely where we are positioned today in Phase 3 of these three phases. And we have the ZB portfolio management strategy and process in place. And we have definitely built out our capabilities to move forward in this space. We're focused on what we're going to define as mission centric M&A, that is whenever repeated, that would absolutely increase our weighted average market growth and does not disrupt our best-in-class margin profile. And as you've seen, we've moved this forward already, with selected tuck-in acquisitions that we did last year. And that really does illustrate the strategy of work. And those deals were smaller, no question they're smaller. And they're relatively immaterial when it comes to the initial revenue that we acquired. But they're absolutely designed to fill portfolio gaps and better position us in high growth markets.  Those high priority markets and sub-markets, where ZB has a path to leadership. And we believe a right to win in markets like sports medicine, ASC, and in the sternal closure market for us. And each of these deals gives us a gap filling, and we believe differentiated product portfolio to drive growth. And that's important to growth, but also to drive additional confidence in our S.E.T. business category. And of course, inside of this active portfolio management phase, there's a planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental business that we discussed back in Q4. That process of creating two independent, even stronger companies is on track. It's early days, obviously, but it is on track. And as you saw from our Q1 results, we do not believe it's causing distraction or disruption in our business. In fact, it's more of the opposite.  We've seen significant energy in the business to kind of jelling in the business, as a new co-team starts to come together, under CEO Vafa Jamali, and they begin to build out their own strategy and their focus. So again, it's early days, but we're very happy with the progress so far of the spin. Alright, so that brings me to my third and final topic this morning that really around our ZB plan to drive long-term growth in ultimately deliver value as a result of that growth. And I can tell you that we remain fully committed and confident in ZB's long-term growth and margin expansion expectations. We've said before, and we'll say it again, that the spin-off of NewCo actually serves to de-risk and potentially accelerate our path to mid-single digit growth, and a best-in-class 30% operating margin profile by the end of 2023. And we're confident that throughout this process, and as we achieve this growth and margin profile, we're also going to have the flexibility to reinvest for growth. And that is a key thing for us. We've got to continue to be disciplined, but ultimately invest for growth in this business. And that's what we will continue to do. Now to get these growth levels and to achieve our top quartile performance in TSR, which I think you probably remember, is one of our strategic pillars. Now we're going to continue to execute in our priority growth areas. And just as a reminder, that means that we expect to drive above market growth sustainably in these, we plan to grow hips consistently at market, but then later this year, above market rates when we launch the ROSA hip application, and we expect to stabilize first and foremost, but also drive focus. And then ultimately, through that focus drive our S.E.T. business at the higher end of market rates there. We're also very focused on driving change for ZB, a real evolution of the company from a metal and plastic provider of implants to a leading med tech innovator. Think of us as a high-tech company that happens to be in med tech. And that's the ZB brand that we're looking for that brand evolution of this company. And I can tell you that already, more than 70% of our product development dollars are being spent in this area, being spent on ZBEdge, that ecosystem of connected technologies. Now, we're always going to be an implant company. And that's the center of the universe for this company. But the ZBEdge ecosystem around it is a way that we can differentiate ourselves versus the competition. And we already have exclusive relationships to help us here. We have relationships already with Apple, and several other tech companies that we truly do believe will drive future innovation that will delight our customers and ultimately benefit patients. And I believe fundamentally, that this shift is coming not only for us, this technology shift not only for us, but for the entire market that we play in them. And I truly do believe that the technology advancements potentially can reshape the growth curve of these markets. I'll say that, again, I think the technology advancements that we're seeing and the value they bring can reshape the growth curve of the markets that we play in. And I think very importantly, also change the care paradigm for our customers and their patients. Alright, let me close by saying that I continue to be highly confident in ZB team, and in our business momentum. I truly believe that we are well-positioned for success and our strategy is working. Our transformation is well underway. And I'm excited about the value that we can drive for our shareholders on a go forward basis, I truly am. And before I hand it off to Suky, I just want to take a minute to say thank you, truly thank you to the entire ZB team. Your vigilance and dedication to our safety protocols over the past year or so has been absolutely critical. And you're focused on our mission, our strategy, and really just how you show up and execute every day, it's unmatched in my view. It truly is unmatched. You are what makes us ZB, I truly believe that. And what makes me confident who really is that we can absolutely continue to deliver on all fronts. Okay, so with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky. He's going to give you more financial details on the quarter and obviously most importantly, our expectations looking forward. Okay, Suky? Yeah. So, thanks for the question. So, I would say it's not as simple math as that, but it's pretty close. Because you've got to remember, certain portions of our business would not have patients that would have a disease state that continues to \u2013 [indiscernible] to deal with, and so not all of our revenue then is linked to procedures that have been deferred. But, if I take those that are, and we also have kind of a percentage that we would assume will drop out of the funnel, we still have a very sizable backlog, hundreds of millions of dollars. So maybe not quite the number you're referencing, but the math logic makes sense when you peel out some of those old pieces. Now relative to the cadence or speed at which we're going to digest those patients it is difficult to predict. I mean, we've never experienced anything of this size and magnitude in global impact. And so, I don't know that I have a perfect proxy to determine how quickly we can actually work through that backlog of patients, but my general feeling is easy to look at just historical views of this, although much smaller and different. It's usually 12-months to 18-months, you typically work through a backlog funnel. My guess is it will take at least that long, given the size and the magnitude of the backlog that we're talking about here. And it's going to be different. It's going to be different depending on where you are in the world. Certain places in the world will move that backlog through much faster, and other places will go a lot slower, because the incentives are not there just to be able to digest again that patient flow as quickly. So again, I guess the takeaway is, it should be a very large backlog of patients. That will be pretty substantial dollars for us to be able to take advantage of this tailwind, but the timing of that, the speed at which we work through is, we're just not sure yet. Absolutely. Maybe what I'll do is toss that one over to Suky, as he's going to give more color around either guidance or just what we're seeing going forward. So, Suky, do you want to take that one? Yeah, sure. We're actually waiting for the FDA approval right now. We're ready to go, obviously we're prepared and ready to launch. We've worked through our commercialization strategy. We did a really nice job about complements team here in getting a third-party engagement to do a pretty comprehensive survey of what we could expect upon commercialization price points, what people are willing to pay for it, and how interested people are for the data capture, and using that data from a remote patient monitoring perspective. So, I think we're really well-prepared for the commercialization. But at the end of the day, you can't do anything until you get the FDA approval. So that's what we're waiting on. And when we get that, we'll be moving forward. My guess is, we'll be able to launch this over the next handful of months. But what I would just emphasize is right, this is a unique launch for us, it's first of its kind. We're going to take our time. We're going to do a limited launch this year. I wouldn't expect material revenue in 2021. The full launch would really come towards the end of 2021 or 2022. But we really want to make sure that we're concentrating on a few customers, going deep with those customers, really understanding data capturing the value that it brings, and then from there going in a more widespread way. Now, if we pick up information quickly and our confidence level grows more quickly than we're expecting, then you could see a difference this year than what I'm predicting right now, but I would think about it as launch this year, obviously, more limited in the way we would do that launch, and then a more aggressive launch, more full launch as we come into 2022. Yeah. For us, I think it matters right out of the gate. To me, I look at this as first of all, absolutely, IQ was part of that stand that I talked about for the ZB ecosystem, right. And I think about ZBEdge, it is a very unique part of it, too. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're an implant company. This is where our bread and butter is for sure. But what we want to do is, we want to elevate beyond that to make sure that we've got an ecosystem around it. And IQ, although extremely important in that is a variable in the overall equation. You still got mymobility that we connect with IQ, which would connect with ROSA. And OrthoIntel is kind of a backdrop to that, and would allow us to be able to collect data on a patient before surgery, interactively post-surgery, and then be able to use those data ultimately to change the way we care for the patient. And that's what's so exciting about it. And so, I think you can't really compare this to a typical knee implant or another implant. And the timeline it might take up to drive real traction or materiality in the market, because it's that unique. It really is a connection point to this broader capability that just does not exist today. So it'll be interesting to see. We've got a pretty, pretty ambitious plan that we have in front of us. And the feedback so far from our valuating surgeons has been very strong.  And just generally in the marketplace, this desire to have data and be able to use the data to have better insights to be able to provide different care, better care is real. And ultimately, what we're so excited about is, as we collect data right out of the gate, we're first to market obviously with a smart implant. But as we collect data, we'll stay out ahead of folks, because that data is really where the magic is.  The implant is interesting. You can listen to it right away. But as you collect a certain amount of data over a period of time, that is actually what provides the insights that are going to matter in the future. And so that gives us an opportunity to stay ahead. So we're very excited about it. It is part of that R&D spend. And we believe that it has the opportunity to have a better ramping curves than in a typical implant, just because it's so unique. Yeah. So, what I would say is that it really varies depending on which customer you're talking to, what part of the world you're talking to them in. But, Suky maybe you could just provide a little more color on that, just to give a view of how we're thinking about the back half, and our view of how much backlog or not come through in the back half. Yeah, absolutely. I won't give specifics between the two businesses, but just know that both businesses did better than we expected in the quarter. Dental definitely was a stronger of the two. But, we know we're excited about seeing that progress. And it was a big, important quarter for us. Because, remember, this is really the first full quarter, when the organization knew about the spin, really understood the spin. And there was always that risk, obviously, when you announce something like that, there could be some disruption. As you can tell, we're not seeing disruption, if anything, we're actually seeing momentum, which is great. But, I would say on the cervical disk side, I kind of like the idea of others entering the market, because ultimately, I truly do believe that cervical disc is a better way to go in fusion. So if we have more people entering the space talking about it, I think we've got an opportunity to convert more of the businesses out there today in fusion, that's really the target. If we can increase the size of the cervical market, that's a good thing for everybody, good thing for patients, good thing for the overall business. And it's an area we're going to continue to focus on. We're going to make sure that we shore up the customers that we have today, but we're going to continue to sell, and proactively get conversions. Another big opportunity for us in spine is the Tether. I mean, it really is a unique technology for us, it helps scoliosis patients in a way that they cannot get otherwise. And that product is on fire, it's doing a great job. And it's extremely mission-centric to the organization. So that just kind of gives you a general overview. Again, happy with both businesses, dental was stronger in the quarter, but spine did also well. Yeah. I think it would be nice to have for sure. In reality, it already exists. So, we believe that it will be something that people will be able to access, but we're going to make sure that we get smarter on that topic and help our customers understanding that detail as well. We don't believe it's the requirement though for uptake, I really do believe that people see this as an opportunity to capture the data, and through the data, be able to provide better care. A couple things that I would say about that is, this is just the beginning. We've had a very strong relationship with Canary. It's a relationship that will go on for many, many years. And, it's not just -- it's going to be for hip, it's going to be for shoulder, there's going to be a whole pipeline of technologies that will launch.  This is just the beginning of the beginning, if you will, for sensors. And this idea of a closed loop is being able to have mymobility applications in each of the areas that we play, having smart implants, as well, having ROSA applications, having OrthoIntel that connects the dots across those, that is something that, ZBEdge ecosystem that we're going to use in each of the areas that we play. So we're pretty excited about it. And so, I guess, to sum it up to say, the remote patient monitoring reimbursement is a great thing to have, and I think it's warranted, but it's not the reason why we believe we're going to get up thinking this. We truly do believe it's the data capture and what that data can tell us what's going to drive it. Sure. So Suky, maybe I'll toss that one over to you, and then maybe I'll take the follow-up. Yeah. Just quickly maybe hit that backlog, recovery and Suky I'll turn it over to you. Yeah, Europe is typically one just based on the healthcare model there, that is a little slower to work through backlogs. The incentives just are not the same as you have in say, the U.S., for instance. So we would expect that to be a little slower in capturing the backlog. But interestingly enough, just because it's running behind probably will have one of the biggest backlogs as a percentage, right, help you look at the overall backlog versus the revenue in that region. And it will likely take the longest to work through just based on what we just said. But Suky, outside of that maybe you can provide more color on our thinking, on why we believe it's going to be lagging behind. Yeah, thanks. It's interesting, because I referenced that for sure, but actually, if you go back three or four quarters, we probably already in a share taking mode for hip. So just want to make sure that I give a complement to the team there. Having here complete has been a great launch. But just the portfolio that we had before once it gets fly out of the way, that team is really executing well. So I don't want to discount the fact that if you do look at the last three or four quarters, and you look at the other players in the market, we've done well versus the overall market. The confidence though in sustaining that goes up with a ROSA Hip application. So it's more of the confidence in being able to sustain what's already happened and potentially even buoy it further. And our goal here would be able to launch that in the back half. Again, the good news is we have a lot more experience with ROSA now, so our confidence level to go more to almost an immediate full launches there. So you're going to see a lot less time spent in limited launch for either partial or ROSA Hip. And we did -- we are going to a tailwind -- a significant tailwind for some time to come. Yeah. We've done a lot of work with Bill and team over Canary. A great, great team over there, by the way, just really good people. And, yeah, we've solidified a very long-term relationship, basically, perpetual, with proprietary use of the technology in all areas that we play, all areas that we placed. So we are excited to be able to start to work on a very robust pipeline of technology. We've got to look at miniaturization, we've got to look at battery consumption, we've got to look at different form factors that would allow us to use the sensor in other implants. And that's something that we're going to be heavily concentrating on. And so, it's much broader than just knee [ph]. And the two organizations work really well together. And we're excited about the opportunity. I think, it's probably a little bit of both, potentially. I mean, if I think about it, the way I would think about this is in hip, you've got pretty good outcomes right now. It's different than -- you still have most people that get hip procedure that that ultimately feel like, they don't remember having it, because it functions pretty well. Whereas a knee is we always talk about really good 20% of patients that are a little frustrated with the outcome, because they don't get exactly what they expected. But on the hip side, because of that, most surgeons don't want to disrupt their flow, right. They don't want to take more time to do a procedure. And the key things that we do for ROSA perspective is to try to keep that pick -- that surgeon flow, that procedure flow, pretty consistent with what they're used to, and not as a result of that change the amount of time it takes to do a hip procedure. And I think that will be a very important differentiator here. We're not going to change the time needed to do this. A couple other things that will be different about this is it is a painless application of robotics to be a first that we'll see in hip. We don't have to place these pins basically drill into the bone of the leg, to be able to have the robot know where the body is in space. So that's going to be unique to us. The other thing that we're going to focus on here is the application out of the gate is going to be for direct anterior approach, which we know is the fastest growth subcategory hip right now. And it's a challenging procedure, because you don't have great visualization. And it's difficult as a result of that it's a tough placement right. We're going to make both of those things easier through the ROSA application that we have. So we think the Avenir Complete implants, we think with this ROSA application, not taking more time to be able to do this the, painless application, and being able to allow people to see where they can see and place the cup where they need to place, it is going to be a big deal. That's what we're betting on. Sure. Okay. So maybe I'll start quickly with that. We had a really strong quarter, again, as a reference pretty similar to what we saw in Q4 of last year. And I think, I want to be a little cautious there, because those are two exceptional quarters, and I feel very confident in our pipeline, but I wouldn't necessarily say that that becomes a new trend. And those are great, great quarters, for sure. And again, the pipeline is strong. And I would say that my confidence level is extremely high that the overall placements this year will definitely be more than last year. But I just don't want people to think that those quarters are going to be every quarter from here on out, even though the pipeline is pretty strong at this point. From a geographic mix standpoint, we continue to see really good traction OUS. So I've been very pleased with that, Asia Pacific in particular, but also Europe, Middle East and Africa. So it's been a good distribution around the world of robotic placements, which is one of the key things we wanted to concentrate on. So really strong quarter, the pipeline is very strong, Partial and ROSA Hip are going to help us with that, obviously. And that geographic distribution is a positive for us. On the Signature ONE planner, yeah, I mean, we're excited about it. I mean, until every single procedure uses pre-surgical planning, we're not finished. We truly do believe it is a better way to care for patients. If you don't know what you're getting into relative to the anatomy, how can you be as prepared as you should be to be able to do the procedure. So we want to make it easier for a surgeon to be fully prepared for that patient, knowing what they're going to deal with when they're in surgery. And pre-surgical planning allows that to happen.  And the real benefit to us is that, number one, we feel the mission of the organization because we're going to do a better procedure, we truly believe that. And number two, we get that sidebar benefit of mix that more revenue per procedure, because if you know the anatomy challenging you're going to be dealing with, you're probably going to be able to get augments ahead of time and you're going to be able to ensure that you've got guides that you're going to need, and that's incremental spend, appropriate spend but incremental spend in the procedure. So that's the benefit for us. But just know that, no matter what the increases that we talked about on a quarterly basis, sequentially, until we get 100% penetration, we're absolutely not finished there. Yeah. We don't want to provide specific breakdown of that next, but just know that we got multiple ways that you can place robotics and we track based on what the customer demand or need is. And we usually don't give any specific dollars, relative to what we can do with ROSA in a specific quarter. But again, I'll just reiterate the fact that, that it was a positive quarter for us, ROSA. And it was a big benefit. And again, the most important thing isn't really the either the quarter that these are placed, it's the tailwind that they create on a go forward basis, because now you've got an opportunity to be able to build revenue around those robotic systems. And what we do when we place these, you get a commitment to competitive conversions.  But what we're finding is attracting this is that whatever we thought we were going to get, we actually get more. And a lot of times, it's not even in the knee business, it's in other businesses that just kind of come to it. It's almost like a halo effect that occurs in the product category. So, it's always important, we concentrate on obviously what happens in the quarter. But more than anything, it's the annuity value of this that occurs post that placement. And I'm just going to say, maybe with a quick close here, I know we get an alpha spec over to you care of it to close it out, but I just want to make sure that every focus a little bit of attention, I know that there's a ton of focus right now on trying to predict the exact moment that the pandemic is behind us and as a result of that the impact on 2021. And it's important, believe me, we're spending a lot of time on it too. But in reality, that's kind of the short-term thinking right now, in where I'm spending more of my time that organization is spending more of our time is, what does this look like post the pandemic, when it truly is fully behind us. And I kind of think of it in a few ways, number one, right out of the gate, the obvious thing is, we're going to have a backlog of patients that's kind of buoy the market growth for some period of time. I said before, I can't predict the amount of time it is, but there's clearly going to be at least a year or more of this backlog that when the pandemic has gone, it's going to be able to get this kind of extraordinary growth in the marketplace. And that's exciting, although not obviously sustainable beyond that. But there are other things that we're looking at now that truly give us a view that we could potentially reshape the curve of these large joint growth markets. And, big things for us kind of threefold. And the way I think about it, is there's no question is technology revolution is happening in orthopedics. We're going to help drive it, but others are doing it as well. And when that occurs, you're going to get a mixed benefit, you're going to see revenue premiums for every procedure, as this technology is adopted. If you think about that over a five year period of time, as you get higher adoption, that clearly has an opportunity to drive up the growth rates of the market. Now, we got to do it, until you actually get it done, it doesn't happen. But the fact is, we see a pathway through technology advancements to be able to bend the curve of these growth markets. The other thing that does too in my view or could do is that there's some hurdles associated with having this type of an ecosystem, this connected ecosystem. And that's going to create barriers to entry into the space where there really wasn't a lot before. And that gives you the byproduct benefit of longer-term contracts, deeper relationships with your customers, and probably better pricing stability. So those are something else that we're looking at with this technology. And I think the third one, I think, very important as we get better outcomes for patients and the confidence level goes up for these procedures, I truly do believe there are patients on the sidelines today that should be getting the procedure but are fearful of it. When they start to hear better outcomes, more technology, you may see some of those patients out of the funnel. Again, all these things are potential building blocks. As we think about the future of orthopedics, it can make the space much more attractive. We got to deliver on it. They're not guaranteed. We got to make sure that it happens. But that's where we're focusing our attention now to make those things a reality. So, I just want to leave you with those thoughts, because that's an exciting future, I believe for orthopedics. Keri, I'll turn it back to you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Zimmer Biomet fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. If anyone needs assistance at any time during the conference, please press the star followed by the zero. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 3, 2023. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question and answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. If you have a question, please press the star followed by the one on your pushbutton phone. I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you Operator and good morning everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 conference call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; EVP and CFO, Suke Upadhyay, and COO Ivan Tornos. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q4 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: All right, great. Thanks Keri, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning for the call. We\u2019ve really got three sections for the call this morning. First, I\u2019m going to talk briefly about our fourth quarter performance and spend a few minutes on our teams, what I just define as solid execution, as well as our innovation and drivers for continued strong performance. Then for the second section, as usual, Suke will provide more detail on the quarter itself and very importantly our 2023 guidance and expectations. Then of course, we\u2019ll close things out by addressing any questions that you might have. Before we get started, I wanted to take a minute to thank really the ZB team, just the full ZB team not only for their work in making Q4 another successful quarter but also for their resilience. The innovative thinking and dedication to getting the job done throughout all of 2022, even in the face of very real adversity, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that this team is the engine that is driving us forward, so again thank you. I can tell you that I\u2019m very proud to be on this journey with you. Now as we turn to Q4 results, know that each and every one of you made the quarter happen, and I can tell you it was a solid quarter. We again saw better than expected growth driven by continued procedure recovery, strong execution, and a solid momentum with our new innovation, and as expected, we also benefited from some favorable comps in the quarter.  Inside of this, we saw another positive quarter of year-over-year momentum in large joints with our overall global hip and knee business growing more than 8% and 10% on an ex-FX basis, and our overall set category grew in the high single digits driven by strong performance in our business growth drivers, which as we said before, are supports, CMFT, and upper extremities, as well as the expected tailwind from BBP comps in our trauma business. That said, we are clearly seeing overall market stabilization, but our fourth quarter execution and procedure recovery is still set against a macro backdrop that is challenging and fluid. Foreign currency has improved but remains a challenge and supply, inflation and staffing pressures continue. In fourth quarter, our team was once again able to navigate these challenges, flexing what I would just define as a muscle memory that I think, fortunately or unfortunately, is a bit unique to ZB and has served us well over the past year during 2022.  But make no mistake - the challenges are real and they\u2019re ongoing, but regardless of this environment with COVID mainly in the rear view mirror, I have confidence that the ZB team will continue to deliver. Our culture, our strategy, innovation and execution are coalescing right now, driving tangible momentum and importantly belief from the team, and as a result confidence in our business continues to grow. Let me just give a few examples from Q4. In the quarter, we announced the approval of our new cementless knee form factor which is adding to our Persona family and strategically rounding out that portfolio. The first procedures have been completed with this new keel design, and the feedback, as expected, has been very positive. We continue to belief that our cementless knee penetration will grow significantly and that this differentiated, premium product can really accelerate that growth.  It\u2019s early days with full launch planned for the middle of the year, but make no mistake, this is a real growth driver for our knee franchise.  This launch builds on other recent product launches, like hip insights and our Identity shoulder system introductions, bringing now our total to more than 50 new product launches from 2018 through 2022, and importantly the largest majority of these launches came in markets we see growing in the mid single digits or better. That\u2019s really important, being launched in markets that we see growing in the mid single digits or better. This strategic prioritization and output from our innovation pipeline has helped ZB more than double our vitality index over that time, and very importantly increase our revenue in faster growth markets and sub-markets, which of course drives positive increases in our weighted average market growth. That momentum continues. We expect to launch another 40-plus products between now and the end of 2025, once again with the majority of those launches in 4%-plus growth markets. This will drive further increases in our vitality index and weighted average market growth, and most importantly bring real and meaningful innovation to the patients and customers that we serve. So what I know for sure is that our current momentum, very robust new product pipeline, and our strengthening balance sheet focused on accelerating our portfolio transformation positions ZB well for the future, and as a result, I feel increasingly confident about ZB\u2019s ability to transform our business, drive growth, deliver value, and achieve our mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life for people around the world. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Suke for a closer look at Q4 and again our expectations for 2023. Suke?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Thanks and good morning everyone. For today\u2019s call, I\u2019m going to focus on three topics: first, our fourth quarter results; second, how that performance and recent macro trends translate into our 2023 guidance; and third, I\u2019ll provide a brief update on our long term financial priorities.  With that, I\u2019ll turn to the fourth quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter of 2022 and how it compares to the same period in 2021, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted continuing operations basis.  Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.825 billion, an increase of 2.7% on a reported basis and an increase of 8.3% on a constant currency basis. As previously noted, we had a selling day headwind of 150 to 200 basis points that impacted each category at about the same level. U.S. sales grew 6.2%, driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in our knee and hip businesses. In addition, the U.S. business saw strength across our three priority areas within SET. International sales grew 11.1% driven by strong procedure volumes across most markets in EMEA and APAC, in tandem with lighter comps and continued strong commercial execution. EMEA performance was driven by recovery in developed markets and continued strength in emerging markets. APAC was impacted by COVID-19 surges and lockdowns in China that were broadly offset by strength in other markets. Now turning to our business category performance, global knees grew 10.2% with U.S. knees up 10.8% and international knees up 9.3%, with strong performance driven by knee procedure recovery across most regions and an easier comp outside of the U.S. Continued global traction for our Persona knee system, including both Persona primary and revision in the U.S., and continued increase in Rosa procedure penetration and pull through. Global hips grew 8.4% with U.S. hips up 9.5% and international hips up 10.8%, driven by strong international procedure recovery and easier comps outside the U.S., continued traction across hip products including the G7 revision system, and Avenir Complete primary hip, which is focused on the direct anterior surgical approach, and lastly continued solid Rosa pull through in the hip category, especially in the U.S. The sports extremity and trauma category grew 7.6% and was impacted by continued strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine, and upper extremities. SET was also impacted by a comp tailwind from China VBP that was partially offset by reimbursement changes in restorative therapies.  Finally, our other category grew 1.3%.  Moving to the P&L, for the quarter we reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.62 compared to GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2021. The change was driven by higher revenues partially offset by a goodwill impairment in EMEA as a result of macro factors. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.88 represented an increase from $1.79 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted gross margin was 71.7%, bringing full year gross margin to 71.2% or about in line with full year 2021, despite significant headwinds from inflationary pressure. Our adjusted operating expenses were $791 million, an increase versus the prior year due to inflationary pressures in tandem with higher investments into R&D and commercial infrastructure to support new products. For the year, overall opex was flat to 2021 with an increase in R&D and lower SG&A. We remain disciplined in realizing efficiencies while investing in our priority areas and offsetting headwinds. Adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 28.3%, up slightly from the prior year, bringing total year operating margins to 27.3%, ahead of full year 2021 despite macro headwinds.  The adjusted tax rate was 16.9% in the quarter, slightly higher than our expectations due to certain one-time discrete tax items. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 16.5% and in line with our full year guidance. Turning to cash and liquidity, operating cash flows were $244 million and free cash flow totaled $115 million for the quarter, bringing our total free cash flow for the full year to $910 million. We continued to reduce our net debt by approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, excluding the effect of foreign currency, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $375 million. Moving to our financial outlook for 2023, we\u2019ve based our projections in the following key assumptions. We expect to experience procedure cancellations and staffing challenges, but the impact will be less acute than what we experienced in 2022. Supply chain headwinds will continue throughout the year but with improvement in the second half of \u201923. Pricing headwinds are expected to be slightly better than our historic average of 200 to 300 basis points. Inflationary pressure will remain stable to 2022 exit, and an expected adjusted EPS dilution of about $0.05 to $0.10 due to our acquisition of Embody in the first quarter of 2023. Against this backdrop, our expectations for the full year \u201923 financial outlook are reported revenue growth in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% versus 2022, an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 150 basis points resulting in revenue growth of 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.95 to $7.15. Inside of that guidance, at our midpoint we expect adjusted operating profit margins to be flat to slightly up compared to 2022 levels. We also expect net interest and other non-operating expenses will be about $190 million primarily due to higher interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate should be broadly in line with 2022 and total shares outstanding are expected to remain in line with full year 2022 average fully diluted shares outstanding. Finally, we expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $925 million to $1.025 billion.  In terms of cadence through the year, we expect that the constant currency revenue growth rate for the first half will be slightly higher than the growth rate in the second half, and we do expect choppiness by quarter. Q1 is projected to be our highest growth quarter due to easier comps and will be followed by the fourth quarter, driven by improved supply and innovation building throughout the year. Q2 and Q3 will be lighter quarters given tougher comps. Lastly, we don\u2019t expect any material day rate impact of full year results; however, Q1 and Q4 will benefit by about 100 basis points of tailwind that will be offset by headwinds in Q2 and Q3.  In summary, we delivered accelerated growth in 2022 with a margin profile that is better than \u201921 as we overcame headwinds while investing in our priority areas. We navigated a number of macro challenges and delivered on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. As we look forward to 2023, while the environment remains dynamic, we see a path to delivering solid growth and earnings performance with robust free cash flow. To close out, let me make a few comments about our financial priorities moving forward. We\u2019ve made significant progress over the past few years in strengthening our balance sheet through improved financial performance and ongoing reductions in debt. This ultimately provides ZB with greater strategic flexibility as we look to transform our portfolio with a focus on increasing our WAMGR and driving improved long term growth. We will remain committed to our investment-grade rating and will continue to look at ways to accelerate profitable growth with a focus on achieving our mission. I\u2019m so very proud of the ZB team for their perseverance and dedication throughout 2022 and I\u2019m excited about what we can accomplish in 2023.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Keri.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Suke.  Before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: All right, can you hear me okay? \nBryan Hanson: Yes, we can hear you.\nRyan Zimmerman: All right, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, Bryan and Suke. Bryan, maybe starting with guidance, if I think back to third quarter, you were asked whether 4% organic growth was an appropriate way to think about \u201923, and at the time you said \u201923--you know, you didn\u2019t see \u201923 as normal. But then in January, you said we\u2019re in a better place, procedures are kind of normal and we\u2019d expect that to continue in \u201923. So as we sit here today with guidance at, you know, 4% constant currency at the midpoint, just help us understand kind of that shift that\u2019s occurred in the fourth quarter that gives you a more optimistic view of the year ahead. Really, the key to my question is, this 4%, do you view that as a floor, do you view that as realistic or aspirational, and just help us kind of characterize where you\u2019re sitting in guidance and the year ahead.\nBryan Hanson: Got it, thanks for the question, Ryan. Maybe what I\u2019ll do is, Suke, you could provide color around the way we\u2019re thinking about guidance, because there\u2019s a lot that goes into it. We still don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a normal year, obviously - there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes on either side of the equation, but you could walk through those, perhaps, and then I will give you some color around what we\u2019re seeing so far in January and how that\u2019s making us feel as well. But why don\u2019t you go ahead and start?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, so Ryan, thank you for the question. Good to be with everyone. First of all, I\u2019d say we had a really good close to the year. We ended top line, bottom line, and free cash flow at the top end of our third quarter guidance, so a really strong finish. There was a number of variables behind that, but the key one is really about execution, so feel really good about the momentum that we have. As we move into 2023, some of the key variables that underpin our guidance, I talked a little bit about them on our--in the scripted remarks. The first is around stabilization related to case cancellations, staffing shortages and things of that nature. We expect that to continue to improve throughout 2023. We\u2019re not completely at normal markets - there are still some underlying dynamics impacting the overall market, but things are definitely improving and we expect that to continue to work through the rest of this year, so procedure recovery for sure in \u201923.  The other thing we have to think, though, to balance that out is we\u2019re continuing to see supply challenges. We saw those in the fourth quarter. Our supply chain team as well as our commercial teams responded incredibly well to those challenges, but we\u2019re assuming that those supply challenges remain at least through the first half of this year and begin to improve in the second part of this year. But as we put all that together, we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence against our full guidance range. We\u2019re optimistic about where trends are going and, like I said, we\u2019re really excited about where the business is headed. I don\u2019t know, Bryan, if you want to talk a little bit about what we\u2019re seeing so far?\nBryan Hanson: Yes, clearly a lot of variables that are still moving, but if I just think about kind of the here and now and just look at what we\u2019ve already accomplished in January, I\u2019d just say it was a really strong start to the year. Again, we\u2019re still looking at those variables, but when I think about the things that we can control, things around execution or innovation, they\u2019re going in the direction we want. When I think about the things we can\u2019t control, it\u2019s procedural recovery and supply challenges. Those are also coalescing in a nice way, so I guess suffice to say based on those things, the momentum right now, and it\u2019s early days, but the momentum right now in 2023 is feeling really good.  Again, we\u2019ll continue to monitor those other variables, but we feel pretty good about how we\u2019re starting.\nRyan Zimmerman: Very helpful. Then if I could ask a follow-up, Suke, the street\u2019s margin expectations going into today for operating margins were essentially flat, maybe up 10 basis points, so really in line with your guidance. But just maybe walk us through the levers that you think are at your disposal here on the operating margin line that could maybe move that up a little bit higher than where we\u2019re starting today.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, I think one of the key drivers is obviously going to be revenue growth, right, so if we continue to navigate the challenges around supply as we have been and as we saw in the fourth quarter, if we continue to see stabilization in the market and start to trend towards the upper half of the range, clearly that will help drive some margin expansion as we continue to leverage our overall cost base. Beyond that, it\u2019s just the normal block and tackling that this company has gotten accustomed to over the last four or five years. We\u2019re going to continue to drive sourcing improvements around site optimization, six sigma procurement. I\u2019ll tell you, the commercial team has really stepped up. I\u2019ve never seen a focus on mix, on simplification of the supply chain and SKU rationalization, on pricing before in the company\u2019s history, so I think we\u2019ve made really good strides from a commercial perspective, which I think could be some leverage to the potential upside. Then across SG&A, we\u2019re still in the early innings of fully leveraging our shared service operating model, which we started through the pandemic, so I think we have a number of things at our disposal that can help either expand margins or de-risk our margin aspirations in a downturn, so feeling really good about what the overall team has been able to accomplish and where we can go with this.\nKeri Mattox: Ryan, thanks so much for the questions. Katie, can we go to the next one in the queue?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Mike Matson with Needham. \nMike Matson: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.  I guess I\u2019ll start with the recon market. It looks like it grew about 8% in 2022, and this is well above the 3% to 4% that we were seeing prior to COVID. What do you think is driving this above-normal growth? It seems like it\u2019s got to be the COVID backlog, because I don\u2019t think pricing has been all that strong, but maybe you could comment on that, and do you think that this type of high single digit market growth can carry into 2023?\nBryan Hanson: Yes, so I would say that probably the biggest reason that you\u2019re seeing that outsized growth overall, I wouldn\u2019t define it as backlog consumption. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve started to consume the backlog. I would define it more as comps, we just had easier comps. I\u2019d maybe call that procedure recovery versus the prior year, so that to me is not something that\u2019s necessarily sustainable but it was just easier comps, being that we had more pressure last year. Pricing was better, though, across the board, whether it\u2019s our company or other companies. We did a better job in pricing as a group and as a result of that, that buoyed us as well. Suke\u2019s talked before about what our expectations are in pricing as we move into 2023, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get another question around that, so those are probably the two biggest things that wouldn\u2019t be as sustainable. But make no mistake, I feel like the market is strong, and some of the things that we look to that can buoy sustainably the market growth is innovation, and innovation adoption right now in orthopedics is really promising, not just the typical innovation but technology innovation that absolutely can drive the share of wallet or mix benefit you get with that new innovation.\nMike Matson: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a nice finish to the year here.  Suke, FX of negative 1.5%, can you tell us the rate you\u2019re using - that seems a little high, and the EPS flow-through?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, sure Larry. Good to be with you today. You\u2019re right - we pegged FX as a headwind year-over-year at 150 basis points. That\u2019s an improvement from our original commentary back on our third quarter call. Originally, we were thinking 300 basis points, and so we did see some moderation of the dollar at the very back end of 2022 and early part of \u201923, so that drove the improvement. The way to think about it is we use recent rates. We look at the full cadre of all of our currency exposures. One of the things to recall, remember that about 40% of our revenue is foreign currency exposed. Half of that is euro and yen, right, so the other half is a lot of other currencies that you have to take into consideration. When we aggregate all that, we\u2019re at 150 basis points. Hopefully we continue to see things improve throughout this year and things turn favorable, but for right now, that\u2019s our latest estimate. The flow-through on that, we expect it to be about 20% to 30% down to earnings. That\u2019s a little bit less than what we said last year, and as I said last year when we quoted 30%, there are a lot of variables that can affect that but it\u2019s still a reasonable drop-through to historical norms. So again, 150 basis points based on recent rates, euro, yen making up about half of our foreign currency exposure, and the flow-through being about 20% to 30%.\nLarry Biegelsen: That\u2019s helpful, and then on SET, it was about 2% in 2022. Can you help us think about the growth that\u2019s embedded in the 4% constant currency at the midpoint and how you\u2019re thinking about the different sub-segments there? Thanks for taking the question.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, so if we think about overall SET, I think what you\u2019re asking, Larry, is how we view that business in an undisturbed market going forward. Is that kind of what you\u2019re asking?\nLarry Biegelsen: Yes, and certainly for \u201923, Bryan.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, so when we come into 2023, even though it\u2019s not going to be a normal market, we\u2019re still thinking about SET as being able to be a mid single digit grower. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at that. In an undisturbed market, we would think the same thing. Remember in the first half, though, we\u2019re going to be a bit pressured still by the restorative therapies group and that change in reimbursement, but even with that throughout the year, we believe that that segment can grow in the mid single digits. The key drivers for that, because we don\u2019t treat all the businesses the same from an investment standpoint, will be our growth drivers, which would be upper extremities for us, our sports business, and in certain portions of our CMFT business.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Larry. Katie, could we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Travis Steed with Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: Hi, good morning, and congrats on a nice quarter. I wanted to ask about the robotic shoulder opportunity. I think before you\u2019d said you\u2019d be first or second to market. Now that Stryker has given more definitive timelines, I wonder if you can kind of clarify if you\u2019ll be first or second, or some timing there, and how you\u2019re thinking about the opportunity from a mix and share perspective.\nIvan Tornos: Hey Travis, good morning - Ivan here. I don\u2019t know where they are, we don\u2019t pay attention to where competitors are. We pay attention to where we are in the process. I\u2019ll tell you frankly, I\u2019ll be very surprised if we\u2019re not first to market, given where we are in the development cycle. My expectation remains that we\u2019re going to be ahead. The most important part is not just the speed in the actual launch, it\u2019s the quality, the features and benefits that we have in the platform. Given the mix of developers that we have involved in the project, I do think it\u2019s going to be transformational for our platform, so that would be my answer.\nTravis Steed: Okay, and then--that\u2019s fair, and then a quick clarification. On the 3% to 5% constant currency growth, how much of the revenue is coming from Embody in that? Then Bryan, a question for you on M&A. Just kind of curious what your willingness is in 2023 now that markets are a little more diversified beyond electives, or if 2023 is more of a tuck-in year from an M&A perspective. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll just start with the Embody thing. That\u2019s a relatively small acquisition. I would probably think more about that as a product launch, so it\u2019s not overly material but it\u2019s a very attractive subspace of sports. As we\u2019re building our that commercial channel, it\u2019s one of those things you really need in your bag to attract talent to that commercial channel, so it\u2019s important to us but I wouldn\u2019t look at that as a significant or a material impact to the year, only in the sense that we\u2019re going to be able to bring that channel in place and get good momentum in sports overall. From an M&A standpoint, yes, we are clearly in Phase 3 of the transformation of the company, which I\u2019ve clearly talked about looks at portfolio transformation, focused on getting more revenue in faster growth markets in its simplest form, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to concentrate on. The fact is as our balance sheet continues to strengthen, our flexibility here, strategic flexibility goes up, and we will look at acquiring technologies that make sense from a mission standpoint for the company, that we see a path to leadership in, that we think will increase our weighted average market growth because that\u2019s important for sustainability, and we see a path to be able to increase growth rate and EPS. I\u2019ve said before there are three areas that we\u2019ll look at for acquisitions, mainly kind of smaller to midsized deals, but we\u2019d look at things that would enhance our position in recon in those faster growth sub-markets - that could be robotics, data, or the ASC setting. In orthopedic area diversification, that would be in faster growth sub-segments like sports or CMFT or extremities, and then as you said, those things that might be outside of orthopedics that would help us diversify the business away from elective procedures but also in fast growth markets.  All of those things are on the table right now, and again as our balance sheet strengthens, our ability to action that obviously also increases. We\u2019re going to stay disciplined, there\u2019s no question about it, but we are clearly on the hunt for targets that make sense in those ways.\nTravis Steed: Great, thanks for the color.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks for the question, Travis. Katie, we can go to the next question in the queue.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. \nDrew Ranieri: Hi, good morning Bryan and Suke. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Bryan, just to start, a question for you. You\u2019ve talked about your confidence in the business, and I understand that your thinking is this year\u2019s not normal relative to pre-pandemic times, but it\u2019s been a while since you last discussed long term plans. I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the business longer term and your confidence in gross margin expansion opportunities ahead. Just anything that you could help frame investors with in terms of thinking about the business from a margin or growth perspective.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, so maybe I\u2019ll start, and Suke, I\u2019ll pass it to you on the margin side. I would say our team\u2019s confidence is as high as it\u2019s ever been, quite frankly. Just think about that in the short term - it is not a normal environment. There are a lot of challenges that we\u2019re having to deal with from a supply chain standpoint. But I do go back to what I said in the prepared remarks - I have a lot of confidence in this team because of the muscle memory we have over the last five years of dealing with a lot of adversity. So just in this moment of a non-normal environment, I would rather have this team than any other team because I believe they can fight through those challenges, and they\u2019ve proven it. That\u2019s number one. Number two, outside of those challenges, we\u2019re just hitting our stride. From a momentum standpoint, we\u2019ve had a lot of kickoff meetings here recently - I love to go to those meetings. You get a real sense for how people are feeling, just having a conversation with sales reps, that\u2019s where it all starts. The momentum there, the confidence there, the belief there is as good as I\u2019ve ever seen it, so all those things add up to me to say, particularly in a normal environment, we\u2019re in a good place and I feel confident that we can continue to deliver the innovation and drive real revenue growth. I don\u2019t want to give too many views of what the future revenue growth of the company will be, but know this - as we increase the weighted average market growth of the company, as we get to a 4% that\u2019s organic that we can commit to and sustain, that won\u2019t be good enough. We\u2019ll continue to look at portfolio transformation to drive it north of that, but right now I feel really good. I feel really good about the confidence that the team has and I feel really confident about the team\u2019s ability to drive the results that we just guided to in 2023. Maybe you want to talk more about the margin expansion?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, I\u2019ll actually level up from margin expansion and talk a bit more about how we think about it, which is earnings power inside the company. Our goal is to drive a leveraged P&L, right, and what do I mean by that? We\u2019re looking for earnings growing faster than revenue, and as we approach those revenue outlooks that Bryan just talked about, we see a very clear path to being able to do that. Now, margin expansion will be a key building block in that, but it\u2019s not the only one, right? Obviously sales leverage and then our ability to continue to leverage our interest rate, as well as tax, there are a number of levers at our disposal to drive that earnings power higher than revenue.  Inside of that for margin, we continue to have the same variables that I\u2019ve been talking about for quite some time, and the company has continued to show improvement on all those fronts, whether it\u2019s pricing, manufacturing simplification, cost improvement, SG&A improvement - I mean, just look at our SG&A this year, we\u2019ve been flat year-over-year while driving expansion in a number of areas in commercial infrastructure, so we\u2019ve shown that we can do this. I\u2019m confident we can continue moving forward and start to really see that durable revenue expansion that Bryan talked about. I\u2019m very confident we can drive earnings power faster than revenue.\nDrew Ranieri: Great, thanks, and just another question, we had a survey out with hospital CFOs and they kind of pointed to orthopedic robotics being a key capital spending category for this year. Just curious what you\u2019re seeing in the environment in terms of hospital purchases, and it would be great to really hear what you\u2019re seeing or having the most success in Rosa, whether it\u2019s greenfield placements or multi-system orders, hospital versus ASC, and maybe what your share shift has been within Rosa accounts and cementless mix. Thanks for taking the questions.\nIvan Tornos: I\u2019m happy to take that one, Drew. I\u2019ll tell you, Q4 was solid both from a Rosa installation and purchasing standpoint. I\u2019m not aware of any deal that we\u2019ve lost, whether it\u2019s here in the U.S or OUS relative to capital. We also do small capital deals in the surgical business and those were on track as well, so sequentially Q3 to Q4 of 2022 was solid. Because of comps, obviously, it\u2019s a lower number than a year ago, but so far, so good when it comes to capital, so nothing that I\u2019ve seen so far leads me to believe that we\u2019re going to have a challenge when it comes to robotics. \nBryan Hanson: Yes, and I think we do a really nice job of not just getting individual deals but also getting multiple placements in the same account. You do typically have hybrid accounts where you\u2019ve got us in there with robotics and potentially another competitor, but it\u2019s not just greenfield, it is existing accounts where you\u2019ve gotten to the point where you don\u2019t have enough capacity for that robotics system and they want to buy another system, so it\u2019s a combination of those two things.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks for the question, Drew. Katie, can we--oh sorry, the cementless mix, was that part of the question, as a follow-on?\nDrew Ranieri: Yes.\nBryan Hanson: Can you repeat the question? We didn\u2019t catch it, sorry.\nDrew Ranieri: What was your cementless mix in knees?\nIvan Tornos: Yes, I can take that as well. We\u2019ve been in the low teens, as we\u2019ve been disclosing. That\u2019s obviously prior to the launch of Persona OsseoTi, which is now in the market, it\u2019s been around for two weeks. The expectation is that number is going to dramatically increase, and as you know, Drew, in combination with robotics, you\u2019re going to see a collateral effect. You\u2019re going to see increase of cementless mix, you\u2019re going to see an increase of robotics penetration, so we\u2019re already bullish about where we\u2019re going to end at the end of the year. We don\u2019t disclose that externally, but you should expect something fairly aggressive.\nBryan Hanson: Just to make sure no one\u2019s confused, Persona OsseoTi, we\u2019ve not used the name before, but that is the new form factor for cementless for Persona. \nDrew Ranieri: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Drew. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.  I was hoping, Bryan, to ask you--you teed up the question for us on price, and Suke, and just maybe a recap of how you fared in \u201922. I\u2019m not sure if you quantified pricing assumptions and guidance top line for \u201923, but maybe if you could also just directionally help us out, figure out the difference in terms of the pricing environment in the U.S. versus Europe and Asia-Pac.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Sure, I\u2019ll take that. First of all, thanks for the question, Josh. On pricing, we had a really good fourth quarter. If you look at our disclosure, our press release, you\u2019d actually see that pricing is positive in the fourth quarter. Now, I would say on an underlying basis, pricing had erosion of about 100 to 150 basis points. We benefited by some year-over-year comps due to BBP, and we also had some one-time pull adjustments that were favorable in the quarter that drove us to be positive in the fourth quarter. But on an underlying basis, I would still think about it as 100 to 150 basis points erosion, which is still incredibly good versus our historical average of 200 to 300 basis points. We ended the year at about 150 basis points of erosion, again, so a pretty clear step change to where we\u2019ve been historically.  I talked about in my scripted remarks, we expect next year--or this year, I should say, 2023 to be slightly better than that annual average that we had before 2022, so maybe not as good as \u201922 but definitely better than where we\u2019ve historically been. There are a number of drivers inside of that. Some of them are transitional, some are more structural in nature. The ones that I\u2019m more excited about are those structural improvements that we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve made a lot of investments around capabilities, around systems, around analytics. We\u2019ve got better governance, we\u2019ve got better discipline. It\u2019s an area we incent the field force off of now, so there are a host of things that structurally are improving our price performance as we move to 2023, and that\u2019s sticking and part of our guide. If you think about the dynamics between U.S. and EMEA and Asia Pacific, maybe I\u2019ll let Ivan talk a little bit about what he\u2019s seeing.\nIvan Tornos: Thanks Suke. So far, we\u2019re not seeing the performance when it comes to pricing being in a single region. Frankly, 2022, all three regions beat our expectations when it comes to pricing. The most important part, I do think it\u2019s sustainable with the guidance that we\u2019ve given for 2023. The role of innovation also is a critical component of the sustainability of that pricing. As you think about bundle deals, as you think about bringing innovation, that is going to drive mix and in some cases a bit of price performance. \nJosh Jennings: Thanks for that. Maybe just a follow-up. I think we, at least our team has been tracking share for large joints in the United States more effectively than internationally, but maybe you could just help us understand where you think you had success capturing share in knees and hips in Europe and Asia-Pac, and just where that stands and how you\u2019re thinking about share capture in those markets, those international markets in \u201923. Thanks for taking both questions.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, so you know, first of all, I think it\u2019s really important - we never really pay a whole lot of attention to any individual quarter. Obviously this quarter was a pretty strong one for us globally and in the U.S., but we don\u2019t try to over-index on that. We do an eight-quarter trend and we look at how we\u2019re trending versus market, and I even try to stay away from specific competitors but just the overall market growth, looking at the largest players. I would say in that eight-quarter trend, as that continues to roll, we\u2019re seeing good performance versus market in large joints, both hip and knee, probably more in knee than hip, but overall we\u2019re feeling pretty good.  You\u2019ve got to go back to before Q2 2020. As you probably remember, we had 20 straight quarters of being below market in every quarter, so five years below market in large joints, so we definitely have seen a sea change in our ability to perform at or above market in large joints, which as you know is our biggest business. That\u2019s the way we think about it and we break it in a bunch of different ways - year over year, we look at it on a stacked basis, we look at it sequentially, but in all those areas when we look at that eight-quarter trend, we\u2019re feeling good about where we are.\nJosh Jennings: Thanks a lot, appreciate it.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Josh. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great. Congrats on a good quarter. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, in the script you talked about improving supply moving throughout the year, but you also talked about it as benefiting fourth quarter sales. What are the products that are supply limited right now, and how should we think about the potential benefit to sales from improving supply?\nBryan Hanson: Yes, so maybe I\u2019ll start off on a broad-based basis, because there\u2019s really two factors that you talked about, Suke, in being able to drive performance in the fourth quarter. One would be supply challenges alleviating, but also the innovation building, because those are almost two separate things, so we\u2019ll make sure that we talk about both of those, and Ivan, maybe talk about some of the innovation.  For us when we think about the supply challenges, it really comes down to material shortages that we\u2019re seeing, that we think are going to get better as we move in through the year, labor shortages that we think are going to get better as we move in through the year, and then sterilization capacity, which everybody is dealing with right now, that I do believe is going to catch up at some point. That\u2019s why we think supply challenges are going to get better, but it\u2019s pretty broad-based. I can\u2019t look at supply challenges and say it\u2019s just this product or that product because it\u2019s in packaging, it\u2019s in resins. Almost everything that we\u2019re dealing with has some form of supply challenges, like sterilization for instance, so I wouldn\u2019t isolate the supply challenges to a product or product set. It\u2019s just a broad-based pressure that we\u2019re feeling. Outside of that, it\u2019s around innovation that\u2019s going to be building, and maybe you can talk to some of the things you\u2019re excited about there.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, sure. Good to talk to you here today, Robbie. Innovation, as we discussed at JP Morgan earlier in the year, could be a three-hour conversation, so I\u2019m going to try to keep it more or less succinct. But I will tell you, I truly believe today innovation is a key competitive advantage. Two data points right out of the gate that I mentioned, vitality index, the percentage of sales coming from new products has more than doubled over the last two years, and we expect the number to increase dramatically over the strategic horizon. Then the second part, we filed in 2022 the highest number of 510(k)s in the history of the company, and actually we had the largest number of approvals, public information, when it comes to the peer group.  Breaking down innovation into three or four buckets, when it comes to knees, I already mentioned Persona OsseoTi - that is the new cementless form factor, that device that we have here at Zimmer Biomet. The clinical data we have on that product is compelling. We believe it\u2019s highly stable when it comes to the mechanical and biological fixation. It\u2019s extremely versatile - you can all the way to the end of the surgery decide whether you want to go cemented or cementless. It does use the Persona technology, so it\u2019s highly anatomic, you can customize the device to any kind of anatomy. We\u2019ve got the broadest [indiscernible] ranges.  I\u2019m excited with Persona Smart - we don\u2019t talk much about it because we still are in the limited market trials, but I like where it\u2019s going. I like the opportunity that we have with Persona Smart, especially later in the year.  When it comes to hips, in the prepared remarks, Bryan talked about HipInsight is the first and only mixed reality digital surgery platform for hip arthroplasty. This is making procedures faster. This is increasing accuracy in the actual procedure. When you come to the meeting in Vegas at the academy, I think you\u2019ll be impressed. It effectively gives the surgeon X-ray vision over the anatomy of the patient, the instruments, the implants. You\u2019re going to get more accuracy, faster procedures. It is going to be transformational.  I like the momentum we have with both Rosa hips and knees. We have a strong portfolio when it comes to shoulder- let\u2019s talk about Identity, the transformational launch that we did at the end of 2022. That is followed by a cadence of launches on Glenoids, on Signature ONE planning - I could spend an hour on that, and then through organic and inorganic means, I think we have a best-in-class portfolio in sports med. This will be my three minute summary on a lot of things that are happening from an innovation standpoint, but I\u2019ll close it by saying again, I do believe it\u2019s a true competitive advantage for Zimmer Biomet.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, and Robbie, just back to your question around supply chain, our comments on Q4 and then 2023, we did see pressure in the fourth quarter around supply chain. I think you\u2019ve heard us comment on that, and not inconsistent with what you\u2019re hearing around the sector, we expect those challenges to continue into 2023.  The commentary on Q4, just to provide a little color that we think that our group did a really nice job in navigating that. The situation continues to be dynamic into \u201923, but our expectation is that we\u2019re going to continue to navigate that really well.\nRobbie Marcus: Great, and you touched on inorganic, you did Embody in the business line. How should we think about overall inorganic and your view at Zimmer Biomet in \u201923 and beyond, and how should we think about the size of deals you\u2019re looking to do and how fast you\u2019re looking to move to take the inorganic and help expand the WAMGR higher? Thanks a lot.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, we\u2019re ready now. Again, the balance sheet is moving in a place that allows us to have even more strategic flexibility than we\u2019ve had in the past, which is a good thing. As I\u2019ve said, it\u2019s probably more of those smaller to midsized deals that would be a bit closer to the vest for now, in other words closer to the orthopedic space that we are already in, but we\u2019re ready. We\u2019re definitely ready. Now it comes down to opportunistically finding the right target at the right price and the right returns, but we are ready to move into Phase 3 of the transformation for sure.\nKeri Mattox: Robbie, thanks so much for the questions. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. \nJayson Bedford: Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple.  A clarification on the growth cadence in \u201923, I think you said that organic growth would be the highest in the first and fourth quarters, but I think those are your toughest comp quarters, so I\u2019m just wondering why 2Q and 3Q are a bit softer from a relative growth perspective. Is it simply the day rate dynamic?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, let me take that one. You heard us correctly. First half will be stronger than the second half from a growth rate perspective, top line ex-FX. First quarter will be the strongest followed by the fourth quarter, and then the second and third quarter. Let me go into a little bit more detail. On the first quarter, that will be our strongest one primarily due to procedural recovery. Remember, we\u2019re comparing against the first quarter of 2022, which had omicron in it, and therefore you\u2019ve got a nice comp benefit. In the fourth quarter, that\u2019s generally from a seasonality perspective from growth, usually one of our strongest quarters, and we\u2019re assuming a nice benefit from the innovation, the momentum of innovation build throughout the year from new products and execution, so that\u2019s why we characterize that as our second-largest quarter. Then inside of that, the second and third quarter will actually have tougher comps because that\u2019s when we began to see some recovery last year relative to omicron.  The day rate impact, you\u2019re right - we said 100 basis points for each of Q1 and Q4, that\u2019s a tailwind which will be offset by headwinds in Q2 and Q3, so you\u2019ve got it largely right there.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. Maybe just on M&A, the $0.05 to $0.10 dilution tied to the Embody deal is a bit heavier than we expected. Can you just talk about the return profile there and when can this be additive, or at least neutral to earnings? \nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, we would see this as breakeven to positive in the first 24 months, so it\u2019s very attractive from a margin profile, from an earnings accretion profile. As Bryan said, it\u2019s more or less like a product launch right now, but as that begins to ramp up from a revenue standpoint and begins to cover some of the investments we\u2019re making in a very important sector in sports and extremities, we feel good about the return profile. It meets all of our hurdles from an NPV, IRR, ROIC metric perspective, and so again it\u2019s early days but neutral within the first 24 months.\nJayson Bedford: Okay, thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Jayson, thanks for the questions. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Great, thank you for taking the questions. Just wondered if--apologies if I missed it, I wonder if you could give us a little more insight into where you\u2019re at from an inflationary perspective into 2023. I think previously you talked about being at the higher end of the range of 50 to 100 BPs. I just wanted to see if that was the way to think about the inflationary impact in the P&L in \u201923, and then maybe update us on the actual headwinds you did see in 2022.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, so you\u2019re right - we did point to the higher end of our range back in \u201922 of 50 to 100 basis points flowing into \u201923. We\u2019re actually seeing that come through year-over-year as a headwind to gross margin. I could say, though, I\u2019m very pleased with how the commercial and supply chain teams have reacted to that, and we believe we\u2019re going to be in a position to offset all of that and pretty much hold gross margin flat year-over-year That\u2019s coming from a number of variables, but again we\u2019re really proud with what the team\u2019s done to offset that. The impact that we saw in 2022 was, I would say, about 100 basis points as well, and if you actually look at gross margin performance, it was flat to 2021, so again the team did a really nice job in offsetting those headwinds. Once again, we\u2019re demonstrating and showing that we can be disciplined, we can offset these headwinds and help our earnings growth over time.\nKyle Rose: Great, that\u2019s helpful. Then overall in the commercial channel, you talked historically about making investments in specialized sales forces and investing alongside your distributors to support some of the higher growth market segments. Just wondered, can you help us understand how these initiatives are trending, and then any potential updates in where you stand from a distributor versus a direct model across some of those higher growth segments?\nIvan Tornos: Maybe I can take that one, Kyle. First things first, on the three segments we think that are growth drivers: sports med, upper extremities, and CMFT, we have double if not triple the number of people dedicated to these specialties. The sports med expansion is very real now that we have a portfolio, so the number of dedicated specialized people has dramatically increased in these three categories. In tandem, we also increased the number of people that are fully dedicated to the ASC environment, and that\u2019s because these procedures for the most part do take place in that space, but that goes beyond sales reps. It also touches on the contracting arm of the organization. As far as your second question, the percentage of direct and indirect, I don\u2019t think that we disclose that externally. We like where we are, we like the mix that we have of direct and indirect. We just left our sales meeting Denver, we had 2,000 people were there, and I tell you their mood is very solid whether an indirect or direct territory leader. I think people feel it\u2019s a good time to be part of the company, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll break down the percentages externally.\nKyle Rose: Thank you very much.\nKeri Mattox: All right, Kyle, thanks so much for the questions. Katie, I think we have time for may one or two more.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Pasquale with Nephron.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Just a quick one. First, was hoping you could give us an update on the Rosa installed base exiting \u201922.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, I\u2019ll keep it short and sweet here. In any year, we expect to do no less than 300 installations, and we exceeded that expectation across all three regions. As you think about the future, \u201923, \u201924 and whatnot, that\u2019s frankly the point of entry. I would be disappointed, maybe even jobless if we didn\u2019t exceed that number, given the new applications in shoulder, next generation hip, and other technologies coming in, but we\u2019re so far exceeding those expectations.\nChris Pasquale: Okay, and then Bryan, I thought your comment that you had not started to work through the COVID backlog yet was interesting. It certainly felt like the market had some pent-up demand benefit last year, but I understand your point that the comps weren\u2019t exactly normal. My question is if you haven\u2019t started to make progress on the backlog yet, do you think you ever will, and are you assuming any progress on that front in 2023?\nBryan Hanson: That is the question that I think we\u2019re all grappling with. There\u2019s clearly backlog. You might call it longer waiting lists, backlog - you can define it the way you want, but the fact is there\u2019s pent-up demand for these procedures. The rate limiting factor is really capacity at the provider level. You could--because even it\u2019s a supply challenged environment, maybe even capacity constraints the company level, but I think the bigger capacity constraint at this point is at the provider level. We actually had a third party run this analysis for us because we really wanted to get in tune to what is the size of the backlog based on the third party\u2019s view, and then also when they believe the backlog would start coming through and at what pace. What we found in that is that, number one, they came back with there is a very sizeable backlog in orthopedics - actually, their analysis came back smaller than what we expected, but still very material. They said that when we start to work through it, it would be constrained again because of the capacity, and it was a relatively minor impact, a tailwind for sure but impact to the overall market growth, just given the capacity constraints you\u2019re going to have in the provider for some period of time. The good news about that, I guess, is when we start to digest the backlog, it will come as a positive tailwind, likely for years. It wouldn\u2019t be overly material in any given year, but it would be a tailwind for multiple years, so that\u2019s the analysis that we have and we just--again, just doing the math, we don\u2019t believe that we\u2019re into that backlog yet. Hopefully we\u2019ll see some of that come in 2023, but we\u2019re not depending on that when you look at the center of our guidance range.\nKeri Mattox: All right, Katie, I think we have time for just one final question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Rick Wise with Stifel. \nRick Wise: Can you hear me now? Sorry about that.\nBryan Hanson: Yes.\nRick Wise: Great. Two questions. I\u2019ll just say them right up front. First, I don\u2019t think you commented on China, Brian. It seems like the latest COVID surge is subsiding, we\u2019re seeing mostly negative but sort of mixed results on doing a little better. How are you thinking about China, factoring it into the first quarter and to the full year?  A quick one for Suke - Suke, Brian asked me to ask you about the shared services initiative. You\u2019re in the early innings. He said, why isn\u2019t it moving faster?  Just kidding, Suke, just kidding.\nSuketu Upadhyay: That\u2019s a great question. \nBryan Hanson: Rick clearly knows me.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, so we\u2019re seeing China and COVID surges clearly start to stabilize in the first quarter. It was pretty acute there in the fourth quarter. Fortunately, we were able to offset it with strength in other markets, so overall China wasn\u2019t as big a factor in the fourth quarter and we don\u2019t see it as a material mover, at least from a COVID standpoint, in the first quarter. We do see China as a very attractive market for overall growth in \u201923 and beyond, especially now that we\u2019ve moved through all of the pain and noise of BBP, which is now sunsetting behind us, so really feeling good about where that market is, and now that team can start to position towards not only growing the business but start to really work on the margin structure of China as a whole, coming out of BBP. So again, feel very optimistic about where we are there. Yes, what a way to end a call on a good quarter and good outlook with shared services, but I love your ambition and I\u2019m going to share that with the leadership team that we\u2019ve got to move faster, so thanks for the question.\nKeri Mattox: All right, thanks Rick, and thanks for all the questions. I\u2019ll turn it over to Bryan just to close out the call.\nBryan Hanson: Just a couple thoughts. First of all, thanks for joining us this morning. I would say I hope it\u2019s clear that the Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the transformation of this company are well on track and we\u2019re feeling very good about where we stand. I can tell you because of those two phases, I feel that we\u2019ll at least take our fair share of the markets that we play in, and certainly hope to do more than that. Now we\u2019re moving onto Phase 3, and that really is the portfolio transformation of our company. We\u2019re looking at changing the mix of our revenue to make sure that we have more of that mix in high growth markets, and we\u2019re going to do that in three ways, which is kind of a combination of Phase 2/Phase 3.  The first one is innovation - we\u2019re going to invest in innovation in the right areas, in faster growth markets so that we build more revenue through that innovation in those attractive markets. It gives you real time revenue growth but it also makes it sustainable by increasing the weighted average market growth of the company. The second is investment in the commercial channel. You\u2019ve got to have the commercial channel and capability to drive that innovation and make it real. The third is portfolio--active portfolio management, really looking at moving things into the organization and out of the organization that can drive our weighted average market growth rate up, so we are clearly in that phase. We have a better balance sheet right now that we\u2019re going to be able to leverage in that part of the transformation, and make no mistake, we feel very confident about Phase 1, Phase 2, and now Phase 3 given that balance sheet freedom that we\u2019re going to have going forward. With that, I think we\u2019ll go ahead and end the call.\nKeri Mattox: Yes, thanks everyone for joining us. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk today, and of course if you have questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the IR team. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Suketu Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks and good morning everyone. For today's call, I'm going to focus on three topics: first, our fourth quarter results; second, how that performance and recent macro trends translate into our 2023 guidance; and third, I'll provide a brief update on our long term financial priorities.  With that, I'll turn to the fourth quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter of 2022 and how it compares to the same period in 2021, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted continuing operations basis.  Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.825 billion, an increase of 2.7% on a reported basis and an increase of 8.3% on a constant currency basis. As previously noted, we had a selling day headwind of 150 to 200 basis points that impacted each category at about the same level. U.S. sales grew 6.2%, driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in our knee and hip businesses. In addition, the U.S. business saw strength across our three priority areas within SET. International sales grew 11.1% driven by strong procedure volumes across most markets in EMEA and APAC, in tandem with lighter comps and continued strong commercial execution. EMEA performance was driven by recovery in developed markets and continued strength in emerging markets. APAC was impacted by COVID-19 surges and lockdowns in China that were broadly offset by strength in other markets. Now turning to our business category performance, global knees grew 10.2% with U.S. knees up 10.8% and international knees up 9.3%, with strong performance driven by knee procedure recovery across most regions and an easier comp outside of the U.S. Continued global traction for our Persona knee system, including both Persona primary and revision in the U.S., and continued increase in Rosa procedure penetration and pull through. Global hips grew 8.4% with U.S. hips up 9.5% and international hips up 10.8%, driven by strong international procedure recovery and easier comps outside the U.S., continued traction across hip products including the G7 revision system, and Avenir Complete primary hip, which is focused on the direct anterior surgical approach, and lastly continued solid Rosa pull through in the hip category, especially in the U.S. The sports extremity and trauma category grew 7.6% and was impacted by continued strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine, and upper extremities. SET was also impacted by a comp tailwind from China VBP that was partially offset by reimbursement changes in restorative therapies.  Finally, our other category grew 1.3%.  Moving to the P&L, for the quarter we reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.62 compared to GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2021. The change was driven by higher revenues partially offset by a goodwill impairment in EMEA as a result of macro factors. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.88 represented an increase from $1.79 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted gross margin was 71.7%, bringing full year gross margin to 71.2% or about in line with full year 2021, despite significant headwinds from inflationary pressure. Our adjusted operating expenses were $791 million, an increase versus the prior year due to inflationary pressures in tandem with higher investments into R&D and commercial infrastructure to support new products. For the year, overall opex was flat to 2021 with an increase in R&D and lower SG&A. We remain disciplined in realizing efficiencies while investing in our priority areas and offsetting headwinds. Adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 28.3%, up slightly from the prior year, bringing total year operating margins to 27.3%, ahead of full year 2021 despite macro headwinds.  The adjusted tax rate was 16.9% in the quarter, slightly higher than our expectations due to certain one-time discrete tax items. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 16.5% and in line with our full year guidance. Turning to cash and liquidity, operating cash flows were $244 million and free cash flow totaled $115 million for the quarter, bringing our total free cash flow for the full year to $910 million. We continued to reduce our net debt by approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, excluding the effect of foreign currency, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $375 million. Moving to our financial outlook for 2023, we've based our projections in the following key assumptions. We expect to experience procedure cancellations and staffing challenges, but the impact will be less acute than what we experienced in 2022. Supply chain headwinds will continue throughout the year but with improvement in the second half of '23. Pricing headwinds are expected to be slightly better than our historic average of 200 to 300 basis points. Inflationary pressure will remain stable to 2022 exit, and an expected adjusted EPS dilution of about $0.05 to $0.10 due to our acquisition of Embody in the first quarter of 2023. Against this backdrop, our expectations for the full year '23 financial outlook are reported revenue growth in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% versus 2022, an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 150 basis points resulting in revenue growth of 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.95 to $7.15. Inside of that guidance, at our midpoint we expect adjusted operating profit margins to be flat to slightly up compared to 2022 levels. We also expect net interest and other non-operating expenses will be about $190 million primarily due to higher interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate should be broadly in line with 2022 and total shares outstanding are expected to remain in line with full year 2022 average fully diluted shares outstanding. Finally, we expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $925 million to $1.025 billion.  In terms of cadence through the year, we expect that the constant currency revenue growth rate for the first half will be slightly higher than the growth rate in the second half, and we do expect choppiness by quarter. Q1 is projected to be our highest growth quarter due to easier comps and will be followed by the fourth quarter, driven by improved supply and innovation building throughout the year. Q2 and Q3 will be lighter quarters given tougher comps. Lastly, we don't expect any material day rate impact of full year results; however, Q1 and Q4 will benefit by about 100 basis points of tailwind that will be offset by headwinds in Q2 and Q3.  In summary, we delivered accelerated growth in 2022 with a margin profile that is better than '21 as we overcame headwinds while investing in our priority areas. We navigated a number of macro challenges and delivered on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. As we look forward to 2023, while the environment remains dynamic, we see a path to delivering solid growth and earnings performance with robust free cash flow. To close out, let me make a few comments about our financial priorities moving forward. We've made significant progress over the past few years in strengthening our balance sheet through improved financial performance and ongoing reductions in debt. This ultimately provides ZB with greater strategic flexibility as we look to transform our portfolio with a focus on increasing our WAMGR and driving improved long term growth. We will remain committed to our investment-grade rating and will continue to look at ways to accelerate profitable growth with a focus on achieving our mission. I'm so very proud of the ZB team for their perseverance and dedication throughout 2022 and I'm excited about what we can accomplish in 2023.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. Yes, so Ryan, thank you for the question. Good to be with everyone. First of all, I'd say we had a really good close to the year. We ended top line, bottom line, and free cash flow at the top end of our third quarter guidance, so a really strong finish. There was a number of variables behind that, but the key one is really about execution, so feel really good about the momentum that we have. As we move into 2023, some of the key variables that underpin our guidance, I talked a little bit about them on our--in the scripted remarks. The first is around stabilization related to case cancellations, staffing shortages and things of that nature. We expect that to continue to improve throughout 2023. We're not completely at normal markets - there are still some underlying dynamics impacting the overall market, but things are definitely improving and we expect that to continue to work through the rest of this year, so procedure recovery for sure in '23.  The other thing we have to think, though, to balance that out is we're continuing to see supply challenges. We saw those in the fourth quarter. Our supply chain team as well as our commercial teams responded incredibly well to those challenges, but we're assuming that those supply challenges remain at least through the first half of this year and begin to improve in the second part of this year. But as we put all that together, we've got a lot of confidence against our full guidance range. We're optimistic about where trends are going and, like I said, we're really excited about where the business is headed. I don't know, Bryan, if you want to talk a little bit about what we're seeing so far? Yes, I think one of the key drivers is obviously going to be revenue growth, right, so if we continue to navigate the challenges around supply as we have been and as we saw in the fourth quarter, if we continue to see stabilization in the market and start to trend towards the upper half of the range, clearly that will help drive some margin expansion as we continue to leverage our overall cost base. Beyond that, it's just the normal block and tackling that this company has gotten accustomed to over the last four or five years. We're going to continue to drive sourcing improvements around site optimization, six sigma procurement. I'll tell you, the commercial team has really stepped up. I've never seen a focus on mix, on simplification of the supply chain and SKU rationalization, on pricing before in the company's history, so I think we've made really good strides from a commercial perspective, which I think could be some leverage to the potential upside. Then across SG&A, we're still in the early innings of fully leveraging our shared service operating model, which we started through the pandemic, so I think we have a number of things at our disposal that can help either expand margins or de-risk our margin aspirations in a downturn, so feeling really good about what the overall team has been able to accomplish and where we can go with this. Yes, sure Larry. Good to be with you today. You're right - we pegged FX as a headwind year-over-year at 150 basis points. That's an improvement from our original commentary back on our third quarter call. Originally, we were thinking 300 basis points, and so we did see some moderation of the dollar at the very back end of 2022 and early part of '23, so that drove the improvement. The way to think about it is we use recent rates. We look at the full cadre of all of our currency exposures. One of the things to recall, remember that about 40% of our revenue is foreign currency exposed. Half of that is euro and yen, right, so the other half is a lot of other currencies that you have to take into consideration. When we aggregate all that, we're at 150 basis points. Hopefully we continue to see things improve throughout this year and things turn favorable, but for right now, that's our latest estimate. The flow-through on that, we expect it to be about 20% to 30% down to earnings. That's a little bit less than what we said last year, and as I said last year when we quoted 30%, there are a lot of variables that can affect that but it's still a reasonable drop-through to historical norms. So again, 150 basis points based on recent rates, euro, yen making up about half of our foreign currency exposure, and the flow-through being about 20% to 30%. Yes, I'll actually level up from margin expansion and talk a bit more about how we think about it, which is earnings power inside the company. Our goal is to drive a leveraged P&L, right, and what do I mean by that? We're looking for earnings growing faster than revenue, and as we approach those revenue outlooks that Bryan just talked about, we see a very clear path to being able to do that. Now, margin expansion will be a key building block in that, but it's not the only one, right? Obviously sales leverage and then our ability to continue to leverage our interest rate, as well as tax, there are a number of levers at our disposal to drive that earnings power higher than revenue.  Inside of that for margin, we continue to have the same variables that I've been talking about for quite some time, and the company has continued to show improvement on all those fronts, whether it's pricing, manufacturing simplification, cost improvement, SG&A improvement - I mean, just look at our SG&A this year, we've been flat year-over-year while driving expansion in a number of areas in commercial infrastructure, so we've shown that we can do this. I'm confident we can continue moving forward and start to really see that durable revenue expansion that Bryan talked about. I'm very confident we can drive earnings power faster than revenue. Sure, I'll take that. First of all, thanks for the question, Josh. On pricing, we had a really good fourth quarter. If you look at our disclosure, our press release, you'd actually see that pricing is positive in the fourth quarter. Now, I would say on an underlying basis, pricing had erosion of about 100 to 150 basis points. We benefited by some year-over-year comps due to BBP, and we also had some one-time pull adjustments that were favorable in the quarter that drove us to be positive in the fourth quarter. But on an underlying basis, I would still think about it as 100 to 150 basis points erosion, which is still incredibly good versus our historical average of 200 to 300 basis points. We ended the year at about 150 basis points of erosion, again, so a pretty clear step change to where we've been historically.  I talked about in my scripted remarks, we expect next year--or this year, I should say, 2023 to be slightly better than that annual average that we had before 2022, so maybe not as good as '22 but definitely better than where we've historically been. There are a number of drivers inside of that. Some of them are transitional, some are more structural in nature. The ones that I'm more excited about are those structural improvements that we've made. We've made a lot of investments around capabilities, around systems, around analytics. We've got better governance, we've got better discipline. It's an area we incent the field force off of now, so there are a host of things that structurally are improving our price performance as we move to 2023, and that's sticking and part of our guide. If you think about the dynamics between U.S. and EMEA and Asia Pacific, maybe I'll let Ivan talk a little bit about what he's seeing. Yes, and Robbie, just back to your question around supply chain, our comments on Q4 and then 2023, we did see pressure in the fourth quarter around supply chain. I think you've heard us comment on that, and not inconsistent with what you're hearing around the sector, we expect those challenges to continue into 2023.  The commentary on Q4, just to provide a little color that we think that our group did a really nice job in navigating that. The situation continues to be dynamic into '23, but our expectation is that we're going to continue to navigate that really well. Yes, let me take that one. You heard us correctly. First half will be stronger than the second half from a growth rate perspective, top line ex-FX. First quarter will be the strongest followed by the fourth quarter, and then the second and third quarter. Let me go into a little bit more detail. On the first quarter, that will be our strongest one primarily due to procedural recovery. Remember, we're comparing against the first quarter of 2022, which had omicron in it, and therefore you've got a nice comp benefit. In the fourth quarter, that's generally from a seasonality perspective from growth, usually one of our strongest quarters, and we're assuming a nice benefit from the innovation, the momentum of innovation build throughout the year from new products and execution, so that's why we characterize that as our second-largest quarter. Then inside of that, the second and third quarter will actually have tougher comps because that's when we began to see some recovery last year relative to omicron.  The day rate impact, you're right - we said 100 basis points for each of Q1 and Q4, that's a tailwind which will be offset by headwinds in Q2 and Q3, so you've got it largely right there. Yes, we would see this as breakeven to positive in the first 24 months, so it's very attractive from a margin profile, from an earnings accretion profile. As Bryan said, it's more or less like a product launch right now, but as that begins to ramp up from a revenue standpoint and begins to cover some of the investments we're making in a very important sector in sports and extremities, we feel good about the return profile. It meets all of our hurdles from an NPV, IRR, ROIC metric perspective, and so again it's early days but neutral within the first 24 months. Yes, so you're right - we did point to the higher end of our range back in '22 of 50 to 100 basis points flowing into '23. We're actually seeing that come through year-over-year as a headwind to gross margin. I could say, though, I'm very pleased with how the commercial and supply chain teams have reacted to that, and we believe we're going to be in a position to offset all of that and pretty much hold gross margin flat year-over-year That's coming from a number of variables, but again we're really proud with what the team's done to offset that. The impact that we saw in 2022 was, I would say, about 100 basis points as well, and if you actually look at gross margin performance, it was flat to 2021, so again the team did a really nice job in offsetting those headwinds. Once again, we're demonstrating and showing that we can be disciplined, we can offset these headwinds and help our earnings growth over time. That's a great question. Yes, so we're seeing China and COVID surges clearly start to stabilize in the first quarter. It was pretty acute there in the fourth quarter. Fortunately, we were able to offset it with strength in other markets, so overall China wasn't as big a factor in the fourth quarter and we don't see it as a material mover, at least from a COVID standpoint, in the first quarter. We do see China as a very attractive market for overall growth in '23 and beyond, especially now that we've moved through all of the pain and noise of BBP, which is now sunsetting behind us, so really feeling good about where that market is, and now that team can start to position towards not only growing the business but start to really work on the margin structure of China as a whole, coming out of BBP. So again, feel very optimistic about where we are there. Yes, what a way to end a call on a good quarter and good outlook with shared services, but I love your ambition and I'm going to share that with the leadership team that we've got to move faster, so thanks for the question."

            "name": "Ivan Tornos",
            "content": "Hey Travis, good morning - Ivan here. I don't know where they are, we don't pay attention to where competitors are. We pay attention to where we are in the process. I'll tell you frankly, I'll be very surprised if we're not first to market, given where we are in the development cycle. My expectation remains that we're going to be ahead. The most important part is not just the speed in the actual launch, it's the quality, the features and benefits that we have in the platform. Given the mix of developers that we have involved in the project, I do think it's going to be transformational for our platform, so that would be my answer. I'm happy to take that one, Drew. I'll tell you, Q4 was solid both from a Rosa installation and purchasing standpoint. I'm not aware of any deal that we've lost, whether it's here in the U.S or OUS relative to capital. We also do small capital deals in the surgical business and those were on track as well, so sequentially Q3 to Q4 of 2022 was solid. Because of comps, obviously, it's a lower number than a year ago, but so far, so good when it comes to capital, so nothing that I've seen so far leads me to believe that we're going to have a challenge when it comes to robotics. Yes, I can take that as well. We've been in the low teens, as we've been disclosing. That's obviously prior to the launch of Persona OsseoTi, which is now in the market, it's been around for two weeks. The expectation is that number is going to dramatically increase, and as you know, Drew, in combination with robotics, you're going to see a collateral effect. You're going to see increase of cementless mix, you're going to see an increase of robotics penetration, so we're already bullish about where we're going to end at the end of the year. We don't disclose that externally, but you should expect something fairly aggressive. Thanks Suke. So far, we're not seeing the performance when it comes to pricing being in a single region. Frankly, 2022, all three regions beat our expectations when it comes to pricing. The most important part, I do think it's sustainable with the guidance that we've given for 2023. The role of innovation also is a critical component of the sustainability of that pricing. As you think about bundle deals, as you think about bringing innovation, that is going to drive mix and in some cases a bit of price performance. Yes, sure. Good to talk to you here today, Robbie. Innovation, as we discussed at JP Morgan earlier in the year, could be a three-hour conversation, so I'm going to try to keep it more or less succinct. But I will tell you, I truly believe today innovation is a key competitive advantage. Two data points right out of the gate that I mentioned, vitality index, the percentage of sales coming from new products has more than doubled over the last two years, and we expect the number to increase dramatically over the strategic horizon. Then the second part, we filed in 2022 the highest number of 510(k)s in the history of the company, and actually we had the largest number of approvals, public information, when it comes to the peer group.  Breaking down innovation into three or four buckets, when it comes to knees, I already mentioned Persona OsseoTi - that is the new cementless form factor, that device that we have here at Zimmer Biomet. The clinical data we have on that product is compelling. We believe it's highly stable when it comes to the mechanical and biological fixation. It's extremely versatile - you can all the way to the end of the surgery decide whether you want to go cemented or cementless. It does use the Persona technology, so it's highly anatomic, you can customize the device to any kind of anatomy. We've got the broadest [indiscernible] ranges.  I'm excited with Persona Smart - we don't talk much about it because we still are in the limited market trials, but I like where it's going. I like the opportunity that we have with Persona Smart, especially later in the year.  When it comes to hips, in the prepared remarks, Bryan talked about HipInsight is the first and only mixed reality digital surgery platform for hip arthroplasty. This is making procedures faster. This is increasing accuracy in the actual procedure. When you come to the meeting in Vegas at the academy, I think you'll be impressed. It effectively gives the surgeon X-ray vision over the anatomy of the patient, the instruments, the implants. You're going to get more accuracy, faster procedures. It is going to be transformational.  I like the momentum we have with both Rosa hips and knees. We have a strong portfolio when it comes to shoulder- let's talk about Identity, the transformational launch that we did at the end of 2022. That is followed by a cadence of launches on Glenoids, on Signature ONE planning - I could spend an hour on that, and then through organic and inorganic means, I think we have a best-in-class portfolio in sports med. This will be my three minute summary on a lot of things that are happening from an innovation standpoint, but I'll close it by saying again, I do believe it's a true competitive advantage for Zimmer Biomet. Maybe I can take that one, Kyle. First things first, on the three segments we think that are growth drivers: sports med, upper extremities, and CMFT, we have double if not triple the number of people dedicated to these specialties. The sports med expansion is very real now that we have a portfolio, so the number of dedicated specialized people has dramatically increased in these three categories. In tandem, we also increased the number of people that are fully dedicated to the ASC environment, and that's because these procedures for the most part do take place in that space, but that goes beyond sales reps. It also touches on the contracting arm of the organization. As far as your second question, the percentage of direct and indirect, I don't think that we disclose that externally. We like where we are, we like the mix that we have of direct and indirect. We just left our sales meeting Denver, we had 2,000 people were there, and I tell you their mood is very solid whether an indirect or direct territory leader. I think people feel it's a good time to be part of the company, but I don't think we'll break down the percentages externally. Yes, I'll keep it short and sweet here. In any year, we expect to do no less than 300 installations, and we exceeded that expectation across all three regions. As you think about the future, '23, '24 and whatnot, that's frankly the point of entry. I would be disappointed, maybe even jobless if we didn't exceed that number, given the new applications in shoulder, next generation hip, and other technologies coming in, but we're so far exceeding those expectations."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "All right, great. Thanks Keri, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning for the call. We've really got three sections for the call this morning. First, I'm going to talk briefly about our fourth quarter performance and spend a few minutes on our teams, what I just define as solid execution, as well as our innovation and drivers for continued strong performance. Then for the second section, as usual, Suke will provide more detail on the quarter itself and very importantly our 2023 guidance and expectations. Then of course, we'll close things out by addressing any questions that you might have. Before we get started, I wanted to take a minute to thank really the ZB team, just the full ZB team not only for their work in making Q4 another successful quarter but also for their resilience. The innovative thinking and dedication to getting the job done throughout all of 2022, even in the face of very real adversity, there's no doubt in my mind that this team is the engine that is driving us forward, so again thank you. I can tell you that I'm very proud to be on this journey with you. Now as we turn to Q4 results, know that each and every one of you made the quarter happen, and I can tell you it was a solid quarter. We again saw better than expected growth driven by continued procedure recovery, strong execution, and a solid momentum with our new innovation, and as expected, we also benefited from some favorable comps in the quarter.  Inside of this, we saw another positive quarter of year-over-year momentum in large joints with our overall global hip and knee business growing more than 8% and 10% on an ex-FX basis, and our overall set category grew in the high single digits driven by strong performance in our business growth drivers, which as we said before, are supports, CMFT, and upper extremities, as well as the expected tailwind from BBP comps in our trauma business. That said, we are clearly seeing overall market stabilization, but our fourth quarter execution and procedure recovery is still set against a macro backdrop that is challenging and fluid. Foreign currency has improved but remains a challenge and supply, inflation and staffing pressures continue. In fourth quarter, our team was once again able to navigate these challenges, flexing what I would just define as a muscle memory that I think, fortunately or unfortunately, is a bit unique to ZB and has served us well over the past year during 2022.  But make no mistake - the challenges are real and they're ongoing, but regardless of this environment with COVID mainly in the rear view mirror, I have confidence that the ZB team will continue to deliver. Our culture, our strategy, innovation and execution are coalescing right now, driving tangible momentum and importantly belief from the team, and as a result confidence in our business continues to grow. Let me just give a few examples from Q4. In the quarter, we announced the approval of our new cementless knee form factor which is adding to our Persona family and strategically rounding out that portfolio. The first procedures have been completed with this new keel design, and the feedback, as expected, has been very positive. We continue to belief that our cementless knee penetration will grow significantly and that this differentiated, premium product can really accelerate that growth.  It's early days with full launch planned for the middle of the year, but make no mistake, this is a real growth driver for our knee franchise.  This launch builds on other recent product launches, like hip insights and our Identity shoulder system introductions, bringing now our total to more than 50 new product launches from 2018 through 2022, and importantly the largest majority of these launches came in markets we see growing in the mid single digits or better. That's really important, being launched in markets that we see growing in the mid single digits or better. This strategic prioritization and output from our innovation pipeline has helped ZB more than double our vitality index over that time, and very importantly increase our revenue in faster growth markets and sub-markets, which of course drives positive increases in our weighted average market growth. That momentum continues. We expect to launch another 40-plus products between now and the end of 2025, once again with the majority of those launches in 4%-plus growth markets. This will drive further increases in our vitality index and weighted average market growth, and most importantly bring real and meaningful innovation to the patients and customers that we serve. So what I know for sure is that our current momentum, very robust new product pipeline, and our strengthening balance sheet focused on accelerating our portfolio transformation positions ZB well for the future, and as a result, I feel increasingly confident about ZB's ability to transform our business, drive growth, deliver value, and achieve our mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life for people around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Suke for a closer look at Q4 and again our expectations for 2023. Suke? Yes, we can hear you. Got it, thanks for the question, Ryan. Maybe what I'll do is, Suke, you could provide color around the way we're thinking about guidance, because there's a lot that goes into it. We still don't believe it's a normal year, obviously - there's a lot of puts and takes on either side of the equation, but you could walk through those, perhaps, and then I will give you some color around what we're seeing so far in January and how that's making us feel as well. But why don't you go ahead and start? Yes, clearly a lot of variables that are still moving, but if I just think about kind of the here and now and just look at what we've already accomplished in January, I'd just say it was a really strong start to the year. Again, we're still looking at those variables, but when I think about the things that we can control, things around execution or innovation, they're going in the direction we want. When I think about the things we can't control, it's procedural recovery and supply challenges. Those are also coalescing in a nice way, so I guess suffice to say based on those things, the momentum right now, and it's early days, but the momentum right now in 2023 is feeling really good.  Again, we'll continue to monitor those other variables, but we feel pretty good about how we're starting. Yes, so I would say that probably the biggest reason that you're seeing that outsized growth overall, I wouldn't define it as backlog consumption. I don't believe we've started to consume the backlog. I would define it more as comps, we just had easier comps. I'd maybe call that procedure recovery versus the prior year, so that to me is not something that's necessarily sustainable but it was just easier comps, being that we had more pressure last year. Pricing was better, though, across the board, whether it's our company or other companies. We did a better job in pricing as a group and as a result of that, that buoyed us as well. Suke's talked before about what our expectations are in pricing as we move into 2023, but I'm sure we'll get another question around that, so those are probably the two biggest things that wouldn't be as sustainable. But make no mistake, I feel like the market is strong, and some of the things that we look to that can buoy sustainably the market growth is innovation, and innovation adoption right now in orthopedics is really promising, not just the typical innovation but technology innovation that absolutely can drive the share of wallet or mix benefit you get with that new innovation. Yes, so if we think about overall SET, I think what you're asking, Larry, is how we view that business in an undisturbed market going forward. Is that kind of what you're asking? Yes, so when we come into 2023, even though it's not going to be a normal market, we're still thinking about SET as being able to be a mid single digit grower. That's the way we're looking at that. In an undisturbed market, we would think the same thing. Remember in the first half, though, we're going to be a bit pressured still by the restorative therapies group and that change in reimbursement, but even with that throughout the year, we believe that that segment can grow in the mid single digits. The key drivers for that, because we don't treat all the businesses the same from an investment standpoint, will be our growth drivers, which would be upper extremities for us, our sports business, and in certain portions of our CMFT business. Sure. Maybe I'll just start with the Embody thing. That's a relatively small acquisition. I would probably think more about that as a product launch, so it's not overly material but it's a very attractive subspace of sports. As we're building our that commercial channel, it's one of those things you really need in your bag to attract talent to that commercial channel, so it's important to us but I wouldn't look at that as a significant or a material impact to the year, only in the sense that we're going to be able to bring that channel in place and get good momentum in sports overall. From an M&A standpoint, yes, we are clearly in Phase 3 of the transformation of the company, which I've clearly talked about looks at portfolio transformation, focused on getting more revenue in faster growth markets in its simplest form, and that's exactly what we're going to concentrate on. The fact is as our balance sheet continues to strengthen, our flexibility here, strategic flexibility goes up, and we will look at acquiring technologies that make sense from a mission standpoint for the company, that we see a path to leadership in, that we think will increase our weighted average market growth because that's important for sustainability, and we see a path to be able to increase growth rate and EPS. I've said before there are three areas that we'll look at for acquisitions, mainly kind of smaller to midsized deals, but we'd look at things that would enhance our position in recon in those faster growth sub-markets - that could be robotics, data, or the ASC setting. In orthopedic area diversification, that would be in faster growth sub-segments like sports or CMFT or extremities, and then as you said, those things that might be outside of orthopedics that would help us diversify the business away from elective procedures but also in fast growth markets.  All of those things are on the table right now, and again as our balance sheet strengthens, our ability to action that obviously also increases. We're going to stay disciplined, there's no question about it, but we are clearly on the hunt for targets that make sense in those ways. Yes, so maybe I'll start, and Suke, I'll pass it to you on the margin side. I would say our team's confidence is as high as it's ever been, quite frankly. Just think about that in the short term - it is not a normal environment. There are a lot of challenges that we're having to deal with from a supply chain standpoint. But I do go back to what I said in the prepared remarks - I have a lot of confidence in this team because of the muscle memory we have over the last five years of dealing with a lot of adversity. So just in this moment of a non-normal environment, I would rather have this team than any other team because I believe they can fight through those challenges, and they've proven it. That's number one. Number two, outside of those challenges, we're just hitting our stride. From a momentum standpoint, we've had a lot of kickoff meetings here recently - I love to go to those meetings. You get a real sense for how people are feeling, just having a conversation with sales reps, that's where it all starts. The momentum there, the confidence there, the belief there is as good as I've ever seen it, so all those things add up to me to say, particularly in a normal environment, we're in a good place and I feel confident that we can continue to deliver the innovation and drive real revenue growth. I don't want to give too many views of what the future revenue growth of the company will be, but know this - as we increase the weighted average market growth of the company, as we get to a 4% that's organic that we can commit to and sustain, that won't be good enough. We'll continue to look at portfolio transformation to drive it north of that, but right now I feel really good. I feel really good about the confidence that the team has and I feel really confident about the team's ability to drive the results that we just guided to in 2023. Maybe you want to talk more about the margin expansion? Yes, and I think we do a really nice job of not just getting individual deals but also getting multiple placements in the same account. You do typically have hybrid accounts where you've got us in there with robotics and potentially another competitor, but it's not just greenfield, it is existing accounts where you've gotten to the point where you don't have enough capacity for that robotics system and they want to buy another system, so it's a combination of those two things. Can you repeat the question? We didn't catch it, sorry. Just to make sure no one's confused, Persona OsseoTi, we've not used the name before, but that is the new form factor for cementless for Persona. Yes, so you know, first of all, I think it's really important - we never really pay a whole lot of attention to any individual quarter. Obviously this quarter was a pretty strong one for us globally and in the U.S., but we don't try to over-index on that. We do an eight-quarter trend and we look at how we're trending versus market, and I even try to stay away from specific competitors but just the overall market growth, looking at the largest players. I would say in that eight-quarter trend, as that continues to roll, we're seeing good performance versus market in large joints, both hip and knee, probably more in knee than hip, but overall we're feeling pretty good.  You've got to go back to before Q2 2020. As you probably remember, we had 20 straight quarters of being below market in every quarter, so five years below market in large joints, so we definitely have seen a sea change in our ability to perform at or above market in large joints, which as you know is our biggest business. That's the way we think about it and we break it in a bunch of different ways - year over year, we look at it on a stacked basis, we look at it sequentially, but in all those areas when we look at that eight-quarter trend, we're feeling good about where we are. Yes, so maybe I'll start off on a broad-based basis, because there's really two factors that you talked about, Suke, in being able to drive performance in the fourth quarter. One would be supply challenges alleviating, but also the innovation building, because those are almost two separate things, so we'll make sure that we talk about both of those, and Ivan, maybe talk about some of the innovation.  For us when we think about the supply challenges, it really comes down to material shortages that we're seeing, that we think are going to get better as we move in through the year, labor shortages that we think are going to get better as we move in through the year, and then sterilization capacity, which everybody is dealing with right now, that I do believe is going to catch up at some point. That's why we think supply challenges are going to get better, but it's pretty broad-based. I can't look at supply challenges and say it's just this product or that product because it's in packaging, it's in resins. Almost everything that we're dealing with has some form of supply challenges, like sterilization for instance, so I wouldn't isolate the supply challenges to a product or product set. It's just a broad-based pressure that we're feeling. Outside of that, it's around innovation that's going to be building, and maybe you can talk to some of the things you're excited about there. Yes, we're ready now. Again, the balance sheet is moving in a place that allows us to have even more strategic flexibility than we've had in the past, which is a good thing. As I've said, it's probably more of those smaller to midsized deals that would be a bit closer to the vest for now, in other words closer to the orthopedic space that we are already in, but we're ready. We're definitely ready. Now it comes down to opportunistically finding the right target at the right price and the right returns, but we are ready to move into Phase 3 of the transformation for sure. That is the question that I think we're all grappling with. There's clearly backlog. You might call it longer waiting lists, backlog - you can define it the way you want, but the fact is there's pent-up demand for these procedures. The rate limiting factor is really capacity at the provider level. You could--because even it's a supply challenged environment, maybe even capacity constraints the company level, but I think the bigger capacity constraint at this point is at the provider level. We actually had a third party run this analysis for us because we really wanted to get in tune to what is the size of the backlog based on the third party's view, and then also when they believe the backlog would start coming through and at what pace. What we found in that is that, number one, they came back with there is a very sizeable backlog in orthopedics - actually, their analysis came back smaller than what we expected, but still very material. They said that when we start to work through it, it would be constrained again because of the capacity, and it was a relatively minor impact, a tailwind for sure but impact to the overall market growth, just given the capacity constraints you're going to have in the provider for some period of time. The good news about that, I guess, is when we start to digest the backlog, it will come as a positive tailwind, likely for years. It wouldn't be overly material in any given year, but it would be a tailwind for multiple years, so that's the analysis that we have and we just--again, just doing the math, we don't believe that we're into that backlog yet. Hopefully we'll see some of that come in 2023, but we're not depending on that when you look at the center of our guidance range. Yes. Rick clearly knows me. Just a couple thoughts. First of all, thanks for joining us this morning. I would say I hope it's clear that the Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the transformation of this company are well on track and we're feeling very good about where we stand. I can tell you because of those two phases, I feel that we'll at least take our fair share of the markets that we play in, and certainly hope to do more than that. Now we're moving onto Phase 3, and that really is the portfolio transformation of our company. We're looking at changing the mix of our revenue to make sure that we have more of that mix in high growth markets, and we're going to do that in three ways, which is kind of a combination of Phase 2/Phase 3.  The first one is innovation - we're going to invest in innovation in the right areas, in faster growth markets so that we build more revenue through that innovation in those attractive markets. It gives you real time revenue growth but it also makes it sustainable by increasing the weighted average market growth of the company. The second is investment in the commercial channel. You've got to have the commercial channel and capability to drive that innovation and make it real. The third is portfolio--active portfolio management, really looking at moving things into the organization and out of the organization that can drive our weighted average market growth rate up, so we are clearly in that phase. We have a better balance sheet right now that we're going to be able to leverage in that part of the transformation, and make no mistake, we feel very confident about Phase 1, Phase 2, and now Phase 3 given that balance sheet freedom that we're going to have going forward. With that, I think we'll go ahead and end the call."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, November 2, 2022. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please, go ahead. \nKeri Mattox: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay; and COO, Ivan Tornos. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q3 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: Thanks, Keri, and thanks for joining us for the call this morning. We've got three sections of the call. First, I'm going to briefly talk about our Q3 performance and really the momentum that we saw in Q3 that has allowed us to increase our outlook for the year and doing so, even in the face of some pretty meaningful macro pressures that we're certainly still facing. I also want to spend time talking about our ZB innovation. This is clearly the driver of our continued strong performance and will be the driver as we go forward. And for the second section, Suky will provide more detail on the quarter, but probably more importantly, our 2022 guidance update. And then we'll close things out by addressing any questions you might have. Before I get started on Q3, I just want to make sure that I take a minute to say thank you. Thank you to the ZB team members that I know are listening. I know a lot of you listen to the call and I appreciate that. Your continued strong performance is -- it's just built on day-in and day-out execution. You're just focused on driving results. And I know you're showing up and facing some very, very real macro challenges right now and I appreciate it. The fact is I'm just really proud that even in the face of these challenges, you're delivering results for our customers, you're delivering results for our patients and for our shareholders and you're moving the mission of this company forward every single day. I know it's not easy but I promise you it is much appreciated. Okay. So turning to the third quarter. Although, the beginning of the quarter was a bit choppy when it comes to procedure cancellations, we did see very nice improvement throughout the quarter and we finished strong. And that execution and recovery occurred in all of our regions, but especially in our OUS regions, with both EMEA and APAC performing better than our expectations. Inside of this, we saw good momentum in our large joints business, with our knee franchise growing in the high single digits and our hip business growing just above 10%. And as you've seen, this was somewhat offset by the telegraphed and expected pressure in our S.E.T. business and our other category. Now, although, we did see the strength in the quarter, we continue to face significant challenges across foreign currency, supply, inflation and staffing. That said, the team has been able to navigate these challenges and mitigate their impact. You can't completely eliminate them, but they've certainly mitigated their impact. And they've done this through operational and commercial discipline, as well as driving our innovation in the field. And as a result, our confidence continues to grow and you see that reflected in our updated financial guidance. In short, our underlying business is clearly strong and I truly do believe it's getting stronger. Just as an example, when we look at the quarter, we announced a first-of-its-kind three-year agreement with Hospital for Special Surgery, or HSS. The partnership creates HSS/Zimmer Biomet Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence in Robotic Joint Replacement. We're focused here with HSS to develop new tools that will be powered by AI to provide data-driven recommendations or insights to surgeons for robotic-assisted joint surgery. It's really -- it's a big deal. It's -- we're clearly very excited about it. We really do believe this is a future of medicine opportunity and we're excited to be involved with HSS. In our Q3, our new product pipeline continue to deliver as well. While it's early, we are definitely excited about the launch of HipInsight. This is the first FDA-cleared mixed-reality navigation system for total hip replacement. HipInsight is the latest addition to our OptiVu portfolio and it further expands our ZBEdge suite of solutions.  Additionally, we announced the FDA clearance of our Identity Shoulder System. This is a technology that has proprietary capability of aligning each surgeon's approach to an individual patient's anatomy. All of this with the goal first and foremost of alleviating pain, but also optimizing the range of motion for that patient. And I got to tell you our existing product portfolio kept up the momentum as well.  Demand continues for ROSA both in knee and hip. Persona Revision traction in the US remained strong and our limited launch of Persona iQ is driving positive feedback and interest and we're focused on aggressive data collection, so that we can establish clinical use benefits.  And we expect to build on this momentum with new product launches in the coming months including as we've talked about our new Persona cementless form factor additional launches in our S.E.T. category and a hip product launch that we're excited about in early 2023. And I can tell you that all of these product innovations coupled with our ongoing efforts to reshape our business and accelerate ZB's transformation position us very well for future growth. We continue to strive to be a best and preferred place to work for our team members and we continue to strive to be a top quartile performer for our shareholders and to be a trusted partner to all of our stakeholders, but in particular our customers and our patients. Just in summary we're navigating and really managing through some very real macro headwinds that are definitely muting our growth. But we're also seeing an offset via COVID recovery very strong execution from the team and meaningful innovation in the field and against that backdrop our team continues to execute our strategy and I feel increasingly confident about our future as a company.  And with that I'm going to turn it to Suky to talk more in depth about Q3 and give you an outlook for 2022 guidance. Okay Suky. \nSuky Upadhyay: Thanks Bryan and good morning. Overall, we delivered another good quarter driven by strong execution and continued recovery of elective procedures. While we continue to navigate challenges our third quarter performance gives us the confidence to raise our full year financial guidance.  With that I'll turn to our third quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the third quarter of 2022 and how it compares to the same period in 2021. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted continuing operations basis.  Net sales in the third quarter were $1.670 billion, a decrease of 0.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 5% on a constant currency basis. US sales grew 3.2% driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in our Knee and Hip businesses. This was partially offset by expected declines in the S.E.T. and other categories.  International sales grew 7.3% driven by strong procedure volumes across most markets in EMEA and APAC in tandem with lighter comps and continued strong commercial execution. EMEA performed better than expected driven by recovery in developed markets and continued strength in emerging markets and APAC performed better than expected with China largely inline with expectations and strength in Japan.  Turning to our business category performance. Global Knees grew 7.2% with US Knees up 7.3% and International Knees up 7%. The strong performance was driven by knee procedure recovery across most regions and easier comps along with continued global traction of our Persona Knee System especially with Persona Revision in the US and continue to increase in ROSA procedure penetration and pull-through.  Global Hips grew 10.5% with U.S. Hips up 5.3% and International Hips up 15.5% driven by strong international procedure recovery and an easier comp outside of the US. Continued traction across key Hip products including the G7 Revision System and Avenir Complete Primary Hip which is focused on the direct interior surgical approach.  And lastly continued solid ROSA pull-through in the hip category especially in the US. The sports extremities and trauma category declined 2.1% and was impacted by a tough comp in 2021 and the expected pressure around VBP which is expected to reverse in Q4 and reimbursement headwinds in US restorative therapies that will anniversary in mid-2023. Within the category, we continued to deliver strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine and upper extremities. Finally, our other category declined 0.4% driven by tough comps and expected lower capital sales related to a higher mix of ROSA placements versus upfront sales. Moving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77 in the third quarter of 2021. The increase was driven by a decline in litigation related expenses and a tax benefit in the quarter from a favorable tax liability outcome. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.58 represents a decrease from $1.71 in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted gross margin was 70.7% in line with expectations. As previously discussed, heightened inflationary pressure will drive full year gross margins to be slightly down when compared to the prior year. As previously noted, increasing input costs from this year will pull-through into 2023 and we now expect the headwind from inflation in 2023 to be at the upper end of our previously communicated 50 to 100 basis point range. Our adjusted operating expenses were $742 million, an increase versus the prior year due to inflationary pressures and higher investments into R&D to support future product launches. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.3%, a 200-basis point decline from the prior year and largely driven by increased inflationary pressures and continued investments into the pipeline and product portfolio. Despite ongoing macro headwinds, we continue to expect our efficiency programs to drive improved second half operating margins versus the first half of the year with a step-up in the fourth quarter in tandem with higher revenue. The adjusted tax rate was 16.3% in the quarter in line with our expectations. Turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $451 million and free cash flow totaled $332 million for the quarter. We reduced our debt by about $160 million in the third quarter excluding the effects of foreign currency and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of about $545 million. On a related note, despite a higher interest rate environment in 2022, interest expense is expected to be broadly in line with our previous expectations for the year. However, we would expect a step-up of interest expense into 2023. We have made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet through improved financial performance and ongoing debt reduction, ultimately providing greater strategic flexibility for the company. Moving on to our updated financial outlook for the year. Constant currency revenue growth is now expected to be 5.5% to 6.5% versus 2021 with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind based on recent spot rates of 550 basis points versus our previous assumption of 500 basis points. This means that reported revenue growth will be in the range of 0% to 1% versus 2021. Also related to revenue, based on the recent spot rates, we estimate that the strengthening of the dollar through 2022 will create about a 300-basis point headwind to revenue growth in 2023. Additionally, we are tightening our expected adjusted diluted EPS range to $6.80 to $6.90. All other metrics in our 2022 financial guidance remain unchanged from our second quarter update. As a reminder, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be slightly higher than the third quarter due in part to a tailwind related to Q4 2021 VBP charges that will be partially offset by about one-day selling day headwind. In summary, we had another solid quarter underpinned by market recovery and good execution and we are pleased to again raise our full year outlook. While we expect to have to continue to navigate a number of persistent macro headwinds, ongoing market recovery in tandem with strong execution and an attractive product pipeline leaves us confident about our future. And lastly, I'm extremely proud of and want to thank our broader ZB team for all that they do. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up, so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator may we have the first question please? \nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Shagun Singh with RBC. \nShagun Singh: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question and congratulations on a strong print here despite a pretty challenging environment. So Bryan and Suky, I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on 2023. Just on the top-line how should we think about the durability of growth? I think last quarter you talked about a 4% floor, but it looks like you have stronger momentum going into next year with a 6% exit rate. And then on margins given the incremental impact you called out from FX and inflation, do you still believe you can drive operating margin expansion next year, or is that going to be more challenging? And then I have a follow-up. \nBryan Hanson: Okay. Two really good questions right out of the gate. So maybe Suky, I'll start with the revenue side of that equation, and then you could answer on the margin side. And certainly any color you want to provide that I might miss feel free to do that. Maybe just to make it simple I'll just start with the end of the story and then I'll get into some of the details around variables that I think are important to consider. But just going to the end of the story, we said that in an undisturbed market we would be disappointed if we couldn't grow 4%. Now I would tell you that we do not see 2023 as a normal market or not a straight market. There's just too many variables moving, but we do see -- we still do see a pathway to 4% growth. So that's kind of the end of the story. Now let's take a look at some of the puts and takes that we have to look at that could either benefit or detract from that. On the positive side of the equation, I'm going to start first with those things that are controllable by our company. There are really three major things that I look at that give me confidence and should give you confidence. Number one, it's around innovation. I'm just going to call it the innovation flywheel here at ZB is really moving in the right direction, and it's creating a solid pipeline that importantly is translating into moving our Vitality Index north and that continues to move north for us and we expect to continue to do that on a go-forward basis. So innovation is a really big part of our confidence. The team is executing. Really strong execution right now and hitting a stride which is important for momentum in the business. And the third one is around a continued focus from this organization on moving our weighted average market growth north through very disciplined portfolio decisions. I'm talking about not just active portfolio management, but truly looking at the way we spend in research and development, commercial infrastructure the way we compensate our people, the way we actively move things out of the portfolio that are not helping our win and move things into the portfolio to do. That has allowed us to increase our weighted average market growth and we're continuing to do so. So those are the positives coming into 2023. From a macro standpoint we have a couple of positives as well. I really look at the backlog of patients in orthopedics as being real. I can't put a number to it, but it's hard to size. It's hard to say when it's going to be impacting the markets the pace that's going to impact the markets. But at some point this has got to begin to work its way through the system and that could provide a tailwind to 2023. And then comps as well in 2023. It's going to be choppy. We've got choppy comps you're going to see differences in growth rates by quarter. But the fact is when I look at the full year, we should look at comps as a slight positive to 2023. And on the negative side it's the stuff that everybody is talking about unfortunately. We do have a very constrained supply challenge situation. And we're managing through it, but it's a tough road. And that's going to continue throughout 2022 -- 2023 we believe. And then staffing and our capacity has continued is not as difficult as it was but that's going to remain a headwind for us in 2023. And then we also look at recession risk on elective procedures particularly if it impacts unemployment. But all that to say 2023 is not a normal year, given all these variables. There's a lot to manage, a lot to think through and lot to contemplate in the way that we set up our guidance range. But based on what I'm seeing today, I expect there to be a four handle in that range which may or may not sound like a lot to people looking at Medtech, but to us knowing where we started that's a pretty significant step-up from where we started the journey and we're proud of it. And again we're just getting started. So that gives you a sense for revenue components and our view on revenue as we come into 2023. And then Suky, I'll pass it to you on the margin side. \nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, Shagun thanks for the question. On the margin side you're right. The macro environment has become incrementally more challenging here in the back half than we originally assumed. That's been reflected in our rest-of-year outlook. And despite those challenges we've been able to raise the back end of our year. So we're pretty proud of that and the team is doing a great job. As that rolls into next year, it has become incrementally more challenging, but we still see a path to maintaining or slightly improving our operating margin versus 2022, despite some of these headwinds. And that assumes current market conditions. If things erode or if things improve, we'll revisit that. But where we are today and assume stability on some of those headwinds, that's how we're thinking about 2023. The biggest move for us really has been around FX. So as you know, we increased our full year outlook by 50 basis points to 550. That means we're exiting the year at 600 basis points of headwind on revenue. That translates to about 300 basis points of headwind into next year. So that's got a pretty significant impact on the top line in absolute dollars. And of course there's a flow-through to margin and to earnings on that. But despite that pretty big drag again, we believe there is a pathway and we're committed to maintaining or growing margins into next year. The other major area you touched on was inflation. Our previous estimate was that we'd have 50 to 100 basis points capitalized out of 2022 into 2023. We're now at the top end of that but still within our overall purview that we gave earlier this year. The real driver of that increase has been less about supply and raw material costs and less about wage and inflation, which were the bigger areas and it's more about higher freight costs right now trending higher as well as energy costs, especially in Europe. But again, at least on the bigger components of that we're starting to see some stabilization. So hopefully, that's a positive light towards the end of the tunnel. And then interest expense. Again just recognizing the higher interest rate environment we're in, we would expect overall interest expense to be modestly higher next year so just making sure that folks have that as an update to their model. But look, we're continuing to address our efficiency programs. We're going deeper and faster. I really want to commend the overall ZB team for embracing these challenges and hitting them head on. They've done a fantastic job. And again just based on that execution and assuming current market conditions hold into 2023, we think we've got a pathway to maintain or slightly improved.\nShagun Singh: That's really helpful. Thank you so much for the color. Just as a follow-up, I was just curious to get your thoughts on portfolio management in the context shift of procedures to the ASC setting. We are hearing about 60% of recon procedures could be done in the ASC setting by 2028 or let's say even by the end of the decade. Any thoughts on that? And are you still under-indexed in that setting? And Thank you so much for taking the questions.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. Thanks. And maybe I'll start off with that, and then Ivan, if you want to weight in feel free to do so. We clearly still see the ASC as an attractive submarket of our recon business and also clearly other parts of our S.E.T. business. It's one of the faster-growth submarkets and we're clearly increasing our focus and spend in that area. And we're doing it in a couple of ways. Number one, we're putting infrastructure in place. We've got dedicated commercial teams that focus only on the ASC. And that's important because you've got to have contracting prowess in that space and we've done that over the last couple of years and really getting good traction as a result of it. Additionally, we're making sure that we scale up in the product categories that the ASC is looking for. We wouldn't have purchased a booms and light company, if we didn't want to have that infrastructure for the ASC. Not to take anything away from booms and lights but it's not an area that we would have waited into, if it wouldn't have given us scale in the ASC marketplace. Same thing in sports acquisitions that we've done in other parts of our business. So we're really doing it two ways: commercial infrastructure, product portfolio, so that we have a broad-based contracting opportunity in the ASC and we're seeing traction as a result of that. We do expect the ASC to continue to move north relative to the number of procedures being done in the ASC versus the hospital. I don't know that I would agree with the numbers you stated. But certainly, we believe that it's going to continue to move north and we want to make sure that we're taking advantage of that. So Ivan, I don't know if you had anything else you want to add.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, I wanted to but I think you covered pretty much everything Bryan. But I do think one of the drivers of having a complete portfolio now is that we have best-in-class contracting. So there were contracts back in 2020 and 2021 that were not a part of Zimmer Biomet was not a part of we're a part of today. So indeed the portfolio that has been remediated the dedicated structure working. And while we don't disclose the specifics in terms of growth we are growing doubl-digit. In the ASC category here in the US, we believe will continue to grow at double-digit rates.\nShagun Singh: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Shagun for the question. Yes. Operator, can we go to the next queue please?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Company.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about the strength you're seeing in the Hip side of your business, particularly as it relates to ROSA pull-through. What are you seeing as it relates to surgeon interest on the Hip side with ROSA and would you say you're still in the early days in terms of that being a tailwind?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. I'll probably pass the -- just that its product related more than anything I'll probably pass it to Ivan to speak to the Hip performance. And also, Ivan maybe speak to some of the things that without too much specificity that we're predicting in the future to help the Hip business as well.\nIvan Tornos: Absolutely. Thank you. Steve, I will just summarize the Hip performance so far, when it comes to robotics at above expectations. We like the fact that this is the only pin-less robotic system in the world. We like the fact that it remains CT scan-less, which is a great advantage for the ASC setting that we're talking about. We've seen versus conventional hip procedures at similar level -- higher level of accuracy in the procedure. So for all the clinical reasons that I'm alluding to, it continues to be a best-in-class product launch. It's going to continue to scale up. We are right now placing installing about 30% of all robotics including Hips in ASC settings, so again a major advantage in settings where time and efficiency makes sense. Beyond robotics, beyond Hip robotics, we\u2019re also excited about other product launches. We have on Hips. I think you might have heard from Bryan in the opening remarks. We've got a partnership in Mixed Reality with a company called Surgical Planning Associates that enables Zimmer Biomet to be the only FDA-approved Mixed Reality platform in hips in the US. What do we saw through Mixed Reality? We get better visibility in hip surgery. We get better accuracy, and overall better efficiency. This is some of the technologies that we're going to be explaining down this week both at Hip as well as Mixed Reality HipInsight but it's a CAGR of other products that continue to have momentum. Continue to perform strongly globally with having a complete -- we believe that we have the best robotic platform with G7 and Arcos. So again, a multiple examples of innovation that are gaining some traction both here in the US and globally.\nSteven Lichtman: Great. Thanks Ivan. And then Suky just a follow-up, thanks for the color on the 2023 inflationary headwinds. Just wondering if you could talk about offsets. You mentioned some of the internal efficiency programs. But what about on pricing, are you seeing any progress on pricing initiatives? Any color you can provide on that and what potential impact they may -- that might have on the offset side?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Thanks for the question, Steven. So, we have so far this year seen an improvement in overall pricing erosion at the company level. Our historic pricing erosion was in the 200 to 300 basis points per year coming into 2022. And so far this year, we're tracking about 100 to 150 basis points. So, there's been some marked improvement. We've been making investments around data and analytics systems, better governance. We've hired additional capabilities. Ivan talked a little bit about contracting. All of these are contributing strategically and tactically to that improved price. As we move into next year, we do expect there to continue to be pricing erosion, but we would hope that and expect it to be at the lower end of our historic average, if not better. So, while we do expect it to be better than where we've been for the last several years, it will still be a headwind year-over-year. Now having said that there are a number of other efficiency programs, that we're targeting to help offset some of these headwinds. Like our new global business services or shared services operating model that we created through the pandemic. We're taking a much more targeted look at country profitability. The product portfolio active portfolio management that Bryan spoke about looking at products that have lower margin lower growth opportunities and thinking differently about those investment profiles, these are all things that are going to help contribute to offset those headwinds.\nSteven Lichtman: Got it. Thanks, Suky.\nKeri Mattox: Steve thanks so much. Yes. And operator, can we go to the next slide in the queue, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next caller from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Bryan, maybe my first one on your 4% for fiscal '23 as a starting point. I'm curious where is that floor assuming? It looks like there is no backlog. Pricing still continues to be a headwind. And it looked like you sounded pretty bullish on new products, but I'm assuming that 4% -- is assuming minimal contribution from new products, could you just go through the assumptions please?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. I think you've kind of laid them out already. When I think about the go-forward-looking revenue growth you're going to have puts and takes. The things that we know are going to be positive for our business will absolutely be innovation. So, when I think about the calculus on revenue growth going forward, there's no question that we've included innovation. We're spending a lot of money and a lot of focus in research and development. We're bringing great products to the market and we absolutely expect that to buoy our revenue growth. That's part of reason why we gain from a 0% growth business in 2017, 2018, and now we're predicting we can get to 4%. So, that's been a big part of that movement. The execution of our team is another part of it. There's no question. I know that it's hard to put a dollar amount on momentum in an organization, but momentum does matter and we have it right now. And the other big one is that weighted average market growth. We have moved our weighted average market growth north during the last five years. So, as we get closer for our weighted average market growth to that 4%. It gives us more confidence that without share taking, we can deliver the 4% in a consistent way. Now, certainly we wouldn't stop there. Active portfolio management is Phase 3 of this organization and we're going to have more financial flexibility going forward. We're going to continue to change that weighted average market growth rate up. But getting to the 4% to start is a good thing. The negatives against that because you're saying okay we've got all these positive and why isn't it more than that? We still have real challenges around supply and that is a distractor for growing your business. And so we're going to have to manage through that as we get through 2023. We believe at least through the middle of 2023 potentially beyond. And even though staffing in our capacity isn't as acute as it was before, it's no question that this is going to be a headwind for us going forward. And of course we have to calculate some potential risk associated with the recession if that does occur. So, I think it's all those things combined in concert with this concept of having some backlog that we're hoping we can count on in 2023. But as of yet, we haven't seen it. Even Q3 which was a great quarter, we still don't believe backlog was consumed. We certainly might have had some backlog in certain areas consumed, but it was offset by some of these negative headwinds that we actually think backlog built in Q3. So, those are the variables that we're looking at as we think about 2023 and beyond. \nVijay Kumar: That's helpful Bryan. And Suky one for you on your free cash flows year-to-date. It's really been impressive up year-on-year free cash conversion north of 80%. You're probably one of a few MedTech companies to have free cash flows up. Is that a timing impact or anything else going on in the free cash flow line item?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, Vijay we did -- we have posted a really good nine months here. I would say there is some timing benefit in the third quarter that will reverse in the fourth quarter. It has to do with some payments around VBP as well as some tax payments that normally would fall in the third quarter but now land in the fourth quarter. All-in-all, I think you nailed it. We're having a pretty good year in cash and we feel confident in our overall range for this year. \nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks guys.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks Vijay. Operator, can we go to the next question?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Hey good morning everybody. I wanted to follow-up a little bit more on the 2023 comments. I think before you said EPS to grow faster than revenue growth. And so now that was with op margins up now margins are kind of flat to slightly improving. So, I'm just curious how we should think about EPS growth now versus the 4% constant currency growth if EPS is still up but probably less than 4%? And I did want to clarify on the interest expense. You had a higher interest expense but I think you have no floating debt. So, just kind of curious what's driving the higher interest expense?\nSuky Upadhyay: Sure. So, Bryan I'll go ahead and take those. So, the one thing to remember on the EPS line is I talked about 300 basis points of headwind on revenue into next year. And so as Bryan thinks -- talks about that 4% on an ex-FX basis, you need to take into consideration the foreign currency headwind that matriculates into next year. So, having said that, with the margins kind of being relatively in line maybe slightly up and with interest expense up year-over-year, which I'll talk about in a moment, you would expect on a reported basis to see EPS kind of travel in line with overall reported revenue. So, hopefully that gives you a little bit more color. Again that's our best view right now. Things can obviously change between now and when we finally give guidance for 2023 in the first quarter of next year. On your question related to interest expense, you're right we are on face value in fixed debt, but we also do and have done some previous strategies to swap out our fixed to floating. So it's really the interest burden on those swaps that create that higher interest expense.\nTravis Steed: Okay. No, that's helpful color. And then -- and Bryan I wanted to ask on M&A. Like you kind of always talked about getting more aggressive with M&A once the market stabilize which it seems like 2023 is a year where we're in a much more \"almost a normal market\". So that's -- willing us to do something on M&A that can maybe move the needle a bit more and more adjacent to the portfolio versus some of the things you've been doing historically with your more smaller private stuff in S.E.T.?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. So first of all, I want to be careful what I say because it's a pretty competitive space right now. We don't want to telegraph too much what we want to do. But clearly, we as an organization are squarely in the Phase 3 of our transformation. And we Travis have been very clear that Phase 3 is all around active portfolio management to transform the portfolio, shifting toward more WAMGR accretive markets and diversifying our business. So that's kind of a broad-based way of looking at what Phase 3 is all about for our company. And we've already made some changes here. I know you're saying there's been smaller acquisitions that we've done, but we haven't had as much firepower obviously. But we have spun businesses out as well that have helped in this strategy. That said, COVID is getting behind us. There's no question. And as a result just exactly the way you're saying we would expect to have more strategic flexibility going forward. What I'd probably be willing to say and maybe not give any more detail is that we're going to look at vetting assets across a few metrics, outside of the typical financial metrics. We look at mission centricity. We've got to make sure that we're acquiring something that can move the mission. We want absolutely something that can drive WAMGR accretion for our organization and it's going to translate into revenue growth that's accretive. Because just because you're in a fast-growth market, if you don't have a good asset you don't necessarily get the growth rate out of it and it's got to accelerate our EPS growth over time because that's kind of the vetting. And then the categories that we're going to look at would be first and foremost, probably closest to the best would be vast growth subcategories of recon. So that would be things like data robotics or building more scale in the ASC setting like we were talking about just a minute ago. It would be faster growth areas outside of recon, but still in orthopedics and that would be mainly in our S.E.T. category. So that diversifies our business away from just recon in those faster-growth subcategories of orthopedics. And then to your point attractive white spaces that are completely out of orthopedics less selective in nature and provide more diversification again out of orthopedics. I don't want to say which of those we're going to prioritize, but just know that all of those vectors are on the table and we're looking at a number of assets in each of those categories.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks for the color.\nBryan Hanson: Absolutely.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks. And operator, I think we can go on to the next question in the queue.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a good quarter. Maybe to start Bryan, I'd love to hear a little bit more about what you're seeing on the capital equipment environment. I know it's a smaller overall component for Zimmer Biomet. But you talked about lower capital sales in the quarter. It sounded like it was a bit more placement versus upfront sales. But any color on ROSA, what you're seeing if it's different US versus US? And how you expect that to trend going forward over the next 12, 18 months?\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. I'll make some comments and then Ivan can correct anything I say incorrectly. But clearly capital is not as big a component for us. So I almost don't like talking about the capital market because I don't want to say anything that's going to hurt those businesses that depend more on the capital market. But from our perspective, where we do focus on it, it hasn't been a major barrier for us. Again, we really focus on from a ROSA perspective trying to place through agreements that allow for payment for the ROSA system through commitments and increased business. Consider a leasing arrangement, but the leasing payment is actually a commitment of business. That is what we focus on and we did more of those in the quarter and that's a good thing for our business. But we do have opportunities to continue to sell and we do not feel at this point anyway serious constraints in the capital market when it comes to ROSA. But maybe Ivan, if you've got any further color to provide around that you can help as well.\nIvan Tornos: Absolutely, Bryan. And good morning, Robbie. I'm pretty sure that correcting my boss publicly is a bad career move. So I'm not going to correct him. Mr. Bryan, your answer is very right. The only thing, I'll add is that, it is really a global performance. So 50% of the installations are in the US, 50% are oUS. as I referenced earlier around 30% of are robots are going to the ASC, and that segment is growing, and we've seen exciting momentum with the hip software. So I would say, all in all our robotic installations placement sales are in line. They continue to move in the right direction. And as we enter Q4, we're very excited about, where we are from a ROSA standpoint. \nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks. Maybe as a follow-up, I think Bryan you said, last quarter extremities grew double digits. This \u2013 a little less visibility in this line item. Anything you could give us on extremities? I know, sports medicine has the HA reimbursement changes, so that there's some pressure there. But any color on what we're seeing in extremities versus trauma and sports and how that might shake out US, APAC, EMEA? Thanks.\nBryan Hanson: Yeah, no problem. So maybe just as a quick reminder for everybody. When we think about our S.E.T. businesses and there's really no proxy for S.E.T. in other businesses, because we have different categories in it than others would probably consider. We have the upper extremities business inside of S.E.T. trauma; CMFT, which is our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic business; sports; separate from sports would be restorative therapies; and then foot and ankle. Those are the categories that we manage across the S.E.T. categories. The pressure that you were talking about in restorative therapies would be separate from sports, but it's still in the S.E.T. categories. On areas that we really focus, and invest in our growth drivers would be upper extremities, CMFT and sports. It doesn't mean the other businesses aren't important they just don't get the same level of resourcing at this point. And those three that we do concentrate on did have another good quarter. And if I look at all three of them, without giving specifics, I would say, they ranged anywhere from mid-single digits to double-digit growth again this quarter. So in the areas, where we're concentrating, there's no question that we're getting the performance in the field. A lot of that has to do with commercial infrastructure, and then the incremental support that we're giving in research and development to those areas. And of course, the acquisitions that we've been tucking in to drive a more fulsome portfolio. What you're seeing relative to pressure in the quarter for the global S.E.T. business it really has more to do with what Suky said in the prepared remarks around Asia Pacific pressure and trauma, mainly associated with VBP, which we'll reverse next quarter. And then that restored therapies pressure from a reimbursement change in G1. And unfortunately, that will carry through to the middle of 2023 or so.\nRobbie Marcus: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Sure.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Robbie. Operator, can we go to the next question in the queue, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Joanne Wuensch with Citibank.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning, and thank you so much for taking the question. I wonder, if you can step back a little bit and talk about the orthopedics markets, what you're viewing as maybe changes or no changes in the competitive landscape maybe something in physician practices pricing, or generally, what you think of as sort of the state of the union? Thanks.\nBryan Hanson: That's a great question. It's an interesting question. I think, what I'll probably do is again maybe start off on some of the things that I'm seeing that, I think are interesting. And then Ivan, Suky, Keri anybody who wants to add anything, because I think it's a really interesting question. It's a good one. My view in part the thing that, I like the most that, I'm seeing kind of state of the union that you're saying is just the rapid adoption in open arms that, I'm seeing from an orthopedics customer perspective to technology. There was a lot of question marks in my mind coming over to orthopedics, on whether or not that transition could truly occur. We saw it with Mako obviously in robotics but we're bringing a lot of other technologies to bear. And I've been very excited to see all companies kind of doubling down on the technology front robotics and data. We're all moving in that direction. And I'm hearing from our customer base that, they're looking for it and very importantly willing to pay for the value that it brings. That's really important, because if that type of innovation comes into a marketplace, particularly in medtech, it usually doesn't leave. And when you do bring that kind of technology, it is more sticky than previous technology and it does have the ability to impact pricing dynamics. Because the more technology that has stickiness to it the longer the term contracts, and the better stability you have in pricing. And you also get this benefit of increased, let's call it share of wallet or mix for every procedure. So if you can bring technology in to the very same procedure you had yesterday, you get more revenue for that procedure. And as we see that adoption continue to move up of things like robotics and data or cementless technologies in knee that actually allows a mix benefit for the entire market, and that could buoy the overall market growth rate. Taking pricing, stability, moving that forward, bringing more revenue per procedure that has a real positive effect for the overall orthopedic space. And so that's a dynamic that's happening real-time that's pretty exciting in my view anyway. But I'll open it up to anyone else if you want to add anything.\nIvan Tornos: Maybe quickly here Bryan I'll just recap some of what you said in four bullet points here. Number one, as it was mentioned earlier, the shift of care on to the ASC and frankly in some cases something getting on a home like physical therapy is real. No longer it's all about the inpatient unit, there's a real shift of care again to ASC, and then post-surgery some of the stuff getting down a home. So that's number one. Number two, clearly the decision maker is not just the physician or the provider. The patient plays a role that's why we're excited the best technologies that we're launching that directly target consumers, patients. So it's not only just the physician and provider, it's basically physician, provider and payer. Some of the data and the technology that Bryan is talking about becomes really a powerful tool for us to engage payers in demonstrating that we are not just a solid clinical value proposition, but also an economic value proposition. Number three, and I think this is aligned with the pricing story there is an emphasis in discussing value just as much as pricing. Some of the discussions that we're having today around length of stay, reducing length of stay, some of the discussions we're having around lowering readmission rates, increasing patient satisfaction, having a shorter surgery with the same outcomes were not discussions that were happening maybe three years ago and they're happening right now. And then number four, the role of innovation. I've been in med-tech for 28 years. I was working in orthopedics 15 years ago. When I rejoined or when I joined orthopedics again four years ago, I would say that things were pretty much the same, net of a couple of robotic introductions. Over the last three, four years we've seen a lot of innovation coming to orthopedics in mixed reality, in infection management, in bringing machine learning, really thinking about the entire organization [ph]. So I would say those are the four key things that we pay attention to and we think we'll have a competitive advantage in those areas. \nJoanne Wuensch: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.\nRichard Newitter: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just follow-up first, Bryan on what you were talking about on some of the pricing opportunities you mentioned with new technology. Mixed reality, smart implants, I'm curious within the buckets of mixed, the ability just to preserve your pricing as contracts roll off and discrete opportunities to charge for some of these newer areas, particularly on that third bucket, can you give some examples of where these new technologies might be able to fall into that third category, or which of those buckets should we expect more of the pricing impact from?\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. It's -- make sure that I understand your question specifically. But when I think about the innovation that we're bringing -- and not just us by the way. That's what I like about it there's momentum across the entire orthopedic space and all the major players moving in this direction. I think in certain areas we're ahead. But make no mistake everyone is moving in this direction. So if I just take a couple of examples and hopefully this will answer the question that you're asking. Think about mymobility for instance, which is one of the first launches that we had in data collection, leveraging the relationship that we have with Apple. This uses an Apple Watch to collect data and then ultimately uses machine learning to be able to do some predictive analysis. And we're actually now looking at that through an opportunity to tell a surgeon and the patient when they're falling out of the norm for recovery. So that's the type of thing that we're able to do. And we do sell that. So there's an opportunity to monetize that application. So it's not just giving it to them and getting pull-through of implants, it certainly is getting the pull-through of implants because you get that natural gravitational pull once you bring technology in, but there's also a discrete way of making money or monetizing that mymobility application. So that's one example. Another example is robotics. I mean, robotics comes in you get that natural gravitational pull for competitive surgeons to come over, but you also get an uplift every time they use a robotic procedure because you get the uptick in disposable value. So that procedure now cost more for the account to do, but you get the benefit of robotics inside of that. So it's a fair trade. Those are two examples of the way technology is leaning in, in that way. Same thing with Persona IQ. That's the first smart implant that will be on the market. It's collecting data in a very compliant way, because you can't take it off. They're nonstop for the patient. And that will also drive a premium in the marketplace. So if you're going to use Persona IQ, you're going to pay discretely for that that sensor capability. And that's the way we're monetizing this. So you could see a combination of things where we monetize the technology or sometimes it just brings value that is unique to us that would allow us to pull in additional implants. But it's some combination of those two things. And again, Ivan, if you wanted to add anything else or Suky or anybody else.\nIvan Tornos: I think you've done a very good job, Bryan. We can get our next question.\nRichard Newitter: Great. And just on Persona IQ it seems like the infection prevention capability or the ability to detect the infection before it occurs, that's probably going to be the killer app for a product like that that will allow you to get that kind of premium. I guess, what should we think of timelines on the data collection to be able to get an approval for infection prevention indication?\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. What I've learned over the years is committing to timelines in a situation like this is always a bad idea. What I can say is that we are absolutely sprinting and using our limited launch focused on, getting users that will use significant quantities and be able to collect data with us so that we can ultimately look for different ways of providing insights that will matter to our customers. The things that we want to focus on first would be what are those things that we could predict that will obviously be good for the patient, but also derail the cost associated with caring for the patients, so reduce the cost of caring for the patients? And in infection is great. If you could get there, that's fantastic. If we could predict a risk of infection before it occurs, that would be fantastic. Certainly something that we're going to be looking to do but it doesn't happen very often. So you just think about the power, the number of patients you're going to have to have and the amount of data it's going to take us a little longer to get there. What we're also going to be looking at though is just loosening, which also happens. Can we predict loosening before it happens? You're looking at stiffening. There are certain things you've got to do from a stiffening perspective that if we can get out ahead of we can reduce the amount of care that needs to be provided to the patient. So there's, a lot of other things that we're looking at to try to predict that will derail, the cost or reduce the cost of caring for the patient and make sure for better outcomes for the patient. So I don't want people to get hyper focused on infection. It's something that we're going to pursue. It will take longer. But the real goal right now is to be able to look at the data that we're collecting which is significant already, and then be able to derive those insights that will change the way we care for our patient. Once we get to those we can define those that will really begin to bolster that value proposition that we have for the product and be able to support a higher price point for Persona IQ.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Sure.\nKeri Mattox: Operator, should we go to the next person in the queue?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeff Johnson: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning guys. Bryan maybe even building further out on this pricing discussion, I think it's all interesting stuff and the premiums you can get on new technologies on sensor-based technologies moving that mix higher and all that that all makes sense. I'm more interested or equally interested I guess I should say on kind of your base business. I don't know what your Vitality Index is right now but let's say 70% or 80% of your revenue is generated on products that are a few years or older in the portfolio, where are hospitals that in understanding that they can't keep extracting two or three points of price even out of those base products every single year if you're going to continue to invest and develop this new technology in that, or are those conversations with hospitals improving at all in this -- especially in this inflationary environment?\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. Probably what I'll do is I'll turn this one over to Suky, because we don't look at pricing just through one vector one lens. There's, multiple variables that we have in that equation that we think are going to benefit the company going forward. But maybe Suky, you could talk about the variables that we do look at when we think about pricing and I know Ivan probably have some color as well you want to provide. \nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. So we do think overall that this can help pricing discussions. They're becoming much more strategic in nature and more centered around value. We're not completely there where we want to be, but we're starting the dialogue more around value versus just straight price and transactions. But maybe Ivan, do you want to talk a little bit, because I know you've got some real world experience. \nIvan Tornos : Yes, absolutely. It's a real discussion. It's happening Jeff in pretty much every country. As you think about our Vitality Index, there is a direct correlation between improvements in Vitality Index percentage of sales coming from new products and stability around price. And it may not be mixed the product launch itself that you launch in a given year. But as you launch as an example Persona IQ that creates a category contracting opportunity where we contract that for the rest of the portfolio in knees, they've got to keep a certain price. And again, that is a real discussion one very real example of how we think about it. We do that in knees. We do that in hips across the board. So, again, a very direct correlation between new product introductions Vitality Index and keeping the price premiums for the product a couple of years later, but also for the category of products in a given space. \nJeff Johnson: Yes. That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up, and I think Suky it's probably for you. But as I think about this placement strategy with ROSA kind of how the market has shifted over the last six to 12 months to more of a placement strategy and it sounds like that's probably going to continue at least for the foreseeable future. When do we get that crossover where the minimum purchase commitments maybe the minimum price points things like that that are guaranteed in those contracts those start to outweigh on the good guy side versus, I'm sure, which are some upfront costs you're having to eat here on this placement strategy and it's probably not helpful in the very short run on the margins things like that? So just when does that crossover happen that the longer tail of those positives really start to kick in? Thanks.\nSuky Upadhyay: I'll start with it and turn over to Ivan. You're thinking about it the right way right? Upfront here there is some investment relative to those placements, because we start that depreciation and you really haven't ramped up that overall growth commitment. We're still in the early innings on that, but maybe Ivan do you want to talk a little bit? \nIvan Tornos : Yes. I would say the governance when it comes to robotics is second to none. So when we do install place our robotic unit in any center globally there is a minimum commitment of cases that the center has to perform where we take the unit back. One reason is financial. The other reason perhaps more important is from a compliance standpoint giving fair market value exchanges, we cannot have capital equipment in centers that are not delivering on the contracted number of cases. That's why we keep talking about how we prefer to place units versus semi units so we get the annuity. On the other side of the question, as we think about those cases, there is also a governance around disposables. There is zero latitude when it comes to pricing discounts on the disposables, the peripheral items that are part of that robotic case. So again, I would say that the robotic governance is second to none and really early innings here in terms of where we are in the journey.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think, operator, we have time for maybe one more. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. \nMatthew O'Brien : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just -- and maybe I'll just stick with one. And Bryan, I just want to put a finer point on this top line number that you're talking about for next year. First of all, is that 4% kind of the floor that you're thinking about for the business next year? And just as I think about the components that you're talking about between VBP and pricing and ASCs, et cetera, it just seems like the environment for hips and knees specifically is going to get more robust or really levered two Hips and Knees. So, why wouldn't 4% be the floor? And is there potential for some meaningful upside to that, as we head into next year? Thanks.\nBryan Hanson: Okay. The positive news is, that's the question I'm getting not a question of whether we could deliver the 4%. So we're making progress there. I would say, that I still think that as I talked about before there are a lot of headwinds that we have to pay attention to. And so, I don't want to say that -- first of all, we're giving more color than we would ever give in a normal year, just given all the challenges that everybody is facing trying to help you out here. But I would say, 4% is a number that I'm saying is doable we see a pathway to 4%. But make no mistake, that there are challenges that are out in the market macro challenges, not things that are internal to our own organization that could stress that. And there are opportunities from a macro perspective, that we just talked about that could also help that. So we're trying to take a balanced view, of what could happen positive or negative to what we think organically, we can do in 2023.  And that's the reason why, I would say, for 4% you should not consider a floor. 4% you should consider a good way to look at all things considered, a fair way to look at growth in 2023. And by the way if 2023 was just a normal year, and we didn't have all these noises, we believe that 4% is about the right way to think about our business. Given all the portfolio moves that we've made the WAMGR, improvements that we've made the innovation flywheel that we're now moving we believe, that's what we deserve. Could we do more than that? Certainly. Particularly, as we start to continue to move our active portfolio management strategy, we have more financial flexibility and we continue to move that weighted average market growth rate north. But, I don't want people thinking that I mean 4% as a floor. I didn't mean to attend that. \nQ \u2013 Matthew O'Brien: Understood. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Sure.\nEnd of Q&A:\nKeri Mattox: All right. Operator, I think we're a little past 9:30, unless there's any closing remarks. So Bryan, anything you'd add we're probably good to end the call.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. I'd probably just add, I think I want people to continue to focus on the transformation that has occurred at Zimmer Biomet. We've been extremely disciplined in our portfolio decisions. And portfolio to me is, in all aspects of the business. We are biasing our spend whether it be research and development, commercial infrastructure, the way we compensate people in active portfolio management through M&A, on ensuring that we're increasing the weighted average market growth of our business and diversifying our business over time. That is happening. It has already happened and more of it will happen on a go-forward basis. And I keep talking about that innovation flywheel, but that was nonexistent just a few years ago. The Vitality Index is moving in the right direction in a rapid way, and we expect that to continue. All of that combined with the execution that we're seeing from the field is putting us in a good place, in a very challenging market. So I guess, I'll leave it with that Keri. \nKeri Mattox: Thanks so much, Bryan. And thanks everyone, for joining the call this morning. Of course, if you have questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team. I know we'll speak to many of you today. So thanks for joining.\nOperator: Thank you, again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks Bryan and good morning. Overall, we delivered another good quarter driven by strong execution and continued recovery of elective procedures. While we continue to navigate challenges our third quarter performance gives us the confidence to raise our full year financial guidance.  With that I'll turn to our third quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the third quarter of 2022 and how it compares to the same period in 2021. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted continuing operations basis.  Net sales in the third quarter were $1.670 billion, a decrease of 0.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 5% on a constant currency basis. US sales grew 3.2% driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in our Knee and Hip businesses. This was partially offset by expected declines in the S.E.T. and other categories.  International sales grew 7.3% driven by strong procedure volumes across most markets in EMEA and APAC in tandem with lighter comps and continued strong commercial execution. EMEA performed better than expected driven by recovery in developed markets and continued strength in emerging markets and APAC performed better than expected with China largely inline with expectations and strength in Japan.  Turning to our business category performance. Global Knees grew 7.2% with US Knees up 7.3% and International Knees up 7%. The strong performance was driven by knee procedure recovery across most regions and easier comps along with continued global traction of our Persona Knee System especially with Persona Revision in the US and continue to increase in ROSA procedure penetration and pull-through.  Global Hips grew 10.5% with U.S. Hips up 5.3% and International Hips up 15.5% driven by strong international procedure recovery and an easier comp outside of the US. Continued traction across key Hip products including the G7 Revision System and Avenir Complete Primary Hip which is focused on the direct interior surgical approach.  And lastly continued solid ROSA pull-through in the hip category especially in the US. The sports extremities and trauma category declined 2.1% and was impacted by a tough comp in 2021 and the expected pressure around VBP which is expected to reverse in Q4 and reimbursement headwinds in US restorative therapies that will anniversary in mid-2023. Within the category, we continued to deliver strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine and upper extremities. Finally, our other category declined 0.4% driven by tough comps and expected lower capital sales related to a higher mix of ROSA placements versus upfront sales. Moving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77 in the third quarter of 2021. The increase was driven by a decline in litigation related expenses and a tax benefit in the quarter from a favorable tax liability outcome. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.58 represents a decrease from $1.71 in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted gross margin was 70.7% in line with expectations. As previously discussed, heightened inflationary pressure will drive full year gross margins to be slightly down when compared to the prior year. As previously noted, increasing input costs from this year will pull-through into 2023 and we now expect the headwind from inflation in 2023 to be at the upper end of our previously communicated 50 to 100 basis point range. Our adjusted operating expenses were $742 million, an increase versus the prior year due to inflationary pressures and higher investments into R&D to support future product launches. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.3%, a 200-basis point decline from the prior year and largely driven by increased inflationary pressures and continued investments into the pipeline and product portfolio. Despite ongoing macro headwinds, we continue to expect our efficiency programs to drive improved second half operating margins versus the first half of the year with a step-up in the fourth quarter in tandem with higher revenue. The adjusted tax rate was 16.3% in the quarter in line with our expectations. Turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $451 million and free cash flow totaled $332 million for the quarter. We reduced our debt by about $160 million in the third quarter excluding the effects of foreign currency and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of about $545 million. On a related note, despite a higher interest rate environment in 2022, interest expense is expected to be broadly in line with our previous expectations for the year. However, we would expect a step-up of interest expense into 2023. We have made significant progress in strengthening our balance sheet through improved financial performance and ongoing debt reduction, ultimately providing greater strategic flexibility for the company. Moving on to our updated financial outlook for the year. Constant currency revenue growth is now expected to be 5.5% to 6.5% versus 2021 with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind based on recent spot rates of 550 basis points versus our previous assumption of 500 basis points. This means that reported revenue growth will be in the range of 0% to 1% versus 2021. Also related to revenue, based on the recent spot rates, we estimate that the strengthening of the dollar through 2022 will create about a 300-basis point headwind to revenue growth in 2023. Additionally, we are tightening our expected adjusted diluted EPS range to $6.80 to $6.90. All other metrics in our 2022 financial guidance remain unchanged from our second quarter update. As a reminder, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be slightly higher than the third quarter due in part to a tailwind related to Q4 2021 VBP charges that will be partially offset by about one-day selling day headwind. In summary, we had another solid quarter underpinned by market recovery and good execution and we are pleased to again raise our full year outlook. While we expect to have to continue to navigate a number of persistent macro headwinds, ongoing market recovery in tandem with strong execution and an attractive product pipeline leaves us confident about our future. And lastly, I'm extremely proud of and want to thank our broader ZB team for all that they do. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, Shagun thanks for the question. On the margin side you're right. The macro environment has become incrementally more challenging here in the back half than we originally assumed. That's been reflected in our rest-of-year outlook. And despite those challenges we've been able to raise the back end of our year. So we're pretty proud of that and the team is doing a great job. As that rolls into next year, it has become incrementally more challenging, but we still see a path to maintaining or slightly improving our operating margin versus 2022, despite some of these headwinds. And that assumes current market conditions. If things erode or if things improve, we'll revisit that. But where we are today and assume stability on some of those headwinds, that's how we're thinking about 2023. The biggest move for us really has been around FX. So as you know, we increased our full year outlook by 50 basis points to 550. That means we're exiting the year at 600 basis points of headwind on revenue. That translates to about 300 basis points of headwind into next year. So that's got a pretty significant impact on the top line in absolute dollars. And of course there's a flow-through to margin and to earnings on that. But despite that pretty big drag again, we believe there is a pathway and we're committed to maintaining or growing margins into next year. The other major area you touched on was inflation. Our previous estimate was that we'd have 50 to 100 basis points capitalized out of 2022 into 2023. We're now at the top end of that but still within our overall purview that we gave earlier this year. The real driver of that increase has been less about supply and raw material costs and less about wage and inflation, which were the bigger areas and it's more about higher freight costs right now trending higher as well as energy costs, especially in Europe. But again, at least on the bigger components of that we're starting to see some stabilization. So hopefully, that's a positive light towards the end of the tunnel. And then interest expense. Again just recognizing the higher interest rate environment we're in, we would expect overall interest expense to be modestly higher next year so just making sure that folks have that as an update to their model. But look, we're continuing to address our efficiency programs. We're going deeper and faster. I really want to commend the overall ZB team for embracing these challenges and hitting them head on. They've done a fantastic job. And again just based on that execution and assuming current market conditions hold into 2023, we think we've got a pathway to maintain or slightly improved. Yes. Thanks for the question, Steven. So, we have so far this year seen an improvement in overall pricing erosion at the company level. Our historic pricing erosion was in the 200 to 300 basis points per year coming into 2022. And so far this year, we're tracking about 100 to 150 basis points. So, there's been some marked improvement. We've been making investments around data and analytics systems, better governance. We've hired additional capabilities. Ivan talked a little bit about contracting. All of these are contributing strategically and tactically to that improved price. As we move into next year, we do expect there to continue to be pricing erosion, but we would hope that and expect it to be at the lower end of our historic average, if not better. So, while we do expect it to be better than where we've been for the last several years, it will still be a headwind year-over-year. Now having said that there are a number of other efficiency programs, that we're targeting to help offset some of these headwinds. Like our new global business services or shared services operating model that we created through the pandemic. We're taking a much more targeted look at country profitability. The product portfolio active portfolio management that Bryan spoke about looking at products that have lower margin lower growth opportunities and thinking differently about those investment profiles, these are all things that are going to help contribute to offset those headwinds. Yes, Vijay we did -- we have posted a really good nine months here. I would say there is some timing benefit in the third quarter that will reverse in the fourth quarter. It has to do with some payments around VBP as well as some tax payments that normally would fall in the third quarter but now land in the fourth quarter. All-in-all, I think you nailed it. We're having a pretty good year in cash and we feel confident in our overall range for this year. Yes, thank you. Sure. So, Bryan I'll go ahead and take those. So, the one thing to remember on the EPS line is I talked about 300 basis points of headwind on revenue into next year. And so as Bryan thinks -- talks about that 4% on an ex-FX basis, you need to take into consideration the foreign currency headwind that matriculates into next year. So, having said that, with the margins kind of being relatively in line maybe slightly up and with interest expense up year-over-year, which I'll talk about in a moment, you would expect on a reported basis to see EPS kind of travel in line with overall reported revenue. So, hopefully that gives you a little bit more color. Again that's our best view right now. Things can obviously change between now and when we finally give guidance for 2023 in the first quarter of next year. On your question related to interest expense, you're right we are on face value in fixed debt, but we also do and have done some previous strategies to swap out our fixed to floating. So it's really the interest burden on those swaps that create that higher interest expense. Yes. So we do think overall that this can help pricing discussions. They're becoming much more strategic in nature and more centered around value. We're not completely there where we want to be, but we're starting the dialogue more around value versus just straight price and transactions. But maybe Ivan, do you want to talk a little bit, because I know you've got some real world experience. I'll start with it and turn over to Ivan. You're thinking about it the right way right? Upfront here there is some investment relative to those placements, because we start that depreciation and you really haven't ramped up that overall growth commitment. We're still in the early innings on that, but maybe Ivan do you want to talk a little bit?"

            "content": "Yes, I wanted to but I think you covered pretty much everything Bryan. But I do think one of the drivers of having a complete portfolio now is that we have best-in-class contracting. So there were contracts back in 2020 and 2021 that were not a part of Zimmer Biomet was not a part of we're a part of today. So indeed the portfolio that has been remediated the dedicated structure working. And while we don't disclose the specifics in terms of growth we are growing doubl-digit. In the ASC category here in the US, we believe will continue to grow at double-digit rates. Absolutely. Thank you. Steve, I will just summarize the Hip performance so far, when it comes to robotics at above expectations. We like the fact that this is the only pin-less robotic system in the world. We like the fact that it remains CT scan-less, which is a great advantage for the ASC setting that we're talking about. We've seen versus conventional hip procedures at similar level -- higher level of accuracy in the procedure. So for all the clinical reasons that I'm alluding to, it continues to be a best-in-class product launch. It's going to continue to scale up. We are right now placing installing about 30% of all robotics including Hips in ASC settings, so again a major advantage in settings where time and efficiency makes sense. Beyond robotics, beyond Hip robotics, we're also excited about other product launches. We have on Hips. I think you might have heard from Bryan in the opening remarks. We've got a partnership in Mixed Reality with a company called Surgical Planning Associates that enables Zimmer Biomet to be the only FDA-approved Mixed Reality platform in hips in the US. What do we saw through Mixed Reality? We get better visibility in hip surgery. We get better accuracy, and overall better efficiency. This is some of the technologies that we're going to be explaining down this week both at Hip as well as Mixed Reality HipInsight but it's a CAGR of other products that continue to have momentum. Continue to perform strongly globally with having a complete -- we believe that we have the best robotic platform with G7 and Arcos. So again, a multiple examples of innovation that are gaining some traction both here in the US and globally. Absolutely, Bryan. And good morning, Robbie. I'm pretty sure that correcting my boss publicly is a bad career move. So I'm not going to correct him. Mr. Bryan, your answer is very right. The only thing, I'll add is that, it is really a global performance. So 50% of the installations are in the US, 50% are oUS. as I referenced earlier around 30% of are robots are going to the ASC, and that segment is growing, and we've seen exciting momentum with the hip software. So I would say, all in all our robotic installations placement sales are in line. They continue to move in the right direction. And as we enter Q4, we're very excited about, where we are from a ROSA standpoint. Maybe quickly here Bryan I'll just recap some of what you said in four bullet points here. Number one, as it was mentioned earlier, the shift of care on to the ASC and frankly in some cases something getting on a home like physical therapy is real. No longer it's all about the inpatient unit, there's a real shift of care again to ASC, and then post-surgery some of the stuff getting down a home. So that's number one. Number two, clearly the decision maker is not just the physician or the provider. The patient plays a role that's why we're excited the best technologies that we're launching that directly target consumers, patients. So it's not only just the physician and provider, it's basically physician, provider and payer. Some of the data and the technology that Bryan is talking about becomes really a powerful tool for us to engage payers in demonstrating that we are not just a solid clinical value proposition, but also an economic value proposition. Number three, and I think this is aligned with the pricing story there is an emphasis in discussing value just as much as pricing. Some of the discussions that we're having today around length of stay, reducing length of stay, some of the discussions we're having around lowering readmission rates, increasing patient satisfaction, having a shorter surgery with the same outcomes were not discussions that were happening maybe three years ago and they're happening right now. And then number four, the role of innovation. I've been in med-tech for 28 years. I was working in orthopedics 15 years ago. When I rejoined or when I joined orthopedics again four years ago, I would say that things were pretty much the same, net of a couple of robotic introductions. Over the last three, four years we've seen a lot of innovation coming to orthopedics in mixed reality, in infection management, in bringing machine learning, really thinking about the entire organization [ph]. So I would say those are the four key things that we pay attention to and we think we'll have a competitive advantage in those areas. I think you've done a very good job, Bryan. We can get our next question. Yes, absolutely. It's a real discussion. It's happening Jeff in pretty much every country. As you think about our Vitality Index, there is a direct correlation between improvements in Vitality Index percentage of sales coming from new products and stability around price. And it may not be mixed the product launch itself that you launch in a given year. But as you launch as an example Persona IQ that creates a category contracting opportunity where we contract that for the rest of the portfolio in knees, they've got to keep a certain price. And again, that is a real discussion one very real example of how we think about it. We do that in knees. We do that in hips across the board. So, again, a very direct correlation between new product introductions Vitality Index and keeping the price premiums for the product a couple of years later, but also for the category of products in a given space. Yes. I would say the governance when it comes to robotics is second to none. So when we do install place our robotic unit in any center globally there is a minimum commitment of cases that the center has to perform where we take the unit back. One reason is financial. The other reason perhaps more important is from a compliance standpoint giving fair market value exchanges, we cannot have capital equipment in centers that are not delivering on the contracted number of cases. That's why we keep talking about how we prefer to place units versus semi units so we get the annuity. On the other side of the question, as we think about those cases, there is also a governance around disposables. There is zero latitude when it comes to pricing discounts on the disposables, the peripheral items that are part of that robotic case. So again, I would say that the robotic governance is second to none and really early innings here in terms of where we are in the journey."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "Thanks, Keri, and thanks for joining us for the call this morning. We've got three sections of the call. First, I'm going to briefly talk about our Q3 performance and really the momentum that we saw in Q3 that has allowed us to increase our outlook for the year and doing so, even in the face of some pretty meaningful macro pressures that we're certainly still facing. I also want to spend time talking about our ZB innovation. This is clearly the driver of our continued strong performance and will be the driver as we go forward. And for the second section, Suky will provide more detail on the quarter, but probably more importantly, our 2022 guidance update. And then we'll close things out by addressing any questions you might have. Before I get started on Q3, I just want to make sure that I take a minute to say thank you. Thank you to the ZB team members that I know are listening. I know a lot of you listen to the call and I appreciate that. Your continued strong performance is -- it's just built on day-in and day-out execution. You're just focused on driving results. And I know you're showing up and facing some very, very real macro challenges right now and I appreciate it. The fact is I'm just really proud that even in the face of these challenges, you're delivering results for our customers, you're delivering results for our patients and for our shareholders and you're moving the mission of this company forward every single day. I know it's not easy but I promise you it is much appreciated. Okay. So turning to the third quarter. Although, the beginning of the quarter was a bit choppy when it comes to procedure cancellations, we did see very nice improvement throughout the quarter and we finished strong. And that execution and recovery occurred in all of our regions, but especially in our OUS regions, with both EMEA and APAC performing better than our expectations. Inside of this, we saw good momentum in our large joints business, with our knee franchise growing in the high single digits and our hip business growing just above 10%. And as you've seen, this was somewhat offset by the telegraphed and expected pressure in our S.E.T. business and our other category. Now, although, we did see the strength in the quarter, we continue to face significant challenges across foreign currency, supply, inflation and staffing. That said, the team has been able to navigate these challenges and mitigate their impact. You can't completely eliminate them, but they've certainly mitigated their impact. And they've done this through operational and commercial discipline, as well as driving our innovation in the field. And as a result, our confidence continues to grow and you see that reflected in our updated financial guidance. In short, our underlying business is clearly strong and I truly do believe it's getting stronger. Just as an example, when we look at the quarter, we announced a first-of-its-kind three-year agreement with Hospital for Special Surgery, or HSS. The partnership creates HSS/Zimmer Biomet Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence in Robotic Joint Replacement. We're focused here with HSS to develop new tools that will be powered by AI to provide data-driven recommendations or insights to surgeons for robotic-assisted joint surgery. It's really -- it's a big deal. It's -- we're clearly very excited about it. We really do believe this is a future of medicine opportunity and we're excited to be involved with HSS. In our Q3, our new product pipeline continue to deliver as well. While it's early, we are definitely excited about the launch of HipInsight. This is the first FDA-cleared mixed-reality navigation system for total hip replacement. HipInsight is the latest addition to our OptiVu portfolio and it further expands our ZBEdge suite of solutions.  Additionally, we announced the FDA clearance of our Identity Shoulder System. This is a technology that has proprietary capability of aligning each surgeon's approach to an individual patient's anatomy. All of this with the goal first and foremost of alleviating pain, but also optimizing the range of motion for that patient. And I got to tell you our existing product portfolio kept up the momentum as well.  Demand continues for ROSA both in knee and hip. Persona Revision traction in the US remained strong and our limited launch of Persona iQ is driving positive feedback and interest and we're focused on aggressive data collection, so that we can establish clinical use benefits.  And we expect to build on this momentum with new product launches in the coming months including as we've talked about our new Persona cementless form factor additional launches in our S.E.T. category and a hip product launch that we're excited about in early 2023. And I can tell you that all of these product innovations coupled with our ongoing efforts to reshape our business and accelerate ZB's transformation position us very well for future growth. We continue to strive to be a best and preferred place to work for our team members and we continue to strive to be a top quartile performer for our shareholders and to be a trusted partner to all of our stakeholders, but in particular our customers and our patients. Just in summary we're navigating and really managing through some very real macro headwinds that are definitely muting our growth. But we're also seeing an offset via COVID recovery very strong execution from the team and meaningful innovation in the field and against that backdrop our team continues to execute our strategy and I feel increasingly confident about our future as a company.  And with that I'm going to turn it to Suky to talk more in depth about Q3 and give you an outlook for 2022 guidance. Okay Suky. Okay. Two really good questions right out of the gate. So maybe Suky, I'll start with the revenue side of that equation, and then you could answer on the margin side. And certainly any color you want to provide that I might miss feel free to do that. Maybe just to make it simple I'll just start with the end of the story and then I'll get into some of the details around variables that I think are important to consider. But just going to the end of the story, we said that in an undisturbed market we would be disappointed if we couldn't grow 4%. Now I would tell you that we do not see 2023 as a normal market or not a straight market. There's just too many variables moving, but we do see -- we still do see a pathway to 4% growth. So that's kind of the end of the story. Now let's take a look at some of the puts and takes that we have to look at that could either benefit or detract from that. On the positive side of the equation, I'm going to start first with those things that are controllable by our company. There are really three major things that I look at that give me confidence and should give you confidence. Number one, it's around innovation. I'm just going to call it the innovation flywheel here at ZB is really moving in the right direction, and it's creating a solid pipeline that importantly is translating into moving our Vitality Index north and that continues to move north for us and we expect to continue to do that on a go-forward basis. So innovation is a really big part of our confidence. The team is executing. Really strong execution right now and hitting a stride which is important for momentum in the business. And the third one is around a continued focus from this organization on moving our weighted average market growth north through very disciplined portfolio decisions. I'm talking about not just active portfolio management, but truly looking at the way we spend in research and development, commercial infrastructure the way we compensate our people, the way we actively move things out of the portfolio that are not helping our win and move things into the portfolio to do. That has allowed us to increase our weighted average market growth and we're continuing to do so. So those are the positives coming into 2023. From a macro standpoint we have a couple of positives as well. I really look at the backlog of patients in orthopedics as being real. I can't put a number to it, but it's hard to size. It's hard to say when it's going to be impacting the markets the pace that's going to impact the markets. But at some point this has got to begin to work its way through the system and that could provide a tailwind to 2023. And then comps as well in 2023. It's going to be choppy. We've got choppy comps you're going to see differences in growth rates by quarter. But the fact is when I look at the full year, we should look at comps as a slight positive to 2023. And on the negative side it's the stuff that everybody is talking about unfortunately. We do have a very constrained supply challenge situation. And we're managing through it, but it's a tough road. And that's going to continue throughout 2022 -- 2023 we believe. And then staffing and our capacity has continued is not as difficult as it was but that's going to remain a headwind for us in 2023. And then we also look at recession risk on elective procedures particularly if it impacts unemployment. But all that to say 2023 is not a normal year, given all these variables. There's a lot to manage, a lot to think through and lot to contemplate in the way that we set up our guidance range. But based on what I'm seeing today, I expect there to be a four handle in that range which may or may not sound like a lot to people looking at Medtech, but to us knowing where we started that's a pretty significant step-up from where we started the journey and we're proud of it. And again we're just getting started. So that gives you a sense for revenue components and our view on revenue as we come into 2023. And then Suky, I'll pass it to you on the margin side. Yes. Thanks. And maybe I'll start off with that, and then Ivan, if you want to weight in feel free to do so. We clearly still see the ASC as an attractive submarket of our recon business and also clearly other parts of our S.E.T. business. It's one of the faster-growth submarkets and we're clearly increasing our focus and spend in that area. And we're doing it in a couple of ways. Number one, we're putting infrastructure in place. We've got dedicated commercial teams that focus only on the ASC. And that's important because you've got to have contracting prowess in that space and we've done that over the last couple of years and really getting good traction as a result of it. Additionally, we're making sure that we scale up in the product categories that the ASC is looking for. We wouldn't have purchased a booms and light company, if we didn't want to have that infrastructure for the ASC. Not to take anything away from booms and lights but it's not an area that we would have waited into, if it wouldn't have given us scale in the ASC marketplace. Same thing in sports acquisitions that we've done in other parts of our business. So we're really doing it two ways: commercial infrastructure, product portfolio, so that we have a broad-based contracting opportunity in the ASC and we're seeing traction as a result of that. We do expect the ASC to continue to move north relative to the number of procedures being done in the ASC versus the hospital. I don't know that I would agree with the numbers you stated. But certainly, we believe that it's going to continue to move north and we want to make sure that we're taking advantage of that. So Ivan, I don't know if you had anything else you want to add. Yes. I'll probably pass the -- just that its product related more than anything I'll probably pass it to Ivan to speak to the Hip performance. And also, Ivan maybe speak to some of the things that without too much specificity that we're predicting in the future to help the Hip business as well. Yes. I think you've kind of laid them out already. When I think about the go-forward-looking revenue growth you're going to have puts and takes. The things that we know are going to be positive for our business will absolutely be innovation. So, when I think about the calculus on revenue growth going forward, there's no question that we've included innovation. We're spending a lot of money and a lot of focus in research and development. We're bringing great products to the market and we absolutely expect that to buoy our revenue growth. That's part of reason why we gain from a 0% growth business in 2017, 2018, and now we're predicting we can get to 4%. So, that's been a big part of that movement. The execution of our team is another part of it. There's no question. I know that it's hard to put a dollar amount on momentum in an organization, but momentum does matter and we have it right now. And the other big one is that weighted average market growth. We have moved our weighted average market growth north during the last five years. So, as we get closer for our weighted average market growth to that 4%. It gives us more confidence that without share taking, we can deliver the 4% in a consistent way. Now, certainly we wouldn't stop there. Active portfolio management is Phase 3 of this organization and we're going to have more financial flexibility going forward. We're going to continue to change that weighted average market growth rate up. But getting to the 4% to start is a good thing. The negatives against that because you're saying okay we've got all these positive and why isn't it more than that? We still have real challenges around supply and that is a distractor for growing your business. And so we're going to have to manage through that as we get through 2023. We believe at least through the middle of 2023 potentially beyond. And even though staffing in our capacity isn't as acute as it was before, it's no question that this is going to be a headwind for us going forward. And of course we have to calculate some potential risk associated with the recession if that does occur. So, I think it's all those things combined in concert with this concept of having some backlog that we're hoping we can count on in 2023. But as of yet, we haven't seen it. Even Q3 which was a great quarter, we still don't believe backlog was consumed. We certainly might have had some backlog in certain areas consumed, but it was offset by some of these negative headwinds that we actually think backlog built in Q3. So, those are the variables that we're looking at as we think about 2023 and beyond. Yes. So first of all, I want to be careful what I say because it's a pretty competitive space right now. We don't want to telegraph too much what we want to do. But clearly, we as an organization are squarely in the Phase 3 of our transformation. And we Travis have been very clear that Phase 3 is all around active portfolio management to transform the portfolio, shifting toward more WAMGR accretive markets and diversifying our business. So that's kind of a broad-based way of looking at what Phase 3 is all about for our company. And we've already made some changes here. I know you're saying there's been smaller acquisitions that we've done, but we haven't had as much firepower obviously. But we have spun businesses out as well that have helped in this strategy. That said, COVID is getting behind us. There's no question. And as a result just exactly the way you're saying we would expect to have more strategic flexibility going forward. What I'd probably be willing to say and maybe not give any more detail is that we're going to look at vetting assets across a few metrics, outside of the typical financial metrics. We look at mission centricity. We've got to make sure that we're acquiring something that can move the mission. We want absolutely something that can drive WAMGR accretion for our organization and it's going to translate into revenue growth that's accretive. Because just because you're in a fast-growth market, if you don't have a good asset you don't necessarily get the growth rate out of it and it's got to accelerate our EPS growth over time because that's kind of the vetting. And then the categories that we're going to look at would be first and foremost, probably closest to the best would be vast growth subcategories of recon. So that would be things like data robotics or building more scale in the ASC setting like we were talking about just a minute ago. It would be faster growth areas outside of recon, but still in orthopedics and that would be mainly in our S.E.T. category. So that diversifies our business away from just recon in those faster-growth subcategories of orthopedics. And then to your point attractive white spaces that are completely out of orthopedics less selective in nature and provide more diversification again out of orthopedics. I don't want to say which of those we're going to prioritize, but just know that all of those vectors are on the table and we're looking at a number of assets in each of those categories. Absolutely. Yeah. I'll make some comments and then Ivan can correct anything I say incorrectly. But clearly capital is not as big a component for us. So I almost don't like talking about the capital market because I don't want to say anything that's going to hurt those businesses that depend more on the capital market. But from our perspective, where we do focus on it, it hasn't been a major barrier for us. Again, we really focus on from a ROSA perspective trying to place through agreements that allow for payment for the ROSA system through commitments and increased business. Consider a leasing arrangement, but the leasing payment is actually a commitment of business. That is what we focus on and we did more of those in the quarter and that's a good thing for our business. But we do have opportunities to continue to sell and we do not feel at this point anyway serious constraints in the capital market when it comes to ROSA. But maybe Ivan, if you've got any further color to provide around that you can help as well. Yeah, no problem. So maybe just as a quick reminder for everybody. When we think about our S.E.T. businesses and there's really no proxy for S.E.T. in other businesses, because we have different categories in it than others would probably consider. We have the upper extremities business inside of S.E.T. trauma; CMFT, which is our craniomaxillofacial and thoracic business; sports; separate from sports would be restorative therapies; and then foot and ankle. Those are the categories that we manage across the S.E.T. categories. The pressure that you were talking about in restorative therapies would be separate from sports, but it's still in the S.E.T. categories. On areas that we really focus, and invest in our growth drivers would be upper extremities, CMFT and sports. It doesn't mean the other businesses aren't important they just don't get the same level of resourcing at this point. And those three that we do concentrate on did have another good quarter. And if I look at all three of them, without giving specifics, I would say, they ranged anywhere from mid-single digits to double-digit growth again this quarter. So in the areas, where we're concentrating, there's no question that we're getting the performance in the field. A lot of that has to do with commercial infrastructure, and then the incremental support that we're giving in research and development to those areas. And of course, the acquisitions that we've been tucking in to drive a more fulsome portfolio. What you're seeing relative to pressure in the quarter for the global S.E.T. business it really has more to do with what Suky said in the prepared remarks around Asia Pacific pressure and trauma, mainly associated with VBP, which we'll reverse next quarter. And then that restored therapies pressure from a reimbursement change in G1. And unfortunately, that will carry through to the middle of 2023 or so. Sure. That's a great question. It's an interesting question. I think, what I'll probably do is again maybe start off on some of the things that I'm seeing that, I think are interesting. And then Ivan, Suky, Keri anybody who wants to add anything, because I think it's a really interesting question. It's a good one. My view in part the thing that, I like the most that, I'm seeing kind of state of the union that you're saying is just the rapid adoption in open arms that, I'm seeing from an orthopedics customer perspective to technology. There was a lot of question marks in my mind coming over to orthopedics, on whether or not that transition could truly occur. We saw it with Mako obviously in robotics but we're bringing a lot of other technologies to bear. And I've been very excited to see all companies kind of doubling down on the technology front robotics and data. We're all moving in that direction. And I'm hearing from our customer base that, they're looking for it and very importantly willing to pay for the value that it brings. That's really important, because if that type of innovation comes into a marketplace, particularly in medtech, it usually doesn't leave. And when you do bring that kind of technology, it is more sticky than previous technology and it does have the ability to impact pricing dynamics. Because the more technology that has stickiness to it the longer the term contracts, and the better stability you have in pricing. And you also get this benefit of increased, let's call it share of wallet or mix for every procedure. So if you can bring technology in to the very same procedure you had yesterday, you get more revenue for that procedure. And as we see that adoption continue to move up of things like robotics and data or cementless technologies in knee that actually allows a mix benefit for the entire market, and that could buoy the overall market growth rate. Taking pricing, stability, moving that forward, bringing more revenue per procedure that has a real positive effect for the overall orthopedic space. And so that's a dynamic that's happening real-time that's pretty exciting in my view anyway. But I'll open it up to anyone else if you want to add anything. Yeah. It's -- make sure that I understand your question specifically. But when I think about the innovation that we're bringing -- and not just us by the way. That's what I like about it there's momentum across the entire orthopedic space and all the major players moving in this direction. I think in certain areas we're ahead. But make no mistake everyone is moving in this direction. So if I just take a couple of examples and hopefully this will answer the question that you're asking. Think about mymobility for instance, which is one of the first launches that we had in data collection, leveraging the relationship that we have with Apple. This uses an Apple Watch to collect data and then ultimately uses machine learning to be able to do some predictive analysis. And we're actually now looking at that through an opportunity to tell a surgeon and the patient when they're falling out of the norm for recovery. So that's the type of thing that we're able to do. And we do sell that. So there's an opportunity to monetize that application. So it's not just giving it to them and getting pull-through of implants, it certainly is getting the pull-through of implants because you get that natural gravitational pull once you bring technology in, but there's also a discrete way of making money or monetizing that mymobility application. So that's one example. Another example is robotics. I mean, robotics comes in you get that natural gravitational pull for competitive surgeons to come over, but you also get an uplift every time they use a robotic procedure because you get the uptick in disposable value. So that procedure now cost more for the account to do, but you get the benefit of robotics inside of that. So it's a fair trade. Those are two examples of the way technology is leaning in, in that way. Same thing with Persona IQ. That's the first smart implant that will be on the market. It's collecting data in a very compliant way, because you can't take it off. They're nonstop for the patient. And that will also drive a premium in the marketplace. So if you're going to use Persona IQ, you're going to pay discretely for that that sensor capability. And that's the way we're monetizing this. So you could see a combination of things where we monetize the technology or sometimes it just brings value that is unique to us that would allow us to pull in additional implants. But it's some combination of those two things. And again, Ivan, if you wanted to add anything else or Suky or anybody else. Yeah. What I've learned over the years is committing to timelines in a situation like this is always a bad idea. What I can say is that we are absolutely sprinting and using our limited launch focused on, getting users that will use significant quantities and be able to collect data with us so that we can ultimately look for different ways of providing insights that will matter to our customers. The things that we want to focus on first would be what are those things that we could predict that will obviously be good for the patient, but also derail the cost associated with caring for the patients, so reduce the cost of caring for the patients? And in infection is great. If you could get there, that's fantastic. If we could predict a risk of infection before it occurs, that would be fantastic. Certainly something that we're going to be looking to do but it doesn't happen very often. So you just think about the power, the number of patients you're going to have to have and the amount of data it's going to take us a little longer to get there. What we're also going to be looking at though is just loosening, which also happens. Can we predict loosening before it happens? You're looking at stiffening. There are certain things you've got to do from a stiffening perspective that if we can get out ahead of we can reduce the amount of care that needs to be provided to the patient. So there's, a lot of other things that we're looking at to try to predict that will derail, the cost or reduce the cost of caring for the patient and make sure for better outcomes for the patient. So I don't want people to get hyper focused on infection. It's something that we're going to pursue. It will take longer. But the real goal right now is to be able to look at the data that we're collecting which is significant already, and then be able to derive those insights that will change the way we care for our patient. Once we get to those we can define those that will really begin to bolster that value proposition that we have for the product and be able to support a higher price point for Persona IQ. Sure. Yeah. Probably what I'll do is I'll turn this one over to Suky, because we don't look at pricing just through one vector one lens. There's, multiple variables that we have in that equation that we think are going to benefit the company going forward. But maybe Suky, you could talk about the variables that we do look at when we think about pricing and I know Ivan probably have some color as well you want to provide. Okay. The positive news is, that's the question I'm getting not a question of whether we could deliver the 4%. So we're making progress there. I would say, that I still think that as I talked about before there are a lot of headwinds that we have to pay attention to. And so, I don't want to say that -- first of all, we're giving more color than we would ever give in a normal year, just given all the challenges that everybody is facing trying to help you out here. But I would say, 4% is a number that I'm saying is doable we see a pathway to 4%. But make no mistake, that there are challenges that are out in the market macro challenges, not things that are internal to our own organization that could stress that. And there are opportunities from a macro perspective, that we just talked about that could also help that. So we're trying to take a balanced view, of what could happen positive or negative to what we think organically, we can do in 2023.  And that's the reason why, I would say, for 4% you should not consider a floor. 4% you should consider a good way to look at all things considered, a fair way to look at growth in 2023. And by the way if 2023 was just a normal year, and we didn't have all these noises, we believe that 4% is about the right way to think about our business. Given all the portfolio moves that we've made the WAMGR, improvements that we've made the innovation flywheel that we're now moving we believe, that's what we deserve. Could we do more than that? Certainly. Particularly, as we start to continue to move our active portfolio management strategy, we have more financial flexibility and we continue to move that weighted average market growth rate north. But, I don't want people thinking that I mean 4% as a floor. I didn't mean to attend that. \nQ \u2013 Matthew O'Brien: Understood. Thank you. Sure. Yes. I'd probably just add, I think I want people to continue to focus on the transformation that has occurred at Zimmer Biomet. We've been extremely disciplined in our portfolio decisions. And portfolio to me is, in all aspects of the business. We are biasing our spend whether it be research and development, commercial infrastructure, the way we compensate people in active portfolio management through M&A, on ensuring that we're increasing the weighted average market growth of our business and diversifying our business over time. That is happening. It has already happened and more of it will happen on a go-forward basis. And I keep talking about that innovation flywheel, but that was nonexistent just a few years ago. The Vitality Index is moving in the right direction in a rapid way, and we expect that to continue. All of that combined with the execution that we're seeing from the field is putting us in a good place, in a very challenging market. So I guess, I'll leave it with that Keri."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, August 2nd, 2022. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President, Senior Vice President, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay; and COO, Ivan Tornos. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q2 earnings release, which can be found on our Web site, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: All right, great. Thanks, Keri, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning for the call. We've got three sections for the call this morning. The first section, I'll talk briefly about our Q2 performance from an overall perspective, and how a combination of strong execution and COVID recovery have actually enabled us to revise our expectations up again for the full-year. And that's in the face of some pretty significant macro pressures, especially around FX. I'll also spend a few minutes talking about ZB Innovation, that's a primary contributor to our performance today, and certainly our performance in the future, so we want to make sure we touch upon that. And for the second section, I'll switch it to Suky, and Suky will obviously provide details on Q2, but I think even more importantly and probably more interesting is to talk about 2022 guidance and our updates there. And then for our favorite section of the call, we'll close things out by addressing any questions you might have, either on Q2 or any other topic. So, let's go ahead and get started with Q2, and I'll start this section by saying that despite some very real and what I would define as universal challenges in our sector, I'm very proud of the fact that the team delivered again another solid quarter that actually was above our internal expectations. And I think this speaks to the team's, I'm just going to define it as, muscle memory associated with effectively managing through challenging times, and that's exactly what we have right now. With the supply concerns that are out there, it is a challenging time, and it's great to know that our team has that muscle memory to manage trough it effectively, and they continue to show that. The primary reason for the overachievement was stronger than anticipated COVID recovery, for sure, which happened in the quarter, but also just really solid and focused execution from the team across our regions and all of our business segments. From a procedure volume standpoint, the momentum that we saw in Q1, particularly at the end of Q1 actually continued through April and May, but we did see a bit of a slowdown in June, and that has actually carried over through to July. The recovery pace was different depending on where you were in the world in Q2. It was strong everywhere, but it was really strong outside the U.S., where we saw a strong performance pretty much across the board in all of our areas OUS. And inside of this, we saw solid momentum again in knees and hips. I'm really pleased to see another strong quarter in large joints, and excited that we continue to get traction for our innovation in this area. The momentum in large joints was then offset by some expected pressure in our S.E.T. businesses and our other category, and Suky will provide more detail here in a minute. I think it's pretty clear for all of us, actually, that foreign currency is a challenge, supply challenges are very real, inflationary pressures are with us right now. And those hurt us in Q2, all of these did, they're going to continue to pressure us through the back-half of '22, and potentially beyond. But just get on our business momentum this far into the year. Our new product innovation and the traction we're getting there with our customers and COVID recovery, at least the profile today, our overall confidence in 2022 has actually gotten better. And as a result of that we are raising our full-year guidance for revenue, operating margin, and earnings per share. And I think this should be a solid indication that our strategy is working, and our team is executing, really just getting it done. And our underlying business is gaining strength. And a big part of that, a big part of this momentum is our new product innovation, and continuing to deliver in delighting out customers. And in Q2, we debuted another element of our ZBEdge ecosystem, and this is an AI technology within our Omni Suite smart OR system that focuses on optimizing surgical workflow and increasing procedure efficiency. And I'd say that's important right now. It's really important because of the capacity constraints that our customers have. Separate from that, from a ROSA perspective, ROSA robotics momentum continued in both knee and hip for the quarter, and our placement pipeline remains extremely strong. And while it's still in limited launch and very early days, the feedback and interest in Persona iQ is positive, and we're focused on collecting as much early data as quickly as we possibly can, with an eye toward clearly establishing clinical use benefits, so we move into full launch in 2023, or as prepared as possible. And all of these innovations and our broader ZBEdge suite highlight the possibilities around data collection and integration on the patient and customer experience, and that's really our focus. In addition to the strength of our existing product portfolio, our new product pipeline is just as exciting. We have additional product launches planned for the second-half of 2022, especially across our knee and S.E.T. portfolios. In knee, our soon-to-be-launched Persona cementless form factor will compliment our current form factor, and provide additional momentum for cementless conversions, particularly as we get into 2023. And in our S.E.T. businesses, I'm very excited about our Identity shoulder system launch. And this is going to be a much more customizable shoulder for a more personalized feel for the patient that should optimize movement in the shoulder. We're also continuing to reshape our business and accelerate ZB's transformation. We've made significant progress in streamlining and modernizing our operating model. But we've also really focused on making ZB a best and preferred place to work, as well as a trusted partner, which are two of our strategic pillars for the company. In Q2, Zimmer Biomet was certified by Great Place to Work, this is a global authority on workplace culture. The U.S. certification was based on direct survey feedback from our team members, which I think makes it even more compelling. We also established a new function for refining and driving our environmental, social, and governance strategy, but also the commitments and actions we're taking in this area as well. We have already seen significant improvements across almost every element of ESG, and truly, we're just getting started. We see this as an important responsibility as a company, for sure, but also something we believe is critically important to our team members, our customers, and our investors. You'll be hearing more from us on the ESG front as we make further progress, and as we continue to enhance our reporting in this area. So, in summary, even though there are real macro headwinds that our team is managing, the recovery shift in COVID continues, and the execution of our strategy is making a difference. We'll need to stay close to the headwinds into the recovery; any of the last couple years have proven that things are fluid. But I do feel confident in our team's ability to navigate the path forward, and I'm excited about where ZB is going. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky for a deeper dive into Q2, and again, a look at our revised expectations for the year. Okay, Suky?\nSuky Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a good quarter, driven by strong execution and faster than expected recovery of elective procedures across most markets. While we continue to face heightened headwinds and challenges related to foreign currency, inflation, and supply chain disruptions, our second quarter performance gives us the confidence to raise our full-year revenue and EPS outlook. With that, I'll turn to our second quarter results and how that translates into our updated full-year financial guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter of 2022, and how it compares to the same period in 2021. And my commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted continuing operations basis. Net sales in the second quarter were $1.782 billion, up 1% on a reported, and 6% on a constant currency basis. As Bryan mentioned, strong procedure volume recovery extended from the first quarter, especially as we moved into April and May, with moderation of recovery in June. U.S. sales grew 1.3% driven by strong recovery in execution as COVID cases subsided and elective procedures returned especially in knee and hips. This was partially offset by lower S.E.T. growth and declines in the Other category. International sales grew 12.2% driven by strong procedural volume across most markets in EMEA and APAC. EMEA experienced rapid uptake in the second quarter across developed and emerging markets, with a generally lighter comp versus 2021. Asia-Pacific, overall, grew in line with expectations, with China performing largely as projected, and Japan growing better than anticipated. Turning to our business category performance, Global knees grew 11.2%, with U.S. knees up 4.5%, and international knees up 20.1%. These results were driven by easy comparisons OUS, along with strong knee procedure recovery across most regions, continued global traction for our Persona knee system, especially with Persona Revision in the U.S., and ROSA penetration and pull-through. While hips grew 8.9% with U.S. hips up 2.6% and international hips up 14.9%, driven by easier comparisons OUS in tandem with strong international procedure recovery. We also saw continued traction across key hip products including our Arcos and G7 system for revision and our Avenir complete primary hip which is focused on the direct anterior surgical approach. And lastly, we continue to see solid ROSA pull-through in the hip category. Sports, extremities, and trauma category increased 0.1% and was impacted by a tough comp in 2021, expected pressure in trauma due to VBP implementation as well as expected pressure in restorative therapies due to a reimbursement shift for our Gel-One product. Within the category, we continued to deliver strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine, and upper extremities. Finally, our other category declined 6.1% driven by tough comps and expected lower capital sales related to a higher mix of ROSA placement versus upfront sales in the quarter. Moving to the P&L, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.73 compared to our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68 in the second quarter of 2021. Higher revenue and lower IPR&D charges more than offset restructuring and mark to market losses on our retained ZimVie stake. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.82 represented an increase from $1.51 in the second quarter of '21. Higher sales in tandem with lower IPR&D in the quarter more than offset lower year-over-year gross margins. Adjusted gross margin was 71.6%, slightly ahead of expectation due primarily to better mix and lower pricing erosion. As a note, we expect heightened inflation to temper our observed second quarter favorability as we move through the rest of the year. We continue to project full-year gross margin to be slightly down when compared to full-year 2021 gross margin. And as we said, increasing inflationary pressure will pull-through into '23. And we now expect about 50 to 100 basis points of headwind from inflation in 2023 versus our previous estimate of about 50 basis points. Our adjusted operating expenses were $777 million. Lower than the prior year primarily due to the 2021 IPR&D charges referenced earlier. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 28%, up from the prior year. As previously noted, full-year margins will be pressured versus the prior year due to inflation, supply chain headwind, and China VBP with partial offset by the ongoing realization of our efficiency programs. Despite these ongoing headwinds, we expect those efficiency programs to drive improved second-half operating margins versus the first-half of the year. The adjusted tax rate was 16.5% in the quarter and in line with our expectations. Operating cash flows were $346 million. And free cash flow totaled $240 million for the quarter. We paid down about $100 million of debt in the second quarter and ended with cash and cash and equivalent of about $390 million. Our improving financial performance in tandem with ongoing reductions in debt, continue to strengthen our balance sheet for greater strategic flexibility. And now moving to our updated financial outlook for the full-year 2022, we are raising our financial guidance based on the following key assumptions. COVID and customer stocking pressures will continue through 2022, but with a lesser impact than previously anticipated. Supply chain and inflationary pressures stabilized at current levels and foreign currency will be a 500 basis point headwind in '22 versus our previous projection of $350 basis points. Also, we assume about a 30% flow through of FX-related revenue headwind falls to EPS. And that the FX headwind applies to the full range of EPS guidance. Against this backdrop, I'll walk through our updated financial guidance for the year. Constant currency revenue growth is now expected to be 4% to 6% versus 21 with an expected foreign currency headwind of 500 basis points. This means that reported revenue growth is expected to be in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% versus 2021. We are raising adjusted operating margin by 25 basis points to the range of 26.75% to 27.75%. Adjusted tax rate guidance remains in the range of 16% to 16.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be higher, at $6.70 to $6.90. And free cash flow is now expected to improve to $800 million to $900 million. And lastly, net interest expense and non-operating expense will be modestly higher than the $160 million we anticipated earlier this year due to higher interest rates and foreign currency. We expect to see typical seasonality in the back-half of the year, which would suggest stronger revenue dollars in Q4 than in Q3. Additionally, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be higher than Q3 growth, in part due to the easier fourth quarter comp related to China VBP headwinds we observed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating margins are expected to follow a similar tend as revenue. In summary, while there are macro challenges and headwinds, our team is navigating those challenges and executing well. We are raising our '22 financial guidance due to better than expected COVID recovery, the strength of our execution, and our confidence in ZB's underlying business fundamentals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Suky. Before we start the q-and-a session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Rick Wise with Stifel.\nRick Wise: Good morning, everybody. Hi, Bryan. Hi, Suky. Maybe I'll start off with your commentary about the outlook for the second-half from a couple of perspectives. Bryan, you talked about the April-May strengthening, maybe some softening in June, and continuing. Help us understand where you're seeing it? What do you think is happening, and maybe better understand what you've dialed into the second-half? We recently did a survey of 50 orthopedic surgeons who were cautious about the second quarter, but the most ebullient, exuberant about their volume expectations for the second-half of any doctor who we surveyed. I'm confused about how we sort of reconcile those two points of view.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, thanks for the question, Rick. So, what I would tell you is that what we experienced and, of course, we talk to a lot of our customers as well, as you would imagine. But what we experienced is in June, and then carrying through to July, not fewer procedures, but more cancellations of those procedures. And most of that was driven by either, one, the staff member having COVID or testing positive for COVID, or the patient testing positive for COVID and as a result of that they could not carry on with the procedure. And what we're saying is that we believe that could continue. We believe that could continue. Until we see a shift, we're going to assume it will continue at least through the third quarter. That's just what we're experiencing. The good news is, when I think about the quarter, we had a really strong quarter, and that business momentum -- the underlying business momentum is real, and we believe that's going to continue. But outside of that, I don't know if you want to speak more, Suky, to just our second-half view?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, so, good morning, Rick. Good to be with you today. So, if you look at our implied guidance in second-half at the midpoint versus what we did in the first-half, you would get about 4% operational ex-FX growth for revenue. And really what underpins that is three key assumptions we've made inside that. One, you've got tougher comps in the second-half than you saw in the first-half. You see that especially with EMEA if you just think about the second quarter growth we just posted. But it really translates to other markets as well, so tougher comps. Two, we have one less selling day in the second-half of the year, so we've accounted for that. And third, as Bryan talked about, we're just taking a prudent view on COVID especially given our index to elective procedures. We did see some softening of procedures due to those cancellations as we exited the second quarter. And we're assuming that that continues into the third quarter with a step up or improvement in COVID in the fourth quarter. Now, I would say if we don't see that pressure continue all the way through the third quarter that would likely take us to the top end of our range. So, those are some of the big building blocks that we've assumed in our second-half growth rate. But as Bryan said, we feel really confident about the execution of the team, where our pipeline is going, and our ability to execute on our recent product launches, so feeling really good about the second-half.\nRick Wise: That's great, thanks for that. And maybe just as a follow-up to a follow-on to some of these thoughts, maybe Suky, and this is always I know your -- this kind of favorite question on calls like this at this time of year. Talk about the setup for '23, just hearing some of the factors you're talking about, improved internal execution, major new products being launching, the positive impact of your efficiency programs. It would seem like I'm leaving this feeling more encouraged about that setup for the next year than I might have, appreciating that there are many uncertainties as well.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, so, I'm you feeling encouraged, because we're feeling encouraged as well, that's the outlook. As we -- we're not going to get into guidance, obviously, for '23, there's still a lot more to play out in '22. But as we think about a normalized market and normal market dynamics, we would expect revenue at floor of 4%. And inside of that, based on all of the operational efficiencies the team has been very successful in making and things that we've got planned for next year, we believe we can offset these headwinds that we're seeing this year relative to inflationary pressures. And we believe we're in a position where we can expand margins into 2023. Now, albeit it won't be as great a margin expansion as you would have if we didn't have these inflationary pressures this year, but we still feel confident that we can expand margins with that type of top line growth profile into next year.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, I'd just maybe make additional comment on that. And I would agree, yes, I think that the execution of the business and the team is very real. The momentum in the business is real. The product pipeline that we have is very strong, that we haven't even launched yet. So, for all those things coming together in a normal market, I would be very disappointed if we didn't deliver at least a 4% growth rate. And that said, that's not where we're going to stop, right. We clearly have a little more cash flexibility, and that opens up options for us from an acquisition standpoint. And we're going to be looking to add accretive WAMGR acquisitions, potentially diversifying acquisitions to bolster that growth rate over time.\nRick Wise: That's incredibly helpful. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Sure.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Rick. Jake, we can go on to the next question.\nOperator: We will hear from Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPito Chickering: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Looking at your 2022 guidance on the margin side, can you help us understand the increase of inflationary pressures in the FX headwinds, and how that's offset by stronger revenue growth and margin leverage? And then, any views you have around positive price for your mix in your updated guidance for the year?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, hey, Pito, this is Suky. So, I'll start with the operating margin guide. So, inside of that, gross margin we do expect to step down in the second-half versus the first-half. We are experiencing greater headwinds due to inflationary pressures, and that's banked into our operating margin guide. And that's increased in the second quarter from our first quarter call. And what we now see is where we originally anticipated, about 50 basis points of that incremental inflationary pressure landing in 2023. We now think it's closer to 50 to 100 basis points. But again, we've completed included that in our new operating margin and gross margin guide or expectations for the rest of this year. Now, I would say, inside of that our assumption is that inflationary pressures stay relatively stable to where we exited the second quarter as we think about the rest of the year. If you take that operating margin you would expect perhaps a bigger EPS flow-through, but as you're seeing with across the sector, FX has been a significant headwind, taking our number up from 350 basis points of headwind, now to 500 basis points of headwind. And so, if you think about our EPS guide and our raise, the way to think about it is while we're increasing our ex-FX or operational growth by 200 basis points, our reported growth at the midpoint is only going up by 50 basis points. And so, if you take that 50 basis points that translates to about an incremental $35 million in revenue, including Q2 performance. And if you flow that through that would get you to about a nickel. And so, that helps support or helps give the big building blocks around the $0.05 raise that we just put in there. So, hopefully that gets to your questions, but happy to take any follow-ons you might have.\nPito Chickering: Yes, I just want a quick follow-up here just around the 2023 commentary, with this sort of 5% FX hit you're seeing, assuming that this sort of comps out next year, can you just refresh us how that would flow through the P&L in 2023?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, so right now, we're assuming is flowing through to net income at about 30%. And that's inclusive of any natural hedges we have plus any FX gains and losses. Now, I would say that 30% can vary over time for a number of variables can vary based on mix of regional profit, it could vary because of timing of foreign currency changes, it could vary because of the timing of FX gains and losses. But right now, our best estimate is 30%. And as that changes, over time, we'll keep you updated.\nPito Chickering: Great, thanks so much.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Pito. Jake, can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: We will now move to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on a really nice quarter here. Bryan or Suky, I just wanted to confirm, there was -- international was really strong for hips and knees. I just want to confirm there was nothing kind of one-time, no catch-up there? And then just S.E.T. and other, maybe just some color on what accelerate those two businesses? Is it the new shoulder in S.E.T.? When does that happen? And the outlook for other, given some of your comments, more ROSA rentals or lease agreement, what's the outlook there? Thanks for taking the question.\nBryan Hanson: Sure, and thanks, Larry. So, what I would tell you is that there was nothing other than some easy comps, obviously, that we had OUS. There was no one-time event that buoyed the quarter that somehow skewed the quarter. It was just the factors that we referenced already that came together and allowed for a very strong quarter OUS. So, that's the first answer. Yes, I'll hit S.E.T., and then maybe Suky, you could talk about other or Ivan, you can as well. So, on the S.E.T. side, I think it's probably good to just take a step back because we don't talk about the subcategories that often of S.E.T., and just kind of reorient everybody. We have six businesses underneath S.E.T. We have our CMFT, which is our Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic business, Sports Med, Upper Extremities, Foot and Ankle, Trauma, and Restorative Therapies. And I would just say, in the quarter, we saw a very strong performance in our three focus area, Upper Extremities, CMFT, and Sports, with Upper Extremities and CMFT both growing double digits in the quarter, and we think that's sustainable, and Sports Medicine growing mid-single digits even with the pretty tough comp in that area, that was offset by expected pressure from Asia-Pacific in Trauma. And to be very clear, we expect that to continue, that pressure in Asia-Pacific to continue through Q3, but then reverse itself in Q4. And then in the U.S., we saw pressure in Restorative Therapies. This is due, as Suky had already mentioned, because of a reimbursement change in Gel-One. But what's important on this is that's going to accelerate into Q3, and continue through about mid-2023, and then it will annualize out, okay. So, just net-net, I would expect S.E.T. to stay pressured in Q3, and then improve in Q4. And again, we feel pretty confident that we're going to continue to see momentum in our focus areas. And maybe, Ivan, you could speak to some of the innovation and some of the things that give you confidence about those areas?\nIvan Tornos: Sure. Thanks, Larry. And thanks, Bryan. So, you mentioned shoulder, and whether this is one device that is driving the growth, and I think the answer, Larry, is that that's not the case, it's more than one product. You are familiar with sort of Signature One Planner and guides. We launched that about three years ago, that today, above 50% of all procedures are done using this technology. And the feedback continues to be really compelling around accuracy, around the simple interface with the surgeon, the integration of the workflow, and just the fact that the surgeon is in control. Nano or the Stemless Shoulder was also launched, and is getting great momentum. The big launch that I think you're talking about hasn't happened yet, or Identity launch, which is going to be our biggest shoulder launch in the last five years, is about to get launched. And that is going to be as spacing-centric as it gets, truly a personalized solution. It has the ability of doing inlay and only reconstruction. I can spend an hour talking about it. I know you're a product guy, and what I tell you, it's going to be transformational. But beyond shoulders, in Sports Med, we have filled the portfolio very quickly, still integrating Relign, the acquisition that we did about 12 months ago. It is an all-in-one arthroscopic surgical platform; the feedback continues to be great both on the capital and consumable side. We got new products on ankles, and again I can continue to go on and on. But I will say that our portfolio in Sports Med today has everything that we need to have. And then lastly on CMFT, as Bryan referenced, that is a double-digit growth business with a combination of organic and inorganic plays. We launched new products on thoracic and neuro, we're about to launch as many as six to seven different products in the next 12 to 18 months, and we're making a lot of investments in that business. So, it's not one product, it's not one category. At least three categories are growing really strongly globally. And then, on top of that, I will say our commercial execution is best in class when it comes to the focus, the specialization, incentive plan, and our contracting capabilities, so, really excited about the S.E.T. and the momentum that we got, Larry.\nBryan Hanson: Great, thanks, Ivan. And maybe, Suky, just speak quickly to other?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, so had two other questions in there, Larry. One was on the quarter for knee and hip, and anything that we saw in there. But I would say it's a very clean quarter. We really didn't see anything material or meaningful relative to shifts in timing on tenders or anything. It was pretty straightforward on both -- well, on recon in total. And then relative to other, it was down, primarily driven by the mix of ROSA; I would say the installments continue to be very strong. As a company, we're very happy with how that -- the continued uptick of ROSA and the utilization increases we're seeing. But the mix of placements versus sales was different than the prior year where we saw, this year, more placements or this quarter more placements than we saw absolute dollars in sales. And then we did see just a little bit, a modest level of pressure in surgical capital within our other business, so again, that was the -- those were the two key drivers to the year-over-year declines in the quarter.\nLarry Biegelsen: All right, thanks so much, guys.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Larry. Jake, we can go on to the next question in the queue, please?\nOperator: We will now hear from Josh Jennings with Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Bryan, wanted to just ask about competitive lens in joints, and what you think is driving in the marketplace decision-making by your surgeon customers? Robotics provided an edge at one point, now all the big four have the robotic systems commercialized. Do you think that surgeons are shifting back to making decisions in terms of what brand based on implant or is robotics still driving competitive wins? And just in that same vein, what -- how should we think about the evolution of ROSA from here, robotics, I'm sure it's probably a combination of implant and the robotic system, but what is Zimmer doing to evolve the ROSA system and anything that's -- any software updates that you guys have implemented so far in 2022, is that one follow-up?\nBryan Hanson: Yes, thanks, Josh, for the question. I would say that it's always been a combination of the implant and the value of the implant to the surgeon, and will always be that way in concert with the technology you bring that surrounds the implant. That could be robotics, it could be mymobility, it could be our entire ecosystem that surrounds the implant. So, it's always been a combination of those two things. When I look at our performances, those things are now coming together in a cleaner market than we've had in the past. And so, the underlying strength we've had as a business has been masked by some external things. As those clouds begin to move, I think you're going to see the real performance of this come out. But with that said, obviously, Ivan is here, he's much closer to it even than I am. So, maybe you could speak to what you're seeing out there?\nIvan Tornos: Yes, absolutely. So, on question number one, Josh, I concur with Bryan, the physician is clearly the decision-maker. But the role of the provider and the payer is also very, very important, and obviously we target those decision-makers as well. Relative to ROSA, I'll tell you Josh, what makes ROSA unique is not that it is one product; it is part of an ecosystem that consolidates a lot of different parts and pieces. It's fully integrated with a lot of pre-op stuff, our partnership with Apple and mymobility or planning software, the fact that you can use ROSA with the number one in the world, Persona, the connectivity with some data points, the OrthoIntel data platforms, and obviously Persona IQ at some point. So, I think it's more of an integrated solution than just one product that is driving those decision-makers to come our way. If you go out there and ask physicians why -- or payers, for that matter, why are they choosing ROSA; other than the outcomes and the technology at play, they like the efficiency, they like the fact that our preplanning is easier, they're seeing the outcomes. And I think those are the reason why we're seeing the great momentum with ROSA. So, hopefully, that answers your question.\nJosh Jennings: Thank you. And Bryan, just wanted to ask about if there's any opportunity you see for maybe product line pruning or even if you're working through any product line obsolescence that could -- you could drop some -- maybe anchor product lines and help catalyze some stronger growth at your different business units? Thanks for taking the questions.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, it's a great question. And it's interesting, because when I first started at Zimmer Biomet, I made the mistake one time on an earnings call talking about the fact that we are going to reduce SKUs, and the stock just tanked because normally what happens when you do that, there is risk associated with revenue. What we have done then is just to be quiet about it. But we have also been doing it. We had dramatic decreases in SKUs over the past 4 years, dramatic. And we are going to continue to focus on that because there is a lot of inefficiencies in orthopedics if you have multiple product lines you are trying to cover and it reduces focus in the field. So, we really are trying to focus on the main brands, push from an incentive standpoint our teams to focus on those brands and rationalize categories they are just not as important to us. So, again we have been doing that very quietly but very effectively over the last 4.5 years.\nJosh Jennings: Great, thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Sure.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Josh. Jake, if we can go to the next question in the queue.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Good morning and congrats on the products. Just a couple quick ones, in response to Rick's question earlier, Suky, you mentioned margin expansion in '23. I was just a little unclear was that in reference to gross margin, op margin, or both?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, Jayson, great question. Good clarification. It's really more about operating margin expansion. As I said, we've got some inflationary pressure this year that's going to capitalize into next year, which is going to put some headwind into gross margin year-over-year. I don't want to get into exactly where we think gross margin is going to end. We just know that year-over-year as a starting point you've got 50 to 100 basis points working against you because of things that happened this year. Having said that, quite excited about all the progress the team is making to help offset those. We are doing some really good things around pricing which is improving our profile. You saw that in this quarter we expect to see some of those more strategic and tactical levers continue to play through for the rest of this year and into next year. Really happy about what the supply chain and commercial teams are doing relative to site optimization and cost down in manufacturing. Even in the backdrop of a very dynamic supply chain market and the challenges with trying to get product and packaging materials and logistics all sorted out in a very again volatile market. And then beyond that in SG&A, we are going to continue to look at improvements in our go-to-market market models commercial models across the world. We have already implemented a number of those, for instance, in Europe where we look to restructure and rethink how we go to market in lower margin markets as well as lower margin business categories. And then, the global business services operating model that we created during the pandemic is ripe for further leverage. And we think that we can continue to drive efficiencies by putting more of our activities into those service lines. So, we feel really good that despite ongoing gross margin pressures because of these inflationary headwinds that we see a clear path to operating margin expansion into '23. So, hope that gives you a little bit more color and clarification on where expect to see it.\nJayson Bedford: Yes, it's very helpful. Just as a bit of unrelated follow-up. In terms of patient backlog, I thought it was somewhat refreshing that you didn't talk about hospital staffing issues. So, my question is what do you think is posing the biggest hurdle to kind of unleashing that backlog. Is it patient reluctance to come in? Whether it would be COVID or economic reasons, or is it still hospital staffing? Thanks.\nSuky Upadhyay: I think it's a good question. I would say it's a bit balance. It's multi-factorial. I would say that even in the quarter -- in the second quarter we didn't talk about backlog much. But I do believe in certain areas where you had capacity, capabilities, we did see some backlog come through. Unfortunately, what we continue to see is also an offset typically of that in other areas that have either COVID or staffing pressure that then drive the numbers down. So, I have kind of continued to see there is a kind of offsetting of areas that can drive forward and pick up backlog in other areas that are probably building backlog. I don't know when that's going to stop. It's hard to predict. But the good news is that we are seeing that anyways very strong procedure growth. We're just seeing canceling being the thing we are concentrating on. So, we're not seeing COVID driving ICU beds in the wrong direction or capacity of ICU beds being in challenge. It just is patient wants to come in. The procedure is being scheduled either the patient or the staff member gets COVID and they can't conduct the procedure. That's what we are seeing and that's what we saw more in June and July so far.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks for the question, Jayson. Jake, can we go to the next question in the queue please?\nOperator: Yes. We will hear from Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Great, thank you for taking the questions, and good morning. Suky, you made some comments on the last question just about pricing updates. So, I wonder if we could just take that one level deeper. Where are you seeing the biggest success I guess in price pressures near term? And then when you think about strategically over the long term, I mean where do you see pricing power and opportunities to potentially flex from a pricing perspective longer term?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, thanks for the question. I will actually turn it over to Ivan. He is probably the closest in doing the day-to-day [cost head] [Ph] on this.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, absolutely, thanks. So, I will tell you. When I joined this business four years ago, the normal price erosion was 3 even 400 basis points per year, in some categories, 500 basis points. That's not what we are. That's not what we are going to be. I would be extremely disappointed it would not below end of the range of 2% and that is on a bad day if you ask me, 200 basis points of price erosion. Relative to what we are doing, what are seeing success, first of all I'll define the journey as a three stage journey. Tactical, number one; strategic, number two; transformational, number three. We completed number one. We have done a lot of tactical stuff. Raising price for non-core products, raising price in non-core markets, thinking differently about different customers, business segmentation, all of that is being done. We are getting get success. Stage number two, strategic, I would say we are probably midpoint in that stage. It's about category contracting. We have number one position in hips and knees in many different accounts around the world. We have now done a good job in leveraging that position to bring S.E.T. another categories that is happening. Now that we have truly an ecosystem solution, we are bundling -- I don't like that word but that's the one that comes to mind our ecosystem and contracting across the [indiscernible] care. We are doing a lot of things in terms of thinking ASCs. We incorporate a ton of people in our contracting group that are thinking more strategically about those relationships, line extensions and what not. And then at some point, we will get into the transformational stage and that is how do we leverage all this data we are getting to do a risk chain agreements? Now that we learnt product platforms like Workai, we are able to engage in predictive analytics. We are going to leverage that to really understand what happens 3 - 6 months after a surgery is done. So, three different stages I would say again with our stage 2. And we are not at least or at worst at 2% price erosion, we are not doing our job. Thanks for the question.\nKyle Rose: Thanks you. That's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on ROSA, maybe just talk a little bit about utilization you are seeing and some of the positives, and then I will take a stab, but overall installed base in your percent of knees and hips following through that would be very helpful.\nBryan Hanson: I think you've always got to try to take a stab at those two things, therefore we are just not going to provide it. But I do want, Ivan, if you could talk about the momentum? I mean we are seeing really strong momentum in ROSA. It was a little off from the other category given the mix as Suky referenced before. We sold less than we did the prior year. But the placements were still strong. And the pull-through on those placements are also still strong, but maybe you can speak.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, sure, absolutely. I'll tell you I am really proud of the work that the team has done globally. We are now in 40 countries with ROSA over the last three years. But I am even more energized about what's happening or what's going to happen over the next three years. But to throw some color, I won't disclose the number of placements. Bryan has done that in the past. I won't talk about penetration. But I will tell you that is double digit here in the U.S. We had a solid Q2. Sequentially, we grew both on sales and placement, overall installment Q2 22 versus Q1 of 2022 versus last year's comps was a headwind. We continue to see a nice mix in terms of the installations in an inpatient unit than in an ASC unit. I mentioned earlier that the feedback from customers is very compelling when it comes efficiency. And today about 30% of all installations have been in ASC. So, that's a great lead indicator to what's going to happen here given the migration into the setting. From competitive standpoint, we track that obviously very closely. About 40% to 50% of installations are happening in competitive accounts. And again, the number of returns and the feedback has been very, very positive in that space as well. So, really excited about where we are. It's a global business continue to see penetration in the right direction. And as I think about next three years, we have as many indications coming, I would say that we are in the really, really early innings of this game.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Kyle. Jake, can we go to the next question please?\nOperator: Yes. Next we will hear from Jason Wittes with Loop Capital.\nJason Wittes: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a follow-up on -- appreciate the detail on ROSA, curios on the competitive accounts that you are getting in with ROSA, are they using multiple robots? Or, is it usually just a single robot that's ROSA? Or how would you characterize the competitive inroads?\nIvan Tornos: Yes, absolutely, Jason. Thank you. It really depends. We are in a lot of teaching institutions. And as you can imagine when you are talking to HSS, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York or the Cleveland Clinic or Mayo, they do like to have a wide range of different robotic solutions. So, it's not uncommon to see two or even three robotic systems there. So, that comes to mind when it comes to selection. As you look at other savings, that depends. It depends on the preference. When you have high volume surgeons that you used to using Persona, then they tend to gravitate towards ROSA because it does integrate Persona and it drives a different level of efficiency. So, that depends on the volume of the surgeon, teaching institution, non-teaching institution. Yes, we do have examples in the U.S. and globally where you have as many as two or even three robots in an account.\nSuky Upadhyay: And it's not surprising that that occurs. Even if you just look at the implants, even in a very strong account that we would have, usually it's not homogenous with one implant. You typically have competitive implants in there as well. So, we follow suit that if you are going to move into robotics, you likely will have more than one robotic system.\nJason Wittes: Okay, I appreciate the detail. And then a follow-up on Persona IQ, I know you mentioned, you kind of working out or building up a case for the value proportions. I assume that's going to be premium price products. And it sounds like you are ready to fully launch that in 2023. How do we think about that in terms -- I mean in terms of the price and value proposition for the patient and the hospital?\nSuky Upadhyay: You are absolutely right. It is going to be it is today and it will be a premium priced product. It is one of those opportunities for sure while just like you would see in robotics disposables. You would see in my mobility. You would see in a cementless uptick in price point. And that's why we are sprinting right now to be able to collect data to prove out the value proposition as I said in my prepared remarks. But Ivan, obviously you are very close to launch maybe you could speak to that as well.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, I am not sure, Jason that we are ready to commit to a launch date. We knew early on when we acquired this technology when we partnered with Canary in this technology that this was going to be a limited market release. And it could take 6, 12, or 18 months depends on the level of data we are getting. We knew that the [Elemar] [Ph] was more of clinical exercise than a commercial exercise. We are on track with the things we want to get. Really the Elemar had three stages. Number one is validation of the value proposition. And again, we are getting millions. And I am talking millions of data points so far in this Elemar, anything from what happens intraop on resection, gap balancing, the level of alignment, the cutting, what happens postop in terms of range of motion, in terms of gait, speed and all kind of things. With all those data points, we need to understand what is the true value proposition for that patient, that provider, and that physician. The second part is how do we -- once we really do launch the product, how do we make this efficient. What's the pathway towards activating sites at a faster speed? How do we change surgeons? How do we deal with data questions around privacy and what not? And then number three is really what's next? We don't want to be just a smart knee company; want to be a smart solutions company. So, we have got a pathway to get into hip. We have got a pathway to get into shoulder. When understand both cemented and cement less needs; different platform. And to that end, there is a lot of data we are getting to understand what is that we are going to do from a portfolio standpoint. So, I am not going to commit to a date for launch. But I would tell you we are on track in terms of gathering all the data and the roadmap ahead.\nJason Wittes: And maybe -- thank you, that's helpful. Just maybe one quick conceptually question here. Is the market ready to pay up for these AI technologies, these planning technologies? I mean traditionally the market has been very focused on implants, implant cost. So, this is a bit of a shift. Has the market been receptive? Do you think they are respective? Do you 2023 they are receptive to paying these types of premiums for these sort of new take on technologies?\nBryan Hanson: I'll answer in a couple ways. I think first I would look at data points that would suggest that the market is ready. And I just look at ROSA, I look at robotics in general, it wasn't that long ago that there was an assumption that orthopedics would not pay a premium to bring robotics in the play. I think we are finding that's changing very rapidly. I really do believe robotics would become a standard of care at some point. I think it's the same thing. This is the next leg of the stool. I really do believe that data collection and the informatics capability as a result of that will be something that people will desire and pay for. We have to prove it. We have to collect the data, create the data lake, create insights as a result of that, and give guidance to surgeons from that data. Once that occurs and we can then predict things ahead of time and change care as a result of that, there's value in that, there's no question. Remember, there's still a large percentage of patients, somewhere in the neighborhood of 20%, to get a knee procedure that are not happy for whatever reason. And when you talk to surgeons, even really good surgeons, they don't always know why. They'll say, \"Hey, I had the best surgery day, the X-ray looked fantastic. That patient is not happy, I do not know why,\" we don't either, but I'm pretty confident with the data we're collecting we'll be able to predict it in the future and then change the care for that patient. And that's really good for the patient, and that's why we're doing it.\nIvan Tornos: I'll just maybe quickly add that in addition to the example of ROSA, which I think is a great example of the market being ready to pay for technology, we really have thousands of patients in or the mymobility by Apple platform, so another example of when you do provide the right data people will pay for it. There's two questions that every day we are trying to solve with payers and providers, can we lower the length of a stay in a hospital post surgery? Can we lower readmission rates? And if you can do that through data and technology, the market will pay for that. And we're making [both base] [Ph] that we're going to be able to do both of those.\nKeri Mattox: Yes, Jason, thanks for the question.\nJason Wittes: Thank you very much. I'll jump back in queue.\nKeri Mattox: No, thank you. Jake, if we can go to the next question in queue that'd be great?\nOperator: And we'll hear from Chris Pasquale with Nephron.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Just following up on the Persona IQ question, can you give us a sense for the scope of what you're collecting? And is this something we should expect at the AAOS meeting, in spring, or is the timing not going to line up with that?\nIvan Tornos: Well, I tell you I could spend an hour talking about these things that we're collecting, but from pre-op, to intra-op, to post-op, through different devices we're collecting data. Now we have Persona IQ, which is obviously intra-op and post-op, we're looking at things such as resection data, gap balancing, the accuracy on cuts, the overall alignment, the range, so of motion expectations, we're looking at post-op at asymmetry of the actual implant, the step length, what else, gait speed, how well are you doing at physical therapy post surgery. Again, I can go on and on. In addition to those patient-centric measures, we're looking at how to design products in a better way based on how those implants are functioning post-op, post surgery. But I think, in the academy, you'll see much more in this space. But again the idea going back to value proposition is out all these multiple data points, what are the two or three that are going to drive their premium and their willingness to pay. I'm looking forward to sharing that in the academy.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. And I think it's important because you said it, it's not just IQ, it is an ecosystem of a capability that allows us to collect data across all areas of the procedure, before, during, and after, in a combination of those things that will create that data lake that is just too vast for us to make any sense of, but with machine learning we can look for patterns in the data and ultimately provide insights as a result of it.\nChris Pasquale: I see, thank you. And then I just wanted to clarify on the pricing commentary. You guys used to give the impact of price by business, went away from that this year, but if I look back over the past seven or eight years, the average impact was just a little bit over 2%. So, I'm a little confused by the three to four-point comment, and how much of an improvement we should really expect if 2% is the target going forward, may be you could just clarify that? Thanks.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, so, I'll take that one. So, overall, on a consolidated basis, you're right, it was somewhere in the 200 to 300 range, but if you deconstructed that and actually looked by category, and we did provide that level of data, you would see that knee and hip or recon was higher on price erosion than the overall consolidated. And you saw generally lower than that average in S.E.T., so that was your offset. I don't know if Ivan -- \nIvan Tornos: Now just to be clear on this, 300 to 400 basis points, that is large joints in the U.S. So, when you look at the overall category it might have been different. But yes, it was not unusual to see 300 -- even higher than 400 basis points here in the U.S. given the way that we contract then -- and historical factors.\nChris Pasquale: Got it, thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Chris. Jake, we have time for maybe one or two more questions. Can we go to the queue?\nOperator: Yes, we'll hear from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you, good morning. Follow-up on S.E.T., you talked about the pipeline you have coming in your focus areas. As you think about overall S.E.T. versus WAMGR for those markets, do you see a pathway to improved foot and ankle growth versus that market, either through internal innovation or M&A [technical difficulty] overall thoughts on your foot and ankle from here?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, so what I'd say is, again, all six of the categories we have in S.E.T. are interesting and attractive categories, there's no question. We do bias our investment and our focus areas, which are the ones that are referenced, CMFT, sports, and upper extremities, mainly because those businesses have either been able to acquire a full portfolio, have a full portfolio, and we see a cleaner path to leadership in those spaces, and so they get disproportionate amount of investment. And as a result of that, we expect above-market growth in those spaces. In the other categories, they still get investment, they're still important to us; we just expect a different performance because the investment level is different. Now, if any one of those businesses comes back with a pathway, through acquisition or otherwise, that would also show a clear path to leadership, it could become a focus area as well. I don't know if you wanted to add anything, Ivan?\nIvan Tornos: I'll just keep it very succinct and say we have not given up on our foot and ankle. There is, I would say, a meaningful amount of R&D that is going to add space. We recently closed the buyout of an extremity, which was a part of [indiscernible]. We now have a more complete offering in forefoot, midfoot, and hindfoot. We had some biology solutions that we're launching as we speak. We had a partnership with a sports medicine group on sutures. So, there is a compelling portfolio, I would label it, that we're seeing that we're going to be able to launch here.\nSteven Lichtman: Got it, okay. And, Bryan, you said before that as you guys moved into Phase 3 of your transformation M&A got crimped, obviously, by COVID. The impact there from a procedure volume basis has ebbed, but obviously there were some other macro headwinds, your balance sheet is in good shape. So, how do you feel, overall, about the environment for Zimmer to go out and do some deals here over the next 12 to 18 months?\nBryan Hanson: Well, it'll tell you, a lot better now than it did before, that's for sure. The fact is our financial flexibility is improving, the balance sheet looks strong. And we've earned the right now to be able to truly increase our focus in this area. Don't get me wrong, all along, since we've been in Phase 3 we've been looking at the market, looking for assets that we could pursue. But now, our ability to execute this phase of our transformation is more real. And just to give you some color there, we truly will be looking at mission-centric targets, because that's the number one criteria. We're also going to be looking for places where we believe or spaces where we believe we can get a path to leadership, at least at some point. We're always going to be looking for WAMGR-accretive assets, and then those things, that as a result of that, can drive faster growth and faster EPS growth over time. To size it, we're probably looking more small-to-medium size deals. And it would be across three areas. Number one would be to diversify in our faster-growth orthopedic markets, like extremities for CMFT, and even settings like ASC, but also, secondly, to diversify our revenue outside of traditional orthopedics with an eye towards those things that are a little less selective in nature. And then inside of recon, we're actually looking to enhance our position in those faster-growth submarkets of recon so we can bring our WAMGR up there as well, things like data and robotics. So, that's where we're going to focus in. We've been at Phase 3 for a while, we've got a lot of things that we're interested in, and now we have a little more financial flexibility to move in that direction.\nKeri Mattox: Yes. And Jake, we probably have to end there. I know we're a little bit above 9:30 here, but thanks for all the questions, all great from the queue. Bryan, don't know if there's any closing remarks that you'd make to round out the call?\nBryan Hanson: Yes, I think what I would say it, hey, it was a strong quarter, but it's just a quarter. The fact is the momentum has been there for a long time. And I'm just really happy that finally, with some of the clouds being removed, you can actually see the performance that the team is actually delivering. I think -- I do want to make sure that we're clear, as we think about that concept of we should at least do a 4% growth rate, it's going to be choppy for a while. The fact is it's not a clean market, it's not an undisturbed market, and it's not going to be for a while. So, you could expect quarters that might be above that 4%, and you might expect to see quarters that are below that 4% just given all that noise in the market. Make no mistake, the business momentum is real. The team is executing right now flawlessly, and our product pipeline is really, really strong, so, our confidence is high. Even though it's going to be choppy for a while our confidence is very high.\nKeri Mattox: Okay. Thanks, everyone, for the questions. Of course, if you have others, please don't hesitate to reach out to the team today, and I'm sure we'll talk soon. Thanks for joining.\nOperator: And this concludes the Zimmer Biomet quarterly earnings call. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a good quarter, driven by strong execution and faster than expected recovery of elective procedures across most markets. While we continue to face heightened headwinds and challenges related to foreign currency, inflation, and supply chain disruptions, our second quarter performance gives us the confidence to raise our full-year revenue and EPS outlook. With that, I'll turn to our second quarter results and how that translates into our updated full-year financial guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter of 2022, and how it compares to the same period in 2021. And my commentary will be on a constant currency or adjusted continuing operations basis. Net sales in the second quarter were $1.782 billion, up 1% on a reported, and 6% on a constant currency basis. As Bryan mentioned, strong procedure volume recovery extended from the first quarter, especially as we moved into April and May, with moderation of recovery in June. U.S. sales grew 1.3% driven by strong recovery in execution as COVID cases subsided and elective procedures returned especially in knee and hips. This was partially offset by lower S.E.T. growth and declines in the Other category. International sales grew 12.2% driven by strong procedural volume across most markets in EMEA and APAC. EMEA experienced rapid uptake in the second quarter across developed and emerging markets, with a generally lighter comp versus 2021. Asia-Pacific, overall, grew in line with expectations, with China performing largely as projected, and Japan growing better than anticipated. Turning to our business category performance, Global knees grew 11.2%, with U.S. knees up 4.5%, and international knees up 20.1%. These results were driven by easy comparisons OUS, along with strong knee procedure recovery across most regions, continued global traction for our Persona knee system, especially with Persona Revision in the U.S., and ROSA penetration and pull-through. While hips grew 8.9% with U.S. hips up 2.6% and international hips up 14.9%, driven by easier comparisons OUS in tandem with strong international procedure recovery. We also saw continued traction across key hip products including our Arcos and G7 system for revision and our Avenir complete primary hip which is focused on the direct anterior surgical approach. And lastly, we continue to see solid ROSA pull-through in the hip category. Sports, extremities, and trauma category increased 0.1% and was impacted by a tough comp in 2021, expected pressure in trauma due to VBP implementation as well as expected pressure in restorative therapies due to a reimbursement shift for our Gel-One product. Within the category, we continued to deliver strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine, and upper extremities. Finally, our other category declined 6.1% driven by tough comps and expected lower capital sales related to a higher mix of ROSA placement versus upfront sales in the quarter. Moving to the P&L, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.73 compared to our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68 in the second quarter of 2021. Higher revenue and lower IPR&D charges more than offset restructuring and mark to market losses on our retained ZimVie stake. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.82 represented an increase from $1.51 in the second quarter of '21. Higher sales in tandem with lower IPR&D in the quarter more than offset lower year-over-year gross margins. Adjusted gross margin was 71.6%, slightly ahead of expectation due primarily to better mix and lower pricing erosion. As a note, we expect heightened inflation to temper our observed second quarter favorability as we move through the rest of the year. We continue to project full-year gross margin to be slightly down when compared to full-year 2021 gross margin. And as we said, increasing inflationary pressure will pull-through into '23. And we now expect about 50 to 100 basis points of headwind from inflation in 2023 versus our previous estimate of about 50 basis points. Our adjusted operating expenses were $777 million. Lower than the prior year primarily due to the 2021 IPR&D charges referenced earlier. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 28%, up from the prior year. As previously noted, full-year margins will be pressured versus the prior year due to inflation, supply chain headwind, and China VBP with partial offset by the ongoing realization of our efficiency programs. Despite these ongoing headwinds, we expect those efficiency programs to drive improved second-half operating margins versus the first-half of the year. The adjusted tax rate was 16.5% in the quarter and in line with our expectations. Operating cash flows were $346 million. And free cash flow totaled $240 million for the quarter. We paid down about $100 million of debt in the second quarter and ended with cash and cash and equivalent of about $390 million. Our improving financial performance in tandem with ongoing reductions in debt, continue to strengthen our balance sheet for greater strategic flexibility. And now moving to our updated financial outlook for the full-year 2022, we are raising our financial guidance based on the following key assumptions. COVID and customer stocking pressures will continue through 2022, but with a lesser impact than previously anticipated. Supply chain and inflationary pressures stabilized at current levels and foreign currency will be a 500 basis point headwind in '22 versus our previous projection of $350 basis points. Also, we assume about a 30% flow through of FX-related revenue headwind falls to EPS. And that the FX headwind applies to the full range of EPS guidance. Against this backdrop, I'll walk through our updated financial guidance for the year. Constant currency revenue growth is now expected to be 4% to 6% versus 21 with an expected foreign currency headwind of 500 basis points. This means that reported revenue growth is expected to be in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% versus 2021. We are raising adjusted operating margin by 25 basis points to the range of 26.75% to 27.75%. Adjusted tax rate guidance remains in the range of 16% to 16.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be higher, at $6.70 to $6.90. And free cash flow is now expected to improve to $800 million to $900 million. And lastly, net interest expense and non-operating expense will be modestly higher than the $160 million we anticipated earlier this year due to higher interest rates and foreign currency. We expect to see typical seasonality in the back-half of the year, which would suggest stronger revenue dollars in Q4 than in Q3. Additionally, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be higher than Q3 growth, in part due to the easier fourth quarter comp related to China VBP headwinds we observed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating margins are expected to follow a similar tend as revenue. In summary, while there are macro challenges and headwinds, our team is navigating those challenges and executing well. We are raising our '22 financial guidance due to better than expected COVID recovery, the strength of our execution, and our confidence in ZB's underlying business fundamentals. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. Yes, so, good morning, Rick. Good to be with you today. So, if you look at our implied guidance in second-half at the midpoint versus what we did in the first-half, you would get about 4% operational ex-FX growth for revenue. And really what underpins that is three key assumptions we've made inside that. One, you've got tougher comps in the second-half than you saw in the first-half. You see that especially with EMEA if you just think about the second quarter growth we just posted. But it really translates to other markets as well, so tougher comps. Two, we have one less selling day in the second-half of the year, so we've accounted for that. And third, as Bryan talked about, we're just taking a prudent view on COVID especially given our index to elective procedures. We did see some softening of procedures due to those cancellations as we exited the second quarter. And we're assuming that that continues into the third quarter with a step up or improvement in COVID in the fourth quarter. Now, I would say if we don't see that pressure continue all the way through the third quarter that would likely take us to the top end of our range. So, those are some of the big building blocks that we've assumed in our second-half growth rate. But as Bryan said, we feel really confident about the execution of the team, where our pipeline is going, and our ability to execute on our recent product launches, so feeling really good about the second-half. Yes, so, I'm you feeling encouraged, because we're feeling encouraged as well, that's the outlook. As we -- we're not going to get into guidance, obviously, for '23, there's still a lot more to play out in '22. But as we think about a normalized market and normal market dynamics, we would expect revenue at floor of 4%. And inside of that, based on all of the operational efficiencies the team has been very successful in making and things that we've got planned for next year, we believe we can offset these headwinds that we're seeing this year relative to inflationary pressures. And we believe we're in a position where we can expand margins into 2023. Now, albeit it won't be as great a margin expansion as you would have if we didn't have these inflationary pressures this year, but we still feel confident that we can expand margins with that type of top line growth profile into next year. Yes, hey, Pito, this is Suky. So, I'll start with the operating margin guide. So, inside of that, gross margin we do expect to step down in the second-half versus the first-half. We are experiencing greater headwinds due to inflationary pressures, and that's banked into our operating margin guide. And that's increased in the second quarter from our first quarter call. And what we now see is where we originally anticipated, about 50 basis points of that incremental inflationary pressure landing in 2023. We now think it's closer to 50 to 100 basis points. But again, we've completed included that in our new operating margin and gross margin guide or expectations for the rest of this year. Now, I would say, inside of that our assumption is that inflationary pressures stay relatively stable to where we exited the second quarter as we think about the rest of the year. If you take that operating margin you would expect perhaps a bigger EPS flow-through, but as you're seeing with across the sector, FX has been a significant headwind, taking our number up from 350 basis points of headwind, now to 500 basis points of headwind. And so, if you think about our EPS guide and our raise, the way to think about it is while we're increasing our ex-FX or operational growth by 200 basis points, our reported growth at the midpoint is only going up by 50 basis points. And so, if you take that 50 basis points that translates to about an incremental $35 million in revenue, including Q2 performance. And if you flow that through that would get you to about a nickel. And so, that helps support or helps give the big building blocks around the $0.05 raise that we just put in there. So, hopefully that gets to your questions, but happy to take any follow-ons you might have. Yes, so right now, we're assuming is flowing through to net income at about 30%. And that's inclusive of any natural hedges we have plus any FX gains and losses. Now, I would say that 30% can vary over time for a number of variables can vary based on mix of regional profit, it could vary because of timing of foreign currency changes, it could vary because of the timing of FX gains and losses. But right now, our best estimate is 30%. And as that changes, over time, we'll keep you updated. Yes, so had two other questions in there, Larry. One was on the quarter for knee and hip, and anything that we saw in there. But I would say it's a very clean quarter. We really didn't see anything material or meaningful relative to shifts in timing on tenders or anything. It was pretty straightforward on both -- well, on recon in total. And then relative to other, it was down, primarily driven by the mix of ROSA; I would say the installments continue to be very strong. As a company, we're very happy with how that -- the continued uptick of ROSA and the utilization increases we're seeing. But the mix of placements versus sales was different than the prior year where we saw, this year, more placements or this quarter more placements than we saw absolute dollars in sales. And then we did see just a little bit, a modest level of pressure in surgical capital within our other business, so again, that was the -- those were the two key drivers to the year-over-year declines in the quarter. Yes. Yes, Jayson, great question. Good clarification. It's really more about operating margin expansion. As I said, we've got some inflationary pressure this year that's going to capitalize into next year, which is going to put some headwind into gross margin year-over-year. I don't want to get into exactly where we think gross margin is going to end. We just know that year-over-year as a starting point you've got 50 to 100 basis points working against you because of things that happened this year. Having said that, quite excited about all the progress the team is making to help offset those. We are doing some really good things around pricing which is improving our profile. You saw that in this quarter we expect to see some of those more strategic and tactical levers continue to play through for the rest of this year and into next year. Really happy about what the supply chain and commercial teams are doing relative to site optimization and cost down in manufacturing. Even in the backdrop of a very dynamic supply chain market and the challenges with trying to get product and packaging materials and logistics all sorted out in a very again volatile market. And then beyond that in SG&A, we are going to continue to look at improvements in our go-to-market market models commercial models across the world. We have already implemented a number of those, for instance, in Europe where we look to restructure and rethink how we go to market in lower margin markets as well as lower margin business categories. And then, the global business services operating model that we created during the pandemic is ripe for further leverage. And we think that we can continue to drive efficiencies by putting more of our activities into those service lines. So, we feel really good that despite ongoing gross margin pressures because of these inflationary headwinds that we see a clear path to operating margin expansion into '23. So, hope that gives you a little bit more color and clarification on where expect to see it. I think it's a good question. I would say it's a bit balance. It's multi-factorial. I would say that even in the quarter -- in the second quarter we didn't talk about backlog much. But I do believe in certain areas where you had capacity, capabilities, we did see some backlog come through. Unfortunately, what we continue to see is also an offset typically of that in other areas that have either COVID or staffing pressure that then drive the numbers down. So, I have kind of continued to see there is a kind of offsetting of areas that can drive forward and pick up backlog in other areas that are probably building backlog. I don't know when that's going to stop. It's hard to predict. But the good news is that we are seeing that anyways very strong procedure growth. We're just seeing canceling being the thing we are concentrating on. So, we're not seeing COVID driving ICU beds in the wrong direction or capacity of ICU beds being in challenge. It just is patient wants to come in. The procedure is being scheduled either the patient or the staff member gets COVID and they can't conduct the procedure. That's what we are seeing and that's what we saw more in June and July so far. Yes, thanks for the question. I will actually turn it over to Ivan. He is probably the closest in doing the day-to-day [cost head] [Ph] on this. And it's not surprising that that occurs. Even if you just look at the implants, even in a very strong account that we would have, usually it's not homogenous with one implant. You typically have competitive implants in there as well. So, we follow suit that if you are going to move into robotics, you likely will have more than one robotic system. You are absolutely right. It is going to be it is today and it will be a premium priced product. It is one of those opportunities for sure while just like you would see in robotics disposables. You would see in my mobility. You would see in a cementless uptick in price point. And that's why we are sprinting right now to be able to collect data to prove out the value proposition as I said in my prepared remarks. But Ivan, obviously you are very close to launch maybe you could speak to that as well. Yes, so, I'll take that one. So, overall, on a consolidated basis, you're right, it was somewhere in the 200 to 300 range, but if you deconstructed that and actually looked by category, and we did provide that level of data, you would see that knee and hip or recon was higher on price erosion than the overall consolidated. And you saw generally lower than that average in S.E.T., so that was your offset. I don't know if Ivan -- Yes, so what I'd say is, again, all six of the categories we have in S.E.T. are interesting and attractive categories, there's no question. We do bias our investment and our focus areas, which are the ones that are referenced, CMFT, sports, and upper extremities, mainly because those businesses have either been able to acquire a full portfolio, have a full portfolio, and we see a cleaner path to leadership in those spaces, and so they get disproportionate amount of investment. And as a result of that, we expect above-market growth in those spaces. In the other categories, they still get investment, they're still important to us; we just expect a different performance because the investment level is different. Now, if any one of those businesses comes back with a pathway, through acquisition or otherwise, that would also show a clear path to leadership, it could become a focus area as well. I don't know if you wanted to add anything, Ivan?"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ivan Tornos",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Larry. And thanks, Bryan. So, you mentioned shoulder, and whether this is one device that is driving the growth, and I think the answer, Larry, is that that's not the case, it's more than one product. You are familiar with sort of Signature One Planner and guides. We launched that about three years ago, that today, above 50% of all procedures are done using this technology. And the feedback continues to be really compelling around accuracy, around the simple interface with the surgeon, the integration of the workflow, and just the fact that the surgeon is in control. Nano or the Stemless Shoulder was also launched, and is getting great momentum. The big launch that I think you're talking about hasn't happened yet, or Identity launch, which is going to be our biggest shoulder launch in the last five years, is about to get launched. And that is going to be as spacing-centric as it gets, truly a personalized solution. It has the ability of doing inlay and only reconstruction. I can spend an hour talking about it. I know you're a product guy, and what I tell you, it's going to be transformational. But beyond shoulders, in Sports Med, we have filled the portfolio very quickly, still integrating Relign, the acquisition that we did about 12 months ago. It is an all-in-one arthroscopic surgical platform; the feedback continues to be great both on the capital and consumable side. We got new products on ankles, and again I can continue to go on and on. But I will say that our portfolio in Sports Med today has everything that we need to have. And then lastly on CMFT, as Bryan referenced, that is a double-digit growth business with a combination of organic and inorganic plays. We launched new products on thoracic and neuro, we're about to launch as many as six to seven different products in the next 12 to 18 months, and we're making a lot of investments in that business. So, it's not one product, it's not one category. At least three categories are growing really strongly globally. And then, on top of that, I will say our commercial execution is best in class when it comes to the focus, the specialization, incentive plan, and our contracting capabilities, so, really excited about the S.E.T. and the momentum that we got, Larry. Yes, absolutely. So, on question number one, Josh, I concur with Bryan, the physician is clearly the decision-maker. But the role of the provider and the payer is also very, very important, and obviously we target those decision-makers as well. Relative to ROSA, I'll tell you Josh, what makes ROSA unique is not that it is one product; it is part of an ecosystem that consolidates a lot of different parts and pieces. It's fully integrated with a lot of pre-op stuff, our partnership with Apple and mymobility or planning software, the fact that you can use ROSA with the number one in the world, Persona, the connectivity with some data points, the OrthoIntel data platforms, and obviously Persona IQ at some point. So, I think it's more of an integrated solution than just one product that is driving those decision-makers to come our way. If you go out there and ask physicians why -- or payers, for that matter, why are they choosing ROSA; other than the outcomes and the technology at play, they like the efficiency, they like the fact that our preplanning is easier, they're seeing the outcomes. And I think those are the reason why we're seeing the great momentum with ROSA. So, hopefully, that answers your question. Yes, absolutely, thanks. So, I will tell you. When I joined this business four years ago, the normal price erosion was 3 even 400 basis points per year, in some categories, 500 basis points. That's not what we are. That's not what we are going to be. I would be extremely disappointed it would not below end of the range of 2% and that is on a bad day if you ask me, 200 basis points of price erosion. Relative to what we are doing, what are seeing success, first of all I'll define the journey as a three stage journey. Tactical, number one; strategic, number two; transformational, number three. We completed number one. We have done a lot of tactical stuff. Raising price for non-core products, raising price in non-core markets, thinking differently about different customers, business segmentation, all of that is being done. We are getting get success. Stage number two, strategic, I would say we are probably midpoint in that stage. It's about category contracting. We have number one position in hips and knees in many different accounts around the world. We have now done a good job in leveraging that position to bring S.E.T. another categories that is happening. Now that we have truly an ecosystem solution, we are bundling -- I don't like that word but that's the one that comes to mind our ecosystem and contracting across the [indiscernible] care. We are doing a lot of things in terms of thinking ASCs. We incorporate a ton of people in our contracting group that are thinking more strategically about those relationships, line extensions and what not. And then at some point, we will get into the transformational stage and that is how do we leverage all this data we are getting to do a risk chain agreements? Now that we learnt product platforms like Workai, we are able to engage in predictive analytics. We are going to leverage that to really understand what happens 3 - 6 months after a surgery is done. So, three different stages I would say again with our stage 2. And we are not at least or at worst at 2% price erosion, we are not doing our job. Thanks for the question. Yes, sure, absolutely. I'll tell you I am really proud of the work that the team has done globally. We are now in 40 countries with ROSA over the last three years. But I am even more energized about what's happening or what's going to happen over the next three years. But to throw some color, I won't disclose the number of placements. Bryan has done that in the past. I won't talk about penetration. But I will tell you that is double digit here in the U.S. We had a solid Q2. Sequentially, we grew both on sales and placement, overall installment Q2 22 versus Q1 of 2022 versus last year's comps was a headwind. We continue to see a nice mix in terms of the installations in an inpatient unit than in an ASC unit. I mentioned earlier that the feedback from customers is very compelling when it comes efficiency. And today about 30% of all installations have been in ASC. So, that's a great lead indicator to what's going to happen here given the migration into the setting. From competitive standpoint, we track that obviously very closely. About 40% to 50% of installations are happening in competitive accounts. And again, the number of returns and the feedback has been very, very positive in that space as well. So, really excited about where we are. It's a global business continue to see penetration in the right direction. And as I think about next three years, we have as many indications coming, I would say that we are in the really, really early innings of this game. Yes, absolutely, Jason. Thank you. It really depends. We are in a lot of teaching institutions. And as you can imagine when you are talking to HSS, Hospital for Special Surgery in New York or the Cleveland Clinic or Mayo, they do like to have a wide range of different robotic solutions. So, it's not uncommon to see two or even three robotic systems there. So, that comes to mind when it comes to selection. As you look at other savings, that depends. It depends on the preference. When you have high volume surgeons that you used to using Persona, then they tend to gravitate towards ROSA because it does integrate Persona and it drives a different level of efficiency. So, that depends on the volume of the surgeon, teaching institution, non-teaching institution. Yes, we do have examples in the U.S. and globally where you have as many as two or even three robots in an account. Yes, I am not sure, Jason that we are ready to commit to a launch date. We knew early on when we acquired this technology when we partnered with Canary in this technology that this was going to be a limited market release. And it could take 6, 12, or 18 months depends on the level of data we are getting. We knew that the [Elemar] [Ph] was more of clinical exercise than a commercial exercise. We are on track with the things we want to get. Really the Elemar had three stages. Number one is validation of the value proposition. And again, we are getting millions. And I am talking millions of data points so far in this Elemar, anything from what happens intraop on resection, gap balancing, the level of alignment, the cutting, what happens postop in terms of range of motion, in terms of gait, speed and all kind of things. With all those data points, we need to understand what is the true value proposition for that patient, that provider, and that physician. The second part is how do we -- once we really do launch the product, how do we make this efficient. What's the pathway towards activating sites at a faster speed? How do we change surgeons? How do we deal with data questions around privacy and what not? And then number three is really what's next? We don't want to be just a smart knee company; want to be a smart solutions company. So, we have got a pathway to get into hip. We have got a pathway to get into shoulder. When understand both cemented and cement less needs; different platform. And to that end, there is a lot of data we are getting to understand what is that we are going to do from a portfolio standpoint. So, I am not going to commit to a date for launch. But I would tell you we are on track in terms of gathering all the data and the roadmap ahead. I'll just maybe quickly add that in addition to the example of ROSA, which I think is a great example of the market being ready to pay for technology, we really have thousands of patients in or the mymobility by Apple platform, so another example of when you do provide the right data people will pay for it. There's two questions that every day we are trying to solve with payers and providers, can we lower the length of a stay in a hospital post surgery? Can we lower readmission rates? And if you can do that through data and technology, the market will pay for that. And we're making [both base] [Ph] that we're going to be able to do both of those. Well, I tell you I could spend an hour talking about these things that we're collecting, but from pre-op, to intra-op, to post-op, through different devices we're collecting data. Now we have Persona IQ, which is obviously intra-op and post-op, we're looking at things such as resection data, gap balancing, the accuracy on cuts, the overall alignment, the range, so of motion expectations, we're looking at post-op at asymmetry of the actual implant, the step length, what else, gait speed, how well are you doing at physical therapy post surgery. Again, I can go on and on. In addition to those patient-centric measures, we're looking at how to design products in a better way based on how those implants are functioning post-op, post surgery. But I think, in the academy, you'll see much more in this space. But again the idea going back to value proposition is out all these multiple data points, what are the two or three that are going to drive their premium and their willingness to pay. I'm looking forward to sharing that in the academy. Now just to be clear on this, 300 to 400 basis points, that is large joints in the U.S. So, when you look at the overall category it might have been different. But yes, it was not unusual to see 300 -- even higher than 400 basis points here in the U.S. given the way that we contract then -- and historical factors. I'll just keep it very succinct and say we have not given up on our foot and ankle. There is, I would say, a meaningful amount of R&D that is going to add space. We recently closed the buyout of an extremity, which was a part of [indiscernible]. We now have a more complete offering in forefoot, midfoot, and hindfoot. We had some biology solutions that we're launching as we speak. We had a partnership with a sports medicine group on sutures. So, there is a compelling portfolio, I would label it, that we're seeing that we're going to be able to launch here."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "All right, great. Thanks, Keri, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning for the call. We've got three sections for the call this morning. The first section, I'll talk briefly about our Q2 performance from an overall perspective, and how a combination of strong execution and COVID recovery have actually enabled us to revise our expectations up again for the full-year. And that's in the face of some pretty significant macro pressures, especially around FX. I'll also spend a few minutes talking about ZB Innovation, that's a primary contributor to our performance today, and certainly our performance in the future, so we want to make sure we touch upon that. And for the second section, I'll switch it to Suky, and Suky will obviously provide details on Q2, but I think even more importantly and probably more interesting is to talk about 2022 guidance and our updates there. And then for our favorite section of the call, we'll close things out by addressing any questions you might have, either on Q2 or any other topic. So, let's go ahead and get started with Q2, and I'll start this section by saying that despite some very real and what I would define as universal challenges in our sector, I'm very proud of the fact that the team delivered again another solid quarter that actually was above our internal expectations. And I think this speaks to the team's, I'm just going to define it as, muscle memory associated with effectively managing through challenging times, and that's exactly what we have right now. With the supply concerns that are out there, it is a challenging time, and it's great to know that our team has that muscle memory to manage trough it effectively, and they continue to show that. The primary reason for the overachievement was stronger than anticipated COVID recovery, for sure, which happened in the quarter, but also just really solid and focused execution from the team across our regions and all of our business segments. From a procedure volume standpoint, the momentum that we saw in Q1, particularly at the end of Q1 actually continued through April and May, but we did see a bit of a slowdown in June, and that has actually carried over through to July. The recovery pace was different depending on where you were in the world in Q2. It was strong everywhere, but it was really strong outside the U.S., where we saw a strong performance pretty much across the board in all of our areas OUS. And inside of this, we saw solid momentum again in knees and hips. I'm really pleased to see another strong quarter in large joints, and excited that we continue to get traction for our innovation in this area. The momentum in large joints was then offset by some expected pressure in our S.E.T. businesses and our other category, and Suky will provide more detail here in a minute. I think it's pretty clear for all of us, actually, that foreign currency is a challenge, supply challenges are very real, inflationary pressures are with us right now. And those hurt us in Q2, all of these did, they're going to continue to pressure us through the back-half of '22, and potentially beyond. But just get on our business momentum this far into the year. Our new product innovation and the traction we're getting there with our customers and COVID recovery, at least the profile today, our overall confidence in 2022 has actually gotten better. And as a result of that we are raising our full-year guidance for revenue, operating margin, and earnings per share. And I think this should be a solid indication that our strategy is working, and our team is executing, really just getting it done. And our underlying business is gaining strength. And a big part of that, a big part of this momentum is our new product innovation, and continuing to deliver in delighting out customers. And in Q2, we debuted another element of our ZBEdge ecosystem, and this is an AI technology within our Omni Suite smart OR system that focuses on optimizing surgical workflow and increasing procedure efficiency. And I'd say that's important right now. It's really important because of the capacity constraints that our customers have. Separate from that, from a ROSA perspective, ROSA robotics momentum continued in both knee and hip for the quarter, and our placement pipeline remains extremely strong. And while it's still in limited launch and very early days, the feedback and interest in Persona iQ is positive, and we're focused on collecting as much early data as quickly as we possibly can, with an eye toward clearly establishing clinical use benefits, so we move into full launch in 2023, or as prepared as possible. And all of these innovations and our broader ZBEdge suite highlight the possibilities around data collection and integration on the patient and customer experience, and that's really our focus. In addition to the strength of our existing product portfolio, our new product pipeline is just as exciting. We have additional product launches planned for the second-half of 2022, especially across our knee and S.E.T. portfolios. In knee, our soon-to-be-launched Persona cementless form factor will compliment our current form factor, and provide additional momentum for cementless conversions, particularly as we get into 2023. And in our S.E.T. businesses, I'm very excited about our Identity shoulder system launch. And this is going to be a much more customizable shoulder for a more personalized feel for the patient that should optimize movement in the shoulder. We're also continuing to reshape our business and accelerate ZB's transformation. We've made significant progress in streamlining and modernizing our operating model. But we've also really focused on making ZB a best and preferred place to work, as well as a trusted partner, which are two of our strategic pillars for the company. In Q2, Zimmer Biomet was certified by Great Place to Work, this is a global authority on workplace culture. The U.S. certification was based on direct survey feedback from our team members, which I think makes it even more compelling. We also established a new function for refining and driving our environmental, social, and governance strategy, but also the commitments and actions we're taking in this area as well. We have already seen significant improvements across almost every element of ESG, and truly, we're just getting started. We see this as an important responsibility as a company, for sure, but also something we believe is critically important to our team members, our customers, and our investors. You'll be hearing more from us on the ESG front as we make further progress, and as we continue to enhance our reporting in this area. So, in summary, even though there are real macro headwinds that our team is managing, the recovery shift in COVID continues, and the execution of our strategy is making a difference. We'll need to stay close to the headwinds into the recovery; any of the last couple years have proven that things are fluid. But I do feel confident in our team's ability to navigate the path forward, and I'm excited about where ZB is going. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky for a deeper dive into Q2, and again, a look at our revised expectations for the year. Okay, Suky? Yes, thanks for the question, Rick. So, what I would tell you is that what we experienced and, of course, we talk to a lot of our customers as well, as you would imagine. But what we experienced is in June, and then carrying through to July, not fewer procedures, but more cancellations of those procedures. And most of that was driven by either, one, the staff member having COVID or testing positive for COVID, or the patient testing positive for COVID and as a result of that they could not carry on with the procedure. And what we're saying is that we believe that could continue. We believe that could continue. Until we see a shift, we're going to assume it will continue at least through the third quarter. That's just what we're experiencing. The good news is, when I think about the quarter, we had a really strong quarter, and that business momentum -- the underlying business momentum is real, and we believe that's going to continue. But outside of that, I don't know if you want to speak more, Suky, to just our second-half view? Yes, I'd just maybe make additional comment on that. And I would agree, yes, I think that the execution of the business and the team is very real. The momentum in the business is real. The product pipeline that we have is very strong, that we haven't even launched yet. So, for all those things coming together in a normal market, I would be very disappointed if we didn't deliver at least a 4% growth rate. And that said, that's not where we're going to stop, right. We clearly have a little more cash flexibility, and that opens up options for us from an acquisition standpoint. And we're going to be looking to add accretive WAMGR acquisitions, potentially diversifying acquisitions to bolster that growth rate over time. Sure. Sure, and thanks, Larry. So, what I would tell you is that there was nothing other than some easy comps, obviously, that we had OUS. There was no one-time event that buoyed the quarter that somehow skewed the quarter. It was just the factors that we referenced already that came together and allowed for a very strong quarter OUS. So, that's the first answer. Yes, I'll hit S.E.T., and then maybe Suky, you could talk about other or Ivan, you can as well. So, on the S.E.T. side, I think it's probably good to just take a step back because we don't talk about the subcategories that often of S.E.T., and just kind of reorient everybody. We have six businesses underneath S.E.T. We have our CMFT, which is our Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic business, Sports Med, Upper Extremities, Foot and Ankle, Trauma, and Restorative Therapies. And I would just say, in the quarter, we saw a very strong performance in our three focus area, Upper Extremities, CMFT, and Sports, with Upper Extremities and CMFT both growing double digits in the quarter, and we think that's sustainable, and Sports Medicine growing mid-single digits even with the pretty tough comp in that area, that was offset by expected pressure from Asia-Pacific in Trauma. And to be very clear, we expect that to continue, that pressure in Asia-Pacific to continue through Q3, but then reverse itself in Q4. And then in the U.S., we saw pressure in Restorative Therapies. This is due, as Suky had already mentioned, because of a reimbursement change in Gel-One. But what's important on this is that's going to accelerate into Q3, and continue through about mid-2023, and then it will annualize out, okay. So, just net-net, I would expect S.E.T. to stay pressured in Q3, and then improve in Q4. And again, we feel pretty confident that we're going to continue to see momentum in our focus areas. And maybe, Ivan, you could speak to some of the innovation and some of the things that give you confidence about those areas? Great, thanks, Ivan. And maybe, Suky, just speak quickly to other? Yes, thanks, Josh, for the question. I would say that it's always been a combination of the implant and the value of the implant to the surgeon, and will always be that way in concert with the technology you bring that surrounds the implant. That could be robotics, it could be mymobility, it could be our entire ecosystem that surrounds the implant. So, it's always been a combination of those two things. When I look at our performances, those things are now coming together in a cleaner market than we've had in the past. And so, the underlying strength we've had as a business has been masked by some external things. As those clouds begin to move, I think you're going to see the real performance of this come out. But with that said, obviously, Ivan is here, he's much closer to it even than I am. So, maybe you could speak to what you're seeing out there? Yes, it's a great question. And it's interesting, because when I first started at Zimmer Biomet, I made the mistake one time on an earnings call talking about the fact that we are going to reduce SKUs, and the stock just tanked because normally what happens when you do that, there is risk associated with revenue. What we have done then is just to be quiet about it. But we have also been doing it. We had dramatic decreases in SKUs over the past 4 years, dramatic. And we are going to continue to focus on that because there is a lot of inefficiencies in orthopedics if you have multiple product lines you are trying to cover and it reduces focus in the field. So, we really are trying to focus on the main brands, push from an incentive standpoint our teams to focus on those brands and rationalize categories they are just not as important to us. So, again we have been doing that very quietly but very effectively over the last 4.5 years. Sure. I think you've always got to try to take a stab at those two things, therefore we are just not going to provide it. But I do want, Ivan, if you could talk about the momentum? I mean we are seeing really strong momentum in ROSA. It was a little off from the other category given the mix as Suky referenced before. We sold less than we did the prior year. But the placements were still strong. And the pull-through on those placements are also still strong, but maybe you can speak. I'll answer in a couple ways. I think first I would look at data points that would suggest that the market is ready. And I just look at ROSA, I look at robotics in general, it wasn't that long ago that there was an assumption that orthopedics would not pay a premium to bring robotics in the play. I think we are finding that's changing very rapidly. I really do believe robotics would become a standard of care at some point. I think it's the same thing. This is the next leg of the stool. I really do believe that data collection and the informatics capability as a result of that will be something that people will desire and pay for. We have to prove it. We have to collect the data, create the data lake, create insights as a result of that, and give guidance to surgeons from that data. Once that occurs and we can then predict things ahead of time and change care as a result of that, there's value in that, there's no question. Remember, there's still a large percentage of patients, somewhere in the neighborhood of 20%, to get a knee procedure that are not happy for whatever reason. And when you talk to surgeons, even really good surgeons, they don't always know why. They'll say, \"Hey, I had the best surgery day, the X-ray looked fantastic. That patient is not happy, I do not know why,\" we don't either, but I'm pretty confident with the data we're collecting we'll be able to predict it in the future and then change the care for that patient. And that's really good for the patient, and that's why we're doing it. Yes. And I think it's important because you said it, it's not just IQ, it is an ecosystem of a capability that allows us to collect data across all areas of the procedure, before, during, and after, in a combination of those things that will create that data lake that is just too vast for us to make any sense of, but with machine learning we can look for patterns in the data and ultimately provide insights as a result of it. Well, it'll tell you, a lot better now than it did before, that's for sure. The fact is our financial flexibility is improving, the balance sheet looks strong. And we've earned the right now to be able to truly increase our focus in this area. Don't get me wrong, all along, since we've been in Phase 3 we've been looking at the market, looking for assets that we could pursue. But now, our ability to execute this phase of our transformation is more real. And just to give you some color there, we truly will be looking at mission-centric targets, because that's the number one criteria. We're also going to be looking for places where we believe or spaces where we believe we can get a path to leadership, at least at some point. We're always going to be looking for WAMGR-accretive assets, and then those things, that as a result of that, can drive faster growth and faster EPS growth over time. To size it, we're probably looking more small-to-medium size deals. And it would be across three areas. Number one would be to diversify in our faster-growth orthopedic markets, like extremities for CMFT, and even settings like ASC, but also, secondly, to diversify our revenue outside of traditional orthopedics with an eye towards those things that are a little less selective in nature. And then inside of recon, we're actually looking to enhance our position in those faster-growth submarkets of recon so we can bring our WAMGR up there as well, things like data and robotics. So, that's where we're going to focus in. We've been at Phase 3 for a while, we've got a lot of things that we're interested in, and now we have a little more financial flexibility to move in that direction. Yes, I think what I would say it, hey, it was a strong quarter, but it's just a quarter. The fact is the momentum has been there for a long time. And I'm just really happy that finally, with some of the clouds being removed, you can actually see the performance that the team is actually delivering. I think -- I do want to make sure that we're clear, as we think about that concept of we should at least do a 4% growth rate, it's going to be choppy for a while. The fact is it's not a clean market, it's not an undisturbed market, and it's not going to be for a while. So, you could expect quarters that might be above that 4%, and you might expect to see quarters that are below that 4% just given all that noise in the market. Make no mistake, the business momentum is real. The team is executing right now flawlessly, and our product pipeline is really, really strong, so, our confidence is high. Even though it's going to be choppy for a while our confidence is very high."

[Operator Instruction] As a reminder this conference is being recorded today, May 3rd, 2022. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instruction] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Senior Vice President Investor Relations and Chief community Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, Operator. And good morning, everyone. I hope you are all well and safe. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; EVP and CFO Suky Upadhyay and COO Ivan Tornos. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q1 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: Alright, thanks, Keri and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I'm going to talk briefly about our Q1 performance and our revised expectations for the full year. I'm also going to spend a few minutes talking about our recent innovation and our key drivers for long-term growth. And then after that, I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who will get into more details on the quarter, but also very importantly, our full-year guidance update. And then we'll close out the call with your questions, of course. So, let's get started with Q1. We had a strong quarter, well above our own expectations and obviously above external expectations. And the primary reason for that level of over achievement was stronger than anticipated COVID recovery in the quarter, particularly when we looked at the back half of the quarter. And if I look at the U.S. recovery, it was stronger and faster than I think anyone expected pretty much across the board. And while we continue to see COVID surges in EMEA and China, the impact on overall procedure cancellations has been minimal at least so far.  And inside of that we saw very strong performance in large joints, and in particular our Knee franchise, while our set recovery lagged our core recon business at this point. We know it's still early in the year but based on what we saw in the quarter, and really current trends in the Q2, our confidence in 2022 growth has definitely increased. And as a result, we're raising and tightening our full-year guidance. Now there are clearly a number of headwinds that we're facing. Supply challenges, inflation, Russia, Ukraine. But given our revenue dependent on elective procedures, COVID recovery outweighs those headwinds. And that's why even in the face of these challenges, we're able to raise our outlook for the year. Okay. So, turning the page a bit, outside of external influences on our business, our strategy is working and our underlying business is very strong. Our new product pipeline continues to deliver. We're adding. more innovation and value to our ZBEdge ecosystem. If you were an AAOS, you saw our recently launched WalkAI. This is ZB's first AI based solution. We also showed recently launched functionality for Mymobility platform, this is under the umbrella of our exclusive partnership with Apple. Our ROSA Robotics momentum continues to be very strong. And the early feedback on Persona IQ, even though it's in limited launch, is very positive. All of these things combined are highlighting the possibilities around data collection and integration on the patient experience. We also continue to drive significant demand and traction with Persona Revision in our Knee franchise. With Avenir Complete in our Hip franchise, and our signature ONE planner in shoulder.  And our new product pipeline remains very strong with additional product launches planned for 2022, especially across our Knee and [Indiscernible] portfolios. We're also continuing to reshape our business and accelerate ZB's transformation. That means of course, streamlining and modernizing our Operating model, but also focusing on making ZB a best preferred place to work and a trusted partner. Just in Q1, we scored 100% on the human rights campaign\u2019s corporate equality index. We made Forbes best large employers list, and were named one of the most innovative companies by FastCompany for our ROSA Robotics platform. We have also prioritized our environmental, social, and governance, or ESG commitments and our actions in this area continued to expand.  We have committed to key environmental standards, delivered on social giving pledges and set DENI standards and long-term goals in this area. And we've enhanced our overall reporting of ESG progress internal to our own team members, but also to investors. And finally, our transformation also includes, as you know, active portfolio management and as a part of this, we completed our spin of ZimVie on March 1st. That was ahead of schedule and certainly as a part of our active portfolio management strategy.  So, in summary, even though there are real macro headwinds that we will have to manage, and I have confidence in our team to do so, the recovery, the shift in recover really in COVID is the bright spot we've been waiting for. And we're excited about and it's certainly changed our view of 2022. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky for a deeper dive into Q1 and our revised expectations for the full year. Okay, Suky.\nSuky Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. We had a good quarter driven by faster-than-expected recovery of elective procedures, giving us the confidence to raise our full-year revenue and earnings per share outlook. Let's turn to our Q1 results and how that translates into our updated full-year financial guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the first quarter 2022 and how it compares to the same period in '21, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted continuing operations basis. Please note we have changed our geographic revenue reporting to U.S. and international, and we released a Form 8-K last week to provide unaudited recasted financial information related to our ZimVie spin off, as well as a change in non-GAAP reporting of in-process R&D-related expenses.  Moving to first-quarter performance, net sales in the first quarter were $1.663 billion up 3.9% on a reported and 6.8% on a constant currency basis. As previously guided, selling days contributed about a 130 basis points of tailwind in the quarter. Revenue was driven by continued execution along with stronger and faster than expected COVID recovery across most markets, with the largest uplift in the U.S. After significantly pressured January, recovery ramp through the quarter with improvement in February and a strong rebound in March. On a consolidated basis, March grew versus pre -pandemic levels and that recovery has continued into April. U.S. sales grew 5.8% driven by strong recovery as COVID cases subsided and elective procedures returned. By the end of the quarter, U.S. cancellation rates have returned to pre -pandemic levels and procedure volumes were above 2019.  International sales grew 8.1% driven by strong growth across Europe and we saw continued recovery despite COVID surges in certain European markets in China. Turning to our business category performance in the first quarter. As a reminder, China VBP is expected to be about neutral to overall revenue growth for the full year. And so far, the 2022 impact is broadly in line with our original expectations. While we don't expect the material impact from VBP on full-year 2022 growth, we do expect there to be fluctuation by quarter. In the first quarter, we saw about a 200 to 300 basis points of pressure across our global Knee, Hip and S.E.T. segments, which we expect to be broadly offset through the next three quarters with the majority coming in the fourth quarter. Global knees grew 11% with U.S. knees up 11.7% and international knees up 10.1% driven by solid commercial execution, continued traction for Persona Revision, robotics pull-through, and strong knee procedure recovery across most markets.\n.: This decrease was driven primarily by an unrealized investment loss due to a decline in the value of our investment in ZimVie, and higher litigation-related and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of a $61 represents an increase from $55 in the first quarter of 2021. The increase was largely driven by higher sales and lower interest expense. Adjusted gross margin was 70.6%, lower than the prior year as expected due to VBP and higher input and manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by higher volumes and better mix. Our adjusted operating expenses were about $735 million, up from the prior year driven by higher investments in R&D. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 26.4%, down versus the prior year but ahead of expectations and driven by higher revenue.  The adjusted tax rate was 16.1% in the quarter in line with our expectations. And now turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows from continuing operations were $360 million and free cash flow totaled $223 million for the quarter. We reduced our debt by about $650 million, excluding the effects of foreign currency and ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of about $435 million. Our improving financial performance in tandem with our ongoing debt reduction continue to strengthen our balance sheet. Moving to our updated financial outlook for 2022 while we continue to manage through macro headwinds related to foreign currency, Russia, inflation, and supply chain challenges, a faster and stronger COVID recovery, in tandem with a positive first quarter give us the confidence to raise and tighten our financial guidance. Against this backdrop, our current expectations for the full year are as follows. On a constant currency basis, we now expect to grow 2% to 4% versus 2021, with an expected foreign currency headwind of approximately 350 basis points. This translates into a reported revenue growth projection in the range of negative 1.5% to positive 0.5% versus 2021. Note that the selling day tailwind that we saw in the first quarter will be fully reversed in the fourth quarter with no material full-year selling day impact. Adjusted operating profit margins continue to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%, this assumes inflationary pressure of about a 150 basis points versus our original estimate of about 50 basis points. Of the incremental a 100 basis points of pressure a half will hit 2022, but be offset by expected higher revenue, and roughly half will be capitalized and impact 2023. Adjusted tax rate expectations remain in the range of 16% to 16.5%, adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to be higher at $6.65 to $6.85. And we are increasing free cash flow to $750 million to $850 million. Inside of that guidance, we have a tougher comp in the second quarter due to COVID recovery we experienced in 2021. But we do expect revenue to grow in the low single-digits over the second quarter of '21 and to exceed pre -pandemic levels for the full quarter. In summary, we expect that the environment will remain dynamic, but we believe the pace of recovery, our continued execution, and the strength of ZB's underlying business fundamentals, position us well to improve our financial outlook. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, just a reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Very nice quarter. I'd be interested in your view of what's happening at the hospital level. We've been hearing all season about staffing headwinds, about CapEx spending headwinds. And I'd be curious to get your opinion on that. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Yes, Thanks. Maybe I'll just start off and then I've got Ivan sitting next to me. We are actually here traveling in Europe, because we take the opportunity to get out and start Q2 strong. What I would tell you is that yes, we are definitely still seeing pressure from the staffing standpoint and we actually, even today would expect that to continue throughout the year. What I think about the quarter itself, whether it be COVID or staffing of a combination of the two, it was pretty tough in January. Got better obviously in February and that was really, really good. And in March -- actually March was a month that we had at growth over 2019, so true growth over pre -pandemic levels, and we've seen that continuing to April. So, all positive from that perspective, but we do expect that staffing pressure will continue to be a challenge throughout the year. Just not as intense, I think is what we thought when we started the year. But, Ivan you're out there more than I am in the U.S. maybe you could also.\nIvan Tornos: Absolutely. Thank you, Bryan. So, I concur, it remains a headwind. What I will tell you is that in the U.S. we have seen our cancellation rates. So, the cases -- will also be the cases that get canceled every week, to starting to look pretty much similar to those cancellation rates in 2019. In the past, most calculations were ACE related, so fear and anxiety. In the early IQ, the staffing challenges, then 2021 it was mainly staff -- agreement, staffing agreement. And that [Indiscernible] seen that it's starting to look [Indiscernible] less of probably in Europe than other markets in the U.S., but it remains a challenge in the U.S.\nJoanne Wuensch: Sorry, capital?\nKeri Mattox: Joanne, was your follow-up about capital and the capital markets, net pressure?\nJoanne Wuensch: Yes -- No, cap -- Yes. Capital purchasing. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: So, I'm having a hard time hearing her for some reason. I don't know if maybe Keri, you could repeat the question. I couldn't hear it.\nKeri Mattox: Sure Bryan, Ivan. Joanne was asking about capital purchasing and what we're seeing on those trends.\nBryan Hanson: Yeah, I can see that question as well. So primarily we sell capital in two businesses, for surgical business and obviously robotics, Knee and Hip [Indiscernible]. We are not seeing anything that tells us that there's a shortage of capital. What the strategy for the quarter is being more around placements than selling robots. But under surgical side, we're not seeing a challenge, we're not seeing that we've seen less fluidity than in Q4. So, I'm actually pretty optimistic in terms of where we are when it comes to a capital allocation from a hospital standpoint. But again, as I mentioned, we are doing more placement than sales in the quarter. We did more placements than sales in the quarter. Thanks for the question.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Joanne. Lauren, can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a good quarter. I appreciate the colors on the margin pressures but just want to make sure it's clear how we're thinking about how these pressures flowed through to 2023. Sounds like 50 basis points of incremental pressure at this point. But also, curious if you have any offsets like pricing I -- it was kind of noticeable that you didn't put pricing in the press release this quarter for the first time. So curious how you're thinking about that.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Sure. Hey, Travis, this is Suky. Thanks for the question. I'll start and then maybe turn it over to Ivan on the pricing question that you had. So, you heard correctly, we think that inflationary pressures are going to be roughly a 150 basis points of a headwind on margins this year. Our original estimate back on the Q4 call was 50 basis points. So, we think we're somewhere in the additional a 100 basis points range from where we originally were. And we were seeing that pressure grow post our call, but it really started to accelerate with the war in Ukraine. And I don't think that's inconsistent with what you're hearing really across this sector and probably in other industries as well.  Now, the way this works is part of that pressure, about half of that will hit this year, but given the way we account for costs and variances, and given the higher level of inventory that we carry, about half of that additional pressure will be capitalized and deferred into 2023. So about 50 basis points of that incremental 100 will find its way into next year. I would say that the key challenges that we're seeing, again are very consistent across the sector from a supply chain standpoint. First, freight is higher; commodity costs are higher, energy costs and labor costs. But the biggest culprit within that is our commodity costs. The good thing is, we're starting to see some stabilization around that. We do still see some higher costs related to stainless steel, packaging materials like plastics and resins and of course titanium, which we're doing a lot of spot buys to secure our safety socks and supply chain. But what we're hearing from our supply chain organization is that starting to stabilize.  Now, the environment is still very dynamic, so we'll keep you posted as the year progresses. But the good thing is that the largest headwind that we've got feels like it's beginning to stabilize a bit. Inside of that from a pricing standpoint, we did see a slightly better quarter, this quarter on from a pricing perspective year-over-year. Some of that is due to some specific strategies and tactics that the team is putting in place to better control pricing erosion year-over-year. And some of that I think is just a little bit still opportunistic because with the continued COVID headwinds that we saw in the beginning part of the quarter, that results in lower volumes, that then results in lower rebate thresholds for some of our customers. That sort of helps a tailwind on our pricing probably temporarily while our volumes are more muted. But maybe Ivan, you want to talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the pricing environment and our ability to offset price or past price pressure onto the end markets.\nIvan Tornos: Absolutely Suky. Hey Travis, Ivan here. So as Suky do it too, and in our normal -- the normal price erosion is around 2 to 300 basis points. We did achieve better at price erosion in the quarter, some components of that are sustainable, others they remain to be seen. But I will tell you that we got over next today in the U.S. and frankly in Europe and APAC that we didn't have in the past, as we see our vitality Index or percentage of sales coming from new products, we see that as a tailwind. And again, we'll see how that develops in quarters to come. And from an incentive standpoint, for the first time we will have very clear incentives in all commercial annexation to maintain or gain price. So, we're not making a commitment to do any better than the 2 to 300 basis points, given that a large percentage of the business is contracted. But certainly, we have the plans and the government that we didn't have before. So, fingers crossed on that one.\nTravis Steed: I appreciate all that color. And Suky one follow-up on China. Just want to make sure we're modeling that correctly. It sounds like it was 200 to 300 basis points headwinds to total company organic growth this quarter, but that comes back in Q4. And if you just look at China volume with the shutdowns, I'd love to hear how that's playing out in Q2 and the recovery there from a volume perspective.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yeah. So, the China volumes have clearly been negatively impacted because of some of the COVID surges that you've been hearing about. It's most acute in Shanghai, we did see earlier in the quarter some additional lock downs in other cities. The good thing is, right now we're not seeing any lock downs beyond Shanghai, now there is limited movement in other provinces, but there are no shutdowns and we're still seeing cases being performed there. Shanghai still remains the most acute situation in China. I'll just back up a little bit. Remember, China is in the low single digits of revenue of the entire company, and Shanghai inside of China is just a relatively modest fraction. So, while we're still seeing pressures specifically in that province, I think it's manageable and somewhat moderated. Again, broadly beyond China -- beyond Shanghai, we're seeing stabilization to improvement. We just have to keep a very close eye on China, [Indiscernible] on Shanghai. But the way you're thinking about the impact of VBP is correct.\nTravis Steed: Okay, thanks for the [Indiscernible].\nBryan Hanson: Yeah, I might just add this down -- I might just add some commentary there. It's actually because even though there's a lot that's happening, that's different than expected in China, the overall impact into the quarter was about what we expected. And even into now coming into Q2. So, for different reasons -- but the fact is, even though we're seeing lock downs in Shanghai and disruption as a result, we're also seeing delays in VBP implementation. And those are almost balancing each other. So, while certainly China was still a headwind for the quarter, from a top and bottom-line standpoint, it was pretty much in line with what we expected even though for just different reasons.\nTravis Steed: Great. Thanks, Brian and Suky.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks. Travis. Lauren, can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Hazan with Goldman Sachs.\nAmit Hazan: Oh thanks. Hey, good morning. Maybe start with market share and I wanted to ask you the question. I know it's hard to tell the trends given the last couple of years. But as we look at three-year CAGR is and just try to make sense of it's going on in the U.S. It's actually not very clear that you are consistently gaining share. And I'm trying to think about this in the context of the 600 or so ROSA at least that you have in the field. I'm sure that's a little bit higher now. And just trying to understand if there are offsets there or how you're thinking about market share in the U.S., for knees in particular, but knees and hips, because the data doesn't strongly suggest that you're gaining share.\nIvan Tornos: So, I'll take that and then I'll pass it over to you, Bryan. I'm going to talk about some specifics. But it probably all depends on how you're running your data, because I would probably argue the different outcome. The fact is it's choppy. It's really choppy. And we're looking at this thing in every different way you can; sequential growth versus the previous quarter, we're looking at it versus prior year, versus 2019 because that was your last good year. We're looking at it on a stack basis. You name it, we're running the analysis to get a sense for what we're doing. What I've said always is that I don't really trust any given quarter, but I do look at trends, and almost any which way I slice it, I do see us moving in the right direction and of course I also see things that you can't see in our own business.  The combination of the trends that I'm seeing, looking at it a lot of different ways and also just the things that I see in my own business, I feel very confident that we're moving in the right direction and we're doing the things that we need to do to be able to drive attractive growth. A big one that I look at is vitality index. We had a more slow vitality in the business, we've doubled that in the last few years and that continues to move north. We've got a very strong pipeline of products. So, to me, when I think about that performance, it's clear. I mean, the transformation is real. And the good news for us is that as COVID and staffing issues start to clear and continue to clear, that the reported performance that we have as a business as finally going to start reflecting what we actually know is happening in the business.\nBryan Hanson: But what gives us a lot of confidence again, is the innovations. So maybe Ivan, you want to talk about some of the innovation that gets you excited.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, absolutely. I mean, I look forward to the day where we have objective market share data on because I also differ from that statement on markets there. But that said, I'm beyond excited about what we got in the store. So, some of the products that we keep talking about, Russ, you mentioned 600 [Indiscernible] at place, I believe the number is higher now. We're getting a strong penetration in key accounts, both in the hospital setting and in the outpatient setting. We have indications, plenty of indications to come. Our revision has only been launched here in the U.S. but continuous to grow at unprecedented rates. It's pulling our primary needs as well along the way, ZBEdge, I would spend an hour talking about all the things that you probably saw in [Indiscernible] in Chicago. Whether it is WalkAI, Mymobility on [Indiscernible] configurations. By the way, we have the largest number of enrollments these last quarter, Cementless knees penetration is also in the teens, and that's before we launch a new form factor device at the end of this year, which is going to give us break in the category. So that's just the [Indiscernible], and Amani, we launched six products in the last two years.  As you look into Hips, we are performing strongly with Avenir Complete, direct Anterior, our revision platform. We don't talk enough about that. Somebody is also performing very well. In said CMSD sports made on trauma are doing well, we got some noise with that trauma early in the year, but we got new launches and new product launches to come. And just a ton of stuff coming from -- and data on technology standpoint. So, I don't know, you were looking at the same data, when it looks the market share. But what I do know is that as you look at the innovation story with the [Indiscernible] index being 2x what it used to be, and the pipeline being dramatically higher than it used to be three years ago. I'm pretty confident that we're going to remain above market for the [Indiscernible].\nAmit Hazan: Thanks for that color. We'd love to know specifically if you do have the data on the U.S. knees and hips, what your data set, I'm sure it's better than ours. But the second follow-up would be for you, Bryan. Just on capital allocation. Just how you're thinking about M&A post the spin now and this in particular environment. If you want us to be thinking about natural limits to kind of the size of the deal you'd be looking at and how you're thinking about adjacencies versus whiteboard opportunities. Just any color would be super helpful. Thanks so much.\nBryan Hanson: Yeah. So maybe I'll start kind of topline and then I'll hand it to Suky to talk about capital allocation and our current focus there. But yes, for sure, M&A and active portfolio management is a big part of what we define as Phase 3 of the transformation. Just as a quick reminder, we started this old journey in Phase 1, which I'm just going to define as kind of the hearts and minds. In other words, kind of mission and culture focus. Significant upgrading in talent at the leadership team level to make sure we have the right people to transform the business and then stabilizing just a number of significant issues around quality compliance, turnover supply, you name it. Phase 2 was more around a true long-term strategy, making sure that we're shifting to innovation versus remediation.  And really changing the kind of innovation we were focused on and then augmenting our structure and operating mechanisms to ensure that we truly do drive execution and accountability to the strategy. And the Phase 3 is where we are in kind of to your question. We are looking to transform the portfolio of the company. Now, COVID has hampered our ability to do that because it's put pressure on the business. We haven't had as much firepower. But the fact is, we have made decisions here that are moving the needle. Number one, we've got the spin of the dental and spine businesses, which we think is the right thing for both businesses.  And although there have been smaller because we don't have the firepower, we've done acquisitions to be able to build, scale and attract as basis. But for sure we will continue to focus on active portfolio management, acquiring companies that can drive weighted average market growth for us in our mission centric. I'm not going to get into specifics on where we would focus because as you probably know, it's pretty competitive out there right now for assets. But this is something that we absolutely will focus on in Phase 3. The good news is as we continue to see stabilization in the market, we're going to be able to continue to buy down debt, which is important to us and eventually increase the firepower to do this. Suky, maybe I'll just turn it over to you to talk about current capital allocation.\nSuky Upadhyay: Sure. Thank you, Bryan. And thanks Amit for the question. Our focus has been very consistent in ensuring that we continue to pay down debt and maintaining our investment-grade. And just a little back point here. Since 2019, we've paid down almost $3 billion of debt and that's in the backdrop of a pandemic that's has significant pressure on our financial performance. It speaks to the strength and durability of our cash flows as a company. But when you combine that priority as capital allocation together with improving financial performance relative to growth and EBITDA, it really does start to set us up pretty nicely for more strategic optionality as Bryan talked about with active portfolio management.  I think in a bigger way, it enables us to look at opportunities to accelerate the top and bottom-line growth for the company while diversifying it as well. And I think all of those things are very credit positive. And so, while we will probably take more of a front foot in that active portfolio management category as Bryan talked about, especially now, coming off the spin. And quite frankly, the organization has gotten out more bandwidth having undertaken in and gotten that very heavy lift behind us. We will undertake that active portfolio management with an eye towards to maintaining our investment-grade ratings. So feels good to start to turn the corner on that and to know that all of our hard work and de -levering the balance sheet, improving financial performances is actually starting to pull through.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks for the questions [Indiscernible], can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeffrey Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Maybe going back to Travis's question, Suky, on -- just on gross margins, I think you're clear on the 50 basis points that's being capitalized and will come out next year. I think the way Travis phrased it and then kind of I was hoping that -- here and answer to was are their offsets to that or should we just assume that that 50 basis points that comes out next year is kind of how we should think conceptually about gross margin being down 50 basis points next year then. Thanks.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. The team is actively looking and always looks at offset to any headwinds, whether it's current year, future years, etc., so I think it's too early to tell exactly what next year's gross margin will look like. But all things being equal, we've got that added headwind. The team is looking at, both from a supply chain standpoint, more faster structural changes across our plant footprint. We're looking at potential procurement and category savings through procurement to potentially offset those headwinds. And I think you've heard about Ivan talking about price, we're making some nice, I think durable headway into improving our price discipline and our price performance. So, we're going to continue to actively look for some offsets to that headwind. But right now, it's just too early to tell -- to say exactly what that 50 basis points ultimately translates to in 2023.\nJeffrey Johnson: Yeah understood. And then I think you guys are pretty clear on kind of the R&D spending things like that. But where are we on a recovery in spend on things like conference attendance, doc training, corporate travel, things like that. Are we at a level now that is back to normalized and just grow off that or is there a recapture that still has to happen there?\nSuky Upadhyay: I would say we've definitely increased since 2021 and obviously since the depths of the pandemic, I think there's likely a little bit more room to go to bring back spending as we continue to see topline performance improved throughout the year. So, and especially in the backdrop of the new products launches that we've got coming out. We want to make sure that we're investing appropriately from a commercial perspective, to make sure that those launches are successful. I don't know Ivan, if you want to say anything else there, but I guess the key thing we'd expect to see a modest increase that will be involve.\nIvan Tornos: Just maybe quickly hearing that Jeff, I will tell you that the fact that they [Indiscernible] what it was three years ago tells you that we haven't a slowdown from an R&D perspective. Within R&D you got two components. which is sustaining engineering and then new product introductions. And the number of new product introductions in '21 and '22 is dramatically different than in past years as we get into '23 and '24, it's even higher. So definitely no cuts when it comes to true innovation. And then relative to [Indiscernible], that's another area that we're trying not to cut. Might have done some adjustments throughout the pandemic, but I will tell you we are full force globally when it comes to [Indiscernible]. So, R&D [Indiscernible] remain sacred cows here from an investment standpoint. Thanks, Jeff.\nJeffrey Johnson: Yeah. Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Jeff. Lauren, can we move into the next question in the queue, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shagun Singh with RBC.\nShagun Singh: Thank you so much for taking the question. So Q1 ex-FX revenue results in 2022 guidance implies lower quarterly growth for the balance of the year. So, what's assumed in your guidance beyond Q1? How should we think about the cadence of that? Perhaps you can touch on both revenue and EPS. Any color on Q2 will be helpful. And then just as a follow-up on portfolio management, how are you thinking about your diversification strategy that you've previously alluded to? It seems like a lot of these procedures, at least on the [Indiscernible] are coming in from the ASC. So, any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: So, Suky, why don't you start with the cadence of growth, as much color as you want to provide there obviously, we're not providing quarterly guidance, but you can get more color there. And then I'll talk about the diversification.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yeah so, you're right, the forward-looking based on our increase in our guidance range on ex-FX, the midpoint now being at 3% versus the former at flat year-over-year. But given our first quarter would suggest lower ex-FX growth rates for the remainder of the year. And that's primarily due to, as we previously discussed, much tougher comps as we move through the rest of the year. The first quarter of this year, we were of course, comparing against the first quarter of 2021, which had a very, very deep COVID, impact. And so, it wasn't unexpected that you'd see a much better Q1 than the rest of the year. So, it's really comp related on the rest of the year as to why that growth rate is lower than the first quarter.  As we think about cadence of revenue growth, as we move forward, we would expect -- we already talked about second quarter being in the low single-digits on an ex-FX basis. And the fourth quarter based on normal seasonality, we would expect the second quarter to be stronger than the third quarter. And then of course, the fourth quarter to be the strongest quarter of the remainder of the year, very consistent with our former seasonality that you saw last year and prior to the pandemic in 2019. And we would also expect earnings to follow that same suit. And as revenue gets stronger, so will the operating margins. So, earnings are expected to follow in that same cadence as revenue.\nBryan Hanson: Great. And on the concept of diversification, when we think about active portfolio management, it's definitely still there. Clearly, we want to make sure that we're diversifying our business and we think about it really in three ways. It's not just product segment diversification. Clearly that's an area of concentration for us because there are faster growth categories that we play in that we want to build scale in. But also, geographic expansion, just to make sure that we're taking advantage of fast-growth areas in the world. And then ASC, you referenced ASC as an attractive setting, we've actually already acquired areas to build our scale in that setting and we built commercial infrastructure to pursue ASC as well. So, we look at it for sure in diversification to drive weighted average market growth, but we don't just look at it to be a product, not just by geography, not just by setting, but all three of those.\nShagun Singh: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Shagun. Lauren, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley.\nDrew Ranieri: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just on your set business for a moment. I appreciate that it lagged in the first quarter, but just trying to get a better sense of how that progresses through the rest of the year. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there's some new products coming later this year, but maybe go into a little bit more detail there, just how are you thinking about your set market or set to growth from a business perspective. Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: Maybe just quick topline and then Ivan, maybe you could speak to some of the things you're seeing inside of set. First and foremost, it is an area that we're very interested in. Not all the sub-segments of S.E.T. are created equal for us or certain categories that we're investing more heavily in because they're more attractive, we think we've got a better chance to win. Quite frankly, we really do believe that we've got scale that we can continue to move forward. So not all equal, but certainly an area of overall concentration for us. I would say that you're going to continue to see some pressure in the next couple of quarters. A lot of that comes from the fact that we still have pressure in VBP and in trauma.  And then I think as you get to the end of the year, particularly some of those new products being launched, you might have an opportunity to see some of that move in the right direction. But just make no mistake, S.E.T. is an important area for us. We've put commercial infrastructure in place, we've acquired technologies in this space, we continue to innovate in the space and we will continue to focus in S.E.T. I don't know if you had anything else you want to --\nIvan Tornos: Just maybe just back up a little. We've seen [Indiscernible], so in the category, as I mentioned earlier, sports are going very well. The acquisition and integration are relying continues to go very nicely here in the US and in Europe. We've seen an increasing penetration on Signature ONE. We are now integrated in shoulder. We Mymobility, which is the integration of ZBEdge components into the shoulder platform. Comprehensive and shoulder is growing, in the strong team globally. So as sports and upper extremities have done very well, CMFT and integration of [Indiscernible] is also going very well. Continue to gain share on hip trauma, [Indiscernible] closer where we have some headwinds. It was referenced by Suky in the prepared remarks. [Indiscernible] trauma primarily because the headwinds in APAC, but also in the U.S. some time it was some contracts. But overall, the category with the exclusion of trauma right now, it seems going really, really well. And as I mentioned, a different forum, we got more product launches in the segment in 2022 at the end of 2022 and in 2023, that we have had since 2015, 2016. So, the innovation to start is that as well. So, things are on track.\nDrew Ranieri: Got it, thank you. That just on robotics, I think I heard you mentioned that there was a struggle. It was a struggle quarter on placements than capital. Can you just talk about whether you expect that trend to continue through 2022? What drives is just the hospital spending environment or are you doing new sales strategy with how to place robotics? Thank you.\nIvan Tornos: Absolutely, thanks. So, it's very fluid. It's very customer-centered. We give the option of the placement, we obviously give the option of selling the ROSA, then sometimes we do a hybrid. In 2021 with did more sales than we anticipated given some of the macro-dynamics as we entered 2022, we see on a particular placement that that delivers better financial returns, we want more of that. That said we still are selling robots. And as I said earlier, we're not seeing any clear headwind today. That capital is not at a low for the robots, both in the hospital setting and in the ASC.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Drew. Lauren, can we go to the next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: Morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Bryan, your comment on recovery, that was interesting. As we look at the market as far as deferred procedures go, we come up with the kind of $1 billion to $2 billion of deferred orthopedic revenue globally over the last couple of years. So, if we get to maybe a third of that here in 2022, I know you can't get to all of it because of staffing headwinds. But given your market share position, get this be kind of a 100 to 200 basis points of tailwind to the topline, is that what you're trying to communicate this -- today as far as what kind of impacted the business we should expect this year from the backlog?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. So, to be clear, the backlog, we still believe there's got to be a backlog. I mean, just the fact there's just been no fundamental shift in the disease state itself and there has to be a backlog just given what's happened over the past couple of years. But what we're not trying to state right now, given our guidance, is that we expect a big part of that backlog or really any of that backlog to influence our numbers. So, we're just saying that we believe as we get to the back half of the year, we're going to get to a normal environment, not making assumptions about capitalizing or benefiting from no backlog. We do believe at some point it has to come through, but we believe at this point it's not going to be some kind of a massive impact that comes quickly, just -- you're just going to have capacity issues associated with that. We do believe it should be a tailwind, but we think is going to happen over years, not months or quarters, would be our view on it. But just to be very clear, we're not expecting that as a part of our guidance right now in backlog recovery.\nMatthew O'Brien: Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe, Suky, because I know you monitor this pretty closely on the ROSA side of things, you've been placing a lot of systems over the last couple of years. Maybe talk a little bit about that pull-through revenue that you're going to get on the implant side and where we are in that cycle, is it going to be a meaningful contributor to the Knee business here in '22 or is it more kind of spread out over the next couple of years? Thanks.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Sure. Probably -- I mean, Suky probably better, maybe even have Ivan talk about that because I mean, that realization of pull-through is now. I mean, it's happening. So maybe Ivan, you want to speak to that.\nIvan Tornos: Maybe I won't give too many details because you never know who's listening. But the facts are that penetration of Cementless associated with ROSA, is sort of the end of teams. The pull-through and a lot is going pointed of the Knee performance in Q1 is ROSA related. The 600 plus robots that we place roughly 50%, not 60% of those in the U.S. half of those are in competitive accounts, how we've seen meaningful revenue going from those areas. And all of that is in the early innings. As we get into the additional launches on Hip, as we getting through all their modalities of ROSA Knee. We've got $7 billion innovation pipeline. We got to continue to see a nice pull-through there. Cementless is one of the elements of our pull-through, as is regular knees. And then we have a disposable and another component, CVX many, many accounts and gets contracted as part of the ROSA placement or sale and that's another social revenue. So again, we don't disclose the revenue which were robots. But I will tell you that is above expectations so far.\nMatthew O'Brien: Thank you.\nBryan Hanson: And Suky, sorry to step on here. But I figure that was more of a commercial discussion versus a financial one.\nSuky Upadhyay: Is that what you were going to ask?\nIvan Tornos: [Indiscernible] or you want to change the answer here?\nKeri Mattox: Lauren, I think we are ready for the next question in the queue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. A couple for me. When you think about '23 in the streets, I think modeling about 8, 3% growth or so. And there's a lot of puts and takes this quarter. We've now shed spine and dental. Bryan, when you think about the business segments, I mean, and the growth rates and the, was kind of asked this from a pacing perspective, but I'd love your perspective from a business segment perspective, what's accretive to growth? What's dilutive to growth now? When you look out on the business? I think we know the answer to this, it'd be helpful I think to walk through where you think the growth rates could be for knees and hips versus sat, etc? Then my second question I'll just ask it now. Suky, you may have spoken this before, but just help us understand any dis-synergy assumptions post-spin on ZimVie?\nBryan Hanson: So, I'll start and then obviously you can transition to Suky. We're feeling really good actually. The funny thing is when you think about Knee, most people think about it and rightly so a pretty slow growth market. But in reality, there's more innovation entering the Knee space than we've ever seen before. We've got our, us, our competitors, all focused on data, robotics, and other forms of technology and share wallet opportunities that we just haven't seen in the past. So even though one might view that as a relatively slow growth market, I actually see it as a real potential to see some acceleration in that market growth. I feel very confident that we can grow well because of all the shots on goal that we have. I also think all boats will float here. I mean, it's really great because you've got a lot of technology entering the space. What we've seen is that it's being digested. When I think about that, what are the implications?  You've got the same number of procedures being done, but you're getting more share of wallet for every procedure that drives up the entire space. Usually when you bring innovation as Ivan was alluded to earlier, when you have vitality in a space that also drives better pricing stability. Because you signed longer-term contracts when somebody converts, for instance, to ROSA, they usually come right back, you try to knock it down from a pricing perspective. So, vitality really does drive stability and pricing as well. So, I think even in a space like that, that you might not believe would be attractive for overall revenue growth, I do believe it is sustainably an attractive area for us to invest in growth. And it's very profitable for us as well. Set is pretty obvious. The categories are set that we're concentrating on are attractive market growth that everybody knows. We believe we have an ability to win and we'll continue to scale in those areas. So pretty much across the board when I look at large joints score set, I see them as attractive markets given the technology and innovation that we're bringing to bear.\nBryan Hanson: Suky?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. And hey, Ryan. On your question related to the spin and I believe it was on this synergy. So, if you look at the re - casted financials that we put out last week, you would see that overall, we see operating margin accretion of about a 190 basis points from the transaction, which is a little bit better than our original expectations, that's a good thing, of further validation of why we entered into that transaction. Inside of that, that would then imply and suggest about $40 million to $50 million of stranded costs remaining with Zimmer Biomet. I would say that we're already making progress against those stranded costs this year. We believe that there's more opportunity going into next year and we kind of just see that as part of our overall operating base as a potential source of opportunity for future efficiency. Hopefully that gets to your question on where we see and how we size the synergies. but make no mistake about it, we're going after those as aggressively as we can while ensuring we don't disrupt the business and the recovery that we're starting to see.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Ryan. Lauren, we have another question in the queue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Matson with Needham and Company.\nMike Matson: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask one on Persona IQ. I know you made some brief comments on it, but maybe you can give us more detailed update on the launch. And then is this something that could be material to your Knee growth this year or next year in terms of adding 100-plus basis points in Knee growth?\nBryan Hanson: Yes. So, we're lucky to have Ivan on the call today because obviously, I'm close to this. He is extremely close to Persona IQ, not just what we have in Knee, but also the future view of where we can take IQ and smart implants. But I would say we're in limited launch, as we've said, we're going to do this right. We're going to take our time, we're going to make sure that we learn what we need to learn just so that when we do full launch, we launch well. But the early stage of this is very attractive. What's interesting about it, he's going to get into IQ itself, what's interesting about it is it's also driving traction for the organization just because it's innovative. Even people that are not ready for IQ yet, they're just saying, ''Hey, I'm not quite ready for it yet.'' They're looking at us as -- differently.  They're looking at Zimmer Biomet as an innovative player in the space, and most people want to be linked to an innovative player, someone who's going to change the space. And so even those customers that didn't want to come to us for IQ, we're getting interest for them just to move to regular Persona. So, it's almost got a halo effect because it's so unique in the marketplace. But yeah.\nIvan Tornos: Absolutely yeah, Mike. So, first thing is first, we're on track with our limited market release. I'm not a friend of the wind limit their market releases; I'd like to do full force launches. But on this one, given the complexity and given the disruption in the market, we wanted to go slowly and collect data. The -- I won't talk about the number of hospitals that have been on-boarded but it is significant. The base in pipeline is also significant on both expectations. We collect the data across the board on mobility, range of motion. We've had literally thousands of base plan data track. The platform Persona IQ is now fully integrated. We found our mobility and the rest of the CDA ecosystem.  We have not seen any surprises when it goes to the qualified data that we tracking. Most excitingly, we've got a technology road map that is going to go beyond knees. Already got the sign agreements for us. I mean, this for shoulder and other categories. On the second part of your question, I'm not going to comment on what it is material or not. I will tell you this, material for patients. And then the logic shall prevail if it is material for patients. So far so good, very excited. I look forward to the next steps.\nMike Matson: Okay. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted ask one on ASC. So how do you feel your position competitively in ASC sector? And do you think your growth in ASC was faster than your growth in hospitals? I mean, it seems like it is for the overall market, I guess from what we've heard, but --\nIvan Tornos: Yes, I can take that one as well. So pleased with where we are, we [Indiscernible] ASC. Clearly, we started later than others in this environment, given our strong position in hospital settings, inpatient, outpatient and whatnot. But we put a plan together to get around 40 components, making sure we have the right portfolio, the right people, the right partnerships, and the right contracts on the products we don't have ton. We fill the gaps on basic things like [Indiscernible] on the 20 cities from [Indiscernible]. We launched that ASC friendly innovation around robotics. We have increased our Cementless penetration. So, I think that the portfolio is a second too, especially now that we added these ports made on [Indiscernible], so strong on the product angle. On the people aspect, we didn't use to have a dedicated, a structure, dedicated commercial structure, and contracting a structure on the ASC setting.  We have it now, is fully dedicated. We got a large group of people that each and every day get up, and seem volume about the ASC. On the partnership angle, we got those key relationships with [Indiscernible] in the US, we developing technology together that is applicable to the ASC. We done a ton of medical allocation, together we found this key centers. I mean, around contract in his Meta date, we got an owner of all ASC contracts. We're very disciplined around the governance in those relationships, particularly in pricing. So, I think the plan is working well. We're growing faster than expected, I'm not sure these days was growing faster or not than the others. The ASC performance in Q1 was above our expectations, and as we think about the rest of the year, I think we're in good position to continue to grow.\nMike Matson: Great. Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Lauren, I think we have time for maybe one or two final questions.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I could ask the S.E.T. business was the slowest grower this quarter, it's 25% of sales. And we don't get geographic breakout or segments there. I was hoping if you could walk us through sort of the different components and any geographic differences to point out. Just given that a lot of your competitors called out extremities and sports medicine as positives this quarter. Thanks.\nBryan Hanson: Maybe also get a chance some of this, Ivan. But the fact is we did have a pretty significant headwind. So, you look at the difference in regions that the most challenging region that we had was Asia-Pacific and a big part of that as we all know, is the trauma, VBP and the weight that that's having on the overall segment. Outside of that, when we looking inside of S.E.T., I would say the same thing. Our upper extremities business did very well. The innovation is helping us drive our performance there, but also the focus that we have. Sports did very well as Ivan talked about before, and that happening both U.S. and Europe. And when you think about our CMFT business, we continue to see traction there, not just because of the acquisitions that we've had, but also because of the now, what I would define as organic growth from those acquisitions. And again, the focus that we have, commercial in CMFT. So those are kind of the bright spots that we have, and those are across all regions. The big headwind for us is in trauma, a lot of that being in Asia-Pacific.\nIvan Tornos: I guess, if I had to add to what Bryan is saying, I'll be saying the same thing with a different action. I want to extend myself, but that it started about the dedicated channel in key geographies in Europe and the U.S. primarily and the innovation that is coming later in the year and going into 2023. Sports is going well; extremity is going well. Again, some knows [Indiscernible] trauma, but two of the three key components are performing very nicely and they love to perform even at a faster basis. Thanks, Robbie.\nRobert Marcus: And are you guys willing to give any ex-China growth rates for extremities and trauma?\nBryan Hanson: I think you could probably just read from what Suky said and -- I think it was in your prepared remarks, Suky, but 200-300 basis points of headwind is what you could look at in the quarter on the global business as a result of China.\nRobert Marcus: Great. And maybe just one quick follow-up for me. As you think about China, that is a country with the difficult pathway forward with the no COVID policy. I just want to make sure, are you assuming continued pressure from lockdowns through the rest of the year or are you assuming that it resolves in the near-term? Thanks a lot.\nIvan Tornos: Yeah. The reason for the range that we have in the guidance is to make sure that we're accommodating risk core opportunity in places like China. So, it's already calculated in the range that we have. What I would tell you is, again, within a little bit lucky there, sometimes it's okay to be lucky rather than always just good. But the fact is we've had that offset. We have had some pressure when we look at Shanghai lockdowns, but we've also had delays and BPP implementation which helps us from a pricing standpoint and they've offset each other. And so, at this point in time, even though the mix of how we're getting to the revenue and the bottom line that we assumed we would get in China it's changed, but the overall impact is about where we thought it would be. So, I guess all that to say, even if we see continued lockdowns, as long as we see continued delays in VBP, they seem to be offsetting each up.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Robbie. I think we're at 9:30, so we probably need to wrap there. Lauren, thank you so much. Bryan, don't know if there's any closing remarks from you or any other members of the team, applies there just to see if you'd like to make any comments before we wrap up on this end.\nBryan Hanson: No, I think the nice thing is we've captured a lot of what we wanted to say via the questions. The fact is it was a good quarter. It feels good to have and I think probably the most important thing, even though there's a lot of challenges that everyone is talking about right now, that we're going to have to deal with it. We're going to have to manage through and have confidence in the team can managed through those. The difference now is it's the same challenges for everybody where we've been disproportionately impacted by COVID. If I had to select, I would take the challenges that we currently have in place and their impact to the business versus continued COVID impact. That's the positive for us. That's been kind of a light at the end of the tunnel that we've been waiting for, which is COVID receding. And I truly do believe if it does receding and it continues to recede, that the actual performance that we see in the business will begin to be reflected in the performance that you see in business. With that, we'll go ahead and end the call.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Bryan. Thanks everyone for joining. Of course, if you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to the IR team at any point.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating in today's conference call.

            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. We had a good quarter driven by faster-than-expected recovery of elective procedures, giving us the confidence to raise our full-year revenue and earnings per share outlook. Let's turn to our Q1 results and how that translates into our updated full-year financial guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the first quarter 2022 and how it compares to the same period in '21, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted continuing operations basis. Please note we have changed our geographic revenue reporting to U.S. and international, and we released a Form 8-K last week to provide unaudited recasted financial information related to our ZimVie spin off, as well as a change in non-GAAP reporting of in-process R&D-related expenses.  Moving to first-quarter performance, net sales in the first quarter were $1.663 billion up 3.9% on a reported and 6.8% on a constant currency basis. As previously guided, selling days contributed about a 130 basis points of tailwind in the quarter. Revenue was driven by continued execution along with stronger and faster than expected COVID recovery across most markets, with the largest uplift in the U.S. After significantly pressured January, recovery ramp through the quarter with improvement in February and a strong rebound in March. On a consolidated basis, March grew versus pre -pandemic levels and that recovery has continued into April. U.S. sales grew 5.8% driven by strong recovery as COVID cases subsided and elective procedures returned. By the end of the quarter, U.S. cancellation rates have returned to pre -pandemic levels and procedure volumes were above 2019.  International sales grew 8.1% driven by strong growth across Europe and we saw continued recovery despite COVID surges in certain European markets in China. Turning to our business category performance in the first quarter. As a reminder, China VBP is expected to be about neutral to overall revenue growth for the full year. And so far, the 2022 impact is broadly in line with our original expectations. While we don't expect the material impact from VBP on full-year 2022 growth, we do expect there to be fluctuation by quarter. In the first quarter, we saw about a 200 to 300 basis points of pressure across our global Knee, Hip and S.E.T. segments, which we expect to be broadly offset through the next three quarters with the majority coming in the fourth quarter. Global knees grew 11% with U.S. knees up 11.7% and international knees up 10.1% driven by solid commercial execution, continued traction for Persona Revision, robotics pull-through, and strong knee procedure recovery across most markets. Yes. Sure. Hey, Travis, this is Suky. Thanks for the question. I'll start and then maybe turn it over to Ivan on the pricing question that you had. So, you heard correctly, we think that inflationary pressures are going to be roughly a 150 basis points of a headwind on margins this year. Our original estimate back on the Q4 call was 50 basis points. So, we think we're somewhere in the additional a 100 basis points range from where we originally were. And we were seeing that pressure grow post our call, but it really started to accelerate with the war in Ukraine. And I don't think that's inconsistent with what you're hearing really across this sector and probably in other industries as well.  Now, the way this works is part of that pressure, about half of that will hit this year, but given the way we account for costs and variances, and given the higher level of inventory that we carry, about half of that additional pressure will be capitalized and deferred into 2023. So about 50 basis points of that incremental 100 will find its way into next year. I would say that the key challenges that we're seeing, again are very consistent across the sector from a supply chain standpoint. First, freight is higher; commodity costs are higher, energy costs and labor costs. But the biggest culprit within that is our commodity costs. The good thing is, we're starting to see some stabilization around that. We do still see some higher costs related to stainless steel, packaging materials like plastics and resins and of course titanium, which we're doing a lot of spot buys to secure our safety socks and supply chain. But what we're hearing from our supply chain organization is that starting to stabilize.  Now, the environment is still very dynamic, so we'll keep you posted as the year progresses. But the good thing is that the largest headwind that we've got feels like it's beginning to stabilize a bit. Inside of that from a pricing standpoint, we did see a slightly better quarter, this quarter on from a pricing perspective year-over-year. Some of that is due to some specific strategies and tactics that the team is putting in place to better control pricing erosion year-over-year. And some of that I think is just a little bit still opportunistic because with the continued COVID headwinds that we saw in the beginning part of the quarter, that results in lower volumes, that then results in lower rebate thresholds for some of our customers. That sort of helps a tailwind on our pricing probably temporarily while our volumes are more muted. But maybe Ivan, you want to talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the pricing environment and our ability to offset price or past price pressure onto the end markets. Yeah. So, the China volumes have clearly been negatively impacted because of some of the COVID surges that you've been hearing about. It's most acute in Shanghai, we did see earlier in the quarter some additional lock downs in other cities. The good thing is, right now we're not seeing any lock downs beyond Shanghai, now there is limited movement in other provinces, but there are no shutdowns and we're still seeing cases being performed there. Shanghai still remains the most acute situation in China. I'll just back up a little bit. Remember, China is in the low single digits of revenue of the entire company, and Shanghai inside of China is just a relatively modest fraction. So, while we're still seeing pressures specifically in that province, I think it's manageable and somewhat moderated. Again, broadly beyond China -- beyond Shanghai, we're seeing stabilization to improvement. We just have to keep a very close eye on China, [Indiscernible] on Shanghai. But the way you're thinking about the impact of VBP is correct. Sure. Thank you, Bryan. And thanks Amit for the question. Our focus has been very consistent in ensuring that we continue to pay down debt and maintaining our investment-grade. And just a little back point here. Since 2019, we've paid down almost $3 billion of debt and that's in the backdrop of a pandemic that's has significant pressure on our financial performance. It speaks to the strength and durability of our cash flows as a company. But when you combine that priority as capital allocation together with improving financial performance relative to growth and EBITDA, it really does start to set us up pretty nicely for more strategic optionality as Bryan talked about with active portfolio management.  I think in a bigger way, it enables us to look at opportunities to accelerate the top and bottom-line growth for the company while diversifying it as well. And I think all of those things are very credit positive. And so, while we will probably take more of a front foot in that active portfolio management category as Bryan talked about, especially now, coming off the spin. And quite frankly, the organization has gotten out more bandwidth having undertaken in and gotten that very heavy lift behind us. We will undertake that active portfolio management with an eye towards to maintaining our investment-grade ratings. So feels good to start to turn the corner on that and to know that all of our hard work and de -levering the balance sheet, improving financial performances is actually starting to pull through. Yes. The team is actively looking and always looks at offset to any headwinds, whether it's current year, future years, etc., so I think it's too early to tell exactly what next year's gross margin will look like. But all things being equal, we've got that added headwind. The team is looking at, both from a supply chain standpoint, more faster structural changes across our plant footprint. We're looking at potential procurement and category savings through procurement to potentially offset those headwinds. And I think you've heard about Ivan talking about price, we're making some nice, I think durable headway into improving our price discipline and our price performance. So, we're going to continue to actively look for some offsets to that headwind. But right now, it's just too early to tell -- to say exactly what that 50 basis points ultimately translates to in 2023. I would say we've definitely increased since 2021 and obviously since the depths of the pandemic, I think there's likely a little bit more room to go to bring back spending as we continue to see topline performance improved throughout the year. So, and especially in the backdrop of the new products launches that we've got coming out. We want to make sure that we're investing appropriately from a commercial perspective, to make sure that those launches are successful. I don't know Ivan, if you want to say anything else there, but I guess the key thing we'd expect to see a modest increase that will be involve. Yeah so, you're right, the forward-looking based on our increase in our guidance range on ex-FX, the midpoint now being at 3% versus the former at flat year-over-year. But given our first quarter would suggest lower ex-FX growth rates for the remainder of the year. And that's primarily due to, as we previously discussed, much tougher comps as we move through the rest of the year. The first quarter of this year, we were of course, comparing against the first quarter of 2021, which had a very, very deep COVID, impact. And so, it wasn't unexpected that you'd see a much better Q1 than the rest of the year. So, it's really comp related on the rest of the year as to why that growth rate is lower than the first quarter.  As we think about cadence of revenue growth, as we move forward, we would expect -- we already talked about second quarter being in the low single-digits on an ex-FX basis. And the fourth quarter based on normal seasonality, we would expect the second quarter to be stronger than the third quarter. And then of course, the fourth quarter to be the strongest quarter of the remainder of the year, very consistent with our former seasonality that you saw last year and prior to the pandemic in 2019. And we would also expect earnings to follow that same suit. And as revenue gets stronger, so will the operating margins. So, earnings are expected to follow in that same cadence as revenue. Yes. Sure. Probably -- I mean, Suky probably better, maybe even have Ivan talk about that because I mean, that realization of pull-through is now. I mean, it's happening. So maybe Ivan, you want to speak to that. Is that what you were going to ask? Yes. And hey, Ryan. On your question related to the spin and I believe it was on this synergy. So, if you look at the re - casted financials that we put out last week, you would see that overall, we see operating margin accretion of about a 190 basis points from the transaction, which is a little bit better than our original expectations, that's a good thing, of further validation of why we entered into that transaction. Inside of that, that would then imply and suggest about $40 million to $50 million of stranded costs remaining with Zimmer Biomet. I would say that we're already making progress against those stranded costs this year. We believe that there's more opportunity going into next year and we kind of just see that as part of our overall operating base as a potential source of opportunity for future efficiency. Hopefully that gets to your question on where we see and how we size the synergies. but make no mistake about it, we're going after those as aggressively as we can while ensuring we don't disrupt the business and the recovery that we're starting to see."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ivan Tornos",
            "content": "Absolutely. Thank you, Bryan. So, I concur, it remains a headwind. What I will tell you is that in the U.S. we have seen our cancellation rates. So, the cases -- will also be the cases that get canceled every week, to starting to look pretty much similar to those cancellation rates in 2019. In the past, most calculations were ACE related, so fear and anxiety. In the early IQ, the staffing challenges, then 2021 it was mainly staff -- agreement, staffing agreement. And that [Indiscernible] seen that it's starting to look [Indiscernible] less of probably in Europe than other markets in the U.S., but it remains a challenge in the U.S. Absolutely Suky. Hey Travis, Ivan here. So as Suky do it too, and in our normal -- the normal price erosion is around 2 to 300 basis points. We did achieve better at price erosion in the quarter, some components of that are sustainable, others they remain to be seen. But I will tell you that we got over next today in the U.S. and frankly in Europe and APAC that we didn't have in the past, as we see our vitality Index or percentage of sales coming from new products, we see that as a tailwind. And again, we'll see how that develops in quarters to come. And from an incentive standpoint, for the first time we will have very clear incentives in all commercial annexation to maintain or gain price. So, we're not making a commitment to do any better than the 2 to 300 basis points, given that a large percentage of the business is contracted. But certainly, we have the plans and the government that we didn't have before. So, fingers crossed on that one. So, I'll take that and then I'll pass it over to you, Bryan. I'm going to talk about some specifics. But it probably all depends on how you're running your data, because I would probably argue the different outcome. The fact is it's choppy. It's really choppy. And we're looking at this thing in every different way you can; sequential growth versus the previous quarter, we're looking at it versus prior year, versus 2019 because that was your last good year. We're looking at it on a stack basis. You name it, we're running the analysis to get a sense for what we're doing. What I've said always is that I don't really trust any given quarter, but I do look at trends, and almost any which way I slice it, I do see us moving in the right direction and of course I also see things that you can't see in our own business.  The combination of the trends that I'm seeing, looking at it a lot of different ways and also just the things that I see in my own business, I feel very confident that we're moving in the right direction and we're doing the things that we need to do to be able to drive attractive growth. A big one that I look at is vitality index. We had a more slow vitality in the business, we've doubled that in the last few years and that continues to move north. We've got a very strong pipeline of products. So, to me, when I think about that performance, it's clear. I mean, the transformation is real. And the good news for us is that as COVID and staffing issues start to clear and continue to clear, that the reported performance that we have as a business as finally going to start reflecting what we actually know is happening in the business. Yes, absolutely. I mean, I look forward to the day where we have objective market share data on because I also differ from that statement on markets there. But that said, I'm beyond excited about what we got in the store. So, some of the products that we keep talking about, Russ, you mentioned 600 [Indiscernible] at place, I believe the number is higher now. We're getting a strong penetration in key accounts, both in the hospital setting and in the outpatient setting. We have indications, plenty of indications to come. Our revision has only been launched here in the U.S. but continuous to grow at unprecedented rates. It's pulling our primary needs as well along the way, ZBEdge, I would spend an hour talking about all the things that you probably saw in [Indiscernible] in Chicago. Whether it is WalkAI, Mymobility on [Indiscernible] configurations. By the way, we have the largest number of enrollments these last quarter, Cementless knees penetration is also in the teens, and that's before we launch a new form factor device at the end of this year, which is going to give us break in the category. So that's just the [Indiscernible], and Amani, we launched six products in the last two years.  As you look into Hips, we are performing strongly with Avenir Complete, direct Anterior, our revision platform. We don't talk enough about that. Somebody is also performing very well. In said CMSD sports made on trauma are doing well, we got some noise with that trauma early in the year, but we got new launches and new product launches to come. And just a ton of stuff coming from -- and data on technology standpoint. So, I don't know, you were looking at the same data, when it looks the market share. But what I do know is that as you look at the innovation story with the [Indiscernible] index being 2x what it used to be, and the pipeline being dramatically higher than it used to be three years ago. I'm pretty confident that we're going to remain above market for the [Indiscernible]. Just maybe quickly hearing that Jeff, I will tell you that the fact that they [Indiscernible] what it was three years ago tells you that we haven't a slowdown from an R&D perspective. Within R&D you got two components. which is sustaining engineering and then new product introductions. And the number of new product introductions in '21 and '22 is dramatically different than in past years as we get into '23 and '24, it's even higher. So definitely no cuts when it comes to true innovation. And then relative to [Indiscernible], that's another area that we're trying not to cut. Might have done some adjustments throughout the pandemic, but I will tell you we are full force globally when it comes to [Indiscernible]. So, R&D [Indiscernible] remain sacred cows here from an investment standpoint. Thanks, Jeff. Just maybe just back up a little. We've seen [Indiscernible], so in the category, as I mentioned earlier, sports are going very well. The acquisition and integration are relying continues to go very nicely here in the US and in Europe. We've seen an increasing penetration on Signature ONE. We are now integrated in shoulder. We Mymobility, which is the integration of ZBEdge components into the shoulder platform. Comprehensive and shoulder is growing, in the strong team globally. So as sports and upper extremities have done very well, CMFT and integration of [Indiscernible] is also going very well. Continue to gain share on hip trauma, [Indiscernible] closer where we have some headwinds. It was referenced by Suky in the prepared remarks. [Indiscernible] trauma primarily because the headwinds in APAC, but also in the U.S. some time it was some contracts. But overall, the category with the exclusion of trauma right now, it seems going really, really well. And as I mentioned, a different forum, we got more product launches in the segment in 2022 at the end of 2022 and in 2023, that we have had since 2015, 2016. So, the innovation to start is that as well. So, things are on track. Absolutely, thanks. So, it's very fluid. It's very customer-centered. We give the option of the placement, we obviously give the option of selling the ROSA, then sometimes we do a hybrid. In 2021 with did more sales than we anticipated given some of the macro-dynamics as we entered 2022, we see on a particular placement that that delivers better financial returns, we want more of that. That said we still are selling robots. And as I said earlier, we're not seeing any clear headwind today. That capital is not at a low for the robots, both in the hospital setting and in the ASC. Maybe I won't give too many details because you never know who's listening. But the facts are that penetration of Cementless associated with ROSA, is sort of the end of teams. The pull-through and a lot is going pointed of the Knee performance in Q1 is ROSA related. The 600 plus robots that we place roughly 50%, not 60% of those in the U.S. half of those are in competitive accounts, how we've seen meaningful revenue going from those areas. And all of that is in the early innings. As we get into the additional launches on Hip, as we getting through all their modalities of ROSA Knee. We've got $7 billion innovation pipeline. We got to continue to see a nice pull-through there. Cementless is one of the elements of our pull-through, as is regular knees. And then we have a disposable and another component, CVX many, many accounts and gets contracted as part of the ROSA placement or sale and that's another social revenue. So again, we don't disclose the revenue which were robots. But I will tell you that is above expectations so far. [Indiscernible] or you want to change the answer here? Absolutely yeah, Mike. So, first thing is first, we're on track with our limited market release. I'm not a friend of the wind limit their market releases; I'd like to do full force launches. But on this one, given the complexity and given the disruption in the market, we wanted to go slowly and collect data. The -- I won't talk about the number of hospitals that have been on-boarded but it is significant. The base in pipeline is also significant on both expectations. We collect the data across the board on mobility, range of motion. We've had literally thousands of base plan data track. The platform Persona IQ is now fully integrated. We found our mobility and the rest of the CDA ecosystem.  We have not seen any surprises when it goes to the qualified data that we tracking. Most excitingly, we've got a technology road map that is going to go beyond knees. Already got the sign agreements for us. I mean, this for shoulder and other categories. On the second part of your question, I'm not going to comment on what it is material or not. I will tell you this, material for patients. And then the logic shall prevail if it is material for patients. So far so good, very excited. I look forward to the next steps. Yes, I can take that one as well. So pleased with where we are, we [Indiscernible] ASC. Clearly, we started later than others in this environment, given our strong position in hospital settings, inpatient, outpatient and whatnot. But we put a plan together to get around 40 components, making sure we have the right portfolio, the right people, the right partnerships, and the right contracts on the products we don't have ton. We fill the gaps on basic things like [Indiscernible] on the 20 cities from [Indiscernible]. We launched that ASC friendly innovation around robotics. We have increased our Cementless penetration. So, I think that the portfolio is a second too, especially now that we added these ports made on [Indiscernible], so strong on the product angle. On the people aspect, we didn't use to have a dedicated, a structure, dedicated commercial structure, and contracting a structure on the ASC setting.  We have it now, is fully dedicated. We got a large group of people that each and every day get up, and seem volume about the ASC. On the partnership angle, we got those key relationships with [Indiscernible] in the US, we developing technology together that is applicable to the ASC. We done a ton of medical allocation, together we found this key centers. I mean, around contract in his Meta date, we got an owner of all ASC contracts. We're very disciplined around the governance in those relationships, particularly in pricing. So, I think the plan is working well. We're growing faster than expected, I'm not sure these days was growing faster or not than the others. The ASC performance in Q1 was above our expectations, and as we think about the rest of the year, I think we're in good position to continue to grow. I guess, if I had to add to what Bryan is saying, I'll be saying the same thing with a different action. I want to extend myself, but that it started about the dedicated channel in key geographies in Europe and the U.S. primarily and the innovation that is coming later in the year and going into 2023. Sports is going well; extremity is going well. Again, some knows [Indiscernible] trauma, but two of the three key components are performing very nicely and they love to perform even at a faster basis. Thanks, Robbie. Yeah. The reason for the range that we have in the guidance is to make sure that we're accommodating risk core opportunity in places like China. So, it's already calculated in the range that we have. What I would tell you is, again, within a little bit lucky there, sometimes it's okay to be lucky rather than always just good. But the fact is we've had that offset. We have had some pressure when we look at Shanghai lockdowns, but we've also had delays and BPP implementation which helps us from a pricing standpoint and they've offset each other. And so, at this point in time, even though the mix of how we're getting to the revenue and the bottom line that we assumed we would get in China it's changed, but the overall impact is about where we thought it would be. So, I guess all that to say, even if we see continued lockdowns, as long as we see continued delays in VBP, they seem to be offsetting each up."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "Alright, thanks, Keri and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I'm going to talk briefly about our Q1 performance and our revised expectations for the full year. I'm also going to spend a few minutes talking about our recent innovation and our key drivers for long-term growth. And then after that, I'm going to turn it over to Suky, who will get into more details on the quarter, but also very importantly, our full-year guidance update. And then we'll close out the call with your questions, of course. So, let's get started with Q1. We had a strong quarter, well above our own expectations and obviously above external expectations. And the primary reason for that level of over achievement was stronger than anticipated COVID recovery in the quarter, particularly when we looked at the back half of the quarter. And if I look at the U.S. recovery, it was stronger and faster than I think anyone expected pretty much across the board. And while we continue to see COVID surges in EMEA and China, the impact on overall procedure cancellations has been minimal at least so far.  And inside of that we saw very strong performance in large joints, and in particular our Knee franchise, while our set recovery lagged our core recon business at this point. We know it's still early in the year but based on what we saw in the quarter, and really current trends in the Q2, our confidence in 2022 growth has definitely increased. And as a result, we're raising and tightening our full-year guidance. Now there are clearly a number of headwinds that we're facing. Supply challenges, inflation, Russia, Ukraine. But given our revenue dependent on elective procedures, COVID recovery outweighs those headwinds. And that's why even in the face of these challenges, we're able to raise our outlook for the year. Okay. So, turning the page a bit, outside of external influences on our business, our strategy is working and our underlying business is very strong. Our new product pipeline continues to deliver. We're adding. more innovation and value to our ZBEdge ecosystem. If you were an AAOS, you saw our recently launched WalkAI. This is ZB's first AI based solution. We also showed recently launched functionality for Mymobility platform, this is under the umbrella of our exclusive partnership with Apple. Our ROSA Robotics momentum continues to be very strong. And the early feedback on Persona IQ, even though it's in limited launch, is very positive. All of these things combined are highlighting the possibilities around data collection and integration on the patient experience. We also continue to drive significant demand and traction with Persona Revision in our Knee franchise. With Avenir Complete in our Hip franchise, and our signature ONE planner in shoulder.  And our new product pipeline remains very strong with additional product launches planned for 2022, especially across our Knee and [Indiscernible] portfolios. We're also continuing to reshape our business and accelerate ZB's transformation. That means of course, streamlining and modernizing our Operating model, but also focusing on making ZB a best preferred place to work and a trusted partner. Just in Q1, we scored 100% on the human rights campaign's corporate equality index. We made Forbes best large employers list, and were named one of the most innovative companies by FastCompany for our ROSA Robotics platform. We have also prioritized our environmental, social, and governance, or ESG commitments and our actions in this area continued to expand.  We have committed to key environmental standards, delivered on social giving pledges and set DENI standards and long-term goals in this area. And we've enhanced our overall reporting of ESG progress internal to our own team members, but also to investors. And finally, our transformation also includes, as you know, active portfolio management and as a part of this, we completed our spin of ZimVie on March 1st. That was ahead of schedule and certainly as a part of our active portfolio management strategy.  So, in summary, even though there are real macro headwinds that we will have to manage, and I have confidence in our team to do so, the recovery, the shift in recover really in COVID is the bright spot we've been waiting for. And we're excited about and it's certainly changed our view of 2022. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suky for a deeper dive into Q1 and our revised expectations for the full year. Okay, Suky. Yes, Thanks. Maybe I'll just start off and then I've got Ivan sitting next to me. We are actually here traveling in Europe, because we take the opportunity to get out and start Q2 strong. What I would tell you is that yes, we are definitely still seeing pressure from the staffing standpoint and we actually, even today would expect that to continue throughout the year. What I think about the quarter itself, whether it be COVID or staffing of a combination of the two, it was pretty tough in January. Got better obviously in February and that was really, really good. And in March -- actually March was a month that we had at growth over 2019, so true growth over pre -pandemic levels, and we've seen that continuing to April. So, all positive from that perspective, but we do expect that staffing pressure will continue to be a challenge throughout the year. Just not as intense, I think is what we thought when we started the year. But, Ivan you're out there more than I am in the U.S. maybe you could also. So, I'm having a hard time hearing her for some reason. I don't know if maybe Keri, you could repeat the question. I couldn't hear it. Yeah, I can see that question as well. So primarily we sell capital in two businesses, for surgical business and obviously robotics, Knee and Hip [Indiscernible]. We are not seeing anything that tells us that there's a shortage of capital. What the strategy for the quarter is being more around placements than selling robots. But under surgical side, we're not seeing a challenge, we're not seeing that we've seen less fluidity than in Q4. So, I'm actually pretty optimistic in terms of where we are when it comes to a capital allocation from a hospital standpoint. But again, as I mentioned, we are doing more placement than sales in the quarter. We did more placements than sales in the quarter. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I might just add this down -- I might just add some commentary there. It's actually because even though there's a lot that's happening, that's different than expected in China, the overall impact into the quarter was about what we expected. And even into now coming into Q2. So, for different reasons -- but the fact is, even though we're seeing lock downs in Shanghai and disruption as a result, we're also seeing delays in VBP implementation. And those are almost balancing each other. So, while certainly China was still a headwind for the quarter, from a top and bottom-line standpoint, it was pretty much in line with what we expected even though for just different reasons. But what gives us a lot of confidence again, is the innovations. So maybe Ivan, you want to talk about some of the innovation that gets you excited. Yeah. So maybe I'll start kind of topline and then I'll hand it to Suky to talk about capital allocation and our current focus there. But yes, for sure, M&A and active portfolio management is a big part of what we define as Phase 3 of the transformation. Just as a quick reminder, we started this old journey in Phase 1, which I'm just going to define as kind of the hearts and minds. In other words, kind of mission and culture focus. Significant upgrading in talent at the leadership team level to make sure we have the right people to transform the business and then stabilizing just a number of significant issues around quality compliance, turnover supply, you name it. Phase 2 was more around a true long-term strategy, making sure that we're shifting to innovation versus remediation.  And really changing the kind of innovation we were focused on and then augmenting our structure and operating mechanisms to ensure that we truly do drive execution and accountability to the strategy. And the Phase 3 is where we are in kind of to your question. We are looking to transform the portfolio of the company. Now, COVID has hampered our ability to do that because it's put pressure on the business. We haven't had as much firepower. But the fact is, we have made decisions here that are moving the needle. Number one, we've got the spin of the dental and spine businesses, which we think is the right thing for both businesses.  And although there have been smaller because we don't have the firepower, we've done acquisitions to be able to build, scale and attract as basis. But for sure we will continue to focus on active portfolio management, acquiring companies that can drive weighted average market growth for us in our mission centric. I'm not going to get into specifics on where we would focus because as you probably know, it's pretty competitive out there right now for assets. But this is something that we absolutely will focus on in Phase 3. The good news is as we continue to see stabilization in the market, we're going to be able to continue to buy down debt, which is important to us and eventually increase the firepower to do this. Suky, maybe I'll just turn it over to you to talk about current capital allocation. So, Suky, why don't you start with the cadence of growth, as much color as you want to provide there obviously, we're not providing quarterly guidance, but you can get more color there. And then I'll talk about the diversification. Great. And on the concept of diversification, when we think about active portfolio management, it's definitely still there. Clearly, we want to make sure that we're diversifying our business and we think about it really in three ways. It's not just product segment diversification. Clearly that's an area of concentration for us because there are faster growth categories that we play in that we want to build scale in. But also, geographic expansion, just to make sure that we're taking advantage of fast-growth areas in the world. And then ASC, you referenced ASC as an attractive setting, we've actually already acquired areas to build our scale in that setting and we built commercial infrastructure to pursue ASC as well. So, we look at it for sure in diversification to drive weighted average market growth, but we don't just look at it to be a product, not just by geography, not just by setting, but all three of those. Maybe just quick topline and then Ivan, maybe you could speak to some of the things you're seeing inside of set. First and foremost, it is an area that we're very interested in. Not all the sub-segments of S.E.T. are created equal for us or certain categories that we're investing more heavily in because they're more attractive, we think we've got a better chance to win. Quite frankly, we really do believe that we've got scale that we can continue to move forward. So not all equal, but certainly an area of overall concentration for us. I would say that you're going to continue to see some pressure in the next couple of quarters. A lot of that comes from the fact that we still have pressure in VBP and in trauma.  And then I think as you get to the end of the year, particularly some of those new products being launched, you might have an opportunity to see some of that move in the right direction. But just make no mistake, S.E.T. is an important area for us. We've put commercial infrastructure in place, we've acquired technologies in this space, we continue to innovate in the space and we will continue to focus in S.E.T. I don't know if you had anything else you want to -- Yes. So, to be clear, the backlog, we still believe there's got to be a backlog. I mean, just the fact there's just been no fundamental shift in the disease state itself and there has to be a backlog just given what's happened over the past couple of years. But what we're not trying to state right now, given our guidance, is that we expect a big part of that backlog or really any of that backlog to influence our numbers. So, we're just saying that we believe as we get to the back half of the year, we're going to get to a normal environment, not making assumptions about capitalizing or benefiting from no backlog. We do believe at some point it has to come through, but we believe at this point it's not going to be some kind of a massive impact that comes quickly, just -- you're just going to have capacity issues associated with that. We do believe it should be a tailwind, but we think is going to happen over years, not months or quarters, would be our view on it. But just to be very clear, we're not expecting that as a part of our guidance right now in backlog recovery. And Suky, sorry to step on here. But I figure that was more of a commercial discussion versus a financial one. So, I'll start and then obviously you can transition to Suky. We're feeling really good actually. The funny thing is when you think about Knee, most people think about it and rightly so a pretty slow growth market. But in reality, there's more innovation entering the Knee space than we've ever seen before. We've got our, us, our competitors, all focused on data, robotics, and other forms of technology and share wallet opportunities that we just haven't seen in the past. So even though one might view that as a relatively slow growth market, I actually see it as a real potential to see some acceleration in that market growth. I feel very confident that we can grow well because of all the shots on goal that we have. I also think all boats will float here. I mean, it's really great because you've got a lot of technology entering the space. What we've seen is that it's being digested. When I think about that, what are the implications?  You've got the same number of procedures being done, but you're getting more share of wallet for every procedure that drives up the entire space. Usually when you bring innovation as Ivan was alluded to earlier, when you have vitality in a space that also drives better pricing stability. Because you signed longer-term contracts when somebody converts, for instance, to ROSA, they usually come right back, you try to knock it down from a pricing perspective. So, vitality really does drive stability and pricing as well. So, I think even in a space like that, that you might not believe would be attractive for overall revenue growth, I do believe it is sustainably an attractive area for us to invest in growth. And it's very profitable for us as well. Set is pretty obvious. The categories are set that we're concentrating on are attractive market growth that everybody knows. We believe we have an ability to win and we'll continue to scale in those areas. So pretty much across the board when I look at large joints score set, I see them as attractive markets given the technology and innovation that we're bringing to bear. Suky? Yes. So, we're lucky to have Ivan on the call today because obviously, I'm close to this. He is extremely close to Persona IQ, not just what we have in Knee, but also the future view of where we can take IQ and smart implants. But I would say we're in limited launch, as we've said, we're going to do this right. We're going to take our time, we're going to make sure that we learn what we need to learn just so that when we do full launch, we launch well. But the early stage of this is very attractive. What's interesting about it, he's going to get into IQ itself, what's interesting about it is it's also driving traction for the organization just because it's innovative. Even people that are not ready for IQ yet, they're just saying, ''Hey, I'm not quite ready for it yet.'' They're looking at us as -- differently.  They're looking at Zimmer Biomet as an innovative player in the space, and most people want to be linked to an innovative player, someone who's going to change the space. And so even those customers that didn't want to come to us for IQ, we're getting interest for them just to move to regular Persona. So, it's almost got a halo effect because it's so unique in the marketplace. But yeah. Maybe also get a chance some of this, Ivan. But the fact is we did have a pretty significant headwind. So, you look at the difference in regions that the most challenging region that we had was Asia-Pacific and a big part of that as we all know, is the trauma, VBP and the weight that that's having on the overall segment. Outside of that, when we looking inside of S.E.T., I would say the same thing. Our upper extremities business did very well. The innovation is helping us drive our performance there, but also the focus that we have. Sports did very well as Ivan talked about before, and that happening both U.S. and Europe. And when you think about our CMFT business, we continue to see traction there, not just because of the acquisitions that we've had, but also because of the now, what I would define as organic growth from those acquisitions. And again, the focus that we have, commercial in CMFT. So those are kind of the bright spots that we have, and those are across all regions. The big headwind for us is in trauma, a lot of that being in Asia-Pacific. I think you could probably just read from what Suky said and -- I think it was in your prepared remarks, Suky, but 200-300 basis points of headwind is what you could look at in the quarter on the global business as a result of China. No, I think the nice thing is we've captured a lot of what we wanted to say via the questions. The fact is it was a good quarter. It feels good to have and I think probably the most important thing, even though there's a lot of challenges that everyone is talking about right now, that we're going to have to deal with it. We're going to have to manage through and have confidence in the team can managed through those. The difference now is it's the same challenges for everybody where we've been disproportionately impacted by COVID. If I had to select, I would take the challenges that we currently have in place and their impact to the business versus continued COVID impact. That's the positive for us. That's been kind of a light at the end of the tunnel that we've been waiting for, which is COVID receding. And I truly do believe if it does receding and it continues to recede, that the actual performance that we see in the business will begin to be reflected in the performance that you see in business. With that, we'll go ahead and end the call."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zimmer Biomet's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today February 8, 2024. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ivan Tornos, our President and CEO; and CFO and EVP, Finance, Operations and Supply Chain, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if the actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which are forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of our basis for calculating these measures is included within our Q4 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ivan. Ivan?\nIvan Tornos: Hey, thank you, Keri, and thanks, everyone for joining the call here this morning. I like to start the way that I typically do, taking a moment to recognize, to show my gratitude to the almost 20,000 Zimmer Biomet team members for their dedication, for their commitment, for their strong resilience, and for their superb performance in 2023. Simply put, 2023 was just a great year for our company and I want to say thank you. In 2023, we impacted the lives of almost 4 million patients and along the way we deliver best-in-class financial performance, growing our constant currency revenue by 7.5% while adjusted EPS earnings per share grew almost 9.5% in the year. That's 200 basis points of leverage between the 7.5% revenue growth and the 9.5% growth in EPS. In the year, we generated almost $1 billion in free cash flow, and that's with some turbulence around inventory management and whatnot. So again, strong performance top to bottom. And I'm just very, very proud of the execution in the year. It's worth noting that, that this level of execution and performance came in a year in which we still had to deal with fairly complex micro issues, whether it's inflation, FX, geopolitical challenges. I don't think I need to talk much about that and also some micro challenges in the year. We did struggle with some supply challenges throughout some of the periods. I'm happy that's behind, but it was a headwind in many periods in 2023. And again delivering 7.5% in 2023 against some top comparables, having grown constant currency revenue in 2022 the year before by 6.6%, so clearly a great trend in the making, clearly strong performance, and I'm just so grateful and so proud of all of you, the Zimmer Biomet team. At the same time, beyond grateful, I'm truly excited as I know that this is just the very beginning when it comes to the level of performance that we can realize here at Zimmer Biomet and multiple drivers of why I'm confident that this is just the very beginning. But I'll start with highlighting the bold pipeline that we have in place. The size of our pipeline is twice what it used to be in 2018. We got great new product launches that are happening here early in 2024. We have a stable supply, we've created an stable supply environment and we got great commercial execution. We're developing flawless commercial execution as evidenced by these growth rates that I just highlighted. To compound our belief behind this level of examine ahead is the fact that we have seen and we continue to see a substantial improvement in our end markets. This is not the same market growth profile that we used to have. Pacing demand is strong, procedure volume is very strong, given a variety of reasons and as the market leader in both knees and hips, being in better markets is just very exciting as we enter 2024. Back five years ago, when I joined the company, we used to think of for WAMGR weighted average market growth rates as being somewhere in the 3% range. And today, we PEG or WAMGR as being very near, if not at 4%. And again, that's a meaningful increase and we believe it's sustainable. So we're not going back to the 3% days when it comes to market growth rates. So again, internal and external dynamics gives me, gives us confidence that the best is truly ahead. When you add to all of these variables, the fact that we have the strongest balance sheet in the history of the company, there is no doubt then that we can claim that our future is nothing short of truly bright. So again, very pleased, very proud and very confident. I'd like to thank our investors as well for their support in 2023 and for their confidence in 2024 and beyond. We continue to take biggest strides forward toward being a company with a very different growth profile from top to bottom. Committing to an expectation to grow at least 100 basis points to 200 basis points above marketing revenue, with our EPS, with our earnings per share, growing faster than revenue, and our free cash flow dollars growing faster than EPS. The guidance that we are providing today for 2024 already reflect such a commitment to this type of financial discipline. And I'm very much looking forward to our Analyst Day on May 29 in when we will provide additional details in terms of our long range plan, which will illustrate that this is not a one-year wonder, this is a multi-year commitment. And you will see then that Zimmer Biomet has truly entered our growth stage era. We're no longer in turnaround mode. We're ready to deliver by being laser-focused on the three strategic imperatives that I highlighted during my very first earnings call as CEO back in November, three strategic imperatives that I continue to repeat over and over at every Zimmer Biomet meeting. And frankly, I will continue to repeat because those are the three drivers that we know are going to drive our performance. Those being number one, people and culture; number two, operational excellence; and number three, innovation and diversification. So let's talk about our 2024 commitments, how different initiatives across these three strategic imperatives will drive our growth forward. First in the area of people and culture, and again, I've explained this in the past, what it means, it's about having the right people in the right roles within the right culture. We must make sure that we support team members to act as owners and operators of the business. This means decentralizing decision making, driving agility, and empowering team members at every level, across every function around the world. We must become leaner; we got to be closer to the customer. Equally important, we must truly live an environment of pay for performance. This is something that has already kicked off in a very meaningful way in the fiscal year -- in this fiscal year 2024. An example of that is the fact that we're incentivizing free cash flow dollar generation or growth in a much more disciplined way across the enterprise knowing that revenue is also the most durable driver of free cash flow performance. Incentives are also set for revenue growth to meaningfully drive compensation across our firm at every level. So again, we change the way we pay people in terms of growing revenue above market. We change the way that we pay people, giving a larger percentage of compensation in adherence to the fact that we as a company need to grow free cash flow dollars at double-digit rates. In the second area of operational excellence, and again, this is about how we think about growing the business top to bottom. You can see already in today's update in the press release that we mean it. It is tough to restructure a company. It's certainly something that we don't take lightly. You read the press release, we had to do it. It's a tough choice once again, but we needed to make operational changes to simplify our structure, to deliver greater efficiency, and to ensure that we enhancing investments in the right areas of the business, again closer to the customer, so again, not an easy thing to do, but something that we had to do and something that we have done. Beyond the restructuring, other initiatives in the area of operational excellence that are already in full motion, are the new programs that we got in place kicking off how to drastically reduce inventory levels at Zimmer Biomet. This will drive substantial improvement in our free cash flow dollar growth, while also reducing our days on hand, DOH by 50 days or more and will reduce or excess an obsolescence exposure, which is something that frankly we've not done that well in previous years. Second thing we're doing is the rollout of a global initiative to drive new product launch excellence across the key new product introductions that we have in the year 2024. In simple terms, the seven or eight most meaningful product launches, let's make sure we have a cadence of operating mechanisms with proper governance to ensure that we're maximizing these product launches across each key geography. And then the third thing we're doing in operational excellence beyond the restructuring is the integration of the pricing organization under the finance structure, reporting directly to Suky, our CFO, to ensure maximum governance and accountability across the enterprise. While we are pleased with the reduction in price erosion over the last two to three years, we believe there is much greater opportunity to drive even better and more durable pricing dynamics. So again, in the area of operational excellence, beyond the restructuring, it's about drastically reducing inventory levels to generate improved free cash flow dollar growth. It's about governance beyond or behind the new product launches. And then thirdly is around doing better in the area of pricing dynamics. In the third strategic imperative of innovation and diversification, we're going to continue to invest in innovative R&D, in customer centric R&D, we're going to continue to fuel our pipeline with meaningful product launches. We're going to continue to drive our vitality index, which has already expanded very meaningfully over the last three years. And we're going to make sure that as we continue to launch new products, we also see margin expansion coming from these new products. I'm excited about where we are today. Our pipeline, the dollar value associated with our pipeline is twice what it was at the end of 2018. And as we enter 2024, we had very meaningful product launches, particularly in the hip area in where we lost market share in the last two years, given the lack of products in key categories like surgical impactors, triple tapered stems, or hip navigation. So again, 2024 is the year in where, through very meaningful product launches, we will regain the momentum that we lost. Beyond hips, I'm excited about where we are in shoulder; Identity continues to generate great excitement. We will enter 2024 in full launch mode when it comes to Identity. We're excited about stemless shoulders entering the market, and yes, very excited about being first to market in the category of shoulder robotics with a very highly differentiated offering in robotics for shoulders that will apply for both anatomic and reverse surgeries. In the area of knees, we're in the early days of our cementless knee launch, in 2024, we seek to increase our penetration rates drastically. Here in the U.S., our penetration rate in cementless is not even in the 20% range and we are committing to drive the penetration rate into the 50% to 60% range at a very rapid pace. Again, more details to those plans at our Analyst Day, but rest assured that our knee penetration rate in the cementless category is not going to stay in the teens or even the low-20s for long. Beyond cementless, we're excited about next-generation robotics in knee. We are excited about partial cementless knees, and we're excited about the fact that in 2024, we're going to be entering the full launch for Persona IQ, the only smart knee in the world that fully integrates data, technology and best-in-class implants in a way that nobody else is doing. In the category of S.E.T., which is six different businesses, sports, foot and ankle, restorative therapies, trauma, extremities, and CMFT, craniomaxillofacial thoracic, we are seeing great growth already exiting 2023. The second semester of 2023, we grew S.E.T. by mid-single-digit or above. And as we entered 2024 and beyond, the expectation is that S.E.T. will continue to grow mid-single-digit or above. And this is something that as a company, we've not realized ever since the merger in 2015 with exclusion of the post-COVID year given comes, so really excited about the return on the multiple investments we made in S.E.T. particularly in the areas of innovation and commercial execution. There is a great cadence of product launches in S.E.T., already mentioned some of those and more to come when we do our Analyst Day in later in the spring. So excited about S.E.T., excited about innovation as a whole or new product development pipeline is strong. We're going to be launching over 40 different new products in the next 24 months or so. Most of them are going to enable category leadership, establishing Zimmer Biomet as the leader or the second position in the category. And virtually all of them are going to be in market spaces that are growing 4% plus or above. So I like the quantity, I like the quality, and I like the market growth profile in terms of where innovation is going. I'm also particularly excited about the innovation plans that we have for the ASC here in the U.S., ASC side of care. We made meaningful investments innovation during all stages of the episode of care, what happens before surgery, what happens during surgery, and what happens after surgery. And relative to the ASC in the intra op stage of the ASC, we are best-in-class when it comes to solving problems, delivering efficiency, best-in-class outcomes and safety. So again, truly excited about our ASC strategy where we're going relative to this side of care. Diversification of Zimmer Biomet's end markets will happen not just by innovation internally, but will happen through smart M&A, which will remain the number one category when it comes to capital allocation, with a best-in-class labor ratio, and with deep confidence in our free cash flow generating plans over the next few years, our strategy is to make a smart M&A the top recipient of our capital. But at the same time, I just love the fact that we have the optionality to continue to do share buybacks as we announced this morning and perhaps at a more meaningful level. So the combination of smart M&A and buybacks can coexist, given the strong free cash flow dollar generation that we are seeing in -- from this regard. I'm energized by the very detailed and focused plans that the team has put in place, which I know that upon their execution will position Zimmer Biomet to deliver on the growth profile that we keep recommitting and that is to grow above to 100 basis points to 200 basis points. So that's a minimum point of entry commitment of 5% in the year 2024, with earnings per share always growing faster than revenue and free cash flow always growing faster than EPS. This is not a one year commitment. This is a multi-year commitment. And again, I know based on the very detailed plans, we will get there. In closing, we are very excited about where we're at, the track record over the last two years, and most importantly, we're deeply excited in terms of where we're going to go in 2024 and beyond. The team is ready. We are establishing the right trend and we're going to continue to drive flawless execution, delivering our commitment. Along the way, we're going to help patients, we're going to create shareholder value, and we will leave our mission of alleviating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Suky.\nSuky Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, our fourth quarter results ended a successful year for Zimmer Biomet, with full-year constant currency revenue growing 7.5% and adjusted earnings growing more than 9.5% on reported basis, while generating just under $1 billion in free cash flow. Inside of that, our business segments performed well for the year. Global knees constant currency growth of over 10%, hips growth of 5%, and S.E.T. growth of almost 4%, all while also expanding adjusted operating margin by almost 100 basis points, the second consecutive year of operating margin expansion in a challenging environment. Also, as previously guided, we closed the second half of 2023 with mid-single-digit revenue growth and levered earnings growth, a profile we expect to continue moving forward. Let's dive into the fourth quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter of 2023 and how it compares to the same period in 2022, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.94 billion, an increase of 6.3% on a reported basis and an increase of 6.1% on a constant currency basis. We had a selling day tailwind of about 100 basis points in the quarter. U.S. growth was 4.4% and international growth was 8.7%. As expected, we saw a robust sequential step up versus the third quarter across all regions. Global knees grew 5.6% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 5.4% and international growing 5.8%. The knee business continues to be driven by our Persona product portfolio combined with our ROSA robotics platform, and we remain excited about the positive feedback around our recently launched cementless form factor for Persona OsseoTi. For the full-year, global knees grew 10.2%. Global hips grew 3.6% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 4% and international growing 3.2%. We are eager to accelerate performance of this segment with the addition of multiple new product offerings in 2024. For the full-year, global hips grew 5.1%. Next, the S.E.T. category grew 6.4% in the quarter, with our key focus areas of sports, CMFT and upper extremities all growing in the mid-single-digit to low-double-digit range. The strong growth in these focus areas was partially offset by other sub segments within the category. For the full-year, S.E.T. grew 3.8%, including a step up to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. Finally, our other category grew 15.9% in the quarter, driven by another strong quarter of global ROSA sales. Now moving to the P&L. In Q4, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.01 compared to GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.62 in the prior year. The increase in GAAP results was driven by higher revenue, a goodwill impairment charge in 2022 that did not repeat favorable one-time tax benefits in 2023, and a lower share count. The details around our financial performance can be found in today's press release. On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.20 compared to $1.88 in the prior year, representing year-over-year reported growth of 17%. The step up is driven by revenue growth, better gross margins, lower OpEx margin in tandem with a lower tax rate. Our adjusted gross margin was 72.5%, up 80 basis points from the prior year, driven by favorable mix, higher volumes and lower royalties. And for the full-year we came in slightly above expectations, representing 90 basis points of year-over-year expansion. Adjusted operating margin was 30.3%, up 200 basis points from the prior year. The year-over-year operating margin step up was primarily driven by revenue leverage, better gross margin and realized efficiencies across SG&A. For the full-year, operating margin was slightly ahead of expectations at 28.2%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Net interest and other adjusted non-operating expenses were $43 million in the quarter and $194 million for the full-year, and our adjusted tax rate was 15.8% the slightly more favorable tax rate was driven by discrete one-time items in the quarter, bringing our full-year tax rate to 16.3% and in line with overall expectations. Turning to cash and liquidity, we generated operating cash flows of $588 million and free cash flow totaled $447 million and we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $416 million. As Ivan mentioned earlier, we completed a $500 million share buyback program in early 2024, which is more than required to offset annual dilution. For the full-year, we generated operating cash flow of just under $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $979 million. Our balance sheet remains strong; leaving us continued financial flexibility and strategic optionality as we move forward. Now moving on to our financial outlook for 2024. Our outlook takes into account certain key assumptions, including pricing, which is expected to be about 100 basis points to 150 basis points of erosion, but it's a continued step change improvement from historical trends. We expect to see continued strength in our end markets in tandem with new product introductions and continued improvement in product supply. Against that backdrop, we expect 2024 constant currency revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including a foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 50 basis points, translating to reported growth of 4.5% to 5.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $8 to $8.15 representing reported growth of 6% to 8%. And currency is expected to have about an $0.08 headwind on EPS based on recent rates and the implementation of Pillar Two has an $0.18 or about a 250 basis points headwind on earnings per share growth for the year. This implies operating margin expansion of greater than 50 basis points at the EPS guidance mid-point when compared to 2023 We expect slightly lower year-over-year gross margins to be more than offset by efficiency and restructuring programs that were initiated in 2023. Net interest and other non-operating expenses are expected to be about $205 million and as previously discussed, our effective tax rate is expected to step up to 18% in conjunction with the implementation of Pillar Two. We expect to end the year with about 207 million shares outstanding lower than 2023 due to the $500 million share buyback plan that I've referenced earlier. Finally, we expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.1 billion, or growth of about 10% at the mid-point. As Ivan mentioned, we initiated a global restructuring program along with other cost savings initiatives in late 2023. These programs further streamline our organizational structure, shift select reporting lines, prioritize how we spend across the organization, and further evolve our operational footprint in order to simplify and maximize efficiency. This program is expected to result in total cash charges of about $125 million to $150 million over the next two years and deliver up to $200 million in run rate savings as we exit 2025, enabling us to invest in priority areas, while driving margin expansion and earnings leverage despite a meaningful step up in tax rate. In terms of cadence through the year, we expect constant currency revenue growth for the first half of the year to be at the lower end of the mid-single-digits, while the second half will be at the higher end of mid-single-digits. Also, quarterly results are expected to be choppy due to billing day impacts. Q1 will be about 150 basis point to 200 basis point headwind, Q2 and Q3 will be 150 basis point tailwind in each quarter and Q4 will be a 50 basis point tailwind. Full-year impact will be immaterial or less than 50 basis point tailwind. 2024 gross margin is expected to set down slightly versus 2023 due to lower FX hedge gains and the realization of capitalized third-party manufacturing cost increases observed in the second half of 2023. From a cadence standpoint, gross margin will be higher in the first half of the year. Additionally, because of the timing of the restructuring program, we expect operating margin will be higher in the second half than in the first half with Q4 being our high watermark followed by Q2. In summary, 2023 was another strong year for the company and we expect to maintain that momentum into 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri for the Q&A.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one brief follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: We'll go first to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Ivan, congratulations on a nice first year here as CEO. I'd love to ask about the 2024 guidance. Just talk about the key assumptions for the 5% to 6% constant currency growth in 2024. What you're assuming for the recon market. And Ivan, talk about your guidance philosophy. Have you incorporated any conservatism in the guidance? What would get you to the high end of the range? And just quickly, Suky, on the buyback, the $500 million, does that imply that it's hard to find good M&A targets? How should we interpret that? Thanks for taking the question.\nIvan Tornos: Hey, thank you, Larry. Always great to hear from you. So I'll take the first two parts and then Suky can talk about the rest. So embedded in the guidance for 2024, which we're very confident on the 5% to 6% is macro and micro reasons. So from a macro perspective, by now you heard from most of our peers, the markets are very healthy. We believe beyond the backlog, the markets are going to continue to be healthy. You got better patient demographics, younger patients; you got the dynamic of cases moving into an ASC. You got more days of surgery in the U.S. where it's not just two days you see in three days. You've seen shorter, better rehabilitation processes. I can go on and on, but the markets are very healthy. And then from a micro perspective, we got a cadence of new product launches. Most of them are going to be very meaningful as you hit the second semester of the year. We got three new product launches in hips early in 2024, which again will be more material later in the year. We launched in ROSA shoulder. We got a cadence of new product introductions in S.E.T. We're going to continue to increase or penetration in cementless and ROSA. So again, the combination of new product launches, great commercial execution, amplified by the healthier market dynamics, gives us confidence on a minimum 5% and a range of 5% to 6%. Relative to my philosophy when it comes to guidance is very basic. We make commitments and we don't miss them. So we study the different dynamics. We study where we're at. We know that operationally we're in a better place. We don't have the headwinds that we had in 2023 around supply and whatnot. So my guidance represents or exemplifies my philosophy of making commitments and delivering on those commitments. I'm not going to comment today on whether there is opportunities to beat and raise for the year. I just leave it at my philosophy is to make commitments and deliver commitments, and these are very well studied commitments. So with that, I'll pass it on to Suky for your second question.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Hey, good morning, Larry. Thanks for the question. I say, first of all, the $500 million share buyback; I think demonstrates our confidence in our outlook in the business. And the short answer to your question, does this imply some deterioration in M&A targets? And I would say absolutely not. I think based on where the company is from a firepower perspective; we feel that we've got the balance sheet strength and power as well as the forward-looking results. To really do both, we still will prioritize smart M&A as Ivan has talked about; we still favor tuck-in acquisitions to mid-size acquisitions. But even in the backdrop of doing heightened level of share buyback, we still see very significant M&A firepower to execute that strategy as well. So short answer again is no. We don't see this as any type of deterioration in targets.\nLarry Biegelsen: All right. Thanks for taking the question.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Larry. Yes, thanks so much. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: We'll go next to Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe start a little bit, Ivan or Suky on the knee performance in this quarter. It was a little bit below what we were expecting, still better than one of your competitors, but below another one on a two-year stack basis, it's not quite 50% of sales, but close to it. So I would anticipate that that's going to need to see very good performance here in 2024 in order to hit the guidance range, which I think is maybe being questioned a little bit this morning. So what is it there specifically between cementless, between robotic, between Persona IQ that gives you the confidence in the knee franchise outside of the macro environment here in 2024? And then I do have a quick follow-up.\nIvan Tornos: Thanks, Matt. So performance relative to the quarter, we're very pleased with the quarter. We perform in line with our expectations for knees and frankly for the entire business, and for the year, it was a solid year with a knees growing double-digit and the entire business growing 10.5% with nice EPS expansion. We really don't pay acute attention to what happens to one quarter. I know that it's our job to do that, but we just don't. The 60 to 62 working days in a quarter, all kinds of volatility, then you add comps. So when it comes to performance, we look to 8 to 12 quarters. And if you do run the analysis 8 to 12 quarters, you're talking about knees, but take a look at S.E.T. hips and whatnot, the performance is there. Speaking of volatility in Q4 for knees, we did see in the U.S. we did see some tons of orders. That impacted some of our largest IDNs here. We also had, let's remember, some tougher comps versus Q4 of 2022 particularly in the U.S. where we were 500 basis points ahead of our strongest competitor in knees. And again, if you look at Q3 that's a quarter where both the knees and hips we outperformed all competitors in the U.S. So again given all this volatility, all these ups and downs we just don't pay attention to one particular quarter. We look acutely at the trends and the trends do show that, 50 years later, we continue to be the number one player in knees and we continue to gain market share. Relative to the second part of your question around 2024, what gives us confidence around the guidance is the fact that we continue to see increases in cementless penetration. We continue to see increases in ROSA penetration. We have solved the backorder challenge that we had in this, which was a headwind for many periods in 2023. And we've seen this great commercial execution in the ASC. So we're very confident about where we are in knees and we are very confident around the acceleration in knees going into 2024.\nMatthew O'Brien: Appreciate that. Follow-up is just on there's a lot of good things coming this year as far as new products, et cetera. But you're trying to lower inventory levels significantly, 50 days of ton in this space. And then, the restructuring as well. Those -- how you factored in those potential headwinds in 2024 and even into 2025 in terms of potentially some lost revenues or dislocation you may suffer as a result? Thank you.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you. Well, let me just begin with a simple answer. Anything and everything we're doing, restructuring wise and inventory management wise is embedded in the guidance we give it. So that's part of that. In terms of inventory management or inventory reductions, we're going to be bold but not reckless. So we're not reducing inventories in the key categories. We actually are making sure that inventory is what it needs to be for those key brands, whether it's Persona, whether it's the key components in hip, whether it is the key components in S.E.T. This is a lot of the leftover from the integration that we didn't do. So the inventory reduction is going to be in non-critical areas, frankly, in non-critical countries. So again, we're doing this thoughtfully. In terms of the restructuring, the reductions that we announced this morning, these are happening in back office. I will tell you virtually all reductions are non-customer facing. And again, the changes we make in inventory and people are embedded in the guidance that we're giving.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Matt. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to ask on S.E.T. and other. Those were the two line items that beat versus the Street. Was just hoping you could breakout some of the trends there, what did well, what might have underperformed, if anything, and how we think about those different line items as part of the guide in 2024 and how much of the strong growth is coming from that versus hips and knees. Thanks.\nIvan Tornos: Hey, thank you, Robbie. So solid quarter for S.E.T. frankly, solid last semester of 2023 for S.E.T. growing around mid-single-digit, around 5%, and committing to growing mid-single-digit or above in 2024. The key drivers are the use of suspects. We continue to do really well with upper extremities growing upper single-digit, double-digit in most geographies, that's new product launches, that's focusing the ASC, that's stable supply, just great commercial execution. Our CMFT business, craniomaxillofacial thoracic, continues to do really well. We call that we did two, three acquisitions over the last three years, and those continue to do really well. And again, CMFT is a business where we see upper single-digit, double-digit. We finally stabilize our restorative therapies business here in the U.S. Recall that we had some reimbursement challenges there, and those are behind. So you've seen the biologics restorative therapy business growing at a nice clip now. And then sports med, we've done some acquisitions. We have had some challenges, but that continues to perform in line with expectations. So I will tell you, Robbie, out of the six businesses within the category, four are going really well. Trauma put an ankle; we got some work to do. We got some decisions, some strategic considerations to make. As we enter 2024, mid-single-digit is the point of entry. This has to be the year where we see S.E.T. growing mid-single-digit. Frankly, in some geographies, I think it's going to be higher than that. We got the innovation; we got the investments in terms of dedicated infrastructure and specialization, heavy emphasis here in the U.S., in the ASC environment. So again, full confidence in the growth profile that we're going to see moving forward.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up for Suky on the guidance and a clarification. The lower end of mid-single-digit in the first half and then higher end second half. Is that inclusive or exclusive of the selling day benefit? Thanks.\nSuky Upadhyay: That is inclusive of the selling day benefit, Robbie.\nRobbie Marcus: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nIvan Tornos: Yes.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Robbie. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: Excuse me. Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Putting them both right up front. I'm curious why gross margins are expected to be somewhat down year-over-year, what the dynamics are for that? And then my second question has to do with cementless. Can you walk us through the math of what you think moving to 50% to 60% of your knees being cemented or cementless, excuse me, either way 50%. What the benefit is of that? Thank you.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Hey, Joanne, it's Suky. I'll start with the gross margin one and then pass it over to Ivan on cementless. Overall, we had a really good year on gross margin in 2023, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Drivers of that are really around we had some FX hedge gains, which we had talked about at length throughout 2023, as well as improved mix and better pricing, still, pricing erosive year-over-year, but better than we expected. Overall, generated a pretty nice profile for 2023. We had previously communicated that we had thought that gross margins might dip down slightly into 2024, primarily driven by the loss of those FX hedge gains. They won't repeat at the same level in 2024 as they did in 2023, but also we're seeing in the capitalization of some increased costs in the back end of 2023, around third-party manufacturing, which will feather into the P&L towards the back end of 2024. Despite those two headwinds, we're able to offset a large component of that, but overall, we do expect to see gross margins down just slightly ZBH-009 restructuring, the reductions that we announced this morning, these are happening in back office. I will tell you virtually all reductions are non-customer facing. And again, the changes we make in inventory and people are embedded in the guidance that we're giving.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Matt. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.

Thanks.\nIvan Tornos: Hey, thank you, Robbie. So solid quarter for S.E.T. frankly, solid last semester of 2023 for S.E.T. growing around mid-single digit, around 5%, and committing to growing mid-single digit or above in 2024.

Putting them both right up front. I'm curious why gross margins are expected to be somewhat down year-over-year, what the dynamics are for that? And then my second question has to do with cementless. Can you walk us through the math of what you think moving to 50% to 60% of your knees being cemented or cementless, excuse me, either way 50%. What the benefit is of that? Thank you.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Hey, Joanne, it\u2019s Suky. I'll start with the gross margin one and then pass it over to Ivan on cementless. Overall, we had a really good year on gross margin in 2023, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Drivers of that are really around we had some FX hedge gains, which we had talked about at length throughout 2023, as well as improved mix and better pricing. Still, pricing erosive year-over-year, but better than we expected. Overall, generated a pretty nice profile for 2023.  We had previously communicated that we had thought that gross margins might dip down slightly into 2024, primarily driven by the loss of those FX hedge gains. They won't repeat at the same level in 2024 as they did in 2023, but also we're seeing in the capitalization of some increased costs in the back end of 2023, around third-party manufacturing, which will feather into the P&L towards the back end of 2024. Despite those two headwinds, we're able to offset a large component of that, but overall, we do expect to see gross margins down just slightly versus 2023 in the backdrop of those headwinds. Now, having said that, if you take the mid-point of our EPS guidance, I think that would back you into an implied operating margin of about 29%, which represents about an 80 basis point increase year-over-year. And so while gross margin may set down slightly, you are seeing operating margins increase as we drive better efficiency and revenue growth through the company. So again, there are a lot of puts and calls throughout the P&L. The great thing is we've got optionality where we see headwinds in one area. We can make that up with efficiency and tailwinds in other areas. I think you've seen that now, once we deliver 2024 three years in a row, which in a challenging environment, in all three years, we're able to continue to grow operating margin and operating earnings. But thanks for the question.\nIvan Tornos: And Joanne, relative to your question on cementless, I'll give you as much as I can. So, starting with the basic pricing dynamics we see with cementless Persona OsseoTi, we see an ASC uplift of around 10% to 15%, frankly closer to the 15% than the 10%, around 40% to 50% of the time, we combo the cementless knee with robotics, with ROSA, and that drives additional uplifting revenue in the form of disposals and whatnot. So that's a great dynamic we see in particular in the ASC. Our penetration today on cementless, we're exiting 2023 somewhere near 18% to 20% with both expectations; excuse me, to get into the 50% to 60% range. And I'm not going to give you a commitment today, but at our Analyst Day, you will see the long range plans and some of the trending when it comes to getting to 60%. We believe that there's going to be a fairly quick uplift, given the fact that the market is already being developed by some of the work that our peers have done. So again, you should not expect that getting to 50% to 60% is going to be a long journey. All of these dynamics are in the U.S. We're launching in 2024 in other markets outside of the U.S., and I will disclose the pricing dynamics when the time is right. But excited about the launch in Japan in 2024 and other key markets. So those are the dynamics here when it comes to cementless.\nJoanne Wuensch: Thank you very much.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Joanne. Yes, absolutely. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Following-up, maybe on Larry's questions about guidance, you talked about the WAMGR being at 4%, and clearly we're in this stronger market environment. And so as I think about the components of guidance with pricing as a headwind of 100, 150 basis points, it suggests product mix is going to contribute 200 basis points to 300 basis points. I just want to see one if that's how you're thinking about it, or if you're thinking about the market contribution to guidance at a higher rate in 2024 and maybe potentially the product mix contribution lower. Maybe just help us flush a little that out.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, I'll try to simplify it. And Suky, by all means elaborate, but we believe the market is around 4% all in. And again, we model this in different ways, but let's call it 4%. I'm not going to quantify the new product contribution, but pretty significant. We got 40 new products getting launched in the next two years, and these are meaningful products. I mentioned we got three large hip products that are going to get launched early in 2024. We got ROSA shoulder, which we believe is going to be meaningful in the year 2024, given the fact that it's not a late year launch. We got a lot of products in the S.E.T. category. So again, you should think of new product introductions as a very meaningful contributor of the guidance. Add to that the fact that we don't have the headwinds that we had in 2023 when it comes to supply, I would say between number one and number two; we got confidence on where we're going. Beyond that, we don't see a headwind when it comes to the shift to the ASC. We actually see that as a tailwind. We're excited about some of the dynamics we're hearing about when it comes to the movement of shoulders into the ASC. That's going to be a contributor. And as I mentioned to Joanne, the uplift that we see on cementless and ROSA, which are products that we launched three years ago but now going to get accelerated are the main contributors to the confidence in the guidance. I don't know, Suky, you have anything else here?\nSuky Upadhyay: I think that's well said. One of the key points Ivan you touched upon, you said, pricing erosion is assumed in that 4% uplift.\nRyan Zimmerman: Right. Okay. That's helpful from both of you. And then just to kind of dovetail on Joanne's question around margins, you talk about gross margin, Suky. Clearly operating margins are doing more heavy lifting this year. And so how much from the restructuring program is benefiting, is driving some of that operating margin expansion? How much are you assuming for top-line leverage in that 80 basis points or so of expansion? And yes, that's about it. Thanks for taking the question.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. So the key driver with gross margin being sort of flat to down slightly, it really is coming from revenue leverage and operating margin. You could expect overall OpEx as a percentage of sales to drop by about 100 basis points, give or take. And that's even with R&D increasing year-over-year. So the efficiency and the restructuring programs in the near-term are really focused on SG&A. However, inside of that full program, we are working on things inside of COGS to help maintain and keep gross margin stable over time. Those are going to be a little bit more mid-term in nature and how they get realized. Things like SKU rationalization, site optimization, inventory reductions and corresponding D&O reductions, those are all things that have a little bit longer lead time, naturally, as you can expect as you're moving your supply chain around and not wanting to disrupt the ability to supply demand. But they are definitely is going to take more of a prominence as we move forward beyond 2024. But for 2024, the way you characterize is right. It's primarily revenue driven and SG&A.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks for the question, Ryan. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: We'll go next to Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I want to ask about the $200 million in cost savings that you guys called out this year. Curious, is the plan for that to kind of drop through to the bottom line or are you going to reinvest that? And what does that mean for kind of margins beyond this year and longer-term?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. So the way we characterized it was that it would be $200 million run rate as we exit 2025. In year for 2024, we expect that to be about $100 million, or about half of the run rate savings that we're predicting over a two-year period. We're dropping a lot of that to the bottom line, as you can see with our implied guidance at the mid-point would suggest about an 80 basis point increase in operating margins. And so we're actually taking a good portion of that, dropping it to the bottom. But we're also reinvesting a pretty significant portion back into our priority areas, ensuring that we've got the appropriate amount of sets and instruments for cementless uptake as well as Persona uptake through ROSA. Ensuring that we've got the right level of commercialization and execution in our new ROSA shoulder launch, ensuring and ramping up commercialization efforts in our hip franchise around the product launches that we have for hip. So it really is a combination of both. And that's the great thing about this efficiency program. It enables us to reinvest back into our priority areas while dropping pretty significant, substantial margin expansion now, for the third year in a row.\nTravis Steed: Yes. Helpful. And on the new comp plan that you called out, curious if that's going to have an impact on margins or just not material enough to impact margins. And then on M&A, just curious if there's been any change on the two years of EPS solution from M&A.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. On the comp plan, it's not really going to have any material impact and it's embedded in our guidance. I think it's more about a mix shift of how that comp plan is designed, right, whereas previously it was more focused and biased towards revenue growth. I think now what we're trying to do is get a greater balance between top and bottom lines all the way through cash flow. So it's really a mix shift in how we think about comp versus an increase in comp. And again, all of that is embedded into our guidance for 2024. Relative to the dilution, we still think about two years from a dilution standpoint is reasonable. Of course, we'd like it to be inside of that. But just given where valuations are today, as well as the cost of debt, which hopefully is going to come down over time, that's kind of where we see one of our guard reps.\nTravis Steed: Great. Helpful. Thanks a lot.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Travis. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Ivan, maybe you mentioned in passing that shoulder for ROSA is not going to be a late year 2024 launch. Just could you dial in that timing anymore? And I'd be interested in hearing about kind of your view on the uptake of ROSA shoulder, obviously, shoulder surgeries, replacements, technically more challenging. I think some questions about what role robots can initially play in those procedures. So just how does that help the uptake of ROSA? And I don't think I heard a ROSA placement number. I think sometimes you give it on kind of an annualized basis. Any updates on kind of exiting 2023 where ROSA placements were? Thanks.\nIvan Tornos: Hey, thank you, Jeff. So I got to be careful what I say about time lapse for ROSA shoulder. I'll just say that I'm very confident that this is not a late 2024 launch. And as I mentioned, I think it's going to be very meaningful. So beyond being first to market, it's a high quality product. It's going to be applicable for both reverse and anatomic surgeries. It's going to simplify a very complex procedure. It's going to be fully integrated with the rest of the shoulder CVH ecosystem. I believe it's going to get great traction in an ASC environment where speed and accuracy matters. And we're going to hopefully demo these next week at the academy meeting. Whether it's ready or not, it will be demoed there at the academy meeting. Relative to your second question on the ROSA placements and the numbers, you should expect us to do around 300 installations per year. You should expect us to drive penetration rates of minimum 5% to 7% at least per year. You should expect that one-third of these ROSA -- overall ROSA installations are going to go into an ASC environment. And as I mentioned earlier to Joanne, you should expect that in a large percentage of cases, these ROSA installations are going to push cementless. So again, great momentum with ROSA and I'm very excited about where we are with shoulder.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. And maybe as a follow-up, just as I think about the 5% to 6% constant currency guidance and 100, 200 basis points above market, it seems like market is settling in at a good rate. If I think about gross margin, obviously some of the hedge settlements should normalize as you get into 2025 P&L coming down, pricing getting less bad. So it sounds like gross margin, at least not a big, big headwind going forward. And then of course, you've got the cost savings initiatives here on the SG&A side. If I roll all that together, including the improving balance sheet and cash flow and a commitment to some share buyback, it feels like 10%, 10.5% EPS growth, which is kind of the mid-point of your guidance this year. If it weren't for tax rate and FX headwinds, that sounds like it could be a sustainable kind of target. I'm sure you don't want to lay out an LRP here out of your Analyst Day, but is there anything in my thinking there that would say 10%-ish plus or minus is not a reasonable kind of longer-term EPS growth rate to be thinking about. Thank you.\nSuky Upadhyay: Hey, Jeff. I think that was actually a really good articulation and summarization of what we're trying to get across today. In fact, if you look at our guidance today on reported EPS, it would suggest 6% to 8% at both ends of the range. That's after overcoming about 400 basis points of headwind between non-operational things like interest expense, FX and tax rate, right. So again, that's about a 400 basis point drag that's embedded in that 6% to 8%. So the way you're thinking about it, could we be in that low-double-digit zip code on EPS in a sustainable, durable way? I think yes.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks for the questions, Jeff. Katie, do you have another question in the queue?\nOperator: We'll go next for Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.\nRichard Newitter: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just with AAOS next week, I was wondering anything that we should be on the lookout for with respect to canary or paternal few rather, and data presentations. I think you had also mentioned on a prior call you were expecting a GLP-1 kind of data analysis, possibly at AAOS and then I have follow-up.\nIvan Tornos: So the answer is yes to both, Richard. So we will have some data points on Persona IQ, and we'll have some data on GLP-1. On Persona IQ, we moved from a limited market release in 2023 to full market release in 2024. We got the value proposition finalized. We got over 2 billion data points. We understand there's a product that is going to enable clinicians to intervene when needed. We got data points on how this product will reduce overall complexity in the episode of care. How we can by intervening soon reduce cost, especially post-surgery, when it can be pretty taxing. We don't reimbursement. We spoke about the NTAP new technology add-on payment, which we got back in October. So that's in full launch mode. We will submit. Barry always asks me this question. We will submit for a PPT coming some point in the spring, summer, and we're going to bring some data around, some of the experiences that we've seen with Persona IQ at the Cleveland Clinic, HSS and other facilities. So excited in terms of what we have with Persona IQ, more to come at the academy. And then for GLP-1s, yes, we're going to be sharing some of the data we've done in conjunction with the academy. And what I will tell you is that so far, everything we've seen with GLP-1s is that it remains a tailwind. We're actually tracking the number of patients that are using a GLP-1 pre-surgery, and that number is in the 20% to 30%. So by all means, this is not a headwind, and I'm glad that conversation is being muted.\nRichard Newitter: Great. And then just piggybacking off of Jeff's question, even with potential earnings dilution, if you're potentially going to be -- have the potential to be in a low-double digits or 10 plus earnings growth range, and I'm given your commitment to growing earnings faster than the top-line, where it sounds like 5% is kind of a sustainable floor, given your end market and your WAMGR it sounds like no matter what, even with dilution over a 1.5, two-year period, you feel confident, or we should feel confident in a high-single-digit earnings growth rate at worst. Is that also a reasonable assumption based on all the different commitments and commentary that you provided?\nIvan Tornos: Well, I think what you're asking is, can you still sustain that in a world where you do a sizable M&A a transaction? If I've gotten that correct, that's really difficult to tell, right? There is no two deals are created equal. It's very situational. And so I don't want to get out there front footed to kind of hypothesize, theoretically, what could happen to EPS inside of a sort of make a new [ph] deal. So I think that what you should take away is that from an underlying perspective, at 5% to 6% organic growth, with the levers that we have operationally, but also with the strength of our balance sheet organically, that we can deliver that attractive earnings per share profile.\nRichard Newitter: Okay.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Rich. Katie, I think we have time for one more question if there's one in the queue.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Mr. Bedford, your line is open. Please go ahead. Please check your mute function.\nJayson Bedford: Oh, sorry, I was off. Yes, sorry about that. I'll be quick. On the supply challenges that you incurred in 2023, can you just remind me what was the impact of these challenges on the P&L last year meaning, is there a way to quantify the impact on revenue?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Hey, Jayson, it's Suky. It's a bit of more stress to try and say exactly how days on backwater really impact sales, because one, obviously you have an impact on actual cases, but the more meaningful impact is the ability for our sales rep to go out there and actually hunt for new business, right? They're going to be a little bit hesitant to go shift and make conversions if they don't feel like they can supply. So that's actually probably the bigger impact. But trying to frame that in percentage points is very difficult to do. The way I looked at it is the tailwind for last year. We believe it's part of the -- sorry, it was a headwind for last year, we believe it's part of the tailwind that's going to help give us confidence in delivering that 5% to 6% organic growth for this year.\nIvan Tornos: Yes. We have some internal data points that we don't share. What I will tell you, Jayson is that new product launches, we had to do limited market releases instead of full market releases, Persona OsseoTi is an example. Conversion, as Suky mentioned, we had to prioritize or send some family customers versus converting accounts. And then the third headwind of supply, from a revenue perspective, we couldn't embark on global expansion of these new product launches. So the example that I used earlier around Japan, second largest market in the world, we could have done things differently. We could have been on the market. So it is sizable and it is behind us.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just along a similar vein, I think you talked about a 50 basis point impact to revenue growth in the second half from Russia. Is Russia a net tailwind as we look to 2024?\nSuky Upadhyay: It is. It is. I would say it's less than 50 basis points. But given that we now have all the licenses secured we need to operate, that that will be a tailwind probably most pronounced in the third quarter because that's when we saw the biggest impact in 2023.\nJayson Bedford: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks for the questions, Jayson. I think we're wrapped up with the queue and just hitting 9:30. So I'll turn it over to Ivan for some closing remarks.\nIvan Tornos: Sure. Thanks, Keri. I'll keep it short. I know we got to get going here, so a minute or less. I want to start, I want to end the way that I started the call by thanking the team members, the almost 20,000 team members here at Zimmer Biomet who are doing a remarkable job in executing the plans that we lay forward. So grew 7.5% constant currency in 2023 with a nice EPS expansion of 200 basis points that's after growing 6.6% in 2022. And now we're committing to at least 5% revenue growth, 5.5% mid-point with nice EPS expansion and double-digit growth in free cash flow. So very proud of the work that team members are doing. And we're very excited about 2024. We are moving from remediation to -- we have moved from remediation to innovation. I'm excited about the pipeline of products. I'm excited about the financial profile that we commit into or growing EPS faster than revenue and free cash flow faster than EPS. And so far during the year, everything that we're seeing gives us confidence, or confidence that it's going to be a very solid year for Zimmer Biomet. So thank you for your attention this morning, and thank you, team members at Zimmer Biomet.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, our fourth quarter results ended a successful year for Zimmer Biomet, with full-year constant currency revenue growing 7.5% and adjusted earnings growing more than 9.5% on reported basis, while generating just under $1 billion in free cash flow. Inside of that, our business segments performed well for the year. Global knees constant currency growth of over 10%, hips growth of 5%, and S.E.T. growth of almost 4%, all while also expanding adjusted operating margin by almost 100 basis points, the second consecutive year of operating margin expansion in a challenging environment. Also, as previously guided, we closed the second half of 2023 with mid-single-digit revenue growth and levered earnings growth, a profile we expect to continue moving forward. Let's dive into the fourth quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter of 2023 and how it compares to the same period in 2022, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.94 billion, an increase of 6.3% on a reported basis and an increase of 6.1% on a constant currency basis. We had a selling day tailwind of about 100 basis points in the quarter. U.S. growth was 4.4% and international growth was 8.7%. As expected, we saw a robust sequential step up versus the third quarter across all regions. Global knees grew 5.6% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 5.4% and international growing 5.8%. The knee business continues to be driven by our Persona product portfolio combined with our ROSA robotics platform, and we remain excited about the positive feedback around our recently launched cementless form factor for Persona OsseoTi. For the full-year, global knees grew 10.2%. Global hips grew 3.6% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 4% and international growing 3.2%. We are eager to accelerate performance of this segment with the addition of multiple new product offerings in 2024. For the full-year, global hips grew 5.1%. Next, the S.E.T. category grew 6.4% in the quarter, with our key focus areas of sports, CMFT and upper extremities all growing in the mid-single-digit to low-double-digit range. The strong growth in these focus areas was partially offset by other sub segments within the category. For the full-year, S.E.T. grew 3.8%, including a step up to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. Finally, our other category grew 15.9% in the quarter, driven by another strong quarter of global ROSA sales. Now moving to the P&L. In Q4, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.01 compared to GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.62 in the prior year. The increase in GAAP results was driven by higher revenue, a goodwill impairment charge in 2022 that did not repeat favorable one-time tax benefits in 2023, and a lower share count. The details around our financial performance can be found in today's press release. On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $2.20 compared to $1.88 in the prior year, representing year-over-year reported growth of 17%. The step up is driven by revenue growth, better gross margins, lower OpEx margin in tandem with a lower tax rate. Our adjusted gross margin was 72.5%, up 80 basis points from the prior year, driven by favorable mix, higher volumes and lower royalties. And for the full-year we came in slightly above expectations, representing 90 basis points of year-over-year expansion. Adjusted operating margin was 30.3%, up 200 basis points from the prior year. The year-over-year operating margin step up was primarily driven by revenue leverage, better gross margin and realized efficiencies across SG&A. For the full-year, operating margin was slightly ahead of expectations at 28.2%, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Net interest and other adjusted non-operating expenses were $43 million in the quarter and $194 million for the full-year, and our adjusted tax rate was 15.8% the slightly more favorable tax rate was driven by discrete one-time items in the quarter, bringing our full-year tax rate to 16.3% and in line with overall expectations. Turning to cash and liquidity, we generated operating cash flows of $588 million and free cash flow totaled $447 million and we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents totaling $416 million. As Ivan mentioned earlier, we completed a $500 million share buyback program in early 2024, which is more than required to offset annual dilution. For the full-year, we generated operating cash flow of just under $1.6 billion and free cash flow of $979 million. Our balance sheet remains strong; leaving us continued financial flexibility and strategic optionality as we move forward. Now moving on to our financial outlook for 2024. Our outlook takes into account certain key assumptions, including pricing, which is expected to be about 100 basis points to 150 basis points of erosion, but it's a continued step change improvement from historical trends. We expect to see continued strength in our end markets in tandem with new product introductions and continued improvement in product supply. Against that backdrop, we expect 2024 constant currency revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including a foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 50 basis points, translating to reported growth of 4.5% to 5.5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $8 to $8.15 representing reported growth of 6% to 8%. And currency is expected to have about an $0.08 headwind on EPS based on recent rates and the implementation of Pillar Two has an $0.18 or about a 250 basis points headwind on earnings per share growth for the year. This implies operating margin expansion of greater than 50 basis points at the EPS guidance mid-point when compared to 2023 We expect slightly lower year-over-year gross margins to be more than offset by efficiency and restructuring programs that were initiated in 2023. Net interest and other non-operating expenses are expected to be about $205 million and as previously discussed, our effective tax rate is expected to step up to 18% in conjunction with the implementation of Pillar Two. We expect to end the year with about 207 million shares outstanding lower than 2023 due to the $500 million share buyback plan that I've referenced earlier. Finally, we expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.1 billion, or growth of about 10% at the mid-point. As Ivan mentioned, we initiated a global restructuring program along with other cost savings initiatives in late 2023. These programs further streamline our organizational structure, shift select reporting lines, prioritize how we spend across the organization, and further evolve our operational footprint in order to simplify and maximize efficiency. This program is expected to result in total cash charges of about $125 million to $150 million over the next two years and deliver up to $200 million in run rate savings as we exit 2025, enabling us to invest in priority areas, while driving margin expansion and earnings leverage despite a meaningful step up in tax rate. In terms of cadence through the year, we expect constant currency revenue growth for the first half of the year to be at the lower end of the mid-single-digits, while the second half will be at the higher end of mid-single-digits. Also, quarterly results are expected to be choppy due to billing day impacts. Q1 will be about 150 basis point to 200 basis point headwind, Q2 and Q3 will be 150 basis point tailwind in each quarter and Q4 will be a 50 basis point tailwind. Full-year impact will be immaterial or less than 50 basis point tailwind. 2024 gross margin is expected to set down slightly versus 2023 due to lower FX hedge gains and the realization of capitalized third-party manufacturing cost increases observed in the second half of 2023. From a cadence standpoint, gross margin will be higher in the first half of the year. Additionally, because of the timing of the restructuring program, we expect operating margin will be higher in the second half than in the first half with Q4 being our high watermark followed by Q2. In summary, 2023 was another strong year for the company and we expect to maintain that momentum into 2024 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri for the Q&A. Yes. Hey, good morning, Larry. Thanks for the question. I say, first of all, the $500 million share buyback; I think demonstrates our confidence in our outlook in the business. And the short answer to your question, does this imply some deterioration in M&A targets? And I would say absolutely not. I think based on where the company is from a firepower perspective; we feel that we've got the balance sheet strength and power as well as the forward-looking results. To really do both, we still will prioritize smart M&A as Ivan has talked about; we still favor tuck-in acquisitions to mid-size acquisitions. But even in the backdrop of doing heightened level of share buyback, we still see very significant M&A firepower to execute that strategy as well. So short answer again is no. We don't see this as any type of deterioration in targets. That is inclusive of the selling day benefit, Robbie. Yes. Hey, Joanne, it's Suky. I'll start with the gross margin one and then pass it over to Ivan on cementless. Overall, we had a really good year on gross margin in 2023, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Drivers of that are really around we had some FX hedge gains, which we had talked about at length throughout 2023, as well as improved mix and better pricing, still, pricing erosive year-over-year, but better than we expected. Overall, generated a pretty nice profile for 2023. We had previously communicated that we had thought that gross margins might dip down slightly into 2024, primarily driven by the loss of those FX hedge gains. They won't repeat at the same level in 2024 as they did in 2023, but also we're seeing in the capitalization of some increased costs in the back end of 2023, around third-party manufacturing, which will feather into the P&L towards the back end of 2024. Despite those two headwinds, we're able to offset a large component of that, but overall, we do expect to see gross margins down just slightly ZBH-009 restructuring, the reductions that we announced this morning, these are happening in back office. I will tell you virtually all reductions are non-customer facing. And again, the changes we make in inventory and people are embedded in the guidance that we're giving. That is inclusive of the selling day benefit, Robbie. Yes. Hey, Joanne, it's Suky. I'll start with the gross margin one and then pass it over to Ivan on cementless. Overall, we had a really good year on gross margin in 2023, up 90 basis points year-over-year. Drivers of that are really around we had some FX hedge gains, which we had talked about at length throughout 2023, as well as improved mix and better pricing. Still, pricing erosive year-over-year, but better than we expected. Overall, generated a pretty nice profile for 2023.  We had previously communicated that we had thought that gross margins might dip down slightly into 2024, primarily driven by the loss of those FX hedge gains. They won't repeat at the same level in 2024 as they did in 2023, but also we're seeing in the capitalization of some increased costs in the back end of 2023, around third-party manufacturing, which will feather into the P&L towards the back end of 2024. Despite those two headwinds, we're able to offset a large component of that, but overall, we do expect to see gross margins down just slightly versus 2023 in the backdrop of those headwinds. Now, having said that, if you take the mid-point of our EPS guidance, I think that would back you into an implied operating margin of about 29%, which represents about an 80 basis point increase year-over-year. And so while gross margin may set down slightly, you are seeing operating margins increase as we drive better efficiency and revenue growth through the company. So again, there are a lot of puts and calls throughout the P&L. The great thing is we've got optionality where we see headwinds in one area. We can make that up with efficiency and tailwinds in other areas. I think you've seen that now, once we deliver 2024 three years in a row, which in a challenging environment, in all three years, we're able to continue to grow operating margin and operating earnings. But thanks for the question. I think that's well said. One of the key points Ivan you touched upon, you said, pricing erosion is assumed in that 4% uplift. Yes. So the key driver with gross margin being sort of flat to down slightly, it really is coming from revenue leverage and operating margin. You could expect overall OpEx as a percentage of sales to drop by about 100 basis points, give or take. And that's even with R&D increasing year-over-year. So the efficiency and the restructuring programs in the near-term are really focused on SG&A. However, inside of that full program, we are working on things inside of COGS to help maintain and keep gross margin stable over time. Those are going to be a little bit more mid-term in nature and how they get realized. Things like SKU rationalization, site optimization, inventory reductions and corresponding D&O reductions, those are all things that have a little bit longer lead time, naturally, as you can expect as you're moving your supply chain around and not wanting to disrupt the ability to supply demand. But they are definitely is going to take more of a prominence as we move forward beyond 2024. But for 2024, the way you characterize is right. It's primarily revenue driven and SG&A. Yes. Yes. So the way we characterized it was that it would be $200 million run rate as we exit 2025. In year for 2024, we expect that to be about $100 million, or about half of the run rate savings that we're predicting over a two-year period. We're dropping a lot of that to the bottom line, as you can see with our implied guidance at the mid-point would suggest about an 80 basis point increase in operating margins. And so we're actually taking a good portion of that, dropping it to the bottom. But we're also reinvesting a pretty significant portion back into our priority areas, ensuring that we've got the appropriate amount of sets and instruments for cementless uptake as well as Persona uptake through ROSA. Ensuring that we've got the right level of commercialization and execution in our new ROSA shoulder launch, ensuring and ramping up commercialization efforts in our hip franchise around the product launches that we have for hip. So it really is a combination of both. And that's the great thing about this efficiency program. It enables us to reinvest back into our priority areas while dropping pretty significant, substantial margin expansion now, for the third year in a row. Yes. On the comp plan, it's not really going to have any material impact and it's embedded in our guidance. I think it's more about a mix shift of how that comp plan is designed, right, whereas previously it was more focused and biased towards revenue growth. I think now what we're trying to do is get a greater balance between top and bottom lines all the way through cash flow. So it's really a mix shift in how we think about comp versus an increase in comp. And again, all of that is embedded into our guidance for 2024. Relative to the dilution, we still think about two years from a dilution standpoint is reasonable. Of course, we'd like it to be inside of that. But just given where valuations are today, as well as the cost of debt, which hopefully is going to come down over time, that's kind of where we see one of our guard reps. Yes. Hey, Jeff. I think that was actually a really good articulation and summarization of what we're trying to get across today. In fact, if you look at our guidance today on reported EPS, it would suggest 6% to 8% at both ends of the range. That's after overcoming about 400 basis points of headwind between non-operational things like interest expense, FX and tax rate, right. So again, that's about a 400 basis point drag that's embedded in that 6% to 8%. So the way you're thinking about it, could we be in that low-double-digit zip code on EPS in a sustainable, durable way? I think yes. Yes. Hey, Jayson, it's Suky. It's a bit of more stress to try and say exactly how days on backwater really impact sales, because one, obviously you have an impact on actual cases, but the more meaningful impact is the ability for our sales rep to go out there and actually hunt for new business, right? They're going to be a little bit hesitant to go shift and make conversions if they don't feel like they can supply. So that's actually probably the bigger impact. But trying to frame that in percentage points is very difficult to do. The way I looked at it is the tailwind for last year. We believe it's part of the -- sorry, it was a headwind for last year, we believe it's part of the tailwind that's going to help give us confidence in delivering that 5% to 6% organic growth for this year. It is. It is. I would say it's less than 50 basis points. But given that we now have all the licenses secured we need to operate, that that will be a tailwind probably most pronounced in the third quarter because that's when we saw the biggest impact in 2023."

            "name": "Ivan Tornos",
            "content": "Hey, thank you, Keri, and thanks, everyone for joining the call here this morning. I like to start the way that I typically do, taking a moment to recognize, to show my gratitude to the almost 20,000 Zimmer Biomet team members for their dedication, for their commitment, for their strong resilience, and for their superb performance in 2023. Simply put, 2023 was just a great year for our company and I want to say thank you. In 2023, we impacted the lives of almost 4 million patients and along the way we deliver best-in-class financial performance, growing our constant currency revenue by 7.5% while adjusted EPS earnings per share grew almost 9.5% in the year. That's 200 basis points of leverage between the 7.5% revenue growth and the 9.5% growth in EPS. In the year, we generated almost $1 billion in free cash flow, and that's with some turbulence around inventory management and whatnot. So again, strong performance top to bottom. And I'm just very, very proud of the execution in the year. It's worth noting that, that this level of execution and performance came in a year in which we still had to deal with fairly complex micro issues, whether it's inflation, FX, geopolitical challenges. I don't think I need to talk much about that and also some micro challenges in the year. We did struggle with some supply challenges throughout some of the periods. I'm happy that's behind, but it was a headwind in many periods in 2023. And again delivering 7.5% in 2023 against some top comparables, having grown constant currency revenue in 2022 the year before by 6.6%, so clearly a great trend in the making, clearly strong performance, and I'm just so grateful and so proud of all of you, the Zimmer Biomet team. At the same time, beyond grateful, I'm truly excited as I know that this is just the very beginning when it comes to the level of performance that we can realize here at Zimmer Biomet and multiple drivers of why I'm confident that this is just the very beginning. But I'll start with highlighting the bold pipeline that we have in place. The size of our pipeline is twice what it used to be in 2018. We got great new product launches that are happening here early in 2024. We have a stable supply, we've created an stable supply environment and we got great commercial execution. We're developing flawless commercial execution as evidenced by these growth rates that I just highlighted. To compound our belief behind this level of examine ahead is the fact that we have seen and we continue to see a substantial improvement in our end markets. This is not the same market growth profile that we used to have. Pacing demand is strong, procedure volume is very strong, given a variety of reasons and as the market leader in both knees and hips, being in better markets is just very exciting as we enter 2024. Back five years ago, when I joined the company, we used to think of for WAMGR weighted average market growth rates as being somewhere in the 3% range. And today, we PEG or WAMGR as being very near, if not at 4%. And again, that's a meaningful increase and we believe it's sustainable. So we're not going back to the 3% days when it comes to market growth rates. So again, internal and external dynamics gives me, gives us confidence that the best is truly ahead. When you add to all of these variables, the fact that we have the strongest balance sheet in the history of the company, there is no doubt then that we can claim that our future is nothing short of truly bright. So again, very pleased, very proud and very confident. I'd like to thank our investors as well for their support in 2023 and for their confidence in 2024 and beyond. We continue to take biggest strides forward toward being a company with a very different growth profile from top to bottom. Committing to an expectation to grow at least 100 basis points to 200 basis points above marketing revenue, with our EPS, with our earnings per share, growing faster than revenue, and our free cash flow dollars growing faster than EPS. The guidance that we are providing today for 2024 already reflect such a commitment to this type of financial discipline. And I'm very much looking forward to our Analyst Day on May 29 in when we will provide additional details in terms of our long range plan, which will illustrate that this is not a one-year wonder, this is a multi-year commitment. And you will see then that Zimmer Biomet has truly entered our growth stage era. We're no longer in turnaround mode. We're ready to deliver by being laser-focused on the three strategic imperatives that I highlighted during my very first earnings call as CEO back in November, three strategic imperatives that I continue to repeat over and over at every Zimmer Biomet meeting. And frankly, I will continue to repeat because those are the three drivers that we know are going to drive our performance. Those being number one, people and culture; number two, operational excellence; and number three, innovation and diversification. So let's talk about our 2024 commitments, how different initiatives across these three strategic imperatives will drive our growth forward. First in the area of people and culture, and again, I've explained this in the past, what it means, it's about having the right people in the right roles within the right culture. We must make sure that we support team members to act as owners and operators of the business. This means decentralizing decision making, driving agility, and empowering team members at every level, across every function around the world. We must become leaner; we got to be closer to the customer. Equally important, we must truly live an environment of pay for performance. This is something that has already kicked off in a very meaningful way in the fiscal year -- in this fiscal year 2024. An example of that is the fact that we're incentivizing free cash flow dollar generation or growth in a much more disciplined way across the enterprise knowing that revenue is also the most durable driver of free cash flow performance. Incentives are also set for revenue growth to meaningfully drive compensation across our firm at every level. So again, we change the way we pay people in terms of growing revenue above market. We change the way that we pay people, giving a larger percentage of compensation in adherence to the fact that we as a company need to grow free cash flow dollars at double-digit rates. In the second area of operational excellence, and again, this is about how we think about growing the business top to bottom. You can see already in today's update in the press release that we mean it. It is tough to restructure a company. It's certainly something that we don't take lightly. You read the press release, we had to do it. It's a tough choice once again, but we needed to make operational changes to simplify our structure, to deliver greater efficiency, and to ensure that we enhancing investments in the right areas of the business, again closer to the customer, so again, not an easy thing to do, but something that we had to do and something that we have done. Beyond the restructuring, other initiatives in the area of operational excellence that are already in full motion, are the new programs that we got in place kicking off how to drastically reduce inventory levels at Zimmer Biomet. This will drive substantial improvement in our free cash flow dollar growth, while also reducing our days on hand, DOH by 50 days or more and will reduce or excess an obsolescence exposure, which is something that frankly we've not done that well in previous years. Second thing we're doing is the rollout of a global initiative to drive new product launch excellence across the key new product introductions that we have in the year 2024. In simple terms, the seven or eight most meaningful product launches, let's make sure we have a cadence of operating mechanisms with proper governance to ensure that we're maximizing these product launches across each key geography. And then the third thing we're doing in operational excellence beyond the restructuring is the integration of the pricing organization under the finance structure, reporting directly to Suky, our CFO, to ensure maximum governance and accountability across the enterprise. While we are pleased with the reduction in price erosion over the last two to three years, we believe there is much greater opportunity to drive even better and more durable pricing dynamics. So again, in the area of operational excellence, beyond the restructuring, it's about drastically reducing inventory levels to generate improved free cash flow dollar growth. It's about governance beyond or behind the new product launches. And then thirdly is around doing better in the area of pricing dynamics. In the third strategic imperative of innovation and diversification, we're going to continue to invest in innovative R&D, in customer centric R&D, we're going to continue to fuel our pipeline with meaningful product launches. We're going to continue to drive our vitality index, which has already expanded very meaningfully over the last three years. And we're going to make sure that as we continue to launch new products, we also see margin expansion coming from these new products. I'm excited about where we are today. Our pipeline, the dollar value associated with our pipeline is twice what it was at the end of 2018. And as we enter 2024, we had very meaningful product launches, particularly in the hip area in where we lost market share in the last two years, given the lack of products in key categories like surgical impactors, triple tapered stems, or hip navigation. So again, 2024 is the year in where, through very meaningful product launches, we will regain the momentum that we lost. Beyond hips, I'm excited about where we are in shoulder; Identity continues to generate great excitement. We will enter 2024 in full launch mode when it comes to Identity. We're excited about stemless shoulders entering the market, and yes, very excited about being first to market in the category of shoulder robotics with a very highly differentiated offering in robotics for shoulders that will apply for both anatomic and reverse surgeries. In the area of knees, we're in the early days of our cementless knee launch, in 2024, we seek to increase our penetration rates drastically. Here in the U.S., our penetration rate in cementless is not even in the 20% range and we are committing to drive the penetration rate into the 50% to 60% range at a very rapid pace. Again, more details to those plans at our Analyst Day, but rest assured that our knee penetration rate in the cementless category is not going to stay in the teens or even the low-20s for long. Beyond cementless, we're excited about next-generation robotics in knee. We are excited about partial cementless knees, and we're excited about the fact that in 2024, we're going to be entering the full launch for Persona IQ, the only smart knee in the world that fully integrates data, technology and best-in-class implants in a way that nobody else is doing. In the category of S.E.T., which is six different businesses, sports, foot and ankle, restorative therapies, trauma, extremities, and CMFT, craniomaxillofacial thoracic, we are seeing great growth already exiting 2023. The second semester of 2023, we grew S.E.T. by mid-single-digit or above. And as we entered 2024 and beyond, the expectation is that S.E.T. will continue to grow mid-single-digit or above. And this is something that as a company, we've not realized ever since the merger in 2015 with exclusion of the post-COVID year given comes, so really excited about the return on the multiple investments we made in S.E.T. particularly in the areas of innovation and commercial execution. There is a great cadence of product launches in S.E.T., already mentioned some of those and more to come when we do our Analyst Day in later in the spring. So excited about S.E.T., excited about innovation as a whole or new product development pipeline is strong. We're going to be launching over 40 different new products in the next 24 months or so. Most of them are going to enable category leadership, establishing Zimmer Biomet as the leader or the second position in the category. And virtually all of them are going to be in market spaces that are growing 4% plus or above. So I like the quantity, I like the quality, and I like the market growth profile in terms of where innovation is going. I'm also particularly excited about the innovation plans that we have for the ASC here in the U.S., ASC side of care. We made meaningful investments innovation during all stages of the episode of care, what happens before surgery, what happens during surgery, and what happens after surgery. And relative to the ASC in the intra op stage of the ASC, we are best-in-class when it comes to solving problems, delivering efficiency, best-in-class outcomes and safety. So again, truly excited about our ASC strategy where we're going relative to this side of care. Diversification of Zimmer Biomet's end markets will happen not just by innovation internally, but will happen through smart M&A, which will remain the number one category when it comes to capital allocation, with a best-in-class labor ratio, and with deep confidence in our free cash flow generating plans over the next few years, our strategy is to make a smart M&A the top recipient of our capital. But at the same time, I just love the fact that we have the optionality to continue to do share buybacks as we announced this morning and perhaps at a more meaningful level. So the combination of smart M&A and buybacks can coexist, given the strong free cash flow dollar generation that we are seeing in -- from this regard. I'm energized by the very detailed and focused plans that the team has put in place, which I know that upon their execution will position Zimmer Biomet to deliver on the growth profile that we keep recommitting and that is to grow above to 100 basis points to 200 basis points. So that's a minimum point of entry commitment of 5% in the year 2024, with earnings per share always growing faster than revenue and free cash flow always growing faster than EPS. This is not a one year commitment. This is a multi-year commitment. And again, I know based on the very detailed plans, we will get there. In closing, we are very excited about where we're at, the track record over the last two years, and most importantly, we're deeply excited in terms of where we're going to go in 2024 and beyond. The team is ready. We are establishing the right trend and we're going to continue to drive flawless execution, delivering our commitment. Along the way, we're going to help patients, we're going to create shareholder value, and we will leave our mission of alleviating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Suky. Hey, thank you, Larry. Always great to hear from you. So I'll take the first two parts and then Suky can talk about the rest. So embedded in the guidance for 2024, which we're very confident on the 5% to 6% is macro and micro reasons. So from a macro perspective, by now you heard from most of our peers, the markets are very healthy. We believe beyond the backlog, the markets are going to continue to be healthy. You got better patient demographics, younger patients; you got the dynamic of cases moving into an ASC. You got more days of surgery in the U.S. where it's not just two days you see in three days. You've seen shorter, better rehabilitation processes. I can go on and on, but the markets are very healthy. And then from a micro perspective, we got a cadence of new product launches. Most of them are going to be very meaningful as you hit the second semester of the year. We got three new product launches in hips early in 2024, which again will be more material later in the year. We launched in ROSA shoulder. We got a cadence of new product introductions in S.E.T. We're going to continue to increase or penetration in cementless and ROSA. So again, the combination of new product launches, great commercial execution, amplified by the healthier market dynamics, gives us confidence on a minimum 5% and a range of 5% to 6%. Relative to my philosophy when it comes to guidance is very basic. We make commitments and we don't miss them. So we study the different dynamics. We study where we're at. We know that operationally we're in a better place. We don't have the headwinds that we had in 2023 around supply and whatnot. So my guidance represents or exemplifies my philosophy of making commitments and delivering on those commitments. I'm not going to comment today on whether there is opportunities to beat and raise for the year. I just leave it at my philosophy is to make commitments and deliver commitments, and these are very well studied commitments. So with that, I'll pass it on to Suky for your second question. Thanks, Matt. So performance relative to the quarter, we're very pleased with the quarter. We perform in line with our expectations for knees and frankly for the entire business, and for the year, it was a solid year with a knees growing double-digit and the entire business growing 10.5% with nice EPS expansion. We really don't pay acute attention to what happens to one quarter. I know that it's our job to do that, but we just don't. The 60 to 62 working days in a quarter, all kinds of volatility, then you add comps. So when it comes to performance, we look to 8 to 12 quarters. And if you do run the analysis 8 to 12 quarters, you're talking about knees, but take a look at S.E.T. hips and whatnot, the performance is there. Speaking of volatility in Q4 for knees, we did see in the U.S. we did see some tons of orders. That impacted some of our largest IDNs here. We also had, let's remember, some tougher comps versus Q4 of 2022 particularly in the U.S. where we were 500 basis points ahead of our strongest competitor in knees. And again, if you look at Q3 that's a quarter where both the knees and hips we outperformed all competitors in the U.S. So again given all this volatility, all these ups and downs we just don't pay attention to one particular quarter. We look acutely at the trends and the trends do show that, 50 years later, we continue to be the number one player in knees and we continue to gain market share. Relative to the second part of your question around 2024, what gives us confidence around the guidance is the fact that we continue to see increases in cementless penetration. We continue to see increases in ROSA penetration. We have solved the backorder challenge that we had in this, which was a headwind for many periods in 2023. And we've seen this great commercial execution in the ASC. So we're very confident about where we are in knees and we are very confident around the acceleration in knees going into 2024. Thank you. Well, let me just begin with a simple answer. Anything and everything we're doing, restructuring wise and inventory management wise is embedded in the guidance we give it. So that's part of that. In terms of inventory management or inventory reductions, we're going to be bold but not reckless. So we're not reducing inventories in the key categories. We actually are making sure that inventory is what it needs to be for those key brands, whether it's Persona, whether it's the key components in hip, whether it is the key components in S.E.T. This is a lot of the leftover from the integration that we didn't do. So the inventory reduction is going to be in non-critical areas, frankly, in non-critical countries. So again, we're doing this thoughtfully. In terms of the restructuring, the reductions that we announced this morning, these are happening in back office. I will tell you virtually all reductions are non-customer facing. And again, the changes we make in inventory and people are embedded in the guidance that we're giving. Hey, thank you, Robbie. So solid quarter for S.E.T. frankly, solid last semester of 2023 for S.E.T. growing around mid-single-digit, around 5%, and committing to growing mid-single-digit or above in 2024. The key drivers are the use of suspects. We continue to do really well with upper extremities growing upper single-digit, double-digit in most geographies, that's new product launches, that's focusing the ASC, that's stable supply, just great commercial execution. Our CMFT business, craniomaxillofacial thoracic, continues to do really well. We call that we did two, three acquisitions over the last three years, and those continue to do really well. And again, CMFT is a business where we see upper single-digit, double-digit. We finally stabilize our restorative therapies business here in the U.S. Recall that we had some reimbursement challenges there, and those are behind. So you've seen the biologics restorative therapy business growing at a nice clip now. And then sports med, we've done some acquisitions. We have had some challenges, but that continues to perform in line with expectations. So I will tell you, Robbie, out of the six businesses within the category, four are going really well. Trauma put an ankle; we got some work to do. We got some decisions, some strategic considerations to make. As we enter 2024, mid-single-digit is the point of entry. This has to be the year where we see S.E.T. growing mid-single-digit. Frankly, in some geographies, I think it's going to be higher than that. We got the innovation; we got the investments in terms of dedicated infrastructure and specialization, heavy emphasis here in the U.S., in the ASC environment. So again, full confidence in the growth profile that we're going to see moving forward. Yes. Hey, thank you, Robbie. So solid quarter for S.E.T. frankly, solid last semester of 2023 for S.E.T. growing around mid-single digit, around 5%, and committing to growing mid-single digit or above in 2024. The key drivers are the use of suspects. We continue to do really well with upper extremities growing upper single-digit, double-digit in most geographies, that's new product launches, that's focusing the ASC, that's stable supply, just great commercial execution. Our CMFT business, craniomaxillofacial thoracic, continues to do really well. We call that we did two, three acquisitions over the last three years, and those continue to do really well. And again, CMFT is a business where we see upper single-digit, double-digit. We finally stabilize our restorative therapies business here in the U.S. Recall that we had some reimbursement challenges there, and those are behind. So you've seen the biologics restorative therapy business growing at a nice clip now. And then sports med, we've done some acquisitions. We have had some challenges, but that continues to perform in line with expectations. So I will tell you, Robbie, out of the six businesses within the category, four are going really well. Trauma put an ankle, we got some work to do. We got some decisions, some strategic considerations to make. As we enter 2024, mid-single digit is the point of entry. This has to be the year where we see S.E.T. growing mid-single digit. Frankly, in some geographies, I think it's going to be higher than that. We got the innovation, we got the investments in terms of dedicated infrastructure and specialization, heavy emphasis here in the U.S., in the ASC environment. So again, full confidence in the growth profile that we're going to see moving forward. Yes. And Joanne, relative to your question on cementless, I'll give you as much as I can. So, starting with the basic pricing dynamics we see with cementless Persona OsseoTi, we see an ASC uplift of around 10% to 15%, frankly closer to the 15% than the 10%, around 40% to 50% of the time, we combo the cementless knee with robotics, with ROSA, and that drives additional uplifting revenue in the form of disposals and whatnot. So that's a great dynamic we see in particular in the ASC. Our penetration today on cementless, we're exiting 2023 somewhere near 18% to 20% with both expectations; excuse me, to get into the 50% to 60% range. And I'm not going to give you a commitment today, but at our Analyst Day, you will see the long range plans and some of the trending when it comes to getting to 60%. We believe that there's going to be a fairly quick uplift, given the fact that the market is already being developed by some of the work that our peers have done. So again, you should not expect that getting to 50% to 60% is going to be a long journey. All of these dynamics are in the U.S. We're launching in 2024 in other markets outside of the U.S., and I will disclose the pricing dynamics when the time is right. But excited about the launch in Japan in 2024 and other key markets. So those are the dynamics here when it comes to cementless. Yes, I'll try to simplify it. And Suky, by all means elaborate, but we believe the market is around 4% all in. And again, we model this in different ways, but let's call it 4%. I'm not going to quantify the new product contribution, but pretty significant. We got 40 new products getting launched in the next two years, and these are meaningful products. I mentioned we got three large hip products that are going to get launched early in 2024. We got ROSA shoulder, which we believe is going to be meaningful in the year 2024, given the fact that it's not a late year launch. We got a lot of products in the S.E.T. category. So again, you should think of new product introductions as a very meaningful contributor of the guidance. Add to that the fact that we don't have the headwinds that we had in 2023 when it comes to supply, I would say between number one and number two; we got confidence on where we're going. Beyond that, we don't see a headwind when it comes to the shift to the ASC. We actually see that as a tailwind. We're excited about some of the dynamics we're hearing about when it comes to the movement of shoulders into the ASC. That's going to be a contributor. And as I mentioned to Joanne, the uplift that we see on cementless and ROSA, which are products that we launched three years ago but now going to get accelerated are the main contributors to the confidence in the guidance. I don't know, Suky, you have anything else here? Thank you. Hey, thank you, Jeff. So I got to be careful what I say about time lapse for ROSA shoulder. I'll just say that I'm very confident that this is not a late 2024 launch. And as I mentioned, I think it's going to be very meaningful. So beyond being first to market, it's a high quality product. It's going to be applicable for both reverse and anatomic surgeries. It's going to simplify a very complex procedure. It's going to be fully integrated with the rest of the shoulder CVH ecosystem. I believe it's going to get great traction in an ASC environment where speed and accuracy matters. And we're going to hopefully demo these next week at the academy meeting. Whether it's ready or not, it will be demoed there at the academy meeting. Relative to your second question on the ROSA placements and the numbers, you should expect us to do around 300 installations per year. You should expect us to drive penetration rates of minimum 5% to 7% at least per year. You should expect that one-third of these ROSA -- overall ROSA installations are going to go into an ASC environment. And as I mentioned earlier to Joanne, you should expect that in a large percentage of cases, these ROSA installations are going to push cementless. So again, great momentum with ROSA and I'm very excited about where we are with shoulder. So the answer is yes to both, Richard. So we will have some data points on Persona IQ, and we'll have some data on GLP-1. On Persona IQ, we moved from a limited market release in 2023 to full market release in 2024. We got the value proposition finalized. We got over 2 billion data points. We understand there's a product that is going to enable clinicians to intervene when needed. We got data points on how this product will reduce overall complexity in the episode of care. How we can by intervening soon reduce cost, especially post-surgery, when it can be pretty taxing. We don't reimbursement. We spoke about the NTAP new technology add-on payment, which we got back in October. So that's in full launch mode. We will submit. Barry always asks me this question. We will submit for a PPT coming some point in the spring, summer, and we're going to bring some data around, some of the experiences that we've seen with Persona IQ at the Cleveland Clinic, HSS and other facilities. So excited in terms of what we have with Persona IQ, more to come at the academy. And then for GLP-1s, yes, we're going to be sharing some of the data we've done in conjunction with the academy. And what I will tell you is that so far, everything we've seen with GLP-1s is that it remains a tailwind. We're actually tracking the number of patients that are using a GLP-1 pre-surgery, and that number is in the 20% to 30%. So by all means, this is not a headwind, and I'm glad that conversation is being muted. Well, I think what you're asking is, can you still sustain that in a world where you do a sizable M&A a transaction? If I've gotten that correct, that's really difficult to tell, right? There is no two deals are created equal. It's very situational. And so I don't want to get out there front footed to kind of hypothesize, theoretically, what could happen to EPS inside of a sort of make a new [ph] deal. So I think that what you should take away is that from an underlying perspective, at 5% to 6% organic growth, with the levers that we have operationally, but also with the strength of our balance sheet organically, that we can deliver that attractive earnings per share profile. Yes. We have some internal data points that we don't share. What I will tell you, Jayson is that new product launches, we had to do limited market releases instead of full market releases, Persona OsseoTi is an example. Conversion, as Suky mentioned, we had to prioritize or send some family customers versus converting accounts. And then the third headwind of supply, from a revenue perspective, we couldn't embark on global expansion of these new product launches. So the example that I used earlier around Japan, second largest market in the world, we could have done things differently. We could have been on the market. So it is sizable and it is behind us. Sure. Thanks, Keri. I'll keep it short. I know we got to get going here, so a minute or less. I want to start, I want to end the way that I started the call by thanking the team members, the almost 20,000 team members here at Zimmer Biomet who are doing a remarkable job in executing the plans that we lay forward. So grew 7.5% constant currency in 2023 with a nice EPS expansion of 200 basis points that's after growing 6.6% in 2022. And now we're committing to at least 5% revenue growth, 5.5% mid-point with nice EPS expansion and double-digit growth in free cash flow. So very proud of the work that team members are doing. And we're very excited about 2024. We are moving from remediation to -- we have moved from remediation to innovation. I'm excited about the pipeline of products. I'm excited about the financial profile that we commit into or growing EPS faster than revenue and free cash flow faster than EPS. And so far during the year, everything that we're seeing gives us confidence, or confidence that it's going to be a very solid year for Zimmer Biomet. So thank you for your attention this morning, and thank you, team members at Zimmer Biomet."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today November 7. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Ivan Tornos, our President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q3 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ivan. Ivan?\nIvan Tornos: Thank you very much, Keri. And good morning, and greetings, everyone from Warsaw, Indiana, the orthopedic capital of the world, welcome to our Q3 earnings call. My first call as the CEO [indiscernible] organization really grateful that all of you are joining us here this morning. I\u2019d like to begin by sharing how truly excited I am to be in the new role. Team to be a very inspiring time, not just in musculoskeletal health, which it is, but also in med-tech in general. Simply put the space is not what it used to be just so five years ago. When you look at orthopedics, when you look at the entire category, it\u2019s changed, it\u2019s changed a lot. Groundbreaking technologies are shaping how procedures are done beyond the backlog and continuing femoral demographics, global demand for treatment is higher than it has historically been This is driven by better clinically reported outcomes. This is driven by shorter episodes of care. This is driven by better, more comfortable ways to do physical therapy. This is driven by greater ways to approach different disease states. And this is driven by subtle treatment migrations like the one we see here in the U.S. with a rapid shift of cases moving into an ASC while also preserving what are very compelling volume levels in the traditional in-patient and outpatient settings. So in plain English, healthy market, great patient dynamics, new technology, disruptive innovation, a lot has changed. And I don\u2019t see us going back to four or five years ago. So again, a very inspiring time to be in musculoskeletal health and orthopedics in general. All of these market accelerating trends are opening new doors for countless patients to benefit from what we do here at ZB, which is to drive life changing solutions. And we do that every single day for countless patients. And the best part about it, we\u2019re just getting started. So I could not be more excited to be here in my new role. With this encouraging market dynamics, sustainable trends, and building on the solid track record of execution that the ZB team has enabled. It\u2019s great to be here today to report what it is, another solid quarter of a strong performance while strongly reaffirming our year-end guidance for the year 2023. Even more exciting, as I look forward to our future, I\u2019m more convinced than ever that Zimmer Biomet will continue to lead the way on customer-centric innovation, already a competitive advantage and solid commercial execution, enabling not just the delivery of our mission, but also improving on our other key value creation drivers, those regaining and sustaining top quartile performance. And again, this is something that we treat with a lot of rigor and something that is a mandate for the organization. We must regain and sustain top quartile performance. For today\u2019s call, I want to first share my thoughts on my first two months as CEO of Zimmer Biomet, while also providing key insights into what I\u2019ve learned, how my learning has shaped what are going to be my three key priorities as the new CEO of the enterprise. This will answer the question on what is fundamentally going to change around here in the next chapter of our transformation. After that, I\u2019m going to talk about the key drivers behind the solid Q3 performance, next Suky will take over, will discuss the financials for the quarter as well as the expectations for the rest of the year, and then our favorite part of the call Q&A. Before we move into these updates, I do want to take a moment to thank the global Zimmer Biomet team for their unwavering commitment to our purpose, to our plans. I want to thank them for their sense of urgency in driving site execution. I want to thank them for everything that they do. This is a highly engaged and focused team that is being operating at a very rapid speed and is eagerly designed to do even more, more for patients, more for customers, more for the team, more for each other, more for the company, more for the communities where we work and live, like right here in Warsaw, and frankly, far more for the shareholders. It\u2019s a team that has gone through a lot, and a lot is a lot. This team has done a lot of heavy lifting, and now with the heavy lifting behind from a remediation standpoint, it\u2019s great to be in a different stage and it\u2019s great to be able to show to the world what the Zimmer Biomet team can do and will do. Beyond proud of the organization and I\u2019m genuinely inspired by what they do each and every day. Been doing this for a while around the world, and I can truthfully tell you I\u2019ve never worked with a better team than the one we have here at Zimmer Biomet. And again, I can hardly wait to showcase our results in quarters to come. So thank you. I also want to thank Bryan Hanson for all that Bryan lead to bring Zimmer Biomet to this moment. We are grateful and we\u2019re stronger because of his leadership. So thank you, Bryan. Now let me share some perspective as the new CEO of Zimmer Biomet. During my first 11 weeks or 77 days in the job, I\u2019ve spent significant time with team members, customers, analysts, investors, or Board, my peers, healthcare executives across med-tech, government officials, and other key stakeholders in healthcare so that I could listen, I could learn and I could get the property insights. I\u2019ve been in every Zimmer Biomet region around the globe. I\u2019ve interacted with every key manufacturing facility. I have visited hundreds of decision makers across every major continent, and I have collected countless pages of feedback and recommendations. Most critically, I\u2019ve used this reflection time to ensure that we at Zimmer Biomet are boldly prioritizing what needs to get done. And this, I can assure you would be a trademark of my time as CEO of Zimmer Biomet, having the courage to say no to several things so that we can become truly great in those things that will drive the most value for the enterprise and our key stakeholders. These key priorities are purpose and people, number one. We have a winning culture. We have the absolute best talent in the industry. It has been a foundational priority for ZB and will continue to be critical under my leadership. People, purpose, talent, culture with a very data centric organization, and we use the same level of data centricity to track how it is that we\u2019re doing with our human capital. To that end, we track level of engagement, development, DEI, engagement across different segments and geographies, high potential ratings and everything in between. I\u2019m really excited to report that, or the most recent engagement survey, which we completed about six weeks ago delivered the absolute best scores in the history of the company. Let me say that again. The latest engagement score for organization close to 20,000 employees showcase the absolute best scores in the history of the organization, frankly, going up across every single category. This tells me that the team is energized. This tells me that the team is ready, and this tells me that the team is about to unleash a lot of greatness for the organization. The second priority is to create and sustain a framework of operational excellence across the Board. Simply put is about being great when it comes to running the business. This means simplifying what we do, where we play, and how we play. This means being courageous and bold about the choices that we make. It starts with being intention about driving sustainable revenue growth. We know this is the number one driver of top quartile performance, and we also know that innovation, customer-centric innovation and commercial execution are the two key drivers of sustainable revenue growth. So we\u2019ll accelerate that, but at the same time, we\u2019re not going to forget that we can and will do better across the entirety of the P&L. We\u2019re going to drive a culture of ownership by every single employee across the globe. With all of us waking up every single day acting as true investors in the business and thinking of time and money as the key currencies of the organization. This means continuing to align our incentives with an even greater emphasis on best-in-class performance from both top and bottom. By delivering on operational excellence, as a mandate or mindset for the organization, we\u2019re going to enable, number one, revenue growth of at least 100 to 200 basis points our market, while growing earnings faster than revenue and free cash flow growing faster than the rate of earnings. Number two, operational excellence will enable best-in-class supply and operational outcomes by simplifying a rather complex operations and manufacturing footprint. And then thirdly, operational excellence as a mandate is going to enable an agile, nimble, and simplify company that can anticipate \u2013 can be proactive in successfully navigating market trends. So again, operational excellence and mindset is going to deliver revenue growth of at least a 100 to 200 basis points of market while growing earnings faster than revenue and free cash flow faster than the rate of earnings, while enabling best-in-class supply and operational outcomes and by making Zimmer Biomet, agile, nimble, and a very simplified company that is proactive in what it does. Based on where we are, as we close the year 2023 and based on our latest guidance, we\u2019re already on track to deliver the metrics that I mentioned above around revenue, earnings and free cash flow the way we\u2019re run the company, but we expect to do it again with even greater rigor in 2024. To that end, we look forward to hosting an Analyst Day, something we\u2019ve not done ever since we merged the two companies. And at that Analyst Day, we\u2019re going to be sharing more details on these thought that I have highlighted and the specific drivers of these goals. So this becomes truly the DNA of Zimmer Biomet. Priority is about innovating and diversifying Zimmer Biomet into higher growth markets, table stakes. We must enter higher growth markets. We do need to diversify our portfolio, and we\u2019ll do that. We\u2019re going to do it through organic and inorganic means, we\u2019re going to do it through innovation and M&A. On the innovation front, we\u2019re going to innovate by continuing to boldly invest in the right segments of R&D, so that is new product development. So that we always think customer problems and bringing solutions to those problems. We\u2019re going to make sure that those problems are in attractive growth areas that are mission-centric, but also are in the right markets. And by bringing those solutions, we\u2019re going to become and remain market leaders in these categories where we choose to play aided by both product and solutions launches that will enable category leadership for Zimmer Biomet. We\u2019re going to be relentless about the certain opportunities, namely the ASC opportunity here in the U.S. where we are already growing in the strong double-digit rates, but we know we are far from realizing our true potential. This journey, by the way, innovation journey has already started. We\u2019re on track to launch over 40 new products over the next 36 months. And the value \u2013 the dollar value for pipeline today is twice the dollar value that we had back in 2018. So a lot of new exciting technologies are about to get launched here at Zimmer Biomet. In addition, 80% of our products in our pipeline, we\u2019re studying markets that are growing at least 4%, many in areas that are growing more than 4%. Equally vital, we\u2019re going to ensure that the innovation journey accelerates value creation through making sure that we monitoring not just the revenue associated with these launches, the vitality index, but also what we call our innovation profitability index or IPI, and that\u2019s the gross margin dollars coming from new products. We got to make sure that these new products are driving margin accretion to the overall margin profile of the organization. So again, it\u2019s about innovation and it\u2019s about value creation at the same time. Mission and margin expansion will coexist and will coexist as part of our innovation journey. To materially change our portfolio, we\u2019re going to also leverage the strength of our balance sheet, which is stronger than ever. We will do M&A. We\u2019re going to be thoughtful and disciplined about the spaces we prioritize, and we\u2019re going to ensure that the spaces are mission centric, and at the same time, these spaces are the areas where Zimmer Biomet has a right to win. We focus on opportunities that are going to hit strategic thresholds, but also hit financial thresholds. We\u2019re going to make sure that these acquisitions drive a strong returns and create long-term shareholder value. It is worth noting that this diversification of our business has started already. Yes, we have to be bolder and we will be bolder, but it has already started. In the last two, three years, we have shifted our portfolio already into mid single digit or above market environments and our weighted average market growth rates have already increased from 50 basis points. And this happened through thoughtful resource allocation and some of the active portfolio management we\u2019ve done. Again, we\u2019re going to be bolder, but the journey has already started. I\u2019m excited about what we can and we\u2019ll do across these three priorities. It\u2019s about first and foremost people, human capital, having a best-in-class culture. Secondly, it\u2019s about delivering operational excellence as a company mindset or mandate. And thirdly, it\u2019s about making sure that we diversify and innovate in a far bolder way through organic and inorganic means. Those are my three priorities. So now that you got a better sense of all priorities. I want to talk about Q3. And again, I want to reiterate that we\u2019re really excited about the performance that was on the quarter. Performance, that that was driven by continued execution, especially in the key areas where we\u2019ve been investing. In particular, I want to talk about niche. It was a great quarter for niche, where we delivered a both market performance in key markets around the world. We also grew in areas that are mission critical within set upper extremities, CMFT, as well as sports medicine. We had solid performance in the ASC environment and we saw revenue generation coming strongly from our data technology and solutions platform, primarily within ROSA and Mobility. In knees, Persona OsseoTi are highly differentiated cementless platform continues to perform above our expectations. I was recently in Dallas at the hip and knee society, and the feedback continues to be superb. Can\u2019t wait until we continue to bring this technology to other geographies. ROSA had a strong quarter continue to see great adoption. We\u2019ve seen a lot of gross adoption happening in the ASC setting, where speed, we\u2019re dealing with higher volumes that matter. In the ASC, we continue to see growth in the teams, and we\u2019re executing contracts daily or portfolio second to none, and we\u2019re benefiting from the recent acquisitions we done such as Embody and ReLign, against the backdrop of this strong execution, Medtech sector stocks have been facing pressure related to GLP-1 drugs and the impact or the perceived impact on obesity. This from a long-term perspective. With a mission-centric patient in the board organization, so if this drug class truly does accelerate and improves patient health, and if these drugs truly do become the end of the obesity pandemic around the world that is great news for everyone as long as truly this is sustainable in the long-term.\n528 million [ph]: Obesity is certainly an accelerator of the disease and certainly is an element of the disease or a driver of the disease. But let\u2019s not forget that once the cartilage is damaged, there is no recovery. Once you get osteoarthritis, you will not get rid of osteoarthritis. And dropping weight is not going to cure osteoarthritis. Again, this is a degenerative and non-curable disease that we\u2019re talking about. If anything, obesity is a blocker today to joint surgery as many surgeons are uncomfortable operating on patients with a BMI greater than 40% countries or even above the 30 thresholds in some locations. So why could GLP-1s then be a tailwind for orthopedics? Three compelling reasons. First, if you can lower the patient\u2019s BMI below a certain threshold, 40 or 30 in some cases these patients now become eligible for surgery. And all the data points that we\u2019re getting in primary markets like the U.S. is that there is a large percentage of patients who today are not going through surgery because their BMI is too high. Secondly, if a patient does lose their weight, and I would say, this is pretty logical and they do become more active, there will be a greater risk for additional joint procedures because there will be injury. And third, if a patient loses weight, they are likely to live longer, again, expanding the patient final for an orthopedic procedure. A good example of this fact is Japan, the second largest market in the world for osteoarthritis with minimal obesity rates, but very long life expectancy dynamics. We\u2019ve not seen any near-term impact from GLP-1s, and we\u2019ve seen the long-term impact would be a positive one for orthopedics and Zimmer Biomet. We\u2019ve engaged independent third parties to perform surgeon surveys and have gathered U.S. based claims data. What still is early in the process, we are very excited about the initial findings. We look forward to sharing them. So in an nutshell, more of a tail win. We\u2019ll be sharing data very soon. And We think that the logic will prevail, and this will be the end of what has been so far a rather emotional argument that is not being fact-based. In closing, I hope you can tell that I\u2019m very confident about the future of this organization. I\u2019m very excited to be here. Our end markets have never been stronger. I will believe that this market beyond the backlog is sustainable. Our execution is strong and is also sustainable. We\u2019ve been delivering consistently for a while. And we\u2019ll continue to do so with even greater focus and speed. We know what we need to do. The strategy is clear and we will execute on the strategy. We have financial flexibility to invest in higher growth markets, and we are going to continue to shift our portfolio mix and diversify our business. I generally believe this is the time for Zimmer Biomet. I\u2019m proud of the work we\u2019ve done and even more proud of the work that we\u2019re going to be doing ahead. This is why I\u2019m excited to be the CEO and even more excited to be proud Zimmer Biomet shareholder as I believe that now is the time for real value creation. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Suky for a run through of our Q3 financials. Suky?\nSuky Upadhyay: Thanks and good morning. I\u2019d like to start my prepared remarks today by welcoming Ivan to his first earnings call as a Zimmer Biomet\u2019s CEO. Ivan has been a constant force and a driver within the organization for several years. And I\u2019m proud to work with him, and I\u2019m excited by the partnership. As Ivan noted, we had another strong quarter driven by healthy and improving end markets and continued strong execution across the organization. Overall, we remain on track to deliver mid-single digit, constant currency revenue growth, and adjusted operating margin expansion in the back half of the year, just as we committed to on our second quarter call. Moving to results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the third quarter and how it compares to the same period in 2022. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.754 billion, an increase of 5% on a reported basis, and an increase of 4.7% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, we had a selling day headwind of about 150 basis points that impacted all regions and product categories at about the same level. Excluding the selling day impact, consolidated ex-FX sales would have grown just over 6%. U.S. growth was 6%, and international growth was 2.9%. In the U.S., our strong year-over-year results were driven by recon and a step up in our S.E.T. category in tandem with strong capital sales. Outside of the U.S., we saw more moderated growth across Europe and Asia driven by tough comps and geopolitical headwinds, which I\u2019ll discuss in our product category section. Global knees grew 7.3% with the U.S. growing 6.1% and international growing 9.1%. The strong performance in knees was driven by continued uptake from our Persona product portfolio combined with the benefits of our ROSA robotics platform. Global hips declined by 60 basis points with the U.S. growing 3% and international declining by 4.2%. Tough comps in China and headwinds in Russia disproportionately impacted our OUS hip business. Excluding these impacts, our international hip business grew in the low single digits. Looking ahead, portfolio expansion will continue to support growth in our hips business. Next, the S.E.T. category grew 2.8%. Again, as a reminder, there was about 150 basis points selling day headwind across all categories and regions. Our key focus areas within S.E.T., including sports, upper extremities, and CMFT continue to post double-digit growth, which was partially offset by other subsegments within the category. We remain confident that S.E.T. will grow in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Finally, our other category grew 16.4% driven by ROSA sales. Now moving on to the P&L. In Q3, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 in the prior year. While we had higher year-over-year revenue and higher pre-tax operating profits, post-tax income was lower due to a favorable tax settlement in 2022 that did not repeat this year. On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of a $1.65, compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of a $1.58 in the prior year. The step up is primarily driven by revenue growth in the quarter, partially offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest costs. Our adjusted gross margin was 70.9%, up 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by favorable mix. Adjusted operating margin was 26.4% and up slightly versus the prior year. Better gross margin and savings from efficiencies across SG&A were partially offset by higher R&D expenses that will support upcoming product launches ultimately driving a continued increase in our vitality index. Net interest and other adjusted non-operating expenses of $48 million was higher than the prior year due to certain foreign currency exposures as well as higher interest rates. And our adjusted tax rate was 16.7% in the quarter. Turning to cash and liquidity, we had operating cash flows of $338 million and free cash flow of $189 million in the quarter. We ended with cash and cash equivalents totaling just under $300 million. Our balance sheet remains strong providing us financial flexibility and strategic optionality as we move forward. Now, regarding our outlook. Overall for 2023, the outlook remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter, implying over 7% constant currency revenue growth and 9% EPS growth at the mid points of our range. We expect reported growth for the full year to be 6% to 6.5% and are maintaining our ex-FX growth expectations for the year of 7% to 7.5%. Inside of that, the U.S. dollar has strengthened. So we are increasing our outlook for foreign currency to be about a 100 basis point headwind to revenue growth for the full year. Additionally, we are reiterating our EPS guidance of $7.47 to $7.57 for the full year. Despite the strengthening dollar, which we project to be about a $0.04 headwind to fourth quarter earnings. This guidance implies that we will increase full year operating margins by about a 100 basis points in the backdrop of a challenging environment. In addition to our formal guidance ranges, I will reiterate that there is no material impact from selling days on the full year revenue growth expectations. However, we do expect about a 100 basis point tailwind in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our expectations for interest and other non-operating expenses as well as tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged. We expect free cash flow for the year to be between $950 million and $1 billion. In summary, we delivered another excellent quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We remain confident in our 2023 expectations and are excited about the next year with revenue growing in the mid-single digits and earnings growing faster than the top line. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Keri.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one brief follow-up, so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go first to Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh, great. Thanks for taking the questions. I\u2019ll ask both upfront as they\u2019re kind of interrelated. Ivan and Suky, I was hoping you could address just the health of the ortho market. You talked to it, but we see your results and we see your peer results, and most of them were in line to slightly below in the quarter. So one, how you\u2019re thinking about the health of the market? And then second, you touched last quarter and then this quarter as well on longer range guidance for 2024. You talked newer guidance this time about 100 basis points to 200 basis points above your end market growth. I think last quarter it was implying something like 4% plus. Is that a change? And how do we think about margins for next year? I think previously it was slightly up. Thanks a lot.\nIvan Tornos: Hey, thank you, Robbie. I\u2019ll start, I\u2019ll talk about the market dynamics and briefly I\u2019ll comment on 2024. I\u2019ll pass it on to Suky to provide more color on 2024 and maybe discuss what he can discuss at this point when it comes to the margin profile. But I\u2019ll start with the market dynamics. We\u2019re the fourth company to report in Q3. So by now everybody sees that the markets are healthy. And quite frankly, I won\u2019t talk much about Q4, but so far so good. So this is not a one quarter type of market dynamic. The reasons behind the market profile, the market growth profile and why I continue to say this market is different than four or five years ago is the things that I alluded to in my prepared remarks. The explosion of ASCs, the movement, the shift to ASC is real. That means new ASCs are opening in the U.S. That means [indiscernible] surgery are happening. Demographics around the world play a factor. We continue to track data in terms of the age for someone to get a hip or a knee. And these are younger patients. In the U.S., we would also see more days of surgery. And I don\u2019t think this is just a backlog dynamic pricing, you see what every single one of us is reporting these days. It\u2019s not the same pricing dynamic that we\u2019ve had in the past. And beyond that, the technology. We are driving disruptive innovation. We got more efficient solutions, surgeries are shorter, and the episode occurred is shorter. So we are dealing with the patients, the fellow patients with more efficiency. Again, this is a durable trend. It\u2019s happening in Q3. As I think about Q4, nothing is really changing. As we look into 2024, every early indicator suggests that things are not going to change. And relative to performance, well, look in the background of these healthy market dynamics in the U.S., we gain share in Q3 in both categories. Really proud of being number one in knees for the quarter. We don\u2019t pay a lot of attention to any given quarter, but that is a fact that we\u2019re the fastest growing company in the quarter. And then globally net of a couple of one-timers both in Russia and China. When it comes to hips, our performance was in line with hips and knees was very strong. And then as we get to 2024, I\u2019ll let Suky comment, but we will be mid-single digit. That\u2019s the point of entry. And nothing has really changed. It\u2019s just getting closer to the end of the year and realizing that these market trends are sustainable. And the innovation pipeline that we have will drive the type of growth. But I\u2019ll pass it on to Suky to comment on all the drivers.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Hey, Robbie. Good morning. Thanks for the question. First thing I\u2019d say is starting with the back half of this year, we committed to mid-single digit ex-FX growth for the second half of the year with operating margin expansion both sequentially and year-over-year. Q3 was a really another strong validation proof point of that. And we feel confident in that profile. The reason I mention that is I think it gives us a running start as we go into 2024. And so, I do want to talk a little bit about 2024 back to your question. First, we\u2019ve already provided a lot of color, I think, on 2024 more than most of our peers. But we feel that being transparent, giving you guys a robust view of what we\u2019re going to do, not only this year, but into the future is really important. But let me talk a little bit about the headwinds and tailwinds as we see it going into 2024 and some things have modestly changed. First, I\u2019ll start with the headwinds. One, we do see a higher tax rate into next year because of the OECD\u2019s Pillar Two. Secondly, based on where FX rates are today, we\u2019d see some additional pressure from a foreign currency perspective into next year. Again, both of these are more macro versus execution, right? They\u2019re things that are outside of our control, but we\u2019re going to contend with them and we\u2019re going to deal with them. And I\u2019ll tell you a little bit about how. On the tailwind side, I would say, yes, we are more confident in our outlook for revenue next year. Our end markets are stronger than they\u2019ve ever been. Our portfolio and new product launches have been executing extremely well in some areas above our expectation. Our performance relative to market has been very strong, and that\u2019s consistent and durable. And quite frankly, we\u2019re seeing a more moderated pricing environment still erosion, but much more moderated than what we\u2019ve see in historically. All of those elements give us confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to post a mid-single digit growth top line ex-FX into 2024. And then, despite those sort of P&L headwinds I talked about, we do believe that we\u2019re going to be able to grow earnings faster than revenue. I talked about gross margin next year, stepping down because of the FX hedge gains from this year, not repeating at the same level. That will still happen, but we\u2019re going to be able to offset some of that. The operations and manufacturing team has been working really hard at efficiency. And so we feel more optimistic about where gross margin is going into next year. Secondly, as I said, we\u2019ve already got a running start on a lot of SG&A efficiency programs in the back half of this year that are going to run into next year. So when you combine those two elements together again, we feel really confident that we\u2019re going to be able to do that mid-single digit top line growth next year, as well as earnings growing faster than revenue. So, thanks again, Robbie, for the question.\nRobbie Marcus: Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Robbie.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Drew Ranieri\u2026\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Robbie.\nOperator: \u2026with Morgan Stanley.\nDrew Ranieri: Hi Ivan and Suky. Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe on 2024 also you haven\u2019t talked about backlog much recent conferences. You kind of pointed out that you think it\u2019s going to carry through 2024, but just maybe help us a bit more of how you\u2019re factoring that into your mid-single digit directional guide for next year? I know it\u2019s not, I know your growth is not all dependent on backlog but just how do you think about that helping to support the orthopedic market growth? And maybe just talk to us about your ability to capture a disproportional amount of share of that backlog? Thank you.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, Drew, thank you very much. And first things first, you should be in your honeymoon considering that you got married recently. So I\u2019m disappointed you here. Look, I\u2019m going to keep this short and sweet. We don\u2019t see backlog as a major driver, growth profile for the next year. So when Suky and I said on mid-single digit, we\u2019re not assuming any real meaningful backlog. So not a key driver. We believe and we spend a lot of time going back and forth on backlog that is going to remain here throughout the end of 2024 at least. But we are not a backlog depending \u2013 backlog dependent type of a company. So we don\u2019t have \u2013 we don\u2019t focus on that. What we\u2019re tracking is innovation, the pipeline that we have, but we\u2019re tracking is the investments we made in the ASC we\u2019re tracking is commercial execution and in the background, just sustainable pricing dynamics. So no backlog. Thank you.\nDrew Ranieri: Thanks. And just a second as a follow-up. Your commentary was very strong that you\u2019re expecting mid-single digit S.E.T. growth into next year. But just remind us about what\u2019s it going to take to really accelerate S.E.T.? And maybe just talk a little bit more about the lift on the organic side and maybe what you\u2019re thinking about in terms of M&A to get that growth rate higher and more sustainable? Thanks for taking the questions.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, absolutely. Great question. First things first. Q3 S.E.T. was in line. As we move into Q4, we\u2019re actually going to be a mid-single digit grower. I\u2019m not going to talk about S.E.T dynamics for 2024. We\u2019ll do that coming guidance, but very excited in terms of where we are. We integrated a couple of companies we have seen SportsMed. Those are performing very well. Our upper extremities, our shoulder business is growing in the mid to upper single digits in most regions. When you look at our CMFT, craniomaxillofacial thoracic, which is part of S.E.T. It has been performing very well. It continues to perform very well. So, again, lots of reasons to believe that as we getting 2024, you should expect a sustainable performance in S.E.T. In terms of M&A, again, we\u2019re coming more on that later, but it remains the number one recipient of capital allocation. We haven\u2019t changed in that regard. And yet, S.E.T. is one category that is very attractive, given the higher market growth dynamics or position in the space. So you should assume that this is one area where we\u2019re going to be focusing from an M&A standpoint. But again, native M&A already delivering mid-single digit growth entering Q4 strongly, and we are excited about 2024. Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Drew. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Matt Taylor with Jefferies.\nMatt Taylor: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a good quarter. I was curious about your outlook comments for 2024. And I was hoping you could specifically address the concern I think investors have about growth, especially in the first half of the year with, I\u2019ll do air quotes on this, but tough comps especially in Q1. So maybe you could address how you think you can grow throughout the year and address investor concerns about those tough comps in the first half?\nIvan Tornos: Yes, I\u2019ll start Matt, and again, Suky maybe want to chime in here. But we confident about 2024 because the market dynamics are sustainable. So there has been a lot of back and forth in terms of what\u2019s going to happen once the backlog is out and all that. First, the backlog. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be out anytime soon. And then pricing is sustainable. And all the things that I mentioned, excuse me, my answer to Robbie, are here. They move to the ASC the shorter episodes of care more days of surgery. So macro wise every data point we get in that is very compelling. And then on the micro, we are seeing a bolus of innovation being launched. We got 40 new products that we\u2019re going to be launching over the next 36 months. Some of these products are very compelling. We launched our Persona OsseoTi, which is the cementless construct earlier in 2023. That is going to be a full \u2013 truly full market release in the U.S. in 2024 with the right amount of S.E.T.s and that\u2019s high growth. As we enter the first semester of 2024 to your point, is another two or three very meaningful product launches. Some in robotics, some within recon, some in S.E.T., that\u2019s very compelling. The integration of embodying, the integration of relying continues to generate revenue. I could spend an hour, but I will tell you that is the balance of really sustainable micro dynamics and solid innovation. And then on top of that, you got great commercial execution with a highly engaged sales force. So I\u2019m not \u2013 we are not deeply concerned about the about the comps.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. I think just building on that, remember the first half of this year, which was very strong, was more about comps versus 2021, or excuse me, versus 2022. Then it was something about abnormal market growth. So again, just building off what Ivan said, we feel confident in that. Now we\u2019re not of course giving specific guidance, and we\u2019re certainly not giving quarterly guidance into next year. So, as always quarters can be choppy or driven by seasonality mix changes, but overall, we\u2019re confident that the single vision.\nIvan Tornos: And maybe one last comment here, Matt, quickly we can move on. Don\u2019t forget that the first semester of 2023, while it had very solid comps, also had pretty challenging dynamics from a supply standpoint. So as we think about 2024, that we believe it\u2019s going to be a tailwind.\nMatt Taylor: Great. Thanks, guys. We\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nSuky Upadhyay: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Shagun Singh with RBC Capital Markets.\nShagun Singh: Thank you so much. I\u2019m just going to try to ask the Q4 implied in 2024 guide in a different way. Your Q4 implied guidance assumes a deceleration from Q3. And your commentary seems pretty positive. It implies a deceleration even on a stack two-year basis, which are just for comp. So should we just assume that it\u2019s conservatism? And then if you look at growth on an underlying basis, adjusted for China, VBP selling days and all one-time items, I think you did plus 6% in 2022. You\u2019re looking to do 7% to 7.5% in 2023 guidance. Sorry, consensus is looking for about 4.5% growth in 2024. I know Ivan, one of your targets is to drive that revenue growth acceleration. You\u2019ve indicated that you will not be satisfied with 4% to 5% growth for the company. So just what is your reaction to that 4.5%? Does it look conservative to you in the context of the comments that you made?\nSuky Upadhyay: Sure. Hey Shagun, this is Suky. Thanks for the question. So just first some fourth quarter, I\u2019ll just keep going back to \u2013 we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance and obviously with our implied, you can pretty much squeeze into the last quarter of the year. We talked about mid-single digit growth margins expanding in the back half of this year, and we\u2019re going to deliver on that. We have a range around our guidance. Obviously, the \u2013 to the downside, geopolitical factors continue to be erosive or supply doesn\u2019t continue to, that very positive trend has been on. Then you\u2019re towards the bottom end. However, if that supply picks up and it remediates even faster than it\u2019s already been improving, then as well as better execution on our new products, we could be at the upper end. So there\u2019s a range around that and so I\u2019ll just leave it at that. But overall, we feel really good about where we\u2019re ending the second half of this year and where our end markets are. As we look into next year, I think you\u2019ve seen a bit of a pivot where our commentary was before anchoring towards 4%, maybe even better to now where we\u2019re saying mid-single digit. And I think that reflects the momentum that we\u2019ve seen to your point in 2022 and 2023.\nShagun Singh: Got it. And if I could just ask a question on M&A.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, go ahead. Go ahead, Shagun.\nShagun Singh: Okay. Great. Just on M&A, Ivan, if you could just elaborate a little bit more in your thinking of tuck-ins versus larger deals, high growth adjacencies that may allow you to diversify outside of elective procedures. And then I\u2019m most interested about ASCs, a lot of your businesses moving to ASC that is a growth driver. What do you need to further succeed there? Do you need a broader bag or more depth? Thank you for taking the questions.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, absolutely. So on M&A, as already mentioned, and it was in my prepared remarks as well, it will remain our top strategic priority from a capital allocation standpoint. So that\u2019s not changing. And we\u2019re excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on growth markets or areas that are not only mission-centric, but offer an exciting growth profile. And that is three things. No ranking order. Three key areas, segments within recon that are growing faster than [indiscernible] or collected or collective market growth rates. And there\u2019s a lot in there. You got navigation. You got data, technology, elements of recon that are really attractive. Two is set as we\u2019ve done already. Buying things in sports med, buying things in CMFT, and then looking at other categories that I don\u2019t want to get into for our competitive dynamics. But again, optionality there. And then ASC is also one attractive area, is one area where we have dedicated resources, we growing in the teams. We have currently 10% to 15% of our sales in that space. And there is opportunities there to acquire things. So that\u2019s a bit of the strategic summary of where we go from an M&A perspective. In terms of financials, we\u2019re not changing the story. We like to do things up to $2 billion in acquisition price. And again, that gives you a lot of options. You can do a mid-size deal. You can do some tuck-ins combination of different things. We want these deals to be EPS neutral within two years. And we spoke about high-single digit ROIC within five years. So that\u2019s a bit of a strategic and financial profile. As we look into the next three or five years, we spend a lot of time, Suky and I have spent a lot of time looking at the strap plan. What is the growth profile? The great news is that we convinced that the free cash flow generation is solid. So we\u2019re going to be able to do M&A and potentially do other stuff when it comes to capital allocation. So that\u2019s the answer to your first question. On ASC, look, I don\u2019t think we need to do much more. We growing in the strong things already here in the U.S. in the ASC. I mentioned 10% to 15% of our sales are there. We got the right portfolio. This is now where we were let\u2019s say three, four years ago. We got the right robotic platform for the ASC. We got a great cementless Knee that is gaining there very quickly. We got a full bag in sports and across set. We got best-in-class technology so the portfolio is great. We got dedicated resources, which you very much need in an ASC environment. We have a dedicated sales force. We got simple contracting, simplified contracting, and look what we don\u2019t have organically, we partner with others. So whether it\u2019s sterilization, booms and lights or other stuff, we got the right partnerships. So very, very confident that we\u2019re going to continue to perform in the ASC environment. Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks so much, Shagun. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: Good morning. Thanks, Ivan, Suky, and Keri. Wanted to just follow-up on your ASC comments. Ivan, wanted to ask about the migration of total joint surgeries to ASCs. Any back the envelope assumptions you would have as used just in terms of where the penetration or where the migration for knees and hips has been. What percentage of cases for each categories reported in ASCs currently here at the end of 2023 versus 2022. And then any metrics you can share just with roads of penetration and ASCs, and then any pricing dynamics for total joints as this migration is occurring. Thanks, multi-part question, but I appreciate you taking it.\nIvan Tornos: All right. Let\u2019s see if my memory is as good as I think it is. So starting with ASC macro wise, we believe that roughly between 40% to 60% of cases in the next five years are going to move to the ASC. And I will say that a large portion of cases are already moving to the ASC. What we like about this dynamic is that as cases are moving to the ASC, other cases are going to in-patient and outpatients. So it\u2019s a little bit of a double dip happening their just, but yes, the number is 40% to 60% over the next three to five years. And I would say a good percentage has already moved. We are growing in the upper teens when it comes to the ASC and today around 10% to 15% repeating myself of cases or revenue rather of Zimmer Biomet comes from the ASC. I will tell you that it\u2019s pretty equal in terms of both hips and knees. So we don\u2019t see one category being above the other. And I like the fact that given the recent CMS changes, you\u2019re going to see sold their cases also accelerating the ASC. We believe that\u2019s a great opportunity for us here at Zimmer Biomet. So that\u2019s the answer on ASC. In terms of ROSA dynamics I think we\u2019ve been very transparent in terms of one-third, roughly one-third of all of our installations are happening in the ASC. That\u2019s a trend that has been happening for a few quarters, and that\u2019s a trend that we continue to see happen in the next quarters. In an ASC environment speed matters, not having to get engaged in complex pre-planning matters. Efficiency does matter and having a knee that you are confident it\u2019s going to be the right knee that matter. And those dynamics are driving ROSA penetration in the ASC. And then outside of the ASC, ROSA continues to perform. We are selling and placing ROSA\u2019s frankly at a rapid pace. You see in the other category, we saw nice increase that\u2019s driven by ROSA. And we are on track to at least install 300 units at the end of the year 2023 when it comes to ROSA, so really satisfied. And that\u2019s before we launch next generation ROSA across recon and deliver the first shoulder robotic platform. So excited about both ASC and ROSA. Thank you for the question, Josh.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Josh. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And Ivan, I have enjoyed watching your posts on LinkedIn. You looks like you\u2019ve traveled around the world literally since you\u2019ve taken over as CEO. I wanted to ask so if you start on the margins, you\u2019re going to end 2023 with an operating margin about 28.5% which is towards the high end of med-tech. Where \u2013 what do you see as peak margins for Zimmer? I mean, 5, 10 years ago the margins were in the low-thirties. Is that still realistic? And I had one follow-up.\nIvan Tornos: Yes. Sure. So good morning, Larry. Thanks for noticing. It\u2019s actually two years in a row where we\u2019ve expanded margins in the backdrop of really challenging environment, by the way, while also accelerating revenue. I think in 2022, we expanded margins, operating margins by about 40 to 50 bps. And this year, you\u2019re right, the implied is about 100 basis points. So again, really proud of what the ZB team has done collectively, again, in the backdrop of still investing for growth, which we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate. As we move into next year, I think I\u2019ve been pretty front footed in our ability to continue to grow margins in 2024. And quite frankly, we\u2019re going to do that in every year after 2024 and continue to deliver a profile where earnings are growing faster than revenue. I\u2019m not going to go out and put a marker out there as to where we think it can get to, but historical levels we will look for over time to definitely hate and exceed those. So I\u2019ll just leave it there. Again, really happy with where the team\u2019s performed over the last couple of years. Very confident what we\u2019re going to do next year. Quite excited about our outlook in the longer-term.\nLarry Biegelsen: That\u2019s helpful. And then the follow-up\u2026\nIvan Tornos: You had a follow-up, Larry?\nLarry Biegelsen: Yes. Other \u2013 the other category was obviously very strong. We heard you talk about gross of sales in the quarter. What was the change in the quarter that drove that strength and how sustainable is that? Thanks for taking the questions.\nIvan Tornos: Yes. I don\u2019t think there is anything changing really. There\u2019s not a change of strategy is we continue with ROSA. We continue to show strong clinical efficacy. We continue to demonstrate time neutrality after a few cases. We continue to see great adoption in an AC environment. We have three ROSA indications today within recon. So total knee partial and hip, we\u2019ve done a lot of podium presence. If you attended the Dallas meeting this last weekend. There was a lot of noise around posters and whatnot. So I think we just get in the right adoption is moving quickly. And then a driver, I will tell you has been tremendous. A lot of these cases that are done, the ASC do like or do one, a lot of surgeons in an ASC won the combination of robotics and cementless. In the past, we didn\u2019t have the right cementless construct. We do not with Persona OsseoTi. So I think that\u2019s been a bit of a tailwind, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a major change of the strategy is just the fact that it\u2019s been two, three years in market now and you\u2019re starting to see the data. So really excited in terms of what we are.\nLarry Biegelsen: Alright, thank you.\nSuky Upadhyay: Hey, Larry, just to get back to your original question, just to make sure I\u2019m completely clear. I do see getting back to historic margins are better over time. Absolutely, a definable objective for us, now having greater insight and taking over for option supply chain, I would say, this is an area where we can certainly do better. We\u2019re going to do better going forward. And I can tell you that the company\u2019s focus on not just revenue growth, but operating profit and free cash flow generation has been more acute and stronger than it\u2019s ever been. So I think we\u2019ve got the pathway, we\u2019ve got the culture, we\u2019ve got the levers to get there over time. Thank you.\nLarry Biegelsen: And Larry, yes, thank you for being my one follower on LinkedIn, the whole time, I said it was my wife. I\u2019m disappointed. Appreciate it.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Larry. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Chris Pasquale with Nephron.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. Just want to follow up real quickly on Larry\u2019s ROSA question. Was the mix of sales versus placements different in 3Q than what we saw in the first half of the year? Just trying to figure out whether that played a role or the acceleration in other sales was really driven by system volume.\nIvan Tornos: Yes. Thank you Chris, for the follow-up. We did see more sales. We haven\u2019t changed the strategy, so it\u2019s reflective of the fact that there is capital in the hospital systems across the world. And we saw people wanting to buy them and we sold the units. It\u2019s not a fundamental change, it\u2019s not a change in the strategy. We settled along that we prefer placing, given the annuity factor and whatnot. But yes, capital is strong and we did do some deals in some ASCs and in some of the systems and that\u2019s why you see the other category growing. Thank you, Chris.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then on SET, is the strategy there to lean into these focus categories that are already growing pretty well and then hope that the overall performance improves as they become a bigger part of the mix? Or do you see an opportunity to reinvigorate areas like lower extremities that maybe aren\u2019t on that list today?\nIvan Tornos: Yes. Let me start with the second part. We really don\u2019t do hope here. So we do have plans to drive better performance in the three areas that so far have not been that compelling, those being restorative therapies for an ankle and trauma. What I will tell you is that the restorative therapies, biologics, the issue, there was a reimbursement change a year ago that\u2019s been resolved. So that\u2019s not a concern moving forward. And then foot and ankle, lower extremities is something that we\u2019re looking at. It may require it some organic inorganic place, but given the space we paying close attention to what is that we need to do. And then trauma for many markets continues to be very attractive. We done some smaller tuck-ins, so I would expect that the declines that we have seen in the past are going to disappear. So again, not really doing hope there. We got plans to remediate and to get back to growth in those three categories. Now that said, the three most compelling priorities within set remain upper extremities shoulder, sports, medicine, and CMFT and those three are performing very nicely.\nChris Pasquale: Great. Thank you.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Chris. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess, a quick follow-up on M&A, any way to frame how much margin or EPS solution you\u2019re willing to take in yours one and two, realize you said neutral by year three. But curious kind of what the framework is on year one and two. And when you think about bid ask spreads, is a deal something you think you could get done this year or is it probably more something for 2024?\nSuky Upadhyay: Hey, Travis. This is Suky? I\u2019m not sure I completely got that second question. Can you repeat that?\nTravis Steed: Yes. In terms of like, when you think about like bid ask spreads and the progress on your conversations, is a deal happening in 2023 a possibility or is it probably something that we need to like the 2024 to see M&A?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. So first of all, on your first question around earnings per share dilution, that\u2019s really going to depend on the type of asset that we acquire, the size of the transaction, what market\u2019s in, where it is in its journey and its life cycle is a product that\u2019s just launched or something that\u2019s very mature in marketplace. So I\u2019m not going to sort of give a guidepost on year one or year two, because I think that would be premature because it is going to be very situation dependent. But what we will commit to is that we\u2019re going to look for break even by at least 20, 24 months, if not sooner than that, so that\u2019s the profile that we look for in our M&A. Now relative to bid ask and timing of course for a variety of reasons mostly proprietary. We\u2019re not going to get into the timing of any specific deal as you know, those are often opportunistic situation based. So here\u2019s what I would say is that we\u2019ve got a lot of strategic flexibility to balance sheets in the strongest position, it\u2019s been since the merger of Zimmer Biomet. We feel really good about the optionality we have going forward and we think we can deploy capital to continue to accelerate our growth profile and diversify the company. But I\u2019m not going to get any specific timing. I\u2019m sure you can appreciate that, but thank you for the question.\nTravis Steed: Yes. That\u2019s fair. Thank you. Thanks for the answer. And a couple housekeeping questions. The OUS, one time stuff in hips this quarter, does that get better in Q4? And when you think about tax rate next year, I heard your comments, but curious if that\u2019d be like on a less than a 100 basis points or more than a 100 basis points on tax rate. And when you think about the interest line, you\u2019ve got I think $850 million in debt coming due. So is interest a headwind or tell in next year?\nIvan Tornos: All right. I\u2019ll briefly comment in on Q4. I\u2019ll keep it simple. It does go away. So this is the one-timer and in Q4 we get back to growth. In terms of the tax and interest, Suky, do you want to comment on that?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. So on the expense line, right now we\u2019re not going to give full guidance on that. So we\u2019ll unveil that. I think the one thing you want to keep in the backdrop is we do believe we can grow earnings, we will grow earnings faster than revenue. On the tax rate, right now our best estimate is that it\u2019ll be about 150 basis point increase off of our full year 2023 tax rate.\nTravis Steed: Thank you. Thanks a lot.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Travis. I think we have time for maybe one last question. Katie, is there one in the queue?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Maybe just one question from me. This OUS hips, I think you called up Russia headwinds. Is that done with in fiscal 2023? Should that continue in the fiscal 2024? And I think you did speak about M&A. Can you comment on your hurdle rates you given current interest rate in monument for deals?\nIvan Tornos: Yes. Sure. Hey Vijay, it\u2019s good to hear from you. So on the OUS hip headwind, specifically due to Russia, if you go back the last quarter\u2019s call \u2013 second quarter, I talked about Russia being about a 50 basis point headwind in the back half of 2023. That estimate is still largely true and most of that occurred in the third quarter. So we\u2019re going to see a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s largely behind us. We don\u2019t see that as being a headwind at this time into 2024. And I\u2019m sorry, Vijay, could you repeat your question around.\nVijay Kumar: Sorry. On the deal M&A given current interest rate environment, can you talk with your herded rates for you know, deals?\nIvan Tornos: Yes. So look we would still look at debt financing over equity financing all day long. Even though, it\u2019s 2x of where it was a year ago, it\u2019s still versus historical rates still a pretty attractive source of capital. It has become marginally more difficult to make the deal economics work at, at these interest rates. So it just means that we\u2019ve got to be that much more disciplined on our valuation and in our purchase price. And so that\u2019s how we view things right now.\nOperator: Thanks, Vijay. And thanks everyone for the question. Yes, absolutely. I think now we\u2019re probably nearing the end of the call. I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ivan just for any closing remarks.\nA - Ivan Tornos: Yes, thank you Kerry. And I\u2019ll keep it to two minutes or less here so we can close on time. But a couple of things here. Number one, really, really pleased with the progress here at Zimmer Biomet really proud of the team and the work that they have done they are doing, and most importantly, the work I know that we are going to continue to do excited about the markets, lots of questions on market dynamics. Every data points suggests that their healthy markets, their durable markets no. We\u2019re not concerned about GLP-1s and I\u2019ll say that with the utmost respect and humility, but every data point shows that this is not something we should be concerned about. The performance is strong and it\u2019s going to continue to get there. We saw a great Q3 performance in recon net of the hip issue OUS. It was solid. I like where we are with both hips and knees here in the U.S. in the largest market. I like the fact that we\u2019ve seen set being in line now. I like the profile as we enter Q4 and as we get into 2024. I believe this will be the year for set. And I like the optionality that we got around M&A. So healthy market, solid portfolio, great opportunity to leverage the balance sheet. I do think it\u2019s a different place, a different environment. So really excited to be here. Look forward to leading this great team. I look forward to answering more questions in quarters to come. Thank you for your time today.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks everyone for joining us. The IR team will be in touch of course, and if you have questions or comments, please feel free to reach out. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks and good morning. I'd like to start my prepared remarks today by welcoming Ivan to his first earnings call as a Zimmer Biomet's CEO. Ivan has been a constant force and a driver within the organization for several years. And I'm proud to work with him, and I'm excited by the partnership. As Ivan noted, we had another strong quarter driven by healthy and improving end markets and continued strong execution across the organization. Overall, we remain on track to deliver mid-single digit, constant currency revenue growth, and adjusted operating margin expansion in the back half of the year, just as we committed to on our second quarter call. Moving to results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the third quarter and how it compares to the same period in 2022. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.754 billion, an increase of 5% on a reported basis, and an increase of 4.7% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, we had a selling day headwind of about 150 basis points that impacted all regions and product categories at about the same level. Excluding the selling day impact, consolidated ex-FX sales would have grown just over 6%. U.S. growth was 6%, and international growth was 2.9%. In the U.S., our strong year-over-year results were driven by recon and a step up in our S.E.T. category in tandem with strong capital sales. Outside of the U.S., we saw more moderated growth across Europe and Asia driven by tough comps and geopolitical headwinds, which I'll discuss in our product category section. Global knees grew 7.3% with the U.S. growing 6.1% and international growing 9.1%. The strong performance in knees was driven by continued uptake from our Persona product portfolio combined with the benefits of our ROSA robotics platform. Global hips declined by 60 basis points with the U.S. growing 3% and international declining by 4.2%. Tough comps in China and headwinds in Russia disproportionately impacted our OUS hip business. Excluding these impacts, our international hip business grew in the low single digits. Looking ahead, portfolio expansion will continue to support growth in our hips business. Next, the S.E.T. category grew 2.8%. Again, as a reminder, there was about 150 basis points selling day headwind across all categories and regions. Our key focus areas within S.E.T., including sports, upper extremities, and CMFT continue to post double-digit growth, which was partially offset by other subsegments within the category. We remain confident that S.E.T. will grow in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Finally, our other category grew 16.4% driven by ROSA sales. Now moving on to the P&L. In Q3, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 in the prior year. While we had higher year-over-year revenue and higher pre-tax operating profits, post-tax income was lower due to a favorable tax settlement in 2022 that did not repeat this year. On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of a $1.65, compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of a $1.58 in the prior year. The step up is primarily driven by revenue growth in the quarter, partially offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest costs. Our adjusted gross margin was 70.9%, up 20 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by favorable mix. Adjusted operating margin was 26.4% and up slightly versus the prior year. Better gross margin and savings from efficiencies across SG&A were partially offset by higher R&D expenses that will support upcoming product launches ultimately driving a continued increase in our vitality index. Net interest and other adjusted non-operating expenses of $48 million was higher than the prior year due to certain foreign currency exposures as well as higher interest rates. And our adjusted tax rate was 16.7% in the quarter. Turning to cash and liquidity, we had operating cash flows of $338 million and free cash flow of $189 million in the quarter. We ended with cash and cash equivalents totaling just under $300 million. Our balance sheet remains strong providing us financial flexibility and strategic optionality as we move forward. Now, regarding our outlook. Overall for 2023, the outlook remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter, implying over 7% constant currency revenue growth and 9% EPS growth at the mid points of our range. We expect reported growth for the full year to be 6% to 6.5% and are maintaining our ex-FX growth expectations for the year of 7% to 7.5%. Inside of that, the U.S. dollar has strengthened. So we are increasing our outlook for foreign currency to be about a 100 basis point headwind to revenue growth for the full year. Additionally, we are reiterating our EPS guidance of $7.47 to $7.57 for the full year. Despite the strengthening dollar, which we project to be about a $0.04 headwind to fourth quarter earnings. This guidance implies that we will increase full year operating margins by about a 100 basis points in the backdrop of a challenging environment. In addition to our formal guidance ranges, I will reiterate that there is no material impact from selling days on the full year revenue growth expectations. However, we do expect about a 100 basis point tailwind in the fourth quarter. Additionally, our expectations for interest and other non-operating expenses as well as tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged. We expect free cash flow for the year to be between $950 million and $1 billion. In summary, we delivered another excellent quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We remain confident in our 2023 expectations and are excited about the next year with revenue growing in the mid-single digits and earnings growing faster than the top line. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. Yes. Hey, Robbie. Good morning. Thanks for the question. First thing I'd say is starting with the back half of this year, we committed to mid-single digit ex-FX growth for the second half of the year with operating margin expansion both sequentially and year-over-year. Q3 was a really another strong validation proof point of that. And we feel confident in that profile. The reason I mention that is I think it gives us a running start as we go into 2024. And so, I do want to talk a little bit about 2024 back to your question. First, we've already provided a lot of color, I think, on 2024 more than most of our peers. But we feel that being transparent, giving you guys a robust view of what we're going to do, not only this year, but into the future is really important. But let me talk a little bit about the headwinds and tailwinds as we see it going into 2024 and some things have modestly changed. First, I'll start with the headwinds. One, we do see a higher tax rate into next year because of the OECD's Pillar Two. Secondly, based on where FX rates are today, we'd see some additional pressure from a foreign currency perspective into next year. Again, both of these are more macro versus execution, right? They're things that are outside of our control, but we're going to contend with them and we're going to deal with them. And I'll tell you a little bit about how. On the tailwind side, I would say, yes, we are more confident in our outlook for revenue next year. Our end markets are stronger than they've ever been. Our portfolio and new product launches have been executing extremely well in some areas above our expectation. Our performance relative to market has been very strong, and that's consistent and durable. And quite frankly, we're seeing a more moderated pricing environment still erosion, but much more moderated than what we've see in historically. All of those elements give us confidence that we're going to be able to post a mid-single digit growth top line ex-FX into 2024. And then, despite those sort of P&L headwinds I talked about, we do believe that we're going to be able to grow earnings faster than revenue. I talked about gross margin next year, stepping down because of the FX hedge gains from this year, not repeating at the same level. That will still happen, but we're going to be able to offset some of that. The operations and manufacturing team has been working really hard at efficiency. And so we feel more optimistic about where gross margin is going into next year. Secondly, as I said, we've already got a running start on a lot of SG&A efficiency programs in the back half of this year that are going to run into next year. So when you combine those two elements together again, we feel really confident that we're going to be able to do that mid-single digit top line growth next year, as well as earnings growing faster than revenue. So, thanks again, Robbie, for the question. Yes. I think just building on that, remember the first half of this year, which was very strong, was more about comps versus 2021, or excuse me, versus 2022. Then it was something about abnormal market growth. So again, just building off what Ivan said, we feel confident in that. Now we're not of course giving specific guidance, and we're certainly not giving quarterly guidance into next year. So, as always quarters can be choppy or driven by seasonality mix changes, but overall, we're confident that the single vision. Thank you. Sure. Hey Shagun, this is Suky. Thanks for the question. So just first some fourth quarter, I'll just keep going back to \u2013 we don't give quarterly guidance and obviously with our implied, you can pretty much squeeze into the last quarter of the year. We talked about mid-single digit growth margins expanding in the back half of this year, and we're going to deliver on that. We have a range around our guidance. Obviously, the \u2013 to the downside, geopolitical factors continue to be erosive or supply doesn't continue to, that very positive trend has been on. Then you're towards the bottom end. However, if that supply picks up and it remediates even faster than it's already been improving, then as well as better execution on our new products, we could be at the upper end. So there's a range around that and so I'll just leave it at that. But overall, we feel really good about where we're ending the second half of this year and where our end markets are. As we look into next year, I think you've seen a bit of a pivot where our commentary was before anchoring towards 4%, maybe even better to now where we're saying mid-single digit. And I think that reflects the momentum that we've seen to your point in 2022 and 2023. Hey, Larry, just to get back to your original question, just to make sure I'm completely clear. I do see getting back to historic margins are better over time. Absolutely, a definable objective for us, now having greater insight and taking over for option supply chain, I would say, this is an area where we can certainly do better. We're going to do better going forward. And I can tell you that the company's focus on not just revenue growth, but operating profit and free cash flow generation has been more acute and stronger than it's ever been. So I think we've got the pathway, we've got the culture, we've got the levers to get there over time. Thank you. Hey, Travis. This is Suky? I'm not sure I completely got that second question. Can you repeat that? Yes. So first of all, on your first question around earnings per share dilution, that's really going to depend on the type of asset that we acquire, the size of the transaction, what market's in, where it is in its journey and its life cycle is a product that's just launched or something that's very mature in marketplace. So I'm not going to sort of give a guidepost on year one or year two, because I think that would be premature because it is going to be very situation dependent. But what we will commit to is that we're going to look for break even by at least 20, 24 months, if not sooner than that, so that's the profile that we look for in our M&A. Now relative to bid ask and timing of course for a variety of reasons mostly proprietary. We're not going to get into the timing of any specific deal as you know, those are often opportunistic situation based. So here's what I would say is that we've got a lot of strategic flexibility to balance sheets in the strongest position, it's been since the merger of Zimmer Biomet. We feel really good about the optionality we have going forward and we think we can deploy capital to continue to accelerate our growth profile and diversify the company. But I'm not going to get any specific timing. I'm sure you can appreciate that, but thank you for the question. Yes. So on the expense line, right now we're not going to give full guidance on that. So we'll unveil that. I think the one thing you want to keep in the backdrop is we do believe we can grow earnings, we will grow earnings faster than revenue. On the tax rate, right now our best estimate is that it'll be about 150 basis point increase off of our full year 2023 tax rate."

            "content": "Yes, thank you Kerry. And I'll keep it to two minutes or less here so we can close on time. But a couple of things here. Number one, really, really pleased with the progress here at Zimmer Biomet really proud of the team and the work that they have done they are doing, and most importantly, the work I know that we are going to continue to do excited about the markets, lots of questions on market dynamics. Every data points suggests that their healthy markets, their durable markets no. We're not concerned about GLP-1s and I'll say that with the utmost respect and humility, but every data point shows that this is not something we should be concerned about. The performance is strong and it's going to continue to get there. We saw a great Q3 performance in recon net of the hip issue OUS. It was solid. I like where we are with both hips and knees here in the U.S. in the largest market. I like the fact that we've seen set being in line now. I like the profile as we enter Q4 and as we get into 2024. I believe this will be the year for set. And I like the optionality that we got around M&A. So healthy market, solid portfolio, great opportunity to leverage the balance sheet. I do think it's a different place, a different environment. So really excited to be here. Look forward to leading this great team. I look forward to answering more questions in quarters to come. Thank you for your time today."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Ivan Tornos",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Keri. And good morning, and greetings, everyone from Warsaw, Indiana, the orthopedic capital of the world, welcome to our Q3 earnings call. My first call as the CEO [indiscernible] organization really grateful that all of you are joining us here this morning. I'd like to begin by sharing how truly excited I am to be in the new role. Team to be a very inspiring time, not just in musculoskeletal health, which it is, but also in med-tech in general. Simply put the space is not what it used to be just so five years ago. When you look at orthopedics, when you look at the entire category, it's changed, it's changed a lot. Groundbreaking technologies are shaping how procedures are done beyond the backlog and continuing femoral demographics, global demand for treatment is higher than it has historically been This is driven by better clinically reported outcomes. This is driven by shorter episodes of care. This is driven by better, more comfortable ways to do physical therapy. This is driven by greater ways to approach different disease states. And this is driven by subtle treatment migrations like the one we see here in the U.S. with a rapid shift of cases moving into an ASC while also preserving what are very compelling volume levels in the traditional in-patient and outpatient settings. So in plain English, healthy market, great patient dynamics, new technology, disruptive innovation, a lot has changed. And I don't see us going back to four or five years ago. So again, a very inspiring time to be in musculoskeletal health and orthopedics in general. All of these market accelerating trends are opening new doors for countless patients to benefit from what we do here at ZB, which is to drive life changing solutions. And we do that every single day for countless patients. And the best part about it, we're just getting started. So I could not be more excited to be here in my new role. With this encouraging market dynamics, sustainable trends, and building on the solid track record of execution that the ZB team has enabled. It's great to be here today to report what it is, another solid quarter of a strong performance while strongly reaffirming our year-end guidance for the year 2023. Even more exciting, as I look forward to our future, I'm more convinced than ever that Zimmer Biomet will continue to lead the way on customer-centric innovation, already a competitive advantage and solid commercial execution, enabling not just the delivery of our mission, but also improving on our other key value creation drivers, those regaining and sustaining top quartile performance. And again, this is something that we treat with a lot of rigor and something that is a mandate for the organization. We must regain and sustain top quartile performance. For today's call, I want to first share my thoughts on my first two months as CEO of Zimmer Biomet, while also providing key insights into what I've learned, how my learning has shaped what are going to be my three key priorities as the new CEO of the enterprise. This will answer the question on what is fundamentally going to change around here in the next chapter of our transformation. After that, I'm going to talk about the key drivers behind the solid Q3 performance, next Suky will take over, will discuss the financials for the quarter as well as the expectations for the rest of the year, and then our favorite part of the call Q&A. Before we move into these updates, I do want to take a moment to thank the global Zimmer Biomet team for their unwavering commitment to our purpose, to our plans. I want to thank them for their sense of urgency in driving site execution. I want to thank them for everything that they do. This is a highly engaged and focused team that is being operating at a very rapid speed and is eagerly designed to do even more, more for patients, more for customers, more for the team, more for each other, more for the company, more for the communities where we work and live, like right here in Warsaw, and frankly, far more for the shareholders. It's a team that has gone through a lot, and a lot is a lot. This team has done a lot of heavy lifting, and now with the heavy lifting behind from a remediation standpoint, it's great to be in a different stage and it's great to be able to show to the world what the Zimmer Biomet team can do and will do. Beyond proud of the organization and I'm genuinely inspired by what they do each and every day. Been doing this for a while around the world, and I can truthfully tell you I've never worked with a better team than the one we have here at Zimmer Biomet. And again, I can hardly wait to showcase our results in quarters to come. So thank you. I also want to thank Bryan Hanson for all that Bryan lead to bring Zimmer Biomet to this moment. We are grateful and we're stronger because of his leadership. So thank you, Bryan. Now let me share some perspective as the new CEO of Zimmer Biomet. During my first 11 weeks or 77 days in the job, I've spent significant time with team members, customers, analysts, investors, or Board, my peers, healthcare executives across med-tech, government officials, and other key stakeholders in healthcare so that I could listen, I could learn and I could get the property insights. I've been in every Zimmer Biomet region around the globe. I've interacted with every key manufacturing facility. I have visited hundreds of decision makers across every major continent, and I have collected countless pages of feedback and recommendations. Most critically, I've used this reflection time to ensure that we at Zimmer Biomet are boldly prioritizing what needs to get done. And this, I can assure you would be a trademark of my time as CEO of Zimmer Biomet, having the courage to say no to several things so that we can become truly great in those things that will drive the most value for the enterprise and our key stakeholders. These key priorities are purpose and people, number one. We have a winning culture. We have the absolute best talent in the industry. It has been a foundational priority for ZB and will continue to be critical under my leadership. People, purpose, talent, culture with a very data centric organization, and we use the same level of data centricity to track how it is that we're doing with our human capital. To that end, we track level of engagement, development, DEI, engagement across different segments and geographies, high potential ratings and everything in between. I'm really excited to report that, or the most recent engagement survey, which we completed about six weeks ago delivered the absolute best scores in the history of the company. Let me say that again. The latest engagement score for organization close to 20,000 employees showcase the absolute best scores in the history of the organization, frankly, going up across every single category. This tells me that the team is energized. This tells me that the team is ready, and this tells me that the team is about to unleash a lot of greatness for the organization. The second priority is to create and sustain a framework of operational excellence across the Board. Simply put is about being great when it comes to running the business. This means simplifying what we do, where we play, and how we play. This means being courageous and bold about the choices that we make. It starts with being intention about driving sustainable revenue growth. We know this is the number one driver of top quartile performance, and we also know that innovation, customer-centric innovation and commercial execution are the two key drivers of sustainable revenue growth. So we'll accelerate that, but at the same time, we're not going to forget that we can and will do better across the entirety of the P&L. We're going to drive a culture of ownership by every single employee across the globe. With all of us waking up every single day acting as true investors in the business and thinking of time and money as the key currencies of the organization. This means continuing to align our incentives with an even greater emphasis on best-in-class performance from both top and bottom. By delivering on operational excellence, as a mandate or mindset for the organization, we're going to enable, number one, revenue growth of at least 100 to 200 basis points our market, while growing earnings faster than revenue and free cash flow growing faster than the rate of earnings. Number two, operational excellence will enable best-in-class supply and operational outcomes by simplifying a rather complex operations and manufacturing footprint. And then thirdly, operational excellence as a mandate is going to enable an agile, nimble, and simplify company that can anticipate \u2013 can be proactive in successfully navigating market trends. So again, operational excellence and mindset is going to deliver revenue growth of at least a 100 to 200 basis points of market while growing earnings faster than revenue and free cash flow faster than the rate of earnings, while enabling best-in-class supply and operational outcomes and by making Zimmer Biomet, agile, nimble, and a very simplified company that is proactive in what it does. Based on where we are, as we close the year 2023 and based on our latest guidance, we're already on track to deliver the metrics that I mentioned above around revenue, earnings and free cash flow the way we're run the company, but we expect to do it again with even greater rigor in 2024. To that end, we look forward to hosting an Analyst Day, something we've not done ever since we merged the two companies. And at that Analyst Day, we're going to be sharing more details on these thought that I have highlighted and the specific drivers of these goals. So this becomes truly the DNA of Zimmer Biomet. Priority is about innovating and diversifying Zimmer Biomet into higher growth markets, table stakes. We must enter higher growth markets. We do need to diversify our portfolio, and we'll do that. We're going to do it through organic and inorganic means, we're going to do it through innovation and M&A. On the innovation front, we're going to innovate by continuing to boldly invest in the right segments of R&D, so that is new product development. So that we always think customer problems and bringing solutions to those problems. We're going to make sure that those problems are in attractive growth areas that are mission-centric, but also are in the right markets. And by bringing those solutions, we're going to become and remain market leaders in these categories where we choose to play aided by both product and solutions launches that will enable category leadership for Zimmer Biomet. We're going to be relentless about the certain opportunities, namely the ASC opportunity here in the U.S. where we are already growing in the strong double-digit rates, but we know we are far from realizing our true potential. This journey, by the way, innovation journey has already started. We're on track to launch over 40 new products over the next 36 months. And the value \u2013 the dollar value for pipeline today is twice the dollar value that we had back in 2018. So a lot of new exciting technologies are about to get launched here at Zimmer Biomet. In addition, 80% of our products in our pipeline, we're studying markets that are growing at least 4%, many in areas that are growing more than 4%. Equally vital, we're going to ensure that the innovation journey accelerates value creation through making sure that we monitoring not just the revenue associated with these launches, the vitality index, but also what we call our innovation profitability index or IPI, and that's the gross margin dollars coming from new products. We got to make sure that these new products are driving margin accretion to the overall margin profile of the organization. So again, it's about innovation and it's about value creation at the same time. Mission and margin expansion will coexist and will coexist as part of our innovation journey. To materially change our portfolio, we're going to also leverage the strength of our balance sheet, which is stronger than ever. We will do M&A. We're going to be thoughtful and disciplined about the spaces we prioritize, and we're going to ensure that the spaces are mission centric, and at the same time, these spaces are the areas where Zimmer Biomet has a right to win. We focus on opportunities that are going to hit strategic thresholds, but also hit financial thresholds. We're going to make sure that these acquisitions drive a strong returns and create long-term shareholder value. It is worth noting that this diversification of our business has started already. Yes, we have to be bolder and we will be bolder, but it has already started. In the last two, three years, we have shifted our portfolio already into mid single digit or above market environments and our weighted average market growth rates have already increased from 50 basis points. And this happened through thoughtful resource allocation and some of the active portfolio management we've done. Again, we're going to be bolder, but the journey has already started. I'm excited about what we can and we'll do across these three priorities. It's about first and foremost people, human capital, having a best-in-class culture. Secondly, it's about delivering operational excellence as a company mindset or mandate. And thirdly, it's about making sure that we diversify and innovate in a far bolder way through organic and inorganic means. Those are my three priorities. So now that you got a better sense of all priorities. I want to talk about Q3. And again, I want to reiterate that we're really excited about the performance that was on the quarter. Performance, that that was driven by continued execution, especially in the key areas where we've been investing. In particular, I want to talk about niche. It was a great quarter for niche, where we delivered a both market performance in key markets around the world. We also grew in areas that are mission critical within set upper extremities, CMFT, as well as sports medicine. We had solid performance in the ASC environment and we saw revenue generation coming strongly from our data technology and solutions platform, primarily within ROSA and Mobility. In knees, Persona OsseoTi are highly differentiated cementless platform continues to perform above our expectations. I was recently in Dallas at the hip and knee society, and the feedback continues to be superb. Can't wait until we continue to bring this technology to other geographies. ROSA had a strong quarter continue to see great adoption. We've seen a lot of gross adoption happening in the ASC setting, where speed, we're dealing with higher volumes that matter. In the ASC, we continue to see growth in the teams, and we're executing contracts daily or portfolio second to none, and we're benefiting from the recent acquisitions we done such as Embody and ReLign, against the backdrop of this strong execution, Medtech sector stocks have been facing pressure related to GLP-1 drugs and the impact or the perceived impact on obesity. This from a long-term perspective. With a mission-centric patient in the board organization, so if this drug class truly does accelerate and improves patient health, and if these drugs truly do become the end of the obesity pandemic around the world that is great news for everyone as long as truly this is sustainable in the long-term.\n528 million [ph]: Obesity is certainly an accelerator of the disease and certainly is an element of the disease or a driver of the disease. But let's not forget that once the cartilage is damaged, there is no recovery. Once you get osteoarthritis, you will not get rid of osteoarthritis. And dropping weight is not going to cure osteoarthritis. Again, this is a degenerative and non-curable disease that we're talking about. If anything, obesity is a blocker today to joint surgery as many surgeons are uncomfortable operating on patients with a BMI greater than 40% countries or even above the 30 thresholds in some locations. So why could GLP-1s then be a tailwind for orthopedics? Three compelling reasons. First, if you can lower the patient's BMI below a certain threshold, 40 or 30 in some cases these patients now become eligible for surgery. And all the data points that we're getting in primary markets like the U.S. is that there is a large percentage of patients who today are not going through surgery because their BMI is too high. Secondly, if a patient does lose their weight, and I would say, this is pretty logical and they do become more active, there will be a greater risk for additional joint procedures because there will be injury. And third, if a patient loses weight, they are likely to live longer, again, expanding the patient final for an orthopedic procedure. A good example of this fact is Japan, the second largest market in the world for osteoarthritis with minimal obesity rates, but very long life expectancy dynamics. We've not seen any near-term impact from GLP-1s, and we've seen the long-term impact would be a positive one for orthopedics and Zimmer Biomet. We've engaged independent third parties to perform surgeon surveys and have gathered U.S. based claims data. What still is early in the process, we are very excited about the initial findings. We look forward to sharing them. So in an nutshell, more of a tail win. We'll be sharing data very soon. And We think that the logic will prevail, and this will be the end of what has been so far a rather emotional argument that is not being fact-based. In closing, I hope you can tell that I'm very confident about the future of this organization. I'm very excited to be here. Our end markets have never been stronger. I will believe that this market beyond the backlog is sustainable. Our execution is strong and is also sustainable. We've been delivering consistently for a while. And we'll continue to do so with even greater focus and speed. We know what we need to do. The strategy is clear and we will execute on the strategy. We have financial flexibility to invest in higher growth markets, and we are going to continue to shift our portfolio mix and diversify our business. I generally believe this is the time for Zimmer Biomet. I'm proud of the work we've done and even more proud of the work that we're going to be doing ahead. This is why I'm excited to be the CEO and even more excited to be proud Zimmer Biomet shareholder as I believe that now is the time for real value creation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Suky for a run through of our Q3 financials. Suky? Hey, thank you, Robbie. I'll start, I'll talk about the market dynamics and briefly I'll comment on 2024. I'll pass it on to Suky to provide more color on 2024 and maybe discuss what he can discuss at this point when it comes to the margin profile. But I'll start with the market dynamics. We're the fourth company to report in Q3. So by now everybody sees that the markets are healthy. And quite frankly, I won't talk much about Q4, but so far so good. So this is not a one quarter type of market dynamic. The reasons behind the market profile, the market growth profile and why I continue to say this market is different than four or five years ago is the things that I alluded to in my prepared remarks. The explosion of ASCs, the movement, the shift to ASC is real. That means new ASCs are opening in the U.S. That means [indiscernible] surgery are happening. Demographics around the world play a factor. We continue to track data in terms of the age for someone to get a hip or a knee. And these are younger patients. In the U.S., we would also see more days of surgery. And I don't think this is just a backlog dynamic pricing, you see what every single one of us is reporting these days. It's not the same pricing dynamic that we've had in the past. And beyond that, the technology. We are driving disruptive innovation. We got more efficient solutions, surgeries are shorter, and the episode occurred is shorter. So we are dealing with the patients, the fellow patients with more efficiency. Again, this is a durable trend. It's happening in Q3. As I think about Q4, nothing is really changing. As we look into 2024, every early indicator suggests that things are not going to change. And relative to performance, well, look in the background of these healthy market dynamics in the U.S., we gain share in Q3 in both categories. Really proud of being number one in knees for the quarter. We don't pay a lot of attention to any given quarter, but that is a fact that we're the fastest growing company in the quarter. And then globally net of a couple of one-timers both in Russia and China. When it comes to hips, our performance was in line with hips and knees was very strong. And then as we get to 2024, I'll let Suky comment, but we will be mid-single digit. That's the point of entry. And nothing has really changed. It's just getting closer to the end of the year and realizing that these market trends are sustainable. And the innovation pipeline that we have will drive the type of growth. But I'll pass it on to Suky to comment on all the drivers. Yes, Drew, thank you very much. And first things first, you should be in your honeymoon considering that you got married recently. So I'm disappointed you here. Look, I'm going to keep this short and sweet. We don't see backlog as a major driver, growth profile for the next year. So when Suky and I said on mid-single digit, we're not assuming any real meaningful backlog. So not a key driver. We believe and we spend a lot of time going back and forth on backlog that is going to remain here throughout the end of 2024 at least. But we are not a backlog depending \u2013 backlog dependent type of a company. So we don't have \u2013 we don't focus on that. What we're tracking is innovation, the pipeline that we have, but we're tracking is the investments we made in the ASC we're tracking is commercial execution and in the background, just sustainable pricing dynamics. So no backlog. Thank you. Yes, absolutely. Great question. First things first. Q3 S.E.T. was in line. As we move into Q4, we're actually going to be a mid-single digit grower. I'm not going to talk about S.E.T dynamics for 2024. We'll do that coming guidance, but very excited in terms of where we are. We integrated a couple of companies we have seen SportsMed. Those are performing very well. Our upper extremities, our shoulder business is growing in the mid to upper single digits in most regions. When you look at our CMFT, craniomaxillofacial thoracic, which is part of S.E.T. It has been performing very well. It continues to perform very well. So, again, lots of reasons to believe that as we getting 2024, you should expect a sustainable performance in S.E.T. In terms of M&A, again, we're coming more on that later, but it remains the number one recipient of capital allocation. We haven't changed in that regard. And yet, S.E.T. is one category that is very attractive, given the higher market growth dynamics or position in the space. So you should assume that this is one area where we're going to be focusing from an M&A standpoint. But again, native M&A already delivering mid-single digit growth entering Q4 strongly, and we are excited about 2024. Thank you. Yes, I'll start Matt, and again, Suky maybe want to chime in here. But we confident about 2024 because the market dynamics are sustainable. So there has been a lot of back and forth in terms of what's going to happen once the backlog is out and all that. First, the backlog. We don't think it's going to be out anytime soon. And then pricing is sustainable. And all the things that I mentioned, excuse me, my answer to Robbie, are here. They move to the ASC the shorter episodes of care more days of surgery. So macro wise every data point we get in that is very compelling. And then on the micro, we are seeing a bolus of innovation being launched. We got 40 new products that we're going to be launching over the next 36 months. Some of these products are very compelling. We launched our Persona OsseoTi, which is the cementless construct earlier in 2023. That is going to be a full \u2013 truly full market release in the U.S. in 2024 with the right amount of S.E.T.s and that's high growth. As we enter the first semester of 2024 to your point, is another two or three very meaningful product launches. Some in robotics, some within recon, some in S.E.T., that's very compelling. The integration of embodying, the integration of relying continues to generate revenue. I could spend an hour, but I will tell you that is the balance of really sustainable micro dynamics and solid innovation. And then on top of that, you got great commercial execution with a highly engaged sales force. So I'm not \u2013 we are not deeply concerned about the about the comps. And maybe one last comment here, Matt, quickly we can move on. Don't forget that the first semester of 2023, while it had very solid comps, also had pretty challenging dynamics from a supply standpoint. So as we think about 2024, that we believe it's going to be a tailwind. Yes, go ahead. Go ahead, Shagun. Yes, absolutely. So on M&A, as already mentioned, and it was in my prepared remarks as well, it will remain our top strategic priority from a capital allocation standpoint. So that's not changing. And we're excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us. We're going to continue to focus on growth markets or areas that are not only mission-centric, but offer an exciting growth profile. And that is three things. No ranking order. Three key areas, segments within recon that are growing faster than [indiscernible] or collected or collective market growth rates. And there's a lot in there. You got navigation. You got data, technology, elements of recon that are really attractive. Two is set as we've done already. Buying things in sports med, buying things in CMFT, and then looking at other categories that I don't want to get into for our competitive dynamics. But again, optionality there. And then ASC is also one attractive area, is one area where we have dedicated resources, we growing in the teams. We have currently 10% to 15% of our sales in that space. And there is opportunities there to acquire things. So that's a bit of the strategic summary of where we go from an M&A perspective. In terms of financials, we're not changing the story. We like to do things up to $2 billion in acquisition price. And again, that gives you a lot of options. You can do a mid-size deal. You can do some tuck-ins combination of different things. We want these deals to be EPS neutral within two years. And we spoke about high-single digit ROIC within five years. So that's a bit of a strategic and financial profile. As we look into the next three or five years, we spend a lot of time, Suky and I have spent a lot of time looking at the strap plan. What is the growth profile? The great news is that we convinced that the free cash flow generation is solid. So we're going to be able to do M&A and potentially do other stuff when it comes to capital allocation. So that's the answer to your first question. On ASC, look, I don't think we need to do much more. We growing in the strong things already here in the U.S. in the ASC. I mentioned 10% to 15% of our sales are there. We got the right portfolio. This is now where we were let's say three, four years ago. We got the right robotic platform for the ASC. We got a great cementless Knee that is gaining there very quickly. We got a full bag in sports and across set. We got best-in-class technology so the portfolio is great. We got dedicated resources, which you very much need in an ASC environment. We have a dedicated sales force. We got simple contracting, simplified contracting, and look what we don't have organically, we partner with others. So whether it's sterilization, booms and lights or other stuff, we got the right partnerships. So very, very confident that we're going to continue to perform in the ASC environment. Thank you. All right. Let's see if my memory is as good as I think it is. So starting with ASC macro wise, we believe that roughly between 40% to 60% of cases in the next five years are going to move to the ASC. And I will say that a large portion of cases are already moving to the ASC. What we like about this dynamic is that as cases are moving to the ASC, other cases are going to in-patient and outpatients. So it's a little bit of a double dip happening their just, but yes, the number is 40% to 60% over the next three to five years. And I would say a good percentage has already moved. We are growing in the upper teens when it comes to the ASC and today around 10% to 15% repeating myself of cases or revenue rather of Zimmer Biomet comes from the ASC. I will tell you that it's pretty equal in terms of both hips and knees. So we don't see one category being above the other. And I like the fact that given the recent CMS changes, you're going to see sold their cases also accelerating the ASC. We believe that's a great opportunity for us here at Zimmer Biomet. So that's the answer on ASC. In terms of ROSA dynamics I think we've been very transparent in terms of one-third, roughly one-third of all of our installations are happening in the ASC. That's a trend that has been happening for a few quarters, and that's a trend that we continue to see happen in the next quarters. In an ASC environment speed matters, not having to get engaged in complex pre-planning matters. Efficiency does matter and having a knee that you are confident it's going to be the right knee that matter. And those dynamics are driving ROSA penetration in the ASC. And then outside of the ASC, ROSA continues to perform. We are selling and placing ROSA's frankly at a rapid pace. You see in the other category, we saw nice increase that's driven by ROSA. And we are on track to at least install 300 units at the end of the year 2023 when it comes to ROSA, so really satisfied. And that's before we launch next generation ROSA across recon and deliver the first shoulder robotic platform. So excited about both ASC and ROSA. Thank you for the question, Josh. Yes. Sure. So good morning, Larry. Thanks for noticing. It's actually two years in a row where we've expanded margins in the backdrop of really challenging environment, by the way, while also accelerating revenue. I think in 2022, we expanded margins, operating margins by about 40 to 50 bps. And this year, you're right, the implied is about 100 basis points. So again, really proud of what the ZB team has done collectively, again, in the backdrop of still investing for growth, which we've been able to demonstrate. As we move into next year, I think I've been pretty front footed in our ability to continue to grow margins in 2024. And quite frankly, we're going to do that in every year after 2024 and continue to deliver a profile where earnings are growing faster than revenue. I'm not going to go out and put a marker out there as to where we think it can get to, but historical levels we will look for over time to definitely hate and exceed those. So I'll just leave it there. Again, really happy with where the team's performed over the last couple of years. Very confident what we're going to do next year. Quite excited about our outlook in the longer-term. You had a follow-up, Larry? Yes. I don't think there is anything changing really. There's not a change of strategy is we continue with ROSA. We continue to show strong clinical efficacy. We continue to demonstrate time neutrality after a few cases. We continue to see great adoption in an AC environment. We have three ROSA indications today within recon. So total knee partial and hip, we've done a lot of podium presence. If you attended the Dallas meeting this last weekend. There was a lot of noise around posters and whatnot. So I think we just get in the right adoption is moving quickly. And then a driver, I will tell you has been tremendous. A lot of these cases that are done, the ASC do like or do one, a lot of surgeons in an ASC won the combination of robotics and cementless. In the past, we didn't have the right cementless construct. We do not with Persona OsseoTi. So I think that's been a bit of a tailwind, but I wouldn't say it's a major change of the strategy is just the fact that it's been two, three years in market now and you're starting to see the data. So really excited in terms of what we are. Yes. Thank you Chris, for the follow-up. We did see more sales. We haven't changed the strategy, so it's reflective of the fact that there is capital in the hospital systems across the world. And we saw people wanting to buy them and we sold the units. It's not a fundamental change, it's not a change in the strategy. We settled along that we prefer placing, given the annuity factor and whatnot. But yes, capital is strong and we did do some deals in some ASCs and in some of the systems and that's why you see the other category growing. Thank you, Chris. Yes. Let me start with the second part. We really don't do hope here. So we do have plans to drive better performance in the three areas that so far have not been that compelling, those being restorative therapies for an ankle and trauma. What I will tell you is that the restorative therapies, biologics, the issue, there was a reimbursement change a year ago that's been resolved. So that's not a concern moving forward. And then foot and ankle, lower extremities is something that we're looking at. It may require it some organic inorganic place, but given the space we paying close attention to what is that we need to do. And then trauma for many markets continues to be very attractive. We done some smaller tuck-ins, so I would expect that the declines that we have seen in the past are going to disappear. So again, not really doing hope there. We got plans to remediate and to get back to growth in those three categories. Now that said, the three most compelling priorities within set remain upper extremities shoulder, sports, medicine, and CMFT and those three are performing very nicely. Thank you. All right. I'll briefly comment in on Q4. I'll keep it simple. It does go away. So this is the one-timer and in Q4 we get back to growth. In terms of the tax and interest, Suky, do you want to comment on that? Yes. Sure. Hey Vijay, it's good to hear from you. So on the OUS hip headwind, specifically due to Russia, if you go back the last quarter's call \u2013 second quarter, I talked about Russia being about a 50 basis point headwind in the back half of 2023. That estimate is still largely true and most of that occurred in the third quarter. So we're going to see a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter, but it's largely behind us. We don't see that as being a headwind at this time into 2024. And I'm sorry, Vijay, could you repeat your question around. Yes. So look we would still look at debt financing over equity financing all day long. Even though, it's 2x of where it was a year ago, it's still versus historical rates still a pretty attractive source of capital. It has become marginally more difficult to make the deal economics work at, at these interest rates. So it just means that we've got to be that much more disciplined on our valuation and in our purchase price. And so that's how we view things right now."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman, President and CEO; and EVP and CFO, Suky Upadhyay; and COO, Ivan Tornos. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties and in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements.  Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q2 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?\nBryan Hanson: All right. Thanks, Keri, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. It's always good to be with you. But I would say it's even a little better and certainly more fun when we have great performance in the quarter. So we're pretty happy about the results that we get to discuss today, and I can tell you, we're looking forward to the dialogue.  And I'll start things up, as we normally do, I'll talk about our Q2 performance and the key drivers inside of the quarter. But I think also really important is to talk about the key drivers that we see continuing to move this business forward.  And then Suky will walk us through the financial details of the quarter and importantly, discuss how we are again raising our full year financial guidance. And then, of course, we'll close things out with a Q&A session, and we look forward to answering your questions and having a dialogue in that session.  Okay. To kick things off, I'm just going to take a step back, which I've been doing now for the last handful of quarters and I think deservedly so, because I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you to each and every one of our team members around the world because it's your hard work, it's your dedication to getting the job done that is moving this business forward.  And I will tell you that I'm proud to say that you have delivered another very strong quarter, while once again making ZB a certified Great Place to Work. And you've done all of this while improving our scores and as a result of that, our rankings on the environmental, social and governance front.  So I think simply stated, we are doing well, while also doing good. And that means for our team members, our patients, our customers and our communities and even our planet. So once again, I want to say thank you to our team for all that you do for ZB and to move our mission forward. And most importantly, for doing it together as one team, one ZB team. Now let's talk about the second quarter. And I'm just going to say simply, we delivered another strong quarter, again beating our own expectations. And that performance positions us to again raise our financial guidance on both the top and bottom line. And this is in the face of some pretty significant macro factors that are impacting us in the entire market. Ongoing supply challenges are very real, and I'll talk about those in a minute, but also inflationary pressure, a tough labor market and the geopolitical landscape that is putting pressure on everybody. But against that, I feel very confident about our pipeline, our execution and the team's demonstrated ability to navigate these headwinds, which gives us confidence to increase our financial outlook.  Okay. With that said, let's talk about the key drivers inside of Q2, and there were some positives and there were some negatives. I'll start with the positives, and the most important one, in my view, is that our team's execution remains flawless. We're seeing significant traction, probably the best we've ever seen with our new product innovation. And that paid dividends in the quarter for sure, but most importantly, is it pays dividends as we move this business forward.  And I would say that procedure recovery continued in the quarter, again showing no meaningful impact from COVID or staffing challenges, and that allowed for a tailwind from increased provider capacity, and that resulted in backlog pull-through in the quarter.  In terms of headwinds, I would say that the team is doing a great job of managing the supply-constrained environment. But I would say that it is still very clearly a governor to our overall growth in the quarter, and it continues to be a distraction for the organization.  See if I combine these things, though, all in all, our momentum continues, and it continues to grow. And I've said before, my confidence in this business, our confidence in this business is as high as it's ever been. And it's high for a good reason. If you just look at the knee franchise alone, our innovation strategy is working. We now have 4 meaningful pillars inside of this business. All of which can drive pricing stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions.  First, let's look at the ROSA Robotic Platform combined with our Persona cementless Knee. Now this is a powerhouse combination that is and will continue to accelerate growth. And based on the traction we're seeing so far, we continue to believe that ROSA and Persona cementless together will enhance our robotics and cementless penetration from the current mid-teen level to 50% or better, 5-0% or better.  The second pillar that we're focused on is Persona revision. This provides a meaningful conversion and mix opportunities inside the revision category. But importantly, it also acts as a powerful tip-of-the-spear product for conversions and primary needs.  And then third, it's just the overall shift of the ZB legacy knee systems to our now fully rounded out Persona portfolio. And this is a meaningful mix benefit that we can take advantage of that, I would say, is somewhat unique to our business.  And then fourth, on top of all this, we have the world's first and only Smart Knee which is Persona iQ. And I know this is still in limited launch, but already, it offers surgeons unparalleled data access and is attractive to patients, those patients who want more direct engagement with their care recovery. And we're taking on a similar approach to our hip portfolio where we continue to launch meaningful innovation, again, giving us the opportunity for price stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions. And we have 4 pillars of focus here as well.  First, it's ROSA and Hip Insight. These are technology shifts in robotics and mixed reality that are setting up the ZB Hip portfolio for greater adoption and growth.  Second is the Avenir Complete. This is our current flagship product combined with G7, which gives us a very strong position in both the attractive direct anterior and revision submarkets of hip.  And then third, this position will be enhanced with work being done on a triple taper stem which will fully round out our direct interior approach portfolio. We believe this new portfolio, combined with the G7, which is the most versatile acetabular component available will be unmatched in the industry.  And then fourth, HAMR. This is our upcoming full launch of an automated impaction system that builds on a proven need in the market, and we fully expect that this launch will create surgical efficiencies while bringing personalized precision to each and every patient.  And then finally, in S.E.T., we are being disciplined and targeting investment in our growth driver categories, Upper extremities, Sports and CMFT, and each of these categories continue to perform. And given our momentum in these businesses and continued investment in innovation and dedicated infrastructure, we fully expect the S.E.T. set business to be a mid-single-digit grower in a normalized market environment.  So overall, we're very excited about our innovation momentum. It's very real. Remember, we've called out that we have 40 planned product launches between this year and the end of 2025. With the majority in 4%-plus growth markets. And that's important because these innovations will certainly drive near-term growth. There's no question about that, but also create better sustainability of that growth because of the markets they're in.  This portfolio shift that we're seeing and the team's execution capabilities are clear signs that our ZB transformation has taken hold. But I can tell you right now that we're not going to stop there. The goal is to continue to enhance our growth profile through our ongoing focus on active portfolio management, and that is supported by our already strong and strengthening balance sheet. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Suky for a closer look at Q2 and our latest expectations for the remainder of 2023. Okay, Suky?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan noted, we had another excellent quarter. Our results were driven by strong end markets as well as strong execution across the entire organization. As a result, we are again increasing our full year financial outlook.  With that, let's turn to our results and updated full year guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter and how it compares to the same period in 2022. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis.  Net sales were $1.870 billion, an increase of 4.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, we had a selling day headwind of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Overall, the business continues to benefit from a recovery of elective procedures driven by continued market normalization, including hospital staffing and procedure cancellations returning to pre-COVID levels. We also benefited from some backlog recapture. While market momentum is strong, we continue to face certain macro challenges, including global supply chain pressures that muted performance across the business. U.S. growth of 5% continued to outpace our expectations and international growth of 7.2% was driven by strong performance in both EMEA as well as Asia Pacific. All regions benefited from continued recovery of elective procedures, backlog recapture as well as strong commercial execution and new product uptake.  Turning to our business category performance. Global Knees grew 10.5% with U.S. growing 9.8% and international growing 11.4%. The strong performance in Knees was driven by the 4 pillars that Bryan mentioned earlier, centering on a very attractive Persona portfolio, combined with the benefits of our ROSA robotics platform.  Global Hips grew 4.9% with U.S. Hips up 2.7% and international up 7.1%. Both regions posted good growth on the back of new product flow, execution and market recovery.  Next, the S.E.T. category was down 30 basis points year-over-year. Inside of that, we saw continued strong performance from our 3 focus areas within the business segment. As expected, we saw pressure from reimbursement headwinds within the Restorative Therapies business. In addition, we experienced more acute supply challenges within Sports and Trauma. In the backdrop of this, we believe we will move beyond these headwinds, and this segment will rebound in the second half of the year.  Finally, our Other category grew 6.5%. Now moving on to the P&L. In Q2, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.73 in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher revenues combined with lower nonoperating expenses due to ZimVie investment losses from the prior year that did not repeat as well as lower spend related to restructuring costs. These benefits were partially offset by increased investment in R&D and commercial initiatives to drive future growth.  On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.82 were flat to the prior year. Higher year-over-year revenues and better gross margins were offset by higher R&D expenses, increased investments into commercial infrastructure for new product launches and higher interest expense. Our adjusted gross margin was 72%, up 40 basis points from the prior year despite absorbing current year inflationary pressures as well as pressure from prior year that was capitalized and flowing into this year's P&L.  Favorable mix and FX hedge gains also helped support the increase in gross margin. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 27.5%, down 50 basis points from the prior year. While gross margin was up, this was offset by higher operating expenses due to increased investments in R&D, aligned to our plan to improve our vitality index through new product innovation as well as higher commercial infrastructure costs to support new product uptake.  Net interest and other nonoperating expenses of $57 million was higher than our expectations and significantly higher than the prior year due to certain foreign currency losses in the quarter as well as higher interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate of 16.3% was in line with expectations.  Turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $348 million and free cash flow totaled $165 million. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $320 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, providing strategic and financial flexibility for future growth.  Moving to our updated financial outlook for 2023. Based on another strong quarter of results, we are again raising our full year 2023 outlook. We are confident that we will continue to grow our top line above market rates and expand operating margin while continuing to reinvest in our business for future growth. We are increasing and narrowing our constant currency revenue growth range to 7% to 7.5% with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of 50 basis points. We are also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.47 to $7.57.  Additionally, due to certain FX-related pressures and higher interest rates, we now expect net interest and other nonoperating expenses to be around $200 million for the year. Our expectation around tax rate and total shares outstanding remains unchanged. And we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.  Our Q3 and Q4 revenue cadence expectations are unchanged. Q3 revenue dollars are expected to be sequentially down versus Q2 and in line with normal seasonality, and Q4 will be our strongest quarter on a dollar basis. While we expect momentum gained from the first half to flow into the second half of the year, recent and new sanctions on Russia may mute growth.  And regarding selling day impact, we continue to expect Q3 to have a selling day headwind of about 150 basis points, while Q4 will have about 100 basis point tailwind. Overall, the net day rate impact for the full year is not meaningful.  From a margin perspective, we expect Q3 to be our low watermark for the year from both a gross margin and operating margin standpoint. While gross margin will have less variability from quarter-to-quarter, we expect Q3 operating margin to step down sequentially between 150 and 200 basis points due to the normal seasonality of our business.  We expect Q4 to step up significantly on a sequential basis, delivering our highest operating margin for the year.  Importantly, we remain committed to investing for future growth while delivering meaningful full year margin expansion in 2023. We're really pleased with how our team is navigating a challenging environment.  In summary, we delivered another quarter of excellent top line results, beating our expectations while managing very real supply chain challenges. We are building on our early momentum through continued execution and are again able to increase our full year guidance. We are also reiterating our confidence and expectation to be a 4% plus or even mid-single-digit top line grower in a normalized market while delivering strong earnings.  In short, our business has never been stronger. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Good Morning Bryan and Suky. Nice quarter. I guess I'd start out with looking at the Hips and Knees in the quarter. I would think that knees 2x the growth rate of hip this quarter, backlog will be similar there. Is the elevated knee growth, mostly the mix shift from cementless and ROSA coming through? I'm curious how much supply is limiting growth in Hips and Knees here and what you're assuming about that improving in the back half?\nBryan Hanson: Thanks, Travis. Well I think maybe I'll do because obviously, Ivan is here with us and as close to the action as any of us. So maybe I'll pass it on him to answer the question. Ivan?\nIvan Tornos: I will say that the growth in knees is mainly innovation. We continue to see great momentum with ROSA penetration, so a pretty dramatic increase in penetration in the U.S. and core markets OUS. The launch of Persona OsseoTi or cementless launch is gaining great traction here in the U.S. In the prepared remarks, Bryan mentioned how we plan to go from 15%, 1-5 to 5-0- I won't disclose where we are in Q2, but it was a significant uptake in that side as well. We did also see great momentum in the ASC. We continue to grow here in the U.S. double digit in the ASC space.  And yes, there was some backlog in key markets around the world. We saw better backlog consumption in EMEA than here in the U.S., but nonetheless backlog was part of the performance. And to the latter part of your question, certainly, supply was a governor. I do believe -- we do believe that in a normal environment with better supply or already very compelling growth rate could have been even higher. But all summarize backlog, innovation and great commercial execution were the key drivers behind the knee performance.\nTravis Steed: Great. And I guess looking forward that the sustainability of this kind of the plus and the 4 plus, and I think I heard the comment even mid-single-digit growth. It sounds like even with some tougher comps you're still confident in that seeing the plus in the 4 plus? And I assume that price is better. You got the mix of backlog is probably still lasting through 2024. I just kind of love to hear your confidence in kind of seeing the upside to that 4-plus?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. Travis, this is Suky. So yes, very perceptive on our comments. Yes, we've got confidence in our business in a normalized environment that we're going to be at 4 plus or, as I said, a mid-single-digit grower. There's a few things. First, I focus on qualitatively execution is incredibly strong. Right now, we've got -- if you think about -- our WAMGR, weighted average market growth continues to improve. That's been steadily improving, one, by investing in R&D organically in higher-growth submarkets even within recon, but then in sports, Extremity and Trauma, and then if you look at the M&A that we've been doing, it's been in higher growth markets in Sports, Upper Extremities as well as CMFT. So overall, our weighted average market growth has been improving.  Next, it's really around our innovation and what that innovation brings in terms of the ability to compete in the market, what it brings relative to share of wallet as well as mix is all very positive as well. And then the last is our performance relative to market. I think we've demonstrated for a number of quarters now that we can perform at or better than market on a consistent basis. So really execution is the primary driver why we've got confidence behind that. And secondly, you're also seeing some improving market dynamics. One, we think that overall, the patient dynamics are changing. You're seeing a lowering of the average age of our patients. That's expanding our overall market. Two, we think that they're getting more confident in the outcomes of recon procedures and sports procedures, again, because the technology, the innovation is improving, we're bringing real value to the marketplace. And I think the last thing is really the convenience and the comfort with the ASC setting is also helping to accelerate the overall market. So the market dynamics are still early and preliminary, but the execution is very strong and very real. So -- we've got a lot of confidence qualitatively. And I think if you look at the back half of our guidance, the implied growth rate of being roughly about 5%, I think that's another proof point quantitatively that gives us that confidence. So again, thanks for picking up on that. And those are the things that give us confidence.\nOperator: We'll go next to Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.\nRichard Newitter: Maybe just looking at the margins, I'm trying to calibrate if we're kind of back to normalized levels sustainably, what your normalized margin and margin improvement prospects are? You did about 200 basis points of year-over-year operating leverage in the first quarter, and you grew double digits on the top line.  Now you're at about 100 basis points roughly in the back half, and that's like you said, a mid-single-digit implied growth rate on the top line. So can we assume like that -- those are basically the right level of operating leverage to correlate to call it, upper mid-single digits? You're getting north of 100 basis points, something more in the lower mid-single digits or upper low single digits, you're 50 basis points plus operating leverage?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. So first of all, thanks for the question, Rich. I'll just step back a little bit and just say, if you go back to 2022 even in a very challenging market with a lot of inflationary pressure, supply chain disruption, et cetera, we were able to grow our operating margins. As you look at 2023, you take our implied guidance, it would suggest we're going to grow operating margins by almost another 100 basis points at the midpoint. So we feel really good about what the company has been doing. And inside of that, we've been doing that with very strong, as you've seen, mid-single-digit growth, very good gross margin performance. I'll break that down in just a moment. Offsetting continued challenges with inflationary pressures, but also inflation from '22 that capitalized into this year, which we've talked a lot about, while still investing against the business for future growth, right? So a very strong profile, good top line growth, good gross margin, offsetting the challenges and continuing to invest against the business. So I do think our ability to sustain these very high, very attractive margins this year into the future is absolutely table stakes, but I also think that we're going to be in a position going forward in a normalized market, where we're going to be able to expand margins from here. So that's how we think about things. I won't try and break down between what level of revenue growth, how much margin expansion. There are a lot of factors that play into that. The big picture takeaway is we're at a really good level now, we're going to sustain that, if not grow that into '24 and beyond.\nRichard Newitter: Okay. And just maybe feeding that into M&A. As we think about your M&A and tuck-in strategy, how should we think of the prioritization of top line from tuck-in M&A versus margin and earnings dilution trade-off?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. So we know how to work around this as a leadership team. And clearly, what you see by looking at other companies in our sector is that valuations are correlated at a very high level to revenue growth. So understanding the ability to get our revenue growth at a higher rate. The mid-single digit is a great accomplishment given where the company was just 3 to 5 short years ago, and we're happy about the progress we've made, but we're not satisfied, right? And we believe that M&A, investing into faster-growth markets absolutely is the right thing to do and ultimately, we'll improve our overall weighted average market growth and the overall growth rate for the company.  And then once you get there, you get natural leverage, the P&L starts to flow through and over time, you start to get to a profile where you get very strong earnings growth well ahead of revenue growth. And so that's the profile that we're going for long term.  From an M&A standpoint, our first priority is that revenue growth and that diversification of the company into faster-growth markets. That may come with some near-term dilution, but we're also going to be very conscious about driving P&L discipline and looking for accretion in a reasonable amount of time, let's say, within the first 2 years. So that's how we think about M&A. The priority is going to be about accelerating the overall company's growth.\nOperator: We'll go next to Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.\nPhilip Chickering: Can we touch more into S.E.T. You talked about strength in 3 focus areas, as process of supply challenges. What were those issues? Are they fixed at this point? And how should we be modeling S.E.T. in the back half of the year? And if the supply tunnels are fixed, should we think about bolus in the third quarter?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. So a couple of things that inside the second quarter on S.E.T. One, we continue to work through some of the reimbursement changes in our Restorative Therapies business that we talked about a year ago. We believe we've now sunsetted those. So those shouldn't be a challenge as we move into Q3 and Q4, the rest of the year. However, we did see some pretty acute supply issues, especially in our Sports business and to a lesser extent, Trauma. That muted growth. But underneath that, our priority areas of Sports, Upper Extremities and CMFT all performed incredibly well. And so we're happy with the continued progress and momentum we're making in those businesses. We do expect an inflection in the back half of the year for those -- for the S.E.T. category as a whole to rebound. It's likely going to be stronger in the fourth quarter as we continue to work through the fluid situation on supply in the third quarter.\nPhilip Chickering: Okay. Great. And then in the script, you talked about Russia getting growth. Can you walk us through a Russia could impact growth at this point and quantify the revenues and raw materials exposed to Russia?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Sure. So overall, Russia is less than 1% of total sales on a full year basis. We became aware at the end of -- towards the end of the second quarter, that new and unexpected sanctions were being placed on certain medical device products. Our products sell into that category. So we basically have to go back and reapply for licensing against all of our products. We don't think that, that's going to be a governor in perpetuity, but at least for the third quarter, it's going to create a bit of a headwind potentially a little bit into Q4 worst case. We think that, that headwind is roughly about 50 basis points in the back half of the year. And again, most of that will be felt in the third quarter. From a raw materials exposure, I think the biggest area, and we've talked about this at length -- our titanium supplies coming out of Russia have been relatively stable. That's a good sign. But we also took the additional measure at the end of '22 to create some redundancy and to find alternate suppliers, multiple suppliers outside of Russia. So we feel good about our titanium supplies.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeffrey Johnson: Kind of, I guess, we're ticking through all the segments here. So maybe if we just look at the Other segment, the 6% growth that was at least a nice step-up from what we've seen kind of on a trailing 12-month basis. Maybe any insights there what drove that and just kind of how we're seeing mix between leasing contracts and/or outright purchases on ROSA?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, sure. Jeff, I'll take that, Suky again. I think the biggest driver was bone cement, not surprising when you see the recon growth numbers in the second quarter to see a very good other performance, especially for bone cement. We also saw some good performance outside in surgical as well, which also creeped up. Your last question inside of that was around ROSA placements versus outright sales. And consistent with prior commentary, we're seeing the majority of our ROSA placements or installments, I should say, being done through the placement strategy versus sales. So that trend continues.\nJeffrey Johnson: All right. Great. And then maybe just a follow-up, just on backlog. I know you don't guide on backlog and any high-level comments though on how you're thinking about that backlog clearing in EMEA and what you saw in the U.S.? And just kind of comfort with that backlog still continuing to provide some tailwinds maybe over the coming year or 2? Thanks.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, definitely felt that in the second quarter as we talked about. That helped offset some of the supply challenges that we had. We expect backlog to continue to contribute through the rest of this year. It's always difficult to determine exactly how much was in any given quarter and to predict how much will come through. It's a little bit of amorphous, but we know that it's there, and we have high confidence that it's going to -- we're going to continue to see it through the back end of this year and likely through 2024.\nOperator: We'll go next to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Congrats on a nice quarter here. I'll ask a couple on the pipeline. Persona iQ, do you guys have what you need now for a full launch from a clinical data standpoint -- and if so, what data are you going to promote and file for the label? And I had one follow-up.\nIvan Tornos: Absolutely, Larry. I'll take that one. First and foremost, we remain on track with our limited market release. We've been saying all along that by January Q1 of 2024, we'll be ready for a full launch. And I will say that we're almost there in gain on the data. We're approaching 1 billion data points from multiple patients thousands of implants by now.  And really we're answering 3 questions. Number one is, to your point, what is the value proposition? Can we demonstrate a reduction in the length of the episode of care? Can we bring objectivity to a range of motion metrics? Can we demonstrate better gate performance given better technique, better surgery? Can we compare recovery curves? Who does better post implantation? There's a lot of data we get in that regard, and we'll be filing some claims once we digest the multiple data points that we're getting. So that's question number one.  Question number two in the limited market release is how do we make the whole thing seamless? This is new to the word technology. It's got a home base station, as you know. It involves the patient, involves the surgeon, the caregiver. So we want to make sure that is a best-in-class experience, and there are some things that we're working around.  And then the third question, and I know this is near and dear to you is who's going to pay for the technology? To that end, we got the NTAP kicking in at the beginning of October. You'll be pleased to know that we follow up with your question around TPD, transitional pass-through. We had a deadline of August 23 to submit. We're in the final stages of evaluating what the submission could look like. We're evaluating commercial payer strategy as part of this limited market release. So we continue to think about the payer as well. So with all of that said, the what, the how and the who will pay, I think going to be in a good position to start to see a full market release by January, if not late Q1 2024.\nLawrence Biegelsen: Ivan, thanks so much for that comprehensive answer. Maybe another one for you. On the Robot -- for the shoulder application for the Robot. I think you just confirm that you still expect to be first to market and what need -- what still needs to be done? And if you'll give any more color on the time line? That would be great.\nIvan Tornos: I'd love to give you more color, but Bryan and Keri will shoot me. I will tell you that we remain convinced capital letters that would be first to market in Shoulder Robotics, and beyond the speed to market, what I like is what the actual platform offers. Faster surgeries, more accurate outcomes, shorter recovery. So a lot what we've seen, we've done our final validation labs with customers, both friends and family customer surgeons and also competitive surgeons and the feedback has been outstanding. Beyond the platform dynamics that I mentioned around shorter recovery, faster surgery, I just love the integration that Russia shoulder will have with the rest of the CDH ecosystem. So more than that soon.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: We all heard United Healthcare's comments this quarter. It was evident in results, but it was specific to recon on Medicare. I'm just wondering if you can kind of parse out the procedure environment within S.E.T.? It's hard to see given some of the supply chain dynamics. I'm just wondering if you can kind of speak to that environment relative to recon in your expectations for durability of its robustness, if you will? Through the remainder of this year, similar to the recon environment.\nIvan Tornos: Ryan. I'll take that one as well. So obviously, it varies from region to region. What I will tell you here in the U.S., we saw greater backlog consumption coming from Knees and Hips. It was actually quite the opposite in EMEA. When it comes to S.E.T., a lot of those cases here in the U.S. are done in an ASC environment. And other cases, are commercial payers, and it's been pretty consistent. But again, it varies quarter-to-quarter, geography to geography. We do believe that the backlog is going to be here for a while, and we'll see fluctuation given ASC non-ASC in the U.S. And then again, different variables outside of the U.S.\nBryan Hanson: I think the key takeaway you just don't see as much impact on the S.E.T. business as you do the Recon business when you think about backlog.\nRyan Zimmerman: Fair. That's helpful, Bryan. And then we talked about Russia. Last year, it was China and the impact of BBP. I'm just wondering if you could articulate specifically what the status is in China? We've heard from many of your peers, China is improving. What are your expectations for China growth? As we kind of lap -- as we start to lap the BBP impacts?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. So first of all, BBP is not a material driver for us at all in 2023. We sort of turned the corner on that between the end of '21 and 2022. So we actually see China as a growth driver for us, albeit at a lower level, but we do believe that, that market has some very strong growth for us. I'd say pre-BBP, that market was growing in the low double-digit range. And we'd be surprised if we didn't return to that level, if not better.\nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Matson with Needham & Company.\nMichael Matson: Back to the S.E.T. business. So Bryan called out kind of the subcategories there that seem to be the area of focus. But the things I didn't hear a mention were lower extremities, i.e., foot and ankle or trauma? So can you maybe just comment on why those were kind of left out of the comments?\nIvan Tornos: Yes, sure. I can do that as well. So I think Suky alluded to the trauma headwinds that we had in the quarter. We had some supply challenges. And obviously, you got the comp in China versus a year ago. Here in the U.S., there were some contracts that we lost about a year ago. We're anniversarying out of those. There were some product launches that were delayed, '22 and '23 that are coming out now. So I will say that moving forward, given the better comps or U.S. and the contract capabilities now in the U.S. along with innovation, the trauma business is going to be in a better position. Foot and ankle has been one of the businesses, frankly, within S.E.T. that we didn't prioritize. We wanted to prioritize upper extremities, SportsMed and CMFT. That being said, I do think there is a couple of product launches that are going to make a difference in the space. So all in all, I do think you'll see better performance. But trauma, foot and ankle are not the key priorities within S.E.T.\nBryan Hanson: Yes. And to be clear, it doesn't mean that we don't see foot and ankle, trauma and restorative therapies as potentially attractive markets. It's just we want to be disciplined in the way that we're going to invest -- and the -- if you look at the strat plans that we have for upper extremity, CMFT and Sports, they're very attractive. So we're going to focus our investment there.  Out at the end of the day, the individuals running foot and ankle, trauma or restorative therapies, put a plan in place that's attractive, they could become growth drivers. But today, we want to differentiate those growth drivers to non-growth drivers, nothing against any other categories. It's just the plan right now is very attractive in those 3.\nIvan Tornos: And just on restorative therapy, that was restorative therapies was part of your question, but we anniversary out of the reimbursement change, July of 2023. So you should expect that business to do dramatically better now.\nMichael Matson: All right. Got it. And then just in terms of the supply chain issues, I don't know if it's possible, but is there any way you could quantify the impact either to your revenue growth and/or your margins in the quarter?\nBryan Hanson: I think we'll try to stay away from quantifying, it's pretty challenging, actually, because when you talk about supply issues, you always get feedback from the field on what could have happened if you had more supply and you've got to make sure that you're kind of sifting through what's real, what's not. But the fact is it is a governor for us right now, and that's why we continue to say it. What's important, though, is it's a macro-challenge. There's not a company in orthopedics right now that is not being impacted by supply challenges. So it's impacting everyone. AAOS just did a survey actually with surgeons asking this question and across the board regardless of who they were using, they were experiencing supply challenges.  Really important thing for us that's built into the guidance that Suky just provided. So that's key. But when I think about that growth driver, the impact it's having on our ability to grow. I think it's important to look at that. That means is getting in the way of our team using new innovation to drive mix benefit and competitive conversions. We truly do believe that it was not a factor. We'd be getting more mix benefit, we'll be getting more competitive conversions because the demand is there. So it's frustrating. We have great momentum in the business, great innovation and supply is in the way of driving that growth. And we believe it's going to continue to be there for a period of time.\nOperator: We'll go next to Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe I could start on margins. If I take the third quarter and fourth quarter commentary that you provided, I have a little trouble getting to the high end of the range. So maybe just speak to some of the pluses and minuses there and what you need to get to the top of the range? And then second question, I'll just throw in as well. You have a big gross margin benefit from currency in '23. There's a pretty wide range of operating margin expansion next year or contraction on The Street. Any early thoughts into how we should be thinking about your ability to grow operating margins next year?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Sure, Robbie. Great to talk to you. So one of the biggest drivers in the overall profile in the back half of the year, by the way, we do believe operating margin in the back half will be modestly better than what you saw in the first half. That's largely going to be driven by better revenue, mostly coming from the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter is always our strongest from a dollar perspective, from sales view.  The second thing is you're likely going to see a step down in overall operating expenses from the second quarter. That was sort of our high watermark as we were dealing with a number of inflationary pressures. But quite frankly, also investing pretty handsomely against things like R&D, which was up like 19% in the quarter, investing against commercial infrastructure in places like sports and upper extremities to continue to specialize that sales force as well as ASCs.  So the two common combined things of higher revenue, lower OpEx as we move into the back end of the year is what's going to drive that margin expansion improvement versus the first half. As we look into 2024, you're right, we did talk about some FX hedge gains this year, which we sized at about 50 basis points on the full year that won't repeat into next year. That will be a headwind, but we're still confident that we can grow operating margins into 2024. It may not be at the same level of 100 basis points that you're seeing this year. But we do believe, as I said earlier, that we can take this sort of high watermark that we are in operating margins that continue to enhance that as we move into 2024. What are some of the building blocks? One, pricing is still a headwind, but we're seeing really great performance. It's not the headwind that it used to be for the company. And what's even more exciting about that is we're truly seeing very strong mix benefit inside the company, and that's coming from our new products and the innovation into the marketplace, which is helping to offset that price erosion. So we think that, that can be a tailwind for us. Secondly, we continue to work aggressively on our site optimization in manufacturing and supply chain, which we think can generate some tailwind in cost of goods as we move forward. And then as you move through the rest of the P&L into SG&A, there's still ample opportunity with our Global Business Services agenda that we just started a few short years ago. We've got a completely different culture and mentality when we think about go-to-market and market profitability. Where at one time, it was revenue growth at all costs. And now it's all about revenue growth at the right profitability level and with earnings growing faster. And so there's just those cultural shifts and that discipline is also driving some really nice margin expansion both in the U.S. as well as outside. So these are just a few levers that quite frankly, we've been pulling on already. There's still room to go and why we feel confident that we can take this high watermark for 2023 and grow it into 2024.\nOperator: We'll go next to Rick Wise with Stifel.\nFrederick Wise: And maybe starting off with a couple of the key new product launches that you highlighted. Bryan, you said as you were talking about the 4 pillars of Knee growth that ROSA+ the cementless Knee launch, were -- that was your first comment, your first focus area, taking cementless from mid-teens to 50% over time. Related to that point, where are you in the rollout? When, or are you even at full launch now or what's required? And how do we think about the acceleration of that launch over the next year or 2?\nBryan Hanson: Thanks, Rick. What I'd say first is just to make sure that I clarify. I'm saying that both ROSA and cementless will move from the mid-teens to 50% plus, 5-0 percent plus. So not just cementless. And they kind of do play off of each other. They benefit each other as they're trying to get adoption in the marketplace. But speaking specifically to cementless, maybe I can pass that to you.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, I would say, Rick, that it's early innings, frankly, both for ROSA as well as cementless. We are in what I think is not still a full launch for cementless, given some of the supply constraints. I think as we exit 2023 and early 2024, we'll have as much supply as we need to meaningfully drive the penetration of cementless with a goal of going from 15% to 50%.  I won't say when 50% is going to happen, but that's definitely the North Star. ROSA is the same situation. We launched 2 platforms in Knee. We are about to launch ROSA Partial this summer, a new and improved version of that. We're working actively on next-generation total knee, which will be a meaningful launch going into '24.  We got all kind of ZBEdge add-ons data technology solutions that are going to augment the penetration there. But I would say net-net, both for ROSA, cementless and some of the peripheral launches around those 2 components, we are in the early innings.\nFrederick Wise: Great. And Bryan, if I could, for a second question, I would like to hear from you your personal priorities. It seems like execution is going well. Ivan did a great job, and the team is doing a great job with the pipeline and execution and driving the business forward, Suky is taking the financial organization in a positive direction. What are your priorities now as you look ahead to the next year or 2? Are you focused on efficiency portfolio? What just -- what are you thinking about and that we should hear about and ask about today?\nBryan Hanson: Thanks, Rick. I mean I'll kind of tongue-in-cheek say we're thinking about everything. But obviously, that doesn't get you anywhere you focus. And we've been very clear from the very beginning that we had 3 phases of the transformation of this company. Phase one is always going to be alive, but we're in great shape Phase 2 is kind of what you just said.  We have a great innovation pipeline. We're executing from an organic standpoint. We feel very confident in that phase. And now we're squarely in Phase 3, as we've been saying, and the big focus for us is that portfolio transformation that will leverage our balance sheet. And the balance sheet is strong and strengthening us in the prepared remarks, and that is the area of focus for us. How do we continue to move our weighted average market growth forward.  I can tell you we've already made great progress in the focus area here. We've already moved it North. With the balance sheet strength, we expect it to continue to move in the right direction. So that's an area of focus, not just for me but for this entire team.\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.\nJoshua Jennings: Hi good morning...\nBryan Hanson: Do we still have you?\nUnidentified Company Representative: I think he got electrocuted...\nKeri Mattox: No, Josh, we hope you are okay. Katie maybe we can go to the next one in the queue, and then hold Josh back if he dials back.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: I guess -- I apologize if I missed this, but what was the impact of price in 2Q and of your expectations around price changed at all?\nSuketu Upadhyay: It was about 1% erosion year-over-year in the second quarter. I think in the first quarter -- I think the average is somewhere around for the first half of the year. We would expect in the second half or somewhere to be between 100 to 150 basis points of erosion.  We're seeing really good traction there for the number of reasons that I've talked about at length previously. But again, I think the really exciting thing is we're starting to see that mix benefit come through from our new product introductions and helping to offset even an improved price erosion profile.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. Great. And then just secondly, on the supply challenges, are these new issues or the kind of legacy carryover issues? And then Bryan, I think you mentioned that you expect this dynamic to continue for some time. Does the impact lessen with each quarter going forward? And any visibility as to kind of when these issues will abate?\nIvan Tornos: I'll start by saying that we have not seen anything new. All along, there were really 3 buckets that summarize the problem, materials, labor and sterilization, augmented with, frankly, just put demand plan on aside because the demand that we felt kept getting better and better and better. Sequentially, we've seen improvement. We've seen better forecast accuracy on the demand side. And then as we think about labor, at the Tier 1 level, our labor capabilities are much better than before. We're hiring people in our sites. When you think about sterilization, we had the right strategies, materials continue to be a challenge, but again, it's much better than before. So I would say improvement versus the past. And sequentially, we continue to see improvement across both supply and demand.\nBryan Hanson: I mean the challenge, it's a fixed equation, right? I mean as you start to improve as we would expect in materials, labor and sterilization because we've put great planning around that, as demand continues to be strong, it's going to delay supply recovery. And so that's what we're seeing is we're seeing a great dynamic strength in the marketplace, better traction in our new innovation than we even expected, but that puts pressure on that equation, and it pushes the supply challenges out.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks so much, Jayson.\nOperator: We'll go next to Kyle Rose with Canaccord.\nKyle Rose: Suky, on -- just circling back on gross margins, strong in 2023, obviously, you walked through some of those benefits. I guess just help us understand maybe how much of an impact inflation in the supply chain has been on underlying gross margins? I mean I understand the positive tailwinds that you've outlined earlier. But how much have you truly been offsetting?  And I guess just trying to understand how much -- when you talk about supply chain challenges and increased unit costs and wages, are we still -- is there a potential to see a second shoe drop? And I'm just kind of trying to understand as inventory turns flows through the business if and when we'll actually ever see that impact through the P&L?  And then secondly, let's talk about returning to a normalized operating environment. I think we all understand it's been a dramatic 3 to 4 years. But I guess just -- when is it fair to start thinking about when we will be in that more of a normalized operating environment, whether it's supply challenges the industry is facing, staffing challenges. Just how should we think about actually getting step back to that mid-single digits?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes, sure. Kyle, thanks for the question. So first, on gross margin, from an inflationary standpoint, recall that we have about 100 basis points from '22 that's capitalized and hitting our P&L this year, and we're seeing that come through, that's happening.  In addition, we are seeing some incremental inflationary pressure, new pressure 2023, primarily related to continued spot buying with some raw materials around packaging, [indiscernible] some of our metals that we use, but we're also seeing it in really the cost to serve. What do I mean by that, really around the need to have to shift product a lot more than you might have to in a stable supply environment. That's one area of incremental inflation or higher costs that we're seeing. Second is we've made the decision to actually pay incremental incentives to our commercial field sales force because we know how challenging it is out in the marketplace. Dealing with these supply challenges, we've been incredibly impressed with how they've been responding. So these are a couple of elements that are also flowing into the P&L. By the way, we're offsetting those and investing into business while increasing operating margin for this year. So the company and the team have been incredibly disciplined in the backdrop of better revenue and still dropping very, very substantial operating margin expansion.  As we move into next year, there could be some of this incremental inflationary pressure that we're seeing this year that makes its way into 2024. It's going to be nowhere near what we saw happen in '22 into '23. It will be much more modest. And like I said, I think we have more levers to help offset that as we move into 2024. But again, I'm not going to give guidance on 2024 and exactly what gross margin or operating margin looked like. But there are some moving parts there. That will be potentially another modest headwind. But again, we have a number of tailwinds to help offset things returning to a normalized market.  Clearly, we're not there yet. Revenue growth may look and feel normal, but the underlying dynamics are still not normal. We don't believe, at least standing where we are today, at least the beginning part of 2024 that we're going to be there. It's a long way away. We'll see where we get to in 2024. But once we do get to that sort of normalized growth, we do believe that we can sustainably hit that 4-plus or mid-single-digit growth profile that I talked about earlier.\nKeri Mattox: All right. Katie, I think we might have time for one last question in the queue.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matt Miksic with Barclays.\nMatthew Miksic: So just a couple of follow-ups. One on margins. And I know there's been a fair amount of talk about on the call and progress in terms of driving leverage commitments to leverage this year. I was wondering if we could sort of zoom out and think about where margins were pre-pandemic in that kind of like low 30s range? If you could remind us, is that -- is that a target to get back to and maybe the time line for getting there? And then just one quick follow-up on the Persona iQ, if I could.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. So the margins in the low 30% range. I'm not sure what you're referring to there, Matt. Maybe just out there the merger of Zimmer and Biomet. But since then, those margins were obviously impacted by a lack of investment in supply chain, commercial infrastructure, et cetera.  So again, I don't know that, that's the right reference point -- what I can tell you is that pre-pandemic to where we are now, we are expanding margins, operating margins as we continue to drive top line revenue growth and investment in the company. So feel good about where we are and where we're headed moving forward. Sorry, your second question?\nMatthew Miksic: Sure. Just a follow-up on Persona iQ. I think the number, I think maybe that was mentioned earlier was something like 1,000 implants. I mean that's a pretty -- it's a pretty small percentage of total maybe 1%, less than 1% of your total implants a year. And I just want to get a sense of at what level do some of the data start coming through? Is it a couple of thousand implants? Is it 300 to 500 implants? When do you expect seeing some of the results you mentioned earlier in the call?\nIvan Tornos: Yes. Thank you, Matt. First and foremost, we don't disclose the number of patients, but I'll tell you, it's far greater than 1,000 patients. When are we done with the limited market release? I think we're about to complete that? The size matters more for certain claims than others, but I will tell you, we've got enough of a sample size to be able to engage in a full market release by 2024.  What's the expectation going forward, this is going to be a flagship product for Zimmer Biomet. We plan to see meaningful penetration of this technology. First in Knees, then in Hips and then at some point in Shoulders as well. What's the right penetration? Again, we won't disclose that. But given the unique technology, we will leverage this to the fullest.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Ivan, and Matt thanks for your question. I think we're almost at the bottom of the hour. I'll actually turn it over to Bryan just for some closing remarks.\nBryan Hanson: Just maybe a quick summary to on what -- but you were just talking about Suky, when we think about a normalized market. And we're saying 2024 in our view, is not going to be normalized for 2 factors. You're still going to have backlog that we're going to have to pay attention to. We would deem backlog is a neutral to potentially negative depending on whether it stays the same or decreases. We don't think there's going to be an increase in it.  And the second one is supply. That is going to be neutral to positive because as we continue to see supply benefits that will create a tailwind for next year. So those are pretty big variables that would tell us that we don't have a normal year in 2024, but they're offsetting. So that's the reason why we think 2024, even though \"not normal\" could look a lot like a normal year from a growth perspective. I just want to make sure that, that's clear. And then just going to sum it up, first of all, thanks again for joining us this morning. And I think it's pretty clear in the way that we talk about the business right now that we're not just excited about where we are as a company, but the future of this company. And I think that's really important.  We've already made disciplined portfolio decisions that have increased the weighted average market growth of this business that's already happened, and that gives us confidence in the growth of the organization, not just today but in the future. And the balance sheet says that we're going to continue to be able to strengthen our position in those fast-growth markets and we will absolutely do that. That is Phase 3 of the transformation. And the innovation pipeline as Ivan continues to talk about is as strong as it's ever been, and that gives us the ability to drive mix benefit, pricing stability and competitive conversions. And when supply gets out of the way, that will even happen more. So we're very excited about it. And I've been doing this long enough to know when the team has got that skip in their step. And they've got the ammunition to be able to drive the performance of the business sustainably. And we are in that place. Okay.  With that, I'll go ahead and close it out, and thanks for joining us.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks, everyone. We'll talk to you soon. And obviously, if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to the IR team.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Suketu Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Bryan noted, we had another excellent quarter. Our results were driven by strong end markets as well as strong execution across the entire organization. As a result, we are again increasing our full year financial outlook.  With that, let's turn to our results and updated full year guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter and how it compares to the same period in 2022. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis.  Net sales were $1.870 billion, an increase of 4.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, we had a selling day headwind of less than 50 basis points in the quarter. Overall, the business continues to benefit from a recovery of elective procedures driven by continued market normalization, including hospital staffing and procedure cancellations returning to pre-COVID levels. We also benefited from some backlog recapture. While market momentum is strong, we continue to face certain macro challenges, including global supply chain pressures that muted performance across the business. U.S. growth of 5% continued to outpace our expectations and international growth of 7.2% was driven by strong performance in both EMEA as well as Asia Pacific. All regions benefited from continued recovery of elective procedures, backlog recapture as well as strong commercial execution and new product uptake.  Turning to our business category performance. Global Knees grew 10.5% with U.S. growing 9.8% and international growing 11.4%. The strong performance in Knees was driven by the 4 pillars that Bryan mentioned earlier, centering on a very attractive Persona portfolio, combined with the benefits of our ROSA robotics platform.  Global Hips grew 4.9% with U.S. Hips up 2.7% and international up 7.1%. Both regions posted good growth on the back of new product flow, execution and market recovery.  Next, the S.E.T. category was down 30 basis points year-over-year. Inside of that, we saw continued strong performance from our 3 focus areas within the business segment. As expected, we saw pressure from reimbursement headwinds within the Restorative Therapies business. In addition, we experienced more acute supply challenges within Sports and Trauma. In the backdrop of this, we believe we will move beyond these headwinds, and this segment will rebound in the second half of the year.  Finally, our Other category grew 6.5%. Now moving on to the P&L. In Q2, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.73 in the prior year. The increase was driven by higher revenues combined with lower nonoperating expenses due to ZimVie investment losses from the prior year that did not repeat as well as lower spend related to restructuring costs. These benefits were partially offset by increased investment in R&D and commercial initiatives to drive future growth.  On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.82 were flat to the prior year. Higher year-over-year revenues and better gross margins were offset by higher R&D expenses, increased investments into commercial infrastructure for new product launches and higher interest expense. Our adjusted gross margin was 72%, up 40 basis points from the prior year despite absorbing current year inflationary pressures as well as pressure from prior year that was capitalized and flowing into this year's P&L.  Favorable mix and FX hedge gains also helped support the increase in gross margin. Adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 27.5%, down 50 basis points from the prior year. While gross margin was up, this was offset by higher operating expenses due to increased investments in R&D, aligned to our plan to improve our vitality index through new product innovation as well as higher commercial infrastructure costs to support new product uptake.  Net interest and other nonoperating expenses of $57 million was higher than our expectations and significantly higher than the prior year due to certain foreign currency losses in the quarter as well as higher interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate of 16.3% was in line with expectations.  Turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $348 million and free cash flow totaled $165 million. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $320 million. Our balance sheet remains strong, providing strategic and financial flexibility for future growth.  Moving to our updated financial outlook for 2023. Based on another strong quarter of results, we are again raising our full year 2023 outlook. We are confident that we will continue to grow our top line above market rates and expand operating margin while continuing to reinvest in our business for future growth. We are increasing and narrowing our constant currency revenue growth range to 7% to 7.5% with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of 50 basis points. We are also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.47 to $7.57.  Additionally, due to certain FX-related pressures and higher interest rates, we now expect net interest and other nonoperating expenses to be around $200 million for the year. Our expectation around tax rate and total shares outstanding remains unchanged. And we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.  Our Q3 and Q4 revenue cadence expectations are unchanged. Q3 revenue dollars are expected to be sequentially down versus Q2 and in line with normal seasonality, and Q4 will be our strongest quarter on a dollar basis. While we expect momentum gained from the first half to flow into the second half of the year, recent and new sanctions on Russia may mute growth.  And regarding selling day impact, we continue to expect Q3 to have a selling day headwind of about 150 basis points, while Q4 will have about 100 basis point tailwind. Overall, the net day rate impact for the full year is not meaningful.  From a margin perspective, we expect Q3 to be our low watermark for the year from both a gross margin and operating margin standpoint. While gross margin will have less variability from quarter-to-quarter, we expect Q3 operating margin to step down sequentially between 150 and 200 basis points due to the normal seasonality of our business.  We expect Q4 to step up significantly on a sequential basis, delivering our highest operating margin for the year.  Importantly, we remain committed to investing for future growth while delivering meaningful full year margin expansion in 2023. We're really pleased with how our team is navigating a challenging environment.  In summary, we delivered another quarter of excellent top line results, beating our expectations while managing very real supply chain challenges. We are building on our early momentum through continued execution and are again able to increase our full year guidance. We are also reiterating our confidence and expectation to be a 4% plus or even mid-single-digit top line grower in a normalized market while delivering strong earnings.  In short, our business has never been stronger. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. Yes. Travis, this is Suky. So yes, very perceptive on our comments. Yes, we've got confidence in our business in a normalized environment that we're going to be at 4 plus or, as I said, a mid-single-digit grower. There's a few things. First, I focus on qualitatively execution is incredibly strong. Right now, we've got -- if you think about -- our WAMGR, weighted average market growth continues to improve. That's been steadily improving, one, by investing in R&D organically in higher-growth submarkets even within recon, but then in sports, Extremity and Trauma, and then if you look at the M&A that we've been doing, it's been in higher growth markets in Sports, Upper Extremities as well as CMFT. So overall, our weighted average market growth has been improving.  Next, it's really around our innovation and what that innovation brings in terms of the ability to compete in the market, what it brings relative to share of wallet as well as mix is all very positive as well. And then the last is our performance relative to market. I think we've demonstrated for a number of quarters now that we can perform at or better than market on a consistent basis. So really execution is the primary driver why we've got confidence behind that. And secondly, you're also seeing some improving market dynamics. One, we think that overall, the patient dynamics are changing. You're seeing a lowering of the average age of our patients. That's expanding our overall market. Two, we think that they're getting more confident in the outcomes of recon procedures and sports procedures, again, because the technology, the innovation is improving, we're bringing real value to the marketplace. And I think the last thing is really the convenience and the comfort with the ASC setting is also helping to accelerate the overall market. So the market dynamics are still early and preliminary, but the execution is very strong and very real. So -- we've got a lot of confidence qualitatively. And I think if you look at the back half of our guidance, the implied growth rate of being roughly about 5%, I think that's another proof point quantitatively that gives us that confidence. So again, thanks for picking up on that. And those are the things that give us confidence. Yes. So first of all, thanks for the question, Rich. I'll just step back a little bit and just say, if you go back to 2022 even in a very challenging market with a lot of inflationary pressure, supply chain disruption, et cetera, we were able to grow our operating margins. As you look at 2023, you take our implied guidance, it would suggest we're going to grow operating margins by almost another 100 basis points at the midpoint. So we feel really good about what the company has been doing. And inside of that, we've been doing that with very strong, as you've seen, mid-single-digit growth, very good gross margin performance. I'll break that down in just a moment. Offsetting continued challenges with inflationary pressures, but also inflation from '22 that capitalized into this year, which we've talked a lot about, while still investing against the business for future growth, right? So a very strong profile, good top line growth, good gross margin, offsetting the challenges and continuing to invest against the business. So I do think our ability to sustain these very high, very attractive margins this year into the future is absolutely table stakes, but I also think that we're going to be in a position going forward in a normalized market, where we're going to be able to expand margins from here. So that's how we think about things. I won't try and break down between what level of revenue growth, how much margin expansion. There are a lot of factors that play into that. The big picture takeaway is we're at a really good level now, we're going to sustain that, if not grow that into '24 and beyond. Yes. So we know how to work around this as a leadership team. And clearly, what you see by looking at other companies in our sector is that valuations are correlated at a very high level to revenue growth. So understanding the ability to get our revenue growth at a higher rate. The mid-single digit is a great accomplishment given where the company was just 3 to 5 short years ago, and we're happy about the progress we've made, but we're not satisfied, right? And we believe that M&A, investing into faster-growth markets absolutely is the right thing to do and ultimately, we'll improve our overall weighted average market growth and the overall growth rate for the company.  And then once you get there, you get natural leverage, the P&L starts to flow through and over time, you start to get to a profile where you get very strong earnings growth well ahead of revenue growth. And so that's the profile that we're going for long term.  From an M&A standpoint, our first priority is that revenue growth and that diversification of the company into faster-growth markets. That may come with some near-term dilution, but we're also going to be very conscious about driving P&L discipline and looking for accretion in a reasonable amount of time, let's say, within the first 2 years. So that's how we think about M&A. The priority is going to be about accelerating the overall company's growth. Yes. So a couple of things that inside the second quarter on S.E.T. One, we continue to work through some of the reimbursement changes in our Restorative Therapies business that we talked about a year ago. We believe we've now sunsetted those. So those shouldn't be a challenge as we move into Q3 and Q4, the rest of the year. However, we did see some pretty acute supply issues, especially in our Sports business and to a lesser extent, Trauma. That muted growth. But underneath that, our priority areas of Sports, Upper Extremities and CMFT all performed incredibly well. And so we're happy with the continued progress and momentum we're making in those businesses. We do expect an inflection in the back half of the year for those -- for the S.E.T. category as a whole to rebound. It's likely going to be stronger in the fourth quarter as we continue to work through the fluid situation on supply in the third quarter. Sure. So overall, Russia is less than 1% of total sales on a full year basis. We became aware at the end of -- towards the end of the second quarter, that new and unexpected sanctions were being placed on certain medical device products. Our products sell into that category. So we basically have to go back and reapply for licensing against all of our products. We don't think that, that's going to be a governor in perpetuity, but at least for the third quarter, it's going to create a bit of a headwind potentially a little bit into Q4 worst case. We think that, that headwind is roughly about 50 basis points in the back half of the year. And again, most of that will be felt in the third quarter. From a raw materials exposure, I think the biggest area, and we've talked about this at length -- our titanium supplies coming out of Russia have been relatively stable. That's a good sign. But we also took the additional measure at the end of '22 to create some redundancy and to find alternate suppliers, multiple suppliers outside of Russia. So we feel good about our titanium supplies. Yes, sure. Jeff, I'll take that, Suky again. I think the biggest driver was bone cement, not surprising when you see the recon growth numbers in the second quarter to see a very good other performance, especially for bone cement. We also saw some good performance outside in surgical as well, which also creeped up. Your last question inside of that was around ROSA placements versus outright sales. And consistent with prior commentary, we're seeing the majority of our ROSA placements or installments, I should say, being done through the placement strategy versus sales. So that trend continues. Yes, definitely felt that in the second quarter as we talked about. That helped offset some of the supply challenges that we had. We expect backlog to continue to contribute through the rest of this year. It's always difficult to determine exactly how much was in any given quarter and to predict how much will come through. It's a little bit of amorphous, but we know that it's there, and we have high confidence that it's going to -- we're going to continue to see it through the back end of this year and likely through 2024. Yes. So first of all, BBP is not a material driver for us at all in 2023. We sort of turned the corner on that between the end of '21 and 2022. So we actually see China as a growth driver for us, albeit at a lower level, but we do believe that, that market has some very strong growth for us. I'd say pre-BBP, that market was growing in the low double-digit range. And we'd be surprised if we didn't return to that level, if not better. Sure, Robbie. Great to talk to you. So one of the biggest drivers in the overall profile in the back half of the year, by the way, we do believe operating margin in the back half will be modestly better than what you saw in the first half. That's largely going to be driven by better revenue, mostly coming from the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter is always our strongest from a dollar perspective, from sales view.  The second thing is you're likely going to see a step down in overall operating expenses from the second quarter. That was sort of our high watermark as we were dealing with a number of inflationary pressures. But quite frankly, also investing pretty handsomely against things like R&D, which was up like 19% in the quarter, investing against commercial infrastructure in places like sports and upper extremities to continue to specialize that sales force as well as ASCs.  So the two common combined things of higher revenue, lower OpEx as we move into the back end of the year is what's going to drive that margin expansion improvement versus the first half. As we look into 2024, you're right, we did talk about some FX hedge gains this year, which we sized at about 50 basis points on the full year that won't repeat into next year. That will be a headwind, but we're still confident that we can grow operating margins into 2024. It may not be at the same level of 100 basis points that you're seeing this year. But we do believe, as I said earlier, that we can take this sort of high watermark that we are in operating margins that continue to enhance that as we move into 2024. What are some of the building blocks? One, pricing is still a headwind, but we're seeing really great performance. It's not the headwind that it used to be for the company. And what's even more exciting about that is we're truly seeing very strong mix benefit inside the company, and that's coming from our new products and the innovation into the marketplace, which is helping to offset that price erosion. So we think that, that can be a tailwind for us. Secondly, we continue to work aggressively on our site optimization in manufacturing and supply chain, which we think can generate some tailwind in cost of goods as we move forward. And then as you move through the rest of the P&L into SG&A, there's still ample opportunity with our Global Business Services agenda that we just started a few short years ago. We've got a completely different culture and mentality when we think about go-to-market and market profitability. Where at one time, it was revenue growth at all costs. And now it's all about revenue growth at the right profitability level and with earnings growing faster. And so there's just those cultural shifts and that discipline is also driving some really nice margin expansion both in the U.S. as well as outside. So these are just a few levers that quite frankly, we've been pulling on already. There's still room to go and why we feel confident that we can take this high watermark for 2023 and grow it into 2024. It was about 1% erosion year-over-year in the second quarter. I think in the first quarter -- I think the average is somewhere around for the first half of the year. We would expect in the second half or somewhere to be between 100 to 150 basis points of erosion.  We're seeing really good traction there for the number of reasons that I've talked about at length previously. But again, I think the really exciting thing is we're starting to see that mix benefit come through from our new product introductions and helping to offset even an improved price erosion profile. Yes, sure. Kyle, thanks for the question. So first, on gross margin, from an inflationary standpoint, recall that we have about 100 basis points from '22 that's capitalized and hitting our P&L this year, and we're seeing that come through, that's happening.  In addition, we are seeing some incremental inflationary pressure, new pressure 2023, primarily related to continued spot buying with some raw materials around packaging, [indiscernible] some of our metals that we use, but we're also seeing it in really the cost to serve. What do I mean by that, really around the need to have to shift product a lot more than you might have to in a stable supply environment. That's one area of incremental inflation or higher costs that we're seeing. Second is we've made the decision to actually pay incremental incentives to our commercial field sales force because we know how challenging it is out in the marketplace. Dealing with these supply challenges, we've been incredibly impressed with how they've been responding. So these are a couple of elements that are also flowing into the P&L. By the way, we're offsetting those and investing into business while increasing operating margin for this year. So the company and the team have been incredibly disciplined in the backdrop of better revenue and still dropping very, very substantial operating margin expansion.  As we move into next year, there could be some of this incremental inflationary pressure that we're seeing this year that makes its way into 2024. It's going to be nowhere near what we saw happen in '22 into '23. It will be much more modest. And like I said, I think we have more levers to help offset that as we move into 2024. But again, I'm not going to give guidance on 2024 and exactly what gross margin or operating margin looked like. But there are some moving parts there. That will be potentially another modest headwind. But again, we have a number of tailwinds to help offset things returning to a normalized market.  Clearly, we're not there yet. Revenue growth may look and feel normal, but the underlying dynamics are still not normal. We don't believe, at least standing where we are today, at least the beginning part of 2024 that we're going to be there. It's a long way away. We'll see where we get to in 2024. But once we do get to that sort of normalized growth, we do believe that we can sustainably hit that 4-plus or mid-single-digit growth profile that I talked about earlier. Yes. So the margins in the low 30% range. I'm not sure what you're referring to there, Matt. Maybe just out there the merger of Zimmer and Biomet. But since then, those margins were obviously impacted by a lack of investment in supply chain, commercial infrastructure, et cetera.  So again, I don't know that, that's the right reference point -- what I can tell you is that pre-pandemic to where we are now, we are expanding margins, operating margins as we continue to drive top line revenue growth and investment in the company. So feel good about where we are and where we're headed moving forward. Sorry, your second question?"

            "name": "Ivan Tornos",
            "content": "I will say that the growth in knees is mainly innovation. We continue to see great momentum with ROSA penetration, so a pretty dramatic increase in penetration in the U.S. and core markets OUS. The launch of Persona OsseoTi or cementless launch is gaining great traction here in the U.S. In the prepared remarks, Bryan mentioned how we plan to go from 15%, 1-5 to 5-0- I won't disclose where we are in Q2, but it was a significant uptake in that side as well. We did also see great momentum in the ASC. We continue to grow here in the U.S. double digit in the ASC space.  And yes, there was some backlog in key markets around the world. We saw better backlog consumption in EMEA than here in the U.S., but nonetheless backlog was part of the performance. And to the latter part of your question, certainly, supply was a governor. I do believe -- we do believe that in a normal environment with better supply or already very compelling growth rate could have been even higher. But all summarize backlog, innovation and great commercial execution were the key drivers behind the knee performance. Absolutely, Larry. I'll take that one. First and foremost, we remain on track with our limited market release. We've been saying all along that by January Q1 of 2024, we'll be ready for a full launch. And I will say that we're almost there in gain on the data. We're approaching 1 billion data points from multiple patients thousands of implants by now.  And really we're answering 3 questions. Number one is, to your point, what is the value proposition? Can we demonstrate a reduction in the length of the episode of care? Can we bring objectivity to a range of motion metrics? Can we demonstrate better gate performance given better technique, better surgery? Can we compare recovery curves? Who does better post implantation? There's a lot of data we get in that regard, and we'll be filing some claims once we digest the multiple data points that we're getting. So that's question number one.  Question number two in the limited market release is how do we make the whole thing seamless? This is new to the word technology. It's got a home base station, as you know. It involves the patient, involves the surgeon, the caregiver. So we want to make sure that is a best-in-class experience, and there are some things that we're working around.  And then the third question, and I know this is near and dear to you is who's going to pay for the technology? To that end, we got the NTAP kicking in at the beginning of October. You'll be pleased to know that we follow up with your question around TPD, transitional pass-through. We had a deadline of August 23 to submit. We're in the final stages of evaluating what the submission could look like. We're evaluating commercial payer strategy as part of this limited market release. So we continue to think about the payer as well. So with all of that said, the what, the how and the who will pay, I think going to be in a good position to start to see a full market release by January, if not late Q1 2024. I'd love to give you more color, but Bryan and Keri will shoot me. I will tell you that we remain convinced capital letters that would be first to market in Shoulder Robotics, and beyond the speed to market, what I like is what the actual platform offers. Faster surgeries, more accurate outcomes, shorter recovery. So a lot what we've seen, we've done our final validation labs with customers, both friends and family customer surgeons and also competitive surgeons and the feedback has been outstanding. Beyond the platform dynamics that I mentioned around shorter recovery, faster surgery, I just love the integration that Russia shoulder will have with the rest of the CDH ecosystem. So more than that soon. Ryan. I'll take that one as well. So obviously, it varies from region to region. What I will tell you here in the U.S., we saw greater backlog consumption coming from Knees and Hips. It was actually quite the opposite in EMEA. When it comes to S.E.T., a lot of those cases here in the U.S. are done in an ASC environment. And other cases, are commercial payers, and it's been pretty consistent. But again, it varies quarter-to-quarter, geography to geography. We do believe that the backlog is going to be here for a while, and we'll see fluctuation given ASC non-ASC in the U.S. And then again, different variables outside of the U.S. Yes, sure. I can do that as well. So I think Suky alluded to the trauma headwinds that we had in the quarter. We had some supply challenges. And obviously, you got the comp in China versus a year ago. Here in the U.S., there were some contracts that we lost about a year ago. We're anniversarying out of those. There were some product launches that were delayed, '22 and '23 that are coming out now. So I will say that moving forward, given the better comps or U.S. and the contract capabilities now in the U.S. along with innovation, the trauma business is going to be in a better position. Foot and ankle has been one of the businesses, frankly, within S.E.T. that we didn't prioritize. We wanted to prioritize upper extremities, SportsMed and CMFT. That being said, I do think there is a couple of product launches that are going to make a difference in the space. So all in all, I do think you'll see better performance. But trauma, foot and ankle are not the key priorities within S.E.T. And just on restorative therapy, that was restorative therapies was part of your question, but we anniversary out of the reimbursement change, July of 2023. So you should expect that business to do dramatically better now. Yes, I would say, Rick, that it's early innings, frankly, both for ROSA as well as cementless. We are in what I think is not still a full launch for cementless, given some of the supply constraints. I think as we exit 2023 and early 2024, we'll have as much supply as we need to meaningfully drive the penetration of cementless with a goal of going from 15% to 50%.  I won't say when 50% is going to happen, but that's definitely the North Star. ROSA is the same situation. We launched 2 platforms in Knee. We are about to launch ROSA Partial this summer, a new and improved version of that. We're working actively on next-generation total knee, which will be a meaningful launch going into '24.  We got all kind of ZBEdge add-ons data technology solutions that are going to augment the penetration there. But I would say net-net, both for ROSA, cementless and some of the peripheral launches around those 2 components, we are in the early innings. I'll start by saying that we have not seen anything new. All along, there were really 3 buckets that summarize the problem, materials, labor and sterilization, augmented with, frankly, just put demand plan on aside because the demand that we felt kept getting better and better and better. Sequentially, we've seen improvement. We've seen better forecast accuracy on the demand side. And then as we think about labor, at the Tier 1 level, our labor capabilities are much better than before. We're hiring people in our sites. When you think about sterilization, we had the right strategies, materials continue to be a challenge, but again, it's much better than before. So I would say improvement versus the past. And sequentially, we continue to see improvement across both supply and demand. Yes. Thank you, Matt. First and foremost, we don't disclose the number of patients, but I'll tell you, it's far greater than 1,000 patients. When are we done with the limited market release? I think we're about to complete that? The size matters more for certain claims than others, but I will tell you, we've got enough of a sample size to be able to engage in a full market release by 2024.  What's the expectation going forward, this is going to be a flagship product for Zimmer Biomet. We plan to see meaningful penetration of this technology. First in Knees, then in Hips and then at some point in Shoulders as well. What's the right penetration? Again, we won't disclose that. But given the unique technology, we will leverage this to the fullest."

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Keri, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. It's always good to be with you. But I would say it's even a little better and certainly more fun when we have great performance in the quarter. So we're pretty happy about the results that we get to discuss today, and I can tell you, we're looking forward to the dialogue.  And I'll start things up, as we normally do, I'll talk about our Q2 performance and the key drivers inside of the quarter. But I think also really important is to talk about the key drivers that we see continuing to move this business forward.  And then Suky will walk us through the financial details of the quarter and importantly, discuss how we are again raising our full year financial guidance. And then, of course, we'll close things out with a Q&A session, and we look forward to answering your questions and having a dialogue in that session.  Okay. To kick things off, I'm just going to take a step back, which I've been doing now for the last handful of quarters and I think deservedly so, because I want to say thank you. I want to say thank you to each and every one of our team members around the world because it's your hard work, it's your dedication to getting the job done that is moving this business forward.  And I will tell you that I'm proud to say that you have delivered another very strong quarter, while once again making ZB a certified Great Place to Work. And you've done all of this while improving our scores and as a result of that, our rankings on the environmental, social and governance front.  So I think simply stated, we are doing well, while also doing good. And that means for our team members, our patients, our customers and our communities and even our planet. So once again, I want to say thank you to our team for all that you do for ZB and to move our mission forward. And most importantly, for doing it together as one team, one ZB team. Now let's talk about the second quarter. And I'm just going to say simply, we delivered another strong quarter, again beating our own expectations. And that performance positions us to again raise our financial guidance on both the top and bottom line. And this is in the face of some pretty significant macro factors that are impacting us in the entire market. Ongoing supply challenges are very real, and I'll talk about those in a minute, but also inflationary pressure, a tough labor market and the geopolitical landscape that is putting pressure on everybody. But against that, I feel very confident about our pipeline, our execution and the team's demonstrated ability to navigate these headwinds, which gives us confidence to increase our financial outlook.  Okay. With that said, let's talk about the key drivers inside of Q2, and there were some positives and there were some negatives. I'll start with the positives, and the most important one, in my view, is that our team's execution remains flawless. We're seeing significant traction, probably the best we've ever seen with our new product innovation. And that paid dividends in the quarter for sure, but most importantly, is it pays dividends as we move this business forward.  And I would say that procedure recovery continued in the quarter, again showing no meaningful impact from COVID or staffing challenges, and that allowed for a tailwind from increased provider capacity, and that resulted in backlog pull-through in the quarter.  In terms of headwinds, I would say that the team is doing a great job of managing the supply-constrained environment. But I would say that it is still very clearly a governor to our overall growth in the quarter, and it continues to be a distraction for the organization.  See if I combine these things, though, all in all, our momentum continues, and it continues to grow. And I've said before, my confidence in this business, our confidence in this business is as high as it's ever been. And it's high for a good reason. If you just look at the knee franchise alone, our innovation strategy is working. We now have 4 meaningful pillars inside of this business. All of which can drive pricing stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions.  First, let's look at the ROSA Robotic Platform combined with our Persona cementless Knee. Now this is a powerhouse combination that is and will continue to accelerate growth. And based on the traction we're seeing so far, we continue to believe that ROSA and Persona cementless together will enhance our robotics and cementless penetration from the current mid-teen level to 50% or better, 5-0% or better.  The second pillar that we're focused on is Persona revision. This provides a meaningful conversion and mix opportunities inside the revision category. But importantly, it also acts as a powerful tip-of-the-spear product for conversions and primary needs.  And then third, it's just the overall shift of the ZB legacy knee systems to our now fully rounded out Persona portfolio. And this is a meaningful mix benefit that we can take advantage of that, I would say, is somewhat unique to our business.  And then fourth, on top of all this, we have the world's first and only Smart Knee which is Persona iQ. And I know this is still in limited launch, but already, it offers surgeons unparalleled data access and is attractive to patients, those patients who want more direct engagement with their care recovery. And we're taking on a similar approach to our hip portfolio where we continue to launch meaningful innovation, again, giving us the opportunity for price stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions. And we have 4 pillars of focus here as well.  First, it's ROSA and Hip Insight. These are technology shifts in robotics and mixed reality that are setting up the ZB Hip portfolio for greater adoption and growth.  Second is the Avenir Complete. This is our current flagship product combined with G7, which gives us a very strong position in both the attractive direct anterior and revision submarkets of hip.  And then third, this position will be enhanced with work being done on a triple taper stem which will fully round out our direct interior approach portfolio. We believe this new portfolio, combined with the G7, which is the most versatile acetabular component available will be unmatched in the industry.  And then fourth, HAMR. This is our upcoming full launch of an automated impaction system that builds on a proven need in the market, and we fully expect that this launch will create surgical efficiencies while bringing personalized precision to each and every patient.  And then finally, in S.E.T., we are being disciplined and targeting investment in our growth driver categories, Upper extremities, Sports and CMFT, and each of these categories continue to perform. And given our momentum in these businesses and continued investment in innovation and dedicated infrastructure, we fully expect the S.E.T. set business to be a mid-single-digit grower in a normalized market environment.  So overall, we're very excited about our innovation momentum. It's very real. Remember, we've called out that we have 40 planned product launches between this year and the end of 2025. With the majority in 4%-plus growth markets. And that's important because these innovations will certainly drive near-term growth. There's no question about that, but also create better sustainability of that growth because of the markets they're in.  This portfolio shift that we're seeing and the team's execution capabilities are clear signs that our ZB transformation has taken hold. But I can tell you right now that we're not going to stop there. The goal is to continue to enhance our growth profile through our ongoing focus on active portfolio management, and that is supported by our already strong and strengthening balance sheet. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Suky for a closer look at Q2 and our latest expectations for the remainder of 2023. Okay, Suky? Thanks, Travis. Well I think maybe I'll do because obviously, Ivan is here with us and as close to the action as any of us. So maybe I'll pass it on him to answer the question. Ivan? I think the key takeaway you just don't see as much impact on the S.E.T. business as you do the Recon business when you think about backlog. Yes. And to be clear, it doesn't mean that we don't see foot and ankle, trauma and restorative therapies as potentially attractive markets. It's just we want to be disciplined in the way that we're going to invest -- and the -- if you look at the strat plans that we have for upper extremity, CMFT and Sports, they're very attractive. So we're going to focus our investment there.  Out at the end of the day, the individuals running foot and ankle, trauma or restorative therapies, put a plan in place that's attractive, they could become growth drivers. But today, we want to differentiate those growth drivers to non-growth drivers, nothing against any other categories. It's just the plan right now is very attractive in those 3. I think we'll try to stay away from quantifying, it's pretty challenging, actually, because when you talk about supply issues, you always get feedback from the field on what could have happened if you had more supply and you've got to make sure that you're kind of sifting through what's real, what's not. But the fact is it is a governor for us right now, and that's why we continue to say it. What's important, though, is it's a macro-challenge. There's not a company in orthopedics right now that is not being impacted by supply challenges. So it's impacting everyone. AAOS just did a survey actually with surgeons asking this question and across the board regardless of who they were using, they were experiencing supply challenges.  Really important thing for us that's built into the guidance that Suky just provided. So that's key. But when I think about that growth driver, the impact it's having on our ability to grow. I think it's important to look at that. That means is getting in the way of our team using new innovation to drive mix benefit and competitive conversions. We truly do believe that it was not a factor. We'd be getting more mix benefit, we'll be getting more competitive conversions because the demand is there. So it's frustrating. We have great momentum in the business, great innovation and supply is in the way of driving that growth. And we believe it's going to continue to be there for a period of time. Thanks, Rick. What I'd say first is just to make sure that I clarify. I'm saying that both ROSA and cementless will move from the mid-teens to 50% plus, 5-0 percent plus. So not just cementless. And they kind of do play off of each other. They benefit each other as they're trying to get adoption in the marketplace. But speaking specifically to cementless, maybe I can pass that to you. Thanks, Rick. I mean I'll kind of tongue-in-cheek say we're thinking about everything. But obviously, that doesn't get you anywhere you focus. And we've been very clear from the very beginning that we had 3 phases of the transformation of this company. Phase one is always going to be alive, but we're in great shape Phase 2 is kind of what you just said.  We have a great innovation pipeline. We're executing from an organic standpoint. We feel very confident in that phase. And now we're squarely in Phase 3, as we've been saying, and the big focus for us is that portfolio transformation that will leverage our balance sheet. And the balance sheet is strong and strengthening us in the prepared remarks, and that is the area of focus for us. How do we continue to move our weighted average market growth forward.  I can tell you we've already made great progress in the focus area here. We've already moved it North. With the balance sheet strength, we expect it to continue to move in the right direction. So that's an area of focus, not just for me but for this entire team. Do we still have you? I mean the challenge, it's a fixed equation, right? I mean as you start to improve as we would expect in materials, labor and sterilization because we've put great planning around that, as demand continues to be strong, it's going to delay supply recovery. And so that's what we're seeing is we're seeing a great dynamic strength in the marketplace, better traction in our new innovation than we even expected, but that puts pressure on that equation, and it pushes the supply challenges out. Just maybe a quick summary to on what -- but you were just talking about Suky, when we think about a normalized market. And we're saying 2024 in our view, is not going to be normalized for 2 factors. You're still going to have backlog that we're going to have to pay attention to. We would deem backlog is a neutral to potentially negative depending on whether it stays the same or decreases. We don't think there's going to be an increase in it.  And the second one is supply. That is going to be neutral to positive because as we continue to see supply benefits that will create a tailwind for next year. So those are pretty big variables that would tell us that we don't have a normal year in 2024, but they're offsetting. So that's the reason why we think 2024, even though \"not normal\" could look a lot like a normal year from a growth perspective. I just want to make sure that, that's clear. And then just going to sum it up, first of all, thanks again for joining us this morning. And I think it's pretty clear in the way that we talk about the business right now that we're not just excited about where we are as a company, but the future of this company. And I think that's really important.  We've already made disciplined portfolio decisions that have increased the weighted average market growth of this business that's already happened, and that gives us confidence in the growth of the organization, not just today but in the future. And the balance sheet says that we're going to continue to be able to strengthen our position in those fast-growth markets and we will absolutely do that. That is Phase 3 of the transformation. And the innovation pipeline as Ivan continues to talk about is as strong as it's ever been, and that gives us the ability to drive mix benefit, pricing stability and competitive conversions. And when supply gets out of the way, that will even happen more. So we're very excited about it. And I've been doing this long enough to know when the team has got that skip in their step. And they've got the ammunition to be able to drive the performance of the business sustainably. And we are in that place. Okay.  With that, I'll go ahead and close it out, and thanks for joining us."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Zimmer Biomet First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today May 2, 2023. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Chief Communications Officer. Please go ahead.\nKeri Mattox : Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. We're joining you from our Warsaw Indiana headquarters and are happy to be with you today. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Joining me are Bryan Hanson, our Chairman President and CEO; EVP and CFO, Suketu Upadhyay and COO, Ivan Tornos. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you, that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included within our Q1 earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan, Bryan?\nBryan Hanson : All right. Thanks, Keri. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. We don't get the opportunity to do this too often. So I'm going to take advantage of it. And I'm just going to start the call by simply saying this was a phenomenal quarter, where pretty much everything went better than expected. And importantly, as a result of that momentum, we are significantly raising our full year top and bottom line outlook, which Suke Upadhyay is going to talk about in just a minute. With that said, and maybe taking a step back, for today's call, I'll talk more about our Q1 performance and the drivers of that performance. And then Suke will get into more details for the quarter and importantly, also our financial guidance for the rest of the year. And then we'll make sure that we save plenty of time for your questions which we look forward to addressing. But before we do any of that, I just want to take a minute to speak directly and personally to the ZB team. And it really just say thank you, truly say thank you. For yet again, you have delivered beyond our expectations. And I'm very proud of what this team is doing to navigate an environment that while improving, there's no question it's improving, it is still fluid. And it presents us with challenges that quite frankly seem like daily challenges. And it is truly impressive how you're navigating that environment right now. And I'm very proud of the dedication, the resilience and the innovative thinking that you're bringing to your roles each and every day. It is truly making a difference. But I'm most proud of how together and I do mean together, we are living the ZB mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality-of-life for people around the world. And as we know, we do that every eight seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which is really what it's all about in the first place. So thank you. Thank you for what you do for ZB, thank you for what you do for our customers and most of all, and most importantly, what you do for our patients, the patients that we serve every day. Okay, so let's take a look now at the first quarter. And as some of you may recall coming into the year, our guidance assumed that Q1 would have the easiest comp of the year, but also experienced some headwinds from both staffing and COVID-related challenges that we felt would put pressure on elective procedures during the quarter. We also assumed that there would be a pretty high level of supply pressure in the first quarter. Our assumptions also believed that all three of these headwind variables would then improve throughout the year providing less impact to the business. But then outside of the easy comp, Q1 would be pretty bumpy. Okay, so what actually happened in the quarter? And why was it considerably stronger than we expected? Well, first and foremost, procedure recovery was much better than we anticipated, really having almost no material or meaningful impact from COVID or staffing challenges in the quarter. And second, we manage the supply constrained environment better than we originally anticipated. Make no mistake, supply is a real problem. And it's putting pressure on the business. But this team has done an excellent job managing that environment, probably leveraging some muscle memory from the past. And then third, and I think really importantly, our team's execution and traction with our new product innovation is even stronger than we anticipated. And that's important because it's going to continue to provide benefit to the rest of the year. And so because of this, we saw another quarter of very positive year-over-year momentum in large joints, with our global hip and knee businesses growing approximately 13% and 18% on an ex-FX basis. Our overall S.E.T. category grew more than 6%, driven by strong low-double-digit performance in our growth drivers in S.E.T. which we've talked about before being sports, CMFT and upper extremities. And then this was partially offset as expected, from headwinds from our restorative therapies business, where these headwinds will anniversary, and as you remember, these are reimbursement change headwinds that we have in that business, they should anniversary by the back half of this year. And then finally, our other category grew 11% in the quarter. So needless to say it was a pretty strong quarter. And the momentum is real in this business and our confidence is extremely high. And there's good reason for this competence. If we just think about this quarter alone, we officially launched our new cementless knee form factor Persona OsseoTi, and this is adding to the Persona family and really strategically rounding out that portfolio. And this new keel design tray is extremely versatile, it's anatomic because it is the Persona family and it's stable. And it's the only knee that you can do a cemented or cementless procedure with an inter operative decision possible for the surgeon. And that's a big deal. We believe that this will enhance the potential for cementless penetration, because surgeons can go into a questionable bone quality procedure with the intent to use cementless, but then they have the ability to pivot back to cement it as the bone quality isn't there. And for this reason, and a lot of other reasons, customer feedback so far has been extremely positive, as we've launched this product. And as you may know, our cementless penetration is already in the mid-teens. But we believe that this can get to 50% or higher penetration. And we're excited about that. And we truly do believe that this premium product can accelerate that growth for ZB and is already doing so. It's still early days. Our full launch is planned for the middle of this year as more sets become available. Make no mistake, this is a real driver for not just our knee franchise, but for the overall company. So we're very excited. As you remember, back in February, we also closed our acquisition of Embody, which is providing access to differentiated products and an innovative pipeline for our sports medicine business. And this investment helps expand ZB's presence in this very attractive high growth market, while also in that market, serving our customers and our patients better. And this combined with a very strong innovation pipeline that we have in sports, and this dedicated commercial channel that we put into place gives us continued confidence in our global sports franchise. And if you're at the AAOS meeting, you would have seen that we previewed our Hammer product, which is designed to ensure consistent and reproducible compaction for hip procedures, while allowing the surgeon to dial up or dial back the force of the strike, depending on the individual patient need. And this ability to be more personalized, actually differentiates Hammer versus other compaction devices on the market. So needless to say, we're excited about this differentiated product. We believe this could actually increase not only the consistency for surgeons, but also the procedure efficiency, which is really important right now. And our current expectation is to launch Hammer in the third quarter of this year. And if you just look at these combined products, this is actually building on other launches that we've talked about the Persona IQ, Hip Insights, the Identity Shoulder system, and in total, we've introduced more than 50 new products from 2018 through the end of 2022, with the majority of those products coming in markets growing 4% or faster. And we're geared to continue that momentum, doesn't stop here with another 40 planned product launches between this year and the end of 2025, again, with the majority of those products to be launched in 4%-plus growth markets. And this shift not only continues to transformation of our product portfolio, because the short term revenue growth, but it also improves our weighted average market growth. And ultimately, as a result of that gives us more confidence that our markets and our portfolio mix positions to company for sustainable mid-single-digit growth. And with this kind of traction around our product pipeline, increasing strength of our balance sheet, and our team members' ability to execute, ZB continues to be well positioned to deliver value today and in the future and achieve our mission as a company. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suke to take a closer look at Q1 and our latest expectations for 2023. Okay, Suke.\nSuketu Upadhyay : Thanks, and good morning everyone. As Bryan mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with better than expected results. As a result of continued market normalization and the strength of our performance, we are increasing and narrowing our full year financial outlook. With that, let's turn to our results in updated full year guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the first quarter and how it compares to the same period in 2022. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.831 billion, an increase of 10.1% on a reported basis and an increase of 13.2%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. As we noted on our last call, we had a selling day tailwind of about 100 basis points this quarter. Overall, the business back from faster than expected recovery of elective procedures driven by the easing of staffing related headwinds, normalization of cancellation rates, and some backlog recapture. Also, we've benefited from lighter comps, strong commercial and supply chain execution and new product uptake. While we continue to face macro supply headwinds, our teams have been doing a great job mitigating these challenges. U.S. growth of 12.7% was well ahead of our expectations with elective procedure volumes recovering and procedure cancellation rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. International sales grew 14%, EMEA growing ahead of expectations, driven by faster recovery and strength across both developed and emerging markets. And in APAC, we saw some pressure in China as anticipated, but results were generally in line with our expectations. Turning the business category performance, global knees grew 18.2% with us growing 18.1% and international growth at 18.2. Specifically, we saw strong uptake across the full Persona product portfolio and traction in all regions. We now have the Persona, Primary, Partial, Revision and OsseoTi cementless options rounding out our full product line. And we are seeing very encouraging results across that new cementless form factor. This full Persona product line not only improves and enhances our product mix benefit, but also supports the continued utilization of Rosa and associated pool through. Global hips grew 12.9% with U.S. hips up 12.3% and international up 13.5%, driven by continued traction across the Avenir and G7 product lines, along with ongoing uptake of Rosa hip. And we are encouraged by the early impact of the Hip Insight launch. The S.E.T. category grew 6.4% driven by continued strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine and upper extremities, all of which grew in the teens. This was partially offset by lower growth in other parts of S.E.T., which includes the reimbursement changes in restore therapies that will anniversary mid this year. Finally, our other category grew 11.1% partially driven by some larger orders and surgical products which may not repeat over time. Moving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share at $1.11, compared towards GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 in the prior year. While investments in R&D and commercial infrastructure increased, net earnings were higher this quarter driven by revenues improve gross margins and losses in the prior year related to ZimVie. On an adjusted basis diluted earnings per share was $1.89 represents a 17% increase from $1.61, in the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted gross margin was 72.8%, up 220 basis points from the prior year. These results were positively impacted by favorable mix related to large joints performance and foreign currency hedged gains. Excluding these items, underlying gross margin was broadly in line with our expectations related to inflation. We're seeing some incremental pressure from spot buying and contract manufacturing pricing, but overall inflationary pressure has largely stabilized. Our adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 28.4%, up 200 basis points primarily driven by revenue better gross margin and continued discipline around our investment profile. Interest in non-operating expenses of $46 million and our adjusted tax rate of 16.3% were broadly in line with our expectations. Turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $308 million and free cash flow totaled $178 million. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $330 million. And moving to our updated financial outlook for 2023. Based on strong Q1 results and our ongoing strong execution, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 outlook. Constant currency revenue growth is now expected to be 6% to 7% versus 2022, with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of 100 basis points. We're also updating our adjusted EPS guidance range now expecting $7.40 to $7.50. While we initially gave color that adjusted operating margin would be flat to slightly better in 2023, or Q1 results in tandem with an improved rest of your outlook gives us the confidence that we will expand operating margins this year. We continue to expect interest and other non-operating expenses, along with our tax rate to be in line with our previous commentary. Finally, we now expect free cash flow for the year to increase to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. In terms of quarterly cadence throughout the year, our expectations remain unchanged. Q1 will be the highest revenue growth quarter followed by Q4, which should benefit from improving supply and contribution from new and innovative products, as well as a selling day tailwind of about 100 basis points. Q2 and Q3 are expected to be lighter growth quarters given tougher comps and a net selling day headwind of about 100 basis points. Again, selling days will have a net neutral impact for the full year. We expect adjusted operating margin to largely follow revenue with second half operating margins being slightly better than the first half. In summary, we delivered excellent top-line results, beating internal expectations in nearly every category while posting very strong adjusted earnings performance. Our business is executing well our pipeline is delivering and our momentum is real. We feel very confident as we move forward. With that I'll turn the call back over to Keri to start the Q&A.\nKeri Mattox : Thanks, Suke. Before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: We'll take our first question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer.\nSteve Lichtman : Good morning, guys. And congratulations on the quarter. I guess, first one, I want to start on the knee and hip market. Obviously, very strong for ZB and for the market. As you noted comps play a part. I was wondering if you could talk about what you think sort of underlying market growth here is, and maybe talk a little bit about procedure growth and where sort of pricing stands as well?\nSuketu Upadhyay : Sure, Steve. Thanks for the question. This is Suey and hello to everyone on the call. The first thing I'd just step back, overall, we had a very good first quarter, as you can see from the results. And it was really across all of our business segments, including all of our regions, and that flowed through all the way through the P&L. So really happy about the quality and the execution of the entire team. We did always think that Q1 would be our strongest growth quarter. We talked about that when we gave our initial guidance for the year. That was really two key drivers. One is you had a strong comp benefit versus the first quarter of 2022. Clearly, we were still dealing with Omicron back in 2022. Secondly, we talked about a day rate tailwind of 100 basis points. So we knew year-over-year that we would see strong growth. But we achieved better than that and really across every one of our business segments, as I pointed out earlier. But recall where our expectations were before. We thought we would continue to see some procedural volume challenges and staffing challenges and also supply chain headwinds. So that underpinned our previous guide. But we actually overachieved relative to those macro factors. Where we just didn't see as much staffing or COVID pressure. We also saw some backlog come into the marketplace. And so from a macro standpoint, it was better than we expected. And then also our execution was incredibly strong. Our innovation was very strong across commercial but also supply chain. So really happy with where everybody sort of executed for the quarter. And we think that, that store will going forward. Relative to your specific question on the overall market growth rates. I would just say, look, we're not yet in normal market growth. You clearly continue to have some choppy comp comparisons versus the prior year. We do still think we're going to continue to face some headwinds relative to staffing and of course, supply chain continues to be a very real challenge out there, partially offset by some backlog tailwinds. So again the markets, I think, are anything but normal yet. But I would say they're very strong, they're improving and normalizing, and we're very encouraged about where they're going. Pricing in the quarter was a little bit, I would say, kind of in line with where we expected it to be. We always talked about this year being a bit better than the traditional 200 to 300 basis points that we've seen historically. And at 140 basis points of erosion that was right in line with where we expected to be.\nSteve Lichtman : Great, thanks. And one product on the new side that is yet benefiting you is on a Persona IQ. I was wondering if you could give us your updated thoughts on that, how the limited launch is going and maybe your latest thoughts on the outlook for that product, particularly after the NTAP proposal. Thanks.\nIvan Tornos : Thank you, Steve, Ivan here. So lots of excitement as of late on Persona IQ. As of late, obviously, we got the NTAP indication that we're kicking October of 2023, were featured in the Wall Street Journal that got a lot of attention. We've signed additional contracts all over the U.S. with advancing rapidly in our limited market release, which as we said in the past, is more clinical in nature than commercial. We got now north of 500 million data points. And again, that's gained a lot of excitement. In terms of where we are, I'll tell you nothing has changed. We believe we'll be in a position to launch speed product by the end of 2023. We're working on four key things when it comes to this limited market release. Number two is understanding the clinical value proposition as well as the commercial value proposition. What do we do with all this data? What is the best way to position this product in the marketplace? Number two, as you can imagine, with the data component, there is a bit of a back and forth ownership, how do we utilize it, how do we make the best out of all this data. So we can act on it. And I would say with that tends a lot in this regard. Number three, is making sure that, overall, the customer experience is seamless. This involves patient education, this involves caregiver education. We're going to make sure that this is a best-in-class experience. And then number four, is how do we monetize the device. So in those four key areas, we've made tremendous advancements. And I do believe we're going to be in a position to launch at the end of the year. The NTAP is not going to impact every single patient, but it's a sizable amount of patients that are going to benefit from the additional reimbursement. And again, it's just another reminder that this is breakthrough technology, first to market, new to market that will make a difference. So the exigent is high, and we look forward to updating you guys down the road.\nSteve Lichtman : Thank you, Ivan.\nKeri Mattox : Thanks so much, Steve. Operator, can we go to the next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Shagun Singh with RBC.\nShagun Singh : Great, thank you so much for taking the question. And congratulations on a really strong print here. I guess just a question around guidance and Q2 trends. So your guidance is about 6% to 7% ex FX in 2023. Can you just walk us through expectations around cadence, perhaps shed some light on April trends for your business? How you expect that to stack up versus Q2. I think prior to the call, consensus was looking for sales and EPS of 1.79 and 1.77, respectively, your guidance obviously implies strength beyond Q1. So any color there? And then longer term, what does it mean for the growth profile for Zimmer going forward really versus consensus? I believe for 2024 is around 4.5%. So any color there would be great. Thanks so much.\nSuketu Upadhyay : Yea. Shagun, it's Suke. Thank you for the question. We definitely saw a very good quarter in the year in the first quarter, and we're expecting that momentum to carry through. And I think you would see that in our rest of year guide coming up to 6% to 7% ex FX. From a quarterly cadence standpoint, I would expect the overall growth rates in each quarter from here to step down from the first quarter. And it really goes back to that one that comp benefit I talked about in the first quarter on Steve's question, but also we have that day rate tailwind of about 100 basis points in the first quarter. So that you should think about, again, the first quarter being the highest fourth quarter being the second highest from a growth perspective and the second and third being a little bit lighter just based on tougher comps and a net day rate headwind. And so that's how you should think about cadence. But definitely, we're lifting our guidance by more than just the first quarter outperformance. We're actually pulling that momentum through the rest of the year as part of that raise. Maybe Bryan, do you want to talk about the underlying growth as we move forward.\nBryan Hanson : I mean, we've stated it before. And obviously, just based on our performance today, our confidence level is even higher. We do believe that we're 4%-plus grower in a normal market. It's not exactly normal right now, as Suky talked about before, but our confidence continues to grow that we're in the right markets. We continue to build scale in more attractive submarkets and our confidence design.\nShagun Singh : And just any color on April trends?\nSuketu Upadhyay : I would say, continue to support our increase in guidance. So things continue to -- our guidance initially showed or had an assumption of improvement throughout the year. Our current increase in guide assumes that as well in the early days in April continuing to prove that out.\nShagun Singh : Thank you.\nKeri Mattox : Thanks, Shagun. Operator, can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Matt Taylor with Jefferies.\nMatt Taylor : Hey, guys. Can you hear me okay?\nKeri Mattox : We can.\nMatt Taylor : Great. So Suke, I want to ask you a question about margins. Because to your point, you're fortunate now you have this maybe excess growth. We don't know exactly. But that gives you a lot of margin to work with. And so I think, ultimately, that's what people care about is how our margin is going to progress. And I know you've talked a lot about it. But if you enjoy this excess growth for a while, how are you going to use that? Are you going to reinvest? Or are you going to let it drop through? What are you thinking about in terms of how to use the excess margin?\nSuketu Upadhyay : Yeah. I'd say the first thing is that it feels good to be in a position where you have the optionality, right, of deciding where you're going to put that additional growth in the margin or the profitability upside that comes from that. We continue to have a very strong, robust and innovative pipeline. We're going to continue to invest against the business in the right way, in a disciplined way. We're going to continue to be focused and make choices about, continue to expand in faster-growth submarkets that have good profitability profiles. We believe we can do that while still expanding margins over time. And that really comes from the strength and the discipline of the overall team in driving efficiency and mix shift in that investment profile to make sure that we're growing the top line while still growing the bottom line. So we think we can do both over time.\nMatt Taylor : Great. And one follow-up. So no one quite knows what's going to happen here, right? But it seems like there may be some excess demand for a while. And the best type of margin is that, that comes from excess organic growth, right? And so you may have that for a while. So how are you thinking about that? You talk about yourself as a 4% grower, but I mean clearly, you just outperformed that by a lot. And I guess, a, how long can that last? And then b, if it does last longer, then how does that change how you run the business?\nSuketu Upadhyay : Yeah. Just going back to your point there, remember the comp benefit in Q1 was a key driver beyond underpinning that large overperformance relative to sort of that 4% to 5% we've been talking about. So just want to make sure that we've got good clarity around that. Having said that, as Bryan talked about, we do think and have even more confidence now based on our execution, based on the normalization of markets based on our pipeline, that 4 to 5 is a durable number, and we'd be disappointed again if we weren't able to achieve that in normalized markets. So we think that, that's sustainable over time. And then as we talked about, if that provides profitability upside that can be reinvested back into the business while still driving margin expansion. I mean that's where we want to be, right? That was the story underpinning our margin expansion all the way back to the beginning a few years ago, which is to be able to do this through revenue leverage, and do it in a high-quality way while investing back to the business.\nMatt Taylor : Yeah, guys. Thank you.\nKeri Mattox : Thanks so much. Operator, can we have next question please?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar : Thank you, guys. Congrats on really strong. I'll start here. My first one here, Bryan, there is some debate on perhaps demand being pulled forward here. Do you see this also in market growth as perhaps a catch-up of backlog as against a pull forward of demand and do you feel like with your product portfolio that you have, is Zimmer now gaining share in the market versus the industry?\nBryan Hanson : Well, maybe I'll just quickly talk about what I see from a market standpoint, us versus market. And then maybe you could speak to, which I think when you say pull forward you talked about backlog consumption. So maybe you could talk about backlog. From us versus market perspective, it felt pretty good in the quarter. Obviously, we look at this on a year-over-year basis, a stack basis, a sequential basis versus our key competitors. But we try not to get overexuberant about any specific order or too depressed about any specific quarter. What we do look at, as I've always talked about, is an eight-quarter trend across those three vectors. If I go all the way back to Q2 of 2020, and I look at that consistent order trend, I feel very good about our position versus market. And I truly believe we're just getting started. So from us versus market perspective, I feel good, and I think it will only get better over time. If you think about the backlog, maybe you could speak to what we saw in the quarter.\nSuketu Upadhyay : Yeah. So there are a lot of factors inside the quarter that drove the outsized performance. I talked about year-over-year our original expectations, but we were above that, again, for a number of variables, including less pressure than we expected. We saw some backlog. I talked about, and we were able to navigate supply chain and good commercial execution. I would say backlog was probably the smaller component of the overall change our performance relative to expectations in Q1. We do expect that to continue for the rest of the year. That's built into our guidance as we move forward. And so yeah, it's good to have that a bit of an offset or tailwind relative to some of the other challenges we're seeing in the marketplace.\nVijay Kumar : Understood. And Suky, one on margins for you. Gross margins up 100 basis points sequentially. Can you just remind us on what was the impact of inflation, China BP, et cetera, in Q1? And what drove this sequential gross margin expansion? And when I look at your guidance, revenue raised by 250 basis points at the midpoint, EPS up by 6%. Clearly, that implies operating margin expansion I think, north of 50 basis points. Is it all coming from gross margins versus operating leverage?\nSuketu Upadhyay : Yeah. So thanks for the question -- second question here, Vijay. The first thing is I'm just going to step back a little bit. As part of the overall margin expansion story, the Zimmer Biomet, we talked about ability to stabilize gross margins from '22 out for the next few years. Side of that on better revenue growth, we would leverage SG&A, which would give us the platform to then expand margins increase our earnings balance as a company. So that continues to be the strategy and story, and I think you're just seeing that play out here to 2023. Remember, as we came into '23, we talked about 100 basis points roughly of inflationary pressure in '22. That was going to capitalize in our P&L this year. That still remains true. In fact, probably seeing a little bit of additional incremental pressure on some areas of supply chain and inflation. I talked about contract manufacturing supply prices. We're still doing some spot buys for certain raw materials. It's putting a modest amount of incremental pressure. Nothing significant, but something we just want to keep our eyes on for the rest of this year and into 2024. But again, inflation has largely stabilized. So that 100 basis points is definitely coming in year-over-year. But despite that, we said that 22% on gross margins would be relatively in line, excuse me, '23 versus 2022, right? So the teams are going to be able to find a way to offset that incremental headwind and we've largely done that. Now in the first quarter, we did see exceptional growth sequentially, but also year-over-year. There are a number of variables that drive that. But I'd say the three biggest are around volume gains, right, that led us year-over-year but also versus expectation. Saw some FX hedge gains in the quarter and also a pretty pronounced mix benefit, especially given the outsized performance of our large joints versus our S.E.T. and other category and also U.S. versus the rest of the world. So those are kind of the three dynamics that are going on. In the first quarter, we -- as we go through the rest of the year, we still expect those three variables to play a positive impact, but not at the same level, okay? So the way to think about this is gross margin for the rest of the year will step down versus Q1, but still for the overall year will be higher than it was in 2022. So you should think about it on an underlying basis, '23 being still in line with 2022, okay? So gross margin is definitely a tailwind, underlying still consistent with prior year. The operating margin that you're implying off of our EPS guide is I think the directionally right way to think about that, and that upside is coming primarily from gross margin. So those are some of the building blocks that underpin our EPS raise for the year.\nKeri Mattox : Operator, can we have the next question?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus : Great. Thanks for the question, and congrats on a nice quarter. Maybe to start, I was hoping maybe you could dive into some of the drivers behind the knee growth rate. It was really impressive, definitely better than market growth and was just hoping you could help us understand how much is coming from robotics, from mix of new products and really dive into some of the growth drivers there? Thanks.\nIvan Tornos : Hey. Thank you, Robbie. Good talking to you this morning. I will probably bucket the performance in two key areas: commercial execution and innovation. And maybe I'll start with Slide number two, and I won't break down all the details on what's driving what. But clearly, new product introductions had to do a lot with the performance. As you know, during Las Vegas, we launched Persona OsseoTi, that is our cementless new form factor platform, and that is gaining traction. I'll tell you, roughly one third of all customers for Persona OsseoTi are competitive accounts. We've seen that with Persona OsseoTi with increasing also the penetration robotics. And again, I won't break down the size of that increase. But we've seen an increase in robotic cases done in combination, personas and ROSA. So definitely a driver there. Persona iQ, obviously, too early but ROSA overall, with Persona primary is gaining traction across the globe. The ecosystem, the interconnectivity of implants and CV is gaining momentum. And that's the momentum whether you hit in the U.S. or you're in Europe or Asia Pacific. So again, a lot to unpack when it comes to innovation. On commercial execution, we navigated supply challenges, I think, very effectively, very proud of what the team has done in that regard. And we're executing flawlessly. We got new incentive plans in place in '23 that were not around in 2022. Around making sure that people are growing in knees and hips, while pulling asset. We have new incentives in other geographies around EMEA and APAC. And I would say, again, the commercial execution is going very well. The last thing I'll talk about is the ASC. This is one area where in the past, we're not doing other grade. We have three major gaps, people, contracts and portfolio. The portfolio is definitely there. We added a lot of people in our contracting group and the number of people they're thinking about ASCs in the hundreds. So today, around 10% to 15% of our sales come from the ASC and that's growing very nicely. So again, commercial execution and innovation are the two key buckets when it comes to this level of performance.\nRobbie Marcus : Really helpful. And maybe for Bryan and Suke, we've heard you talk in the past about using M&A to maybe diversify into faster-growing parts of the market. There's a lot of talk from your competitors about M&A, some of them more specific than others. I thought it would be great to just get your latest thoughts on M&A for Zimmer, how you're thinking about it in terms of size and ability to diversify away from your core markets and your thoughts on valuations out there right now. Thanks.\nBryan Hanson : Yeah. So maybe just quickly before I get into our focus areas. I'd say in valuations, I still think -- see things as being pretty expensive. I look at assets that are out there today. We're not seeing as much downward pressure on valuations as we certainly were hoping for. Maybe a little better recently, but not as good as we would have expected. And then that, combined with the fact that capital is a little more expensive to come by is not necessarily a great combination. That said, we still think there's opportunities that we're going to try to pursue. We are absolutely in Phase 3 of the transformation. As we said many times, Phase 3 is focused on portfolio transformation using capital to be able to acquire technologies that are attractive to the organization. And we're very focused on this and extremely disciplined, number one, we're not going to look at a target if it's not mission centric. That's very important to the organization. We are a mission-driven organization, and that target needs to move our mission forward. We need to see a path to leadership at some point if we move into that space or we're already in that space. We need to see a WAM accretion, so increasing our weighted average market growth and as a result of that, our revenue growth and then ultimately helping us drive faster EPS growth. So those are the types of deals. And then inside of that, we're looking at enhancing our position through acquisitions in fast growth subcategories of recon, which may not seem super exciting, but the fact is there's some fast growth subcategories that we want to build scale in so that we can grow faster than the overall market in a consistent way. And then we're also going to look to diversify. So looking at acquisitions, which we've already shown in other parts of orthopedics that are faster growth, that's mainly in our set category for us. Eventually looking to diversify outside of orthopedics to diversify outside of electric procedures and give us other forms of opportunity to grow the business again outside of orthopedics. And we would say most likely in the near term, we would look at smaller to midsized deals, and we would kind of quantify that to say about $1 billion in revenue or less would put us in that category. And we would probably stay a little closer to the vest in Orthopedics in the near term. So that's the way we're thinking about it right now. Anything else you want to add to that?\nSuketu Upadhyay : I would just say all the hard work that the team has done in improving financial performance, paying down debt over the last few years, even through a challenging period to COVID. We've really strengthened the balance sheet. And so the great thing is our capital structure can support everything that Bryan spoke about. Right now, we're traveling somewhere around the mid- to high-2s from a net debt to leverage ratio perspective. So if you took turn, turn and half on that relative to $2 billion to $2.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA, you would see that there's a substantial amount of M&A firepower available to us. And those numbers would only be augmented by the EBITDA from a target. So a long way of saying that we've got the capital structure, we've got the balance sheet to support what Bryan talked about.\nBryan Hanson : And what's key about that, we were very disciplined about this. It's who we put phases into the organization transformation. We wanted to make sure that the base business was humming. That the organization was executing just like Ivan spoke to, we have. Our confidence level is very high. So not only do we have the balance sheet to move into that Phase 3 transformation. We now are ready to do it. We have the capability. We have the right team in place and we have the execution of the base business. So we're excited about Phase 3.\nRobbie Marcus : Thanks for the question.\nKeri Mattox : Yeah. Operator, can we get the next question in the queue.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O'Brien : Thanks for taking the question. Brian and Ivan, you talked a lot about new product introductions. And I think you said 40 through the next three years. How does that compare to the number of products you've introduced over the past three years? And then I know you've got your competitors listening probably don't want to give us too much. But just can you give us a general sense of where those are going to go? Are they going to go into set specifically? And are you going to start touching maybe some areas kind of outside your traditional power alleys, I guess, with those new product introductions.\nIvan Tornos : Yeah, thanks for your question, Matthew. So first things first, it's not just the quantity, it's also the quality. Not every new product is created equal. But I think we referenced in the past, we launched around 50 new products from 18 through 22. And the commitment is to do at least 40 new product launches over the next 36 months. And again, what excites me about this launch is, Matthew, is the type of products that they are. They're differentiated. In many instances, they are first to market. And most of them are in growth areas that are going to drive WinGuard accretion for that, so 4% or above. In terms of where they're going, it will take me about an hour to go through everything in the pipeline. I'll keep it to maybe three minutes or less, but I'll tell you excited about where we are in is with a full portfolio, things that are already -- we already spoke about cementless or Persona OsseoTi new to market as of two-three months ago is getting up on traction. Our cementless penetration is at 15%, 1-5. We deserve to be in the 50% range, and that is definitely the goal. Excited about ROSA partial or robotic parcel system that is next generation is getting relaunched summer of 2023.Persona IQ, I think, we spoke plenty about that. As you look at the next 12 to 14 months, we will have Oxford Partial cementless here in the U.S. That is a legacy product that has gained a ton of markets in Europe. Persona Revision I didn't comment on that one, Robbie asked about performance. In Q1 Persona Revision saw tremendous growth again. That is a product that is only available in the U.S. I can hardly wait for 2024 when it gets into all U.S. markets. Shifting to hips, we launched ROSA Hip on the direct interior category, posterior to come at some point. In the market, we are the only mixed reality company with hip insights. That is something that is gaining tremendous traction. You can see the hologram of a patient anatomy. It drives efficiency and accuracy in a case with a lower instrumentation. Bryan, in the opening remarks spoke about HAMR or surgical impact. That is also a device that is driving efficiency in an operating room, frankly, taking an existing product. Product that is in market and making it better. It drives variable energy control. It's got better accuracy. It has the ability of actual implanting the cap. Again, I can spend an hour in that regard. On [Indiscernible], we got a sizeable of products inset through acquisitions and organic. We recently announced that we closed the Embody deal. That is giving us a competitive advantage in soft tissue repair, whether it's tendon injury or whether it's rotator cap that is performing very well. We got everything that we need in Sports medtech. We have a new product introduction in Shoulder. Again, I think three minutes are almost done, but I will tell you, there is a lot that is happening and it's happening both from an implant standpoint happening from a technology data solutions standpoint. So we look forward to updating you at an upcoming product fair, but I will tell you, innovation is truly now a competitive advance seat at Zimmer Biomet.\nMatthew O'Brien : Thank you can hear the enthusiasm there. I appreciate it. A question for Suke. On the pricing side, I think you said down 140 bps in Q1. You had a competitor report last night, and they said more like neutral this year, they're more diversified. I know it's a little different. But are you guys a little bit more on the stream side as far as pricing concessions at this point in the marketplace? Is that part of the strategy? And can pricing actually be a little less of a headwind for you guys over the next maybe year or two versus what you've seen historically? Thanks.\nSuketu Upadhyay : Yeah. Hey, Matt, so I definitely think that pricing will be less of a headwind than we've seen historically. I do think that pricing pressure in the overall market will remain it could potentially intensify over time. But I will tell you, our performance, so idiosyncratic to Zimmer Biomet is that we're putting things in place to ensure that we don't have pricing erosion at the same level that we've had historically. Even if the market worsens. So we think that we can continue to travel less than 200 basis points here in 2023 and at least for the near term beyond that.\nKeri Mattox : Thanks, Matt. Can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch : Good morning. And very nice quarter. Just summing back just a little bit. I don't think anyone expects these kind of growth rates to go on forever that it's a new normal. But it does give you what I would call, breathability to make some strategic decisions as you get these really strong quarters on a cash flow basis and on a revenue basis. What changes and maybe the way you approach your strategy given it?\nBryan Hanson : Yeah. Probably no major change, to be honest. To your point, it will create some headroom and it gives us that optionality as referenced before to let it flow through, which, as you can tell by our guide, we're going to let some of this flow through, but also to invest, and we are highly focused on driving revenue growth. We've done a lot of research in the med tech space. And it's very clear that those companies that are consistently top quartile performers in TSR, grow faster than those companies that aren't. And the second leading thing behind that is EPS growth. So make no mistake, when we get this headroom, we're going to be focused, first and foremost, on investing in the business to continue to drive sustained revenue growth that ultimately as a result of that drives EPS growth as well. So it's going to be the balance that we've always had with maybe a little more optionality than we would have otherwise.\nJoanne Wuensch : And then as my follow-up. You did mention that there are some, we'll call it, niggling supply chain issues that are out there. Is there a way to put some color around that, what those issues may be? Are they easing? Or are they staying the same, intensifying -- and just sort of maybe give us a line of sight on what would make those go away.\nIvan Tornos : Absolutely. I wish I will tell you when they are going to go away. What I will say is that we're navigating those very effectively. There are three key areas that I would say, account for 90% of the problem: Material shortage, labor issues and sterilization issues. On the materials situation is better. We have validated second sources. We've come out with new materials. So I would say that it's probably better than it was, let's say, six to 12 months ago. On the labor here in Warsaw, we constantly continue to hire people. So again, I would say we're in a much better position than we were six-12 months ago. Sterilization is also getting better, but make no mistake, it is a bottleneck. We could definitely be in a much better position. It will have more capabilities. That said, as reflected in the quarter, supply has been what it needed to be. It's put us in a position that we can continue to manage the business and grow the business. In terms of when this goes away, I have no idea. But I do think that it's well managed as of today.\nBryan Hanson : Yeah. The other factor that's impacting it is you've got all these negative pressures that Ivan just referenced. And then, of course, our demand is going up pretty substantially. So the demand signal is coming in much higher than we expected in the face of that environment that's pretty challenging. And I just want to -- again, I know I said it in my prepared remarks, but I want to compliment the team. I've been with the commercial teams around the globe. And they're just doing an excellent job. These guys are really fighting 24 hours a day to make sure that we get product to the cases where they're needed. And trust me, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of effort. It's a lot of frustration I'm positive of that, but the team is doing a wonderful job indeed.\nJoanne Wuensch : Bryan, thanks for the question.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Lawrence Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLawrence Biegelsen : Good morning, guys. I'll echo my congratulations. A really nice quarter here. Just one for Ivan person, one big picture, one for Bryan. So Ivan, on Persona IQ, can you put the NTAP into context for us into context for us, what percent of knee patients are Medicare. What do you see happening with reimbursement for commercial payers? Do you expect them to follow? And have you guys filed for a pass-through payment in the outpatient setting? And I had one follow-up for Bryan.\nIvan Tornos : Thank you. I'll keep it short, so you can continue with Bryan. But first things first, NTAP. New technology add-on payment enables an additional payment of around $850 per additional knee, so up to $1,700 for both knees. The decision kicks in, in October or actually the indication. The approval kicks in, in October '23 and the last for 30 years. So it's pretty material. In terms of -- and by the way, it's not done. So we're going to be requesting these additional payments for the base station and other components. So there may be some additional upside to these numbers that I just quoted. In terms of the percentage of patients, this is for Medicare inpatient. We estimate that to be between 15% to 20%. Relative to the second part of the question, do we think that commercial payers will follow. I think that comes down to the data to the clinical data. As we expand the number of patients that benefit from this technology, we're able to validate the clinical claims that we think that we're going to able to validate, of course, this will become a new standard of care, and this will impact not just Medicare patients, but also commercial patients. So I think you had a follow-up question for Bryan.\nLawrence Biegelsen : And just Ivan, on the outpatient setting, did you file for pass-through payment?\nIvan Tornos : We're in the process of evaluating that, but we have not done that as of right now, no, we don't have any.\nLawrence Biegelsen : Okay. And Bryan, people have asked this question. I'm going to ask a similar question in a different way. So the recon market is clearly running hot now, 13% by our math in Q1. Pre-COVID, the recon market grew 2% to 3%. So a, do you expect the recon market to eventually return to its historical growth rate at some point in the future? I'm not asking you for a date. And b, does that create more urgency for you to do some M&A to increase your [Indiscernible] and diversify while things are good. Thanks for taking the question.\nBryan Hanson : Yeah. I think it's important to go back to the first quarter and just say, hey, that's not indicative of recon market. That is an easy comp for everybody, not just us, but across the board. So you have to look at that outsized performance and kind of haircut it by the comp. But even without that, it's a very hot market, to your point right now. And there are certain things about that, that you might think would be for just a period of time. Backlog recovery should be here for a while. But that will eventually go away. But there are some things associated with Recon that we think are sustainable. And we've talked about these in the past. I don't know that everybody connects with what we're saying. But here's what I see. If I think about market in total, there's a pretty significant technology shift that's occurring in Orthopedics at a very rapid pace. And by the way, we're just really getting started with that technology shift. That has a mixed benefit associated with it. So you don't need one new patient. You just need that technology to come in and that lifts the overall market growth and creates because of the innovation, better pricing stability. So the combination of those two things, in my view, is durable and sustainable to elevate the overall recon market growth, and we're certainly going to take advantage of that. The other benefit that we have in this area for us specifically is that we're investing very disciplined in areas in recon that are faster growth. So our weighted average market growth will be better than the overall market growth in Recon. That creates more sustainability for fast growth and above-market growth for the company. And then outside of that and specific to us, as Suky said, we're doing a much better job on pricing. And that's a big benefit. So if we can stay below our historical average in pricing that does also elevate our Recon business. And then finally, if I think about our innovation, we do believe it's differentiated. So we have an opportunity to also take market share through that innovation. So we really do believe Recon is attractive and sustainable. It's not going to be first quarter type of growth. That's abnormal because of the comp. But we do believe it could be elevated. We're also looking into some patient behavior potential changes that we're seeing through COVID. This is early days. We're kind of analyzing it right now, but the feedback is that there's really three things that may be changing the perspective of a patient on whether they do or don't get a procedure. Which would be positive for us because we think that we're going to make the decision to get the procedure. The first one is the technology advancements are giving people confidence that the outcome of the procedure is going to be good. A lot of people don't get the procedure because they're afraid the procedure is not going to do what they wanted to do. If that fear goes away, you may see more people enter the funnel. The second is that you're getting out of the hospital or the ASC faster. So that turnaround for the procedures 24 hours a lot of times used to be dates. So that also then is less inconvenient for the patient. And then the ASC setting by itself is attractive. I mean we don't want to go to a hospital to get a knee procedure where a bunch of sick people are. The ASC setting is less overwhelming, feel safer. And I think people are more attracted to it. And the final thing is you've got flexwork right now. That's pretty rampant out there. And so people feel more comfortable, more confident rehabbing and also staying in work. So we think those three things really have the opportunity to continue to elevate the recon market. And we're going to continue to look at it and take advantage of it.\nLawrence Biegelsen : Thank you.\nKeri Mattox : Thanks, Larry. I think we have time for one more question in the queue.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed : Hi, thanks for taking questions. I guess I hear you on all the strong momentum to carry through post Q1 and improvement throughout the year. And so maybe given the funky comps on Q1. Maybe think about Q2 in dollars, like hips and knees before the pandemic were typically flat to slightly down. And so I don't know if you think on a dollar basis, Q2 hips and needs would still be flat or if it can actually go up sequentially. Just kind of thinking about the momentum you have going through the year?\nSuketu Upadhyay : Yeah. I think on an absolute dollar standpoint, you should expect to see a step down in Q2. That's typical seasonality. So growth rates yet are going to be wonky sequentially or year-over-year between 1Q and 2Q, but you should expect to see the traditional sort of historic step down in absolute dollars for Q2.\nTravis Steed : Okay. Appreciate that clarity. And then I did want some clarification. I think I heard you say gross margin for the full year would still be flat year-over-year. I wanted to make sure I understood why it was still flat every year given the momentum on Q1. And then it looks like you bought back $268 million of stock in the quarter. I don't know if there was any color on that, if that's kind of a new use of capital for you. Thank you.\nSuketu Upadhyay : Yeah, thank you. Thanks for the question on gross margin, Travis, because actually, I intended to say that gross margin would be higher this year versus 2022, primarily driven by that mix component and FX hedge gains. But if you thought about neutralizing those because they may not continue beyond 2023 at the same level, the underlying gross margin will be equivalent to 22%. But in absolute terms, it will be higher this year versus last year on gross margin. I just want to make sure that's clear. Very perceptive on the share buyback. We did buy back, I think, about $250 million of shares this year, $150 million in Q4 of last year. That gets split between the Embody transaction, where we structured that with some equity to be advantageous from a deal structuring standpoint. So we bought those shares back, so to avoid any dilution on that deal from shares. And then the second is our more normal cadence going forward will be to buy back equity dilution from annual brands.\nTravis Steed : Perfect, thanks so much.\nKeri Mattox: Thanks so much for the question. Yeah. And I think that wraps us up through the queue, and we're at 9:30. So thanks, everyone, for your comments and your questions. The IR team is obviously available today, and we'll continue the conversations as we go through the day. Please feel free to reach out with any others.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating on in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Suketu Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning everyone. As Bryan mentioned, we had an excellent quarter with better than expected results. As a result of continued market normalization and the strength of our performance, we are increasing and narrowing our full year financial outlook. With that, let's turn to our results in updated full year guidance. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the first quarter and how it compares to the same period in 2022. And my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.831 billion, an increase of 10.1% on a reported basis and an increase of 13.2%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. As we noted on our last call, we had a selling day tailwind of about 100 basis points this quarter. Overall, the business back from faster than expected recovery of elective procedures driven by the easing of staffing related headwinds, normalization of cancellation rates, and some backlog recapture. Also, we've benefited from lighter comps, strong commercial and supply chain execution and new product uptake. While we continue to face macro supply headwinds, our teams have been doing a great job mitigating these challenges. U.S. growth of 12.7% was well ahead of our expectations with elective procedure volumes recovering and procedure cancellation rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. International sales grew 14%, EMEA growing ahead of expectations, driven by faster recovery and strength across both developed and emerging markets. And in APAC, we saw some pressure in China as anticipated, but results were generally in line with our expectations. Turning the business category performance, global knees grew 18.2% with us growing 18.1% and international growth at 18.2. Specifically, we saw strong uptake across the full Persona product portfolio and traction in all regions. We now have the Persona, Primary, Partial, Revision and OsseoTi cementless options rounding out our full product line. And we are seeing very encouraging results across that new cementless form factor. This full Persona product line not only improves and enhances our product mix benefit, but also supports the continued utilization of Rosa and associated pool through. Global hips grew 12.9% with U.S. hips up 12.3% and international up 13.5%, driven by continued traction across the Avenir and G7 product lines, along with ongoing uptake of Rosa hip. And we are encouraged by the early impact of the Hip Insight launch. The S.E.T. category grew 6.4% driven by continued strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine and upper extremities, all of which grew in the teens. This was partially offset by lower growth in other parts of S.E.T., which includes the reimbursement changes in restore therapies that will anniversary mid this year. Finally, our other category grew 11.1% partially driven by some larger orders and surgical products which may not repeat over time. Moving to the P&L. For the quarter, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share at $1.11, compared towards GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 in the prior year. While investments in R&D and commercial infrastructure increased, net earnings were higher this quarter driven by revenues improve gross margins and losses in the prior year related to ZimVie. On an adjusted basis diluted earnings per share was $1.89 represents a 17% increase from $1.61, in the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted gross margin was 72.8%, up 220 basis points from the prior year. These results were positively impacted by favorable mix related to large joints performance and foreign currency hedged gains. Excluding these items, underlying gross margin was broadly in line with our expectations related to inflation. We're seeing some incremental pressure from spot buying and contract manufacturing pricing, but overall inflationary pressure has largely stabilized. Our adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 28.4%, up 200 basis points primarily driven by revenue better gross margin and continued discipline around our investment profile. Interest in non-operating expenses of $46 million and our adjusted tax rate of 16.3% were broadly in line with our expectations. Turning to cash and liquidity. Operating cash flows were $308 million and free cash flow totaled $178 million. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $330 million. And moving to our updated financial outlook for 2023. Based on strong Q1 results and our ongoing strong execution, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 outlook. Constant currency revenue growth is now expected to be 6% to 7% versus 2022, with an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of 100 basis points. We're also updating our adjusted EPS guidance range now expecting $7.40 to $7.50. While we initially gave color that adjusted operating margin would be flat to slightly better in 2023, or Q1 results in tandem with an improved rest of your outlook gives us the confidence that we will expand operating margins this year. We continue to expect interest and other non-operating expenses, along with our tax rate to be in line with our previous commentary. Finally, we now expect free cash flow for the year to increase to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. In terms of quarterly cadence throughout the year, our expectations remain unchanged. Q1 will be the highest revenue growth quarter followed by Q4, which should benefit from improving supply and contribution from new and innovative products, as well as a selling day tailwind of about 100 basis points. Q2 and Q3 are expected to be lighter growth quarters given tougher comps and a net selling day headwind of about 100 basis points. Again, selling days will have a net neutral impact for the full year. We expect adjusted operating margin to largely follow revenue with second half operating margins being slightly better than the first half. In summary, we delivered excellent top-line results, beating internal expectations in nearly every category while posting very strong adjusted earnings performance. Our business is executing well our pipeline is delivering and our momentum is real. We feel very confident as we move forward. With that I'll turn the call back over to Keri to start the Q&A. Sure, Steve. Thanks for the question. This is Suey and hello to everyone on the call. The first thing I'd just step back, overall, we had a very good first quarter, as you can see from the results. And it was really across all of our business segments, including all of our regions, and that flowed through all the way through the P&L. So really happy about the quality and the execution of the entire team. We did always think that Q1 would be our strongest growth quarter. We talked about that when we gave our initial guidance for the year. That was really two key drivers. One is you had a strong comp benefit versus the first quarter of 2022. Clearly, we were still dealing with Omicron back in 2022. Secondly, we talked about a day rate tailwind of 100 basis points. So we knew year-over-year that we would see strong growth. But we achieved better than that and really across every one of our business segments, as I pointed out earlier. But recall where our expectations were before. We thought we would continue to see some procedural volume challenges and staffing challenges and also supply chain headwinds. So that underpinned our previous guide. But we actually overachieved relative to those macro factors. Where we just didn't see as much staffing or COVID pressure. We also saw some backlog come into the marketplace. And so from a macro standpoint, it was better than we expected. And then also our execution was incredibly strong. Our innovation was very strong across commercial but also supply chain. So really happy with where everybody sort of executed for the quarter. And we think that, that store will going forward. Relative to your specific question on the overall market growth rates. I would just say, look, we're not yet in normal market growth. You clearly continue to have some choppy comp comparisons versus the prior year. We do still think we're going to continue to face some headwinds relative to staffing and of course, supply chain continues to be a very real challenge out there, partially offset by some backlog tailwinds. So again the markets, I think, are anything but normal yet. But I would say they're very strong, they're improving and normalizing, and we're very encouraged about where they're going. Pricing in the quarter was a little bit, I would say, kind of in line with where we expected it to be. We always talked about this year being a bit better than the traditional 200 to 300 basis points that we've seen historically. And at 140 basis points of erosion that was right in line with where we expected to be. Yea. Shagun, it's Suke. Thank you for the question. We definitely saw a very good quarter in the year in the first quarter, and we're expecting that momentum to carry through. And I think you would see that in our rest of year guide coming up to 6% to 7% ex FX. From a quarterly cadence standpoint, I would expect the overall growth rates in each quarter from here to step down from the first quarter. And it really goes back to that one that comp benefit I talked about in the first quarter on Steve's question, but also we have that day rate tailwind of about 100 basis points in the first quarter. So that you should think about, again, the first quarter being the highest fourth quarter being the second highest from a growth perspective and the second and third being a little bit lighter just based on tougher comps and a net day rate headwind. And so that's how you should think about cadence. But definitely, we're lifting our guidance by more than just the first quarter outperformance. We're actually pulling that momentum through the rest of the year as part of that raise. Maybe Bryan, do you want to talk about the underlying growth as we move forward. I would say, continue to support our increase in guidance. So things continue to -- our guidance initially showed or had an assumption of improvement throughout the year. Our current increase in guide assumes that as well in the early days in April continuing to prove that out. Yeah. I'd say the first thing is that it feels good to be in a position where you have the optionality, right, of deciding where you're going to put that additional growth in the margin or the profitability upside that comes from that. We continue to have a very strong, robust and innovative pipeline. We're going to continue to invest against the business in the right way, in a disciplined way. We're going to continue to be focused and make choices about, continue to expand in faster-growth submarkets that have good profitability profiles. We believe we can do that while still expanding margins over time. And that really comes from the strength and the discipline of the overall team in driving efficiency and mix shift in that investment profile to make sure that we're growing the top line while still growing the bottom line. So we think we can do both over time. Yeah. Just going back to your point there, remember the comp benefit in Q1 was a key driver beyond underpinning that large overperformance relative to sort of that 4% to 5% we've been talking about. So just want to make sure that we've got good clarity around that. Having said that, as Bryan talked about, we do think and have even more confidence now based on our execution, based on the normalization of markets based on our pipeline, that 4 to 5 is a durable number, and we'd be disappointed again if we weren't able to achieve that in normalized markets. So we think that, that's sustainable over time. And then as we talked about, if that provides profitability upside that can be reinvested back into the business while still driving margin expansion. I mean that's where we want to be, right? That was the story underpinning our margin expansion all the way back to the beginning a few years ago, which is to be able to do this through revenue leverage, and do it in a high-quality way while investing back to the business. Yeah. So there are a lot of factors inside the quarter that drove the outsized performance. I talked about year-over-year our original expectations, but we were above that, again, for a number of variables, including less pressure than we expected. We saw some backlog. I talked about, and we were able to navigate supply chain and good commercial execution. I would say backlog was probably the smaller component of the overall change our performance relative to expectations in Q1. We do expect that to continue for the rest of the year. That's built into our guidance as we move forward. And so yeah, it's good to have that a bit of an offset or tailwind relative to some of the other challenges we're seeing in the marketplace. Yeah. So thanks for the question -- second question here, Vijay. The first thing is I'm just going to step back a little bit. As part of the overall margin expansion story, the Zimmer Biomet, we talked about ability to stabilize gross margins from '22 out for the next few years. Side of that on better revenue growth, we would leverage SG&A, which would give us the platform to then expand margins increase our earnings balance as a company. So that continues to be the strategy and story, and I think you're just seeing that play out here to 2023. Remember, as we came into '23, we talked about 100 basis points roughly of inflationary pressure in '22. That was going to capitalize in our P&L this year. That still remains true. In fact, probably seeing a little bit of additional incremental pressure on some areas of supply chain and inflation. I talked about contract manufacturing supply prices. We're still doing some spot buys for certain raw materials. It's putting a modest amount of incremental pressure. Nothing significant, but something we just want to keep our eyes on for the rest of this year and into 2024. But again, inflation has largely stabilized. So that 100 basis points is definitely coming in year-over-year. But despite that, we said that 22% on gross margins would be relatively in line, excuse me, '23 versus 2022, right? So the teams are going to be able to find a way to offset that incremental headwind and we've largely done that. Now in the first quarter, we did see exceptional growth sequentially, but also year-over-year. There are a number of variables that drive that. But I'd say the three biggest are around volume gains, right, that led us year-over-year but also versus expectation. Saw some FX hedge gains in the quarter and also a pretty pronounced mix benefit, especially given the outsized performance of our large joints versus our S.E.T. and other category and also U.S. versus the rest of the world. So those are kind of the three dynamics that are going on. In the first quarter, we -- as we go through the rest of the year, we still expect those three variables to play a positive impact, but not at the same level, okay? So the way to think about this is gross margin for the rest of the year will step down versus Q1, but still for the overall year will be higher than it was in 2022. So you should think about it on an underlying basis, '23 being still in line with 2022, okay? So gross margin is definitely a tailwind, underlying still consistent with prior year. The operating margin that you're implying off of our EPS guide is I think the directionally right way to think about that, and that upside is coming primarily from gross margin. So those are some of the building blocks that underpin our EPS raise for the year. I would just say all the hard work that the team has done in improving financial performance, paying down debt over the last few years, even through a challenging period to COVID. We've really strengthened the balance sheet. And so the great thing is our capital structure can support everything that Bryan spoke about. Right now, we're traveling somewhere around the mid- to high-2s from a net debt to leverage ratio perspective. So if you took turn, turn and half on that relative to $2 billion to $2.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA, you would see that there's a substantial amount of M&A firepower available to us. And those numbers would only be augmented by the EBITDA from a target. So a long way of saying that we've got the capital structure, we've got the balance sheet to support what Bryan talked about. Yeah. Hey, Matt, so I definitely think that pricing will be less of a headwind than we've seen historically. I do think that pricing pressure in the overall market will remain it could potentially intensify over time. But I will tell you, our performance, so idiosyncratic to Zimmer Biomet is that we're putting things in place to ensure that we don't have pricing erosion at the same level that we've had historically. Even if the market worsens. So we think that we can continue to travel less than 200 basis points here in 2023 and at least for the near term beyond that. Yeah. I think on an absolute dollar standpoint, you should expect to see a step down in Q2. That's typical seasonality. So growth rates yet are going to be wonky sequentially or year-over-year between 1Q and 2Q, but you should expect to see the traditional sort of historic step down in absolute dollars for Q2. Yeah, thank you. Thanks for the question on gross margin, Travis, because actually, I intended to say that gross margin would be higher this year versus 2022, primarily driven by that mix component and FX hedge gains. But if you thought about neutralizing those because they may not continue beyond 2023 at the same level, the underlying gross margin will be equivalent to 22%. But in absolute terms, it will be higher this year versus last year on gross margin. I just want to make sure that's clear. Very perceptive on the share buyback. We did buy back, I think, about $250 million of shares this year, $150 million in Q4 of last year. That gets split between the Embody transaction, where we structured that with some equity to be advantageous from a deal structuring standpoint. So we bought those shares back, so to avoid any dilution on that deal from shares. And then the second is our more normal cadence going forward will be to buy back equity dilution from annual brands."

            "name": "Ivan Tornos",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, Ivan here. So lots of excitement as of late on Persona IQ. As of late, obviously, we got the NTAP indication that we're kicking October of 2023, were featured in the Wall Street Journal that got a lot of attention. We've signed additional contracts all over the U.S. with advancing rapidly in our limited market release, which as we said in the past, is more clinical in nature than commercial. We got now north of 500 million data points. And again, that's gained a lot of excitement. In terms of where we are, I'll tell you nothing has changed. We believe we'll be in a position to launch speed product by the end of 2023. We're working on four key things when it comes to this limited market release. Number two is understanding the clinical value proposition as well as the commercial value proposition. What do we do with all this data? What is the best way to position this product in the marketplace? Number two, as you can imagine, with the data component, there is a bit of a back and forth ownership, how do we utilize it, how do we make the best out of all this data. So we can act on it. And I would say with that tends a lot in this regard. Number three, is making sure that, overall, the customer experience is seamless. This involves patient education, this involves caregiver education. We're going to make sure that this is a best-in-class experience. And then number four, is how do we monetize the device. So in those four key areas, we've made tremendous advancements. And I do believe we're going to be in a position to launch at the end of the year. The NTAP is not going to impact every single patient, but it's a sizable amount of patients that are going to benefit from the additional reimbursement. And again, it's just another reminder that this is breakthrough technology, first to market, new to market that will make a difference. So the exigent is high, and we look forward to updating you guys down the road. Hey. Thank you, Robbie. Good talking to you this morning. I will probably bucket the performance in two key areas: commercial execution and innovation. And maybe I'll start with Slide number two, and I won't break down all the details on what's driving what. But clearly, new product introductions had to do a lot with the performance. As you know, during Las Vegas, we launched Persona OsseoTi, that is our cementless new form factor platform, and that is gaining traction. I'll tell you, roughly one third of all customers for Persona OsseoTi are competitive accounts. We've seen that with Persona OsseoTi with increasing also the penetration robotics. And again, I won't break down the size of that increase. But we've seen an increase in robotic cases done in combination, personas and ROSA. So definitely a driver there. Persona iQ, obviously, too early but ROSA overall, with Persona primary is gaining traction across the globe. The ecosystem, the interconnectivity of implants and CV is gaining momentum. And that's the momentum whether you hit in the U.S. or you're in Europe or Asia Pacific. So again, a lot to unpack when it comes to innovation. On commercial execution, we navigated supply challenges, I think, very effectively, very proud of what the team has done in that regard. And we're executing flawlessly. We got new incentive plans in place in '23 that were not around in 2022. Around making sure that people are growing in knees and hips, while pulling asset. We have new incentives in other geographies around EMEA and APAC. And I would say, again, the commercial execution is going very well. The last thing I'll talk about is the ASC. This is one area where in the past, we're not doing other grade. We have three major gaps, people, contracts and portfolio. The portfolio is definitely there. We added a lot of people in our contracting group and the number of people they're thinking about ASCs in the hundreds. So today, around 10% to 15% of our sales come from the ASC and that's growing very nicely. So again, commercial execution and innovation are the two key buckets when it comes to this level of performance. Yeah, thanks for your question, Matthew. So first things first, it's not just the quantity, it's also the quality. Not every new product is created equal. But I think we referenced in the past, we launched around 50 new products from 18 through 22. And the commitment is to do at least 40 new product launches over the next 36 months. And again, what excites me about this launch is, Matthew, is the type of products that they are. They're differentiated. In many instances, they are first to market. And most of them are in growth areas that are going to drive WinGuard accretion for that, so 4% or above. In terms of where they're going, it will take me about an hour to go through everything in the pipeline. I'll keep it to maybe three minutes or less, but I'll tell you excited about where we are in is with a full portfolio, things that are already -- we already spoke about cementless or Persona OsseoTi new to market as of two-three months ago is getting up on traction. Our cementless penetration is at 15%, 1-5. We deserve to be in the 50% range, and that is definitely the goal. Excited about ROSA partial or robotic parcel system that is next generation is getting relaunched summer of 2023.Persona IQ, I think, we spoke plenty about that. As you look at the next 12 to 14 months, we will have Oxford Partial cementless here in the U.S. That is a legacy product that has gained a ton of markets in Europe. Persona Revision I didn't comment on that one, Robbie asked about performance. In Q1 Persona Revision saw tremendous growth again. That is a product that is only available in the U.S. I can hardly wait for 2024 when it gets into all U.S. markets. Shifting to hips, we launched ROSA Hip on the direct interior category, posterior to come at some point. In the market, we are the only mixed reality company with hip insights. That is something that is gaining tremendous traction. You can see the hologram of a patient anatomy. It drives efficiency and accuracy in a case with a lower instrumentation. Bryan, in the opening remarks spoke about HAMR or surgical impact. That is also a device that is driving efficiency in an operating room, frankly, taking an existing product. Product that is in market and making it better. It drives variable energy control. It's got better accuracy. It has the ability of actual implanting the cap. Again, I can spend an hour in that regard. On [Indiscernible], we got a sizeable of products inset through acquisitions and organic. We recently announced that we closed the Embody deal. That is giving us a competitive advantage in soft tissue repair, whether it's tendon injury or whether it's rotator cap that is performing very well. We got everything that we need in Sports medtech. We have a new product introduction in Shoulder. Again, I think three minutes are almost done, but I will tell you, there is a lot that is happening and it's happening both from an implant standpoint happening from a technology data solutions standpoint. So we look forward to updating you at an upcoming product fair, but I will tell you, innovation is truly now a competitive advance seat at Zimmer Biomet. Absolutely. I wish I will tell you when they are going to go away. What I will say is that we're navigating those very effectively. There are three key areas that I would say, account for 90% of the problem: Material shortage, labor issues and sterilization issues. On the materials situation is better. We have validated second sources. We've come out with new materials. So I would say that it's probably better than it was, let's say, six to 12 months ago. On the labor here in Warsaw, we constantly continue to hire people. So again, I would say we're in a much better position than we were six-12 months ago. Sterilization is also getting better, but make no mistake, it is a bottleneck. We could definitely be in a much better position. It will have more capabilities. That said, as reflected in the quarter, supply has been what it needed to be. It's put us in a position that we can continue to manage the business and grow the business. In terms of when this goes away, I have no idea. But I do think that it's well managed as of today. Thank you. I'll keep it short, so you can continue with Bryan. But first things first, NTAP. New technology add-on payment enables an additional payment of around $850 per additional knee, so up to $1,700 for both knees. The decision kicks in, in October or actually the indication. The approval kicks in, in October '23 and the last for 30 years. So it's pretty material. In terms of -- and by the way, it's not done. So we're going to be requesting these additional payments for the base station and other components. So there may be some additional upside to these numbers that I just quoted. In terms of the percentage of patients, this is for Medicare inpatient. We estimate that to be between 15% to 20%. Relative to the second part of the question, do we think that commercial payers will follow. I think that comes down to the data to the clinical data. As we expand the number of patients that benefit from this technology, we're able to validate the clinical claims that we think that we're going to able to validate, of course, this will become a new standard of care, and this will impact not just Medicare patients, but also commercial patients. So I think you had a follow-up question for Bryan. We're in the process of evaluating that, but we have not done that as of right now, no, we don't have any."

            "name": "Bryan Hanson",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Keri. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. We don't get the opportunity to do this too often. So I'm going to take advantage of it. And I'm just going to start the call by simply saying this was a phenomenal quarter, where pretty much everything went better than expected. And importantly, as a result of that momentum, we are significantly raising our full year top and bottom line outlook, which Suke Upadhyay is going to talk about in just a minute. With that said, and maybe taking a step back, for today's call, I'll talk more about our Q1 performance and the drivers of that performance. And then Suke will get into more details for the quarter and importantly, also our financial guidance for the rest of the year. And then we'll make sure that we save plenty of time for your questions which we look forward to addressing. But before we do any of that, I just want to take a minute to speak directly and personally to the ZB team. And it really just say thank you, truly say thank you. For yet again, you have delivered beyond our expectations. And I'm very proud of what this team is doing to navigate an environment that while improving, there's no question it's improving, it is still fluid. And it presents us with challenges that quite frankly seem like daily challenges. And it is truly impressive how you're navigating that environment right now. And I'm very proud of the dedication, the resilience and the innovative thinking that you're bringing to your roles each and every day. It is truly making a difference. But I'm most proud of how together and I do mean together, we are living the ZB mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality-of-life for people around the world. And as we know, we do that every eight seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which is really what it's all about in the first place. So thank you. Thank you for what you do for ZB, thank you for what you do for our customers and most of all, and most importantly, what you do for our patients, the patients that we serve every day. Okay, so let's take a look now at the first quarter. And as some of you may recall coming into the year, our guidance assumed that Q1 would have the easiest comp of the year, but also experienced some headwinds from both staffing and COVID-related challenges that we felt would put pressure on elective procedures during the quarter. We also assumed that there would be a pretty high level of supply pressure in the first quarter. Our assumptions also believed that all three of these headwind variables would then improve throughout the year providing less impact to the business. But then outside of the easy comp, Q1 would be pretty bumpy. Okay, so what actually happened in the quarter? And why was it considerably stronger than we expected? Well, first and foremost, procedure recovery was much better than we anticipated, really having almost no material or meaningful impact from COVID or staffing challenges in the quarter. And second, we manage the supply constrained environment better than we originally anticipated. Make no mistake, supply is a real problem. And it's putting pressure on the business. But this team has done an excellent job managing that environment, probably leveraging some muscle memory from the past. And then third, and I think really importantly, our team's execution and traction with our new product innovation is even stronger than we anticipated. And that's important because it's going to continue to provide benefit to the rest of the year. And so because of this, we saw another quarter of very positive year-over-year momentum in large joints, with our global hip and knee businesses growing approximately 13% and 18% on an ex-FX basis. Our overall S.E.T. category grew more than 6%, driven by strong low-double-digit performance in our growth drivers in S.E.T. which we've talked about before being sports, CMFT and upper extremities. And then this was partially offset as expected, from headwinds from our restorative therapies business, where these headwinds will anniversary, and as you remember, these are reimbursement change headwinds that we have in that business, they should anniversary by the back half of this year. And then finally, our other category grew 11% in the quarter. So needless to say it was a pretty strong quarter. And the momentum is real in this business and our confidence is extremely high. And there's good reason for this competence. If we just think about this quarter alone, we officially launched our new cementless knee form factor Persona OsseoTi, and this is adding to the Persona family and really strategically rounding out that portfolio. And this new keel design tray is extremely versatile, it's anatomic because it is the Persona family and it's stable. And it's the only knee that you can do a cemented or cementless procedure with an inter operative decision possible for the surgeon. And that's a big deal. We believe that this will enhance the potential for cementless penetration, because surgeons can go into a questionable bone quality procedure with the intent to use cementless, but then they have the ability to pivot back to cement it as the bone quality isn't there. And for this reason, and a lot of other reasons, customer feedback so far has been extremely positive, as we've launched this product. And as you may know, our cementless penetration is already in the mid-teens. But we believe that this can get to 50% or higher penetration. And we're excited about that. And we truly do believe that this premium product can accelerate that growth for ZB and is already doing so. It's still early days. Our full launch is planned for the middle of this year as more sets become available. Make no mistake, this is a real driver for not just our knee franchise, but for the overall company. So we're very excited. As you remember, back in February, we also closed our acquisition of Embody, which is providing access to differentiated products and an innovative pipeline for our sports medicine business. And this investment helps expand ZB's presence in this very attractive high growth market, while also in that market, serving our customers and our patients better. And this combined with a very strong innovation pipeline that we have in sports, and this dedicated commercial channel that we put into place gives us continued confidence in our global sports franchise. And if you're at the AAOS meeting, you would have seen that we previewed our Hammer product, which is designed to ensure consistent and reproducible compaction for hip procedures, while allowing the surgeon to dial up or dial back the force of the strike, depending on the individual patient need. And this ability to be more personalized, actually differentiates Hammer versus other compaction devices on the market. So needless to say, we're excited about this differentiated product. We believe this could actually increase not only the consistency for surgeons, but also the procedure efficiency, which is really important right now. And our current expectation is to launch Hammer in the third quarter of this year. And if you just look at these combined products, this is actually building on other launches that we've talked about the Persona IQ, Hip Insights, the Identity Shoulder system, and in total, we've introduced more than 50 new products from 2018 through the end of 2022, with the majority of those products coming in markets growing 4% or faster. And we're geared to continue that momentum, doesn't stop here with another 40 planned product launches between this year and the end of 2025, again, with the majority of those products to be launched in 4%-plus growth markets. And this shift not only continues to transformation of our product portfolio, because the short term revenue growth, but it also improves our weighted average market growth. And ultimately, as a result of that gives us more confidence that our markets and our portfolio mix positions to company for sustainable mid-single-digit growth. And with this kind of traction around our product pipeline, increasing strength of our balance sheet, and our team members' ability to execute, ZB continues to be well positioned to deliver value today and in the future and achieve our mission as a company. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Suke to take a closer look at Q1 and our latest expectations for 2023. Okay, Suke. I mean, we've stated it before. And obviously, just based on our performance today, our confidence level is even higher. We do believe that we're 4%-plus grower in a normal market. It's not exactly normal right now, as Suky talked about before, but our confidence continues to grow that we're in the right markets. We continue to build scale in more attractive submarkets and our confidence design. Well, maybe I'll just quickly talk about what I see from a market standpoint, us versus market. And then maybe you could speak to, which I think when you say pull forward you talked about backlog consumption. So maybe you could talk about backlog. From us versus market perspective, it felt pretty good in the quarter. Obviously, we look at this on a year-over-year basis, a stack basis, a sequential basis versus our key competitors. But we try not to get overexuberant about any specific order or too depressed about any specific quarter. What we do look at, as I've always talked about, is an eight-quarter trend across those three vectors. If I go all the way back to Q2 of 2020, and I look at that consistent order trend, I feel very good about our position versus market. And I truly believe we're just getting started. So from us versus market perspective, I feel good, and I think it will only get better over time. If you think about the backlog, maybe you could speak to what we saw in the quarter. Yeah. So maybe just quickly before I get into our focus areas. I'd say in valuations, I still think -- see things as being pretty expensive. I look at assets that are out there today. We're not seeing as much downward pressure on valuations as we certainly were hoping for. Maybe a little better recently, but not as good as we would have expected. And then that, combined with the fact that capital is a little more expensive to come by is not necessarily a great combination. That said, we still think there's opportunities that we're going to try to pursue. We are absolutely in Phase 3 of the transformation. As we said many times, Phase 3 is focused on portfolio transformation using capital to be able to acquire technologies that are attractive to the organization. And we're very focused on this and extremely disciplined, number one, we're not going to look at a target if it's not mission centric. That's very important to the organization. We are a mission-driven organization, and that target needs to move our mission forward. We need to see a path to leadership at some point if we move into that space or we're already in that space. We need to see a WAM accretion, so increasing our weighted average market growth and as a result of that, our revenue growth and then ultimately helping us drive faster EPS growth. So those are the types of deals. And then inside of that, we're looking at enhancing our position through acquisitions in fast growth subcategories of recon, which may not seem super exciting, but the fact is there's some fast growth subcategories that we want to build scale in so that we can grow faster than the overall market in a consistent way. And then we're also going to look to diversify. So looking at acquisitions, which we've already shown in other parts of orthopedics that are faster growth, that's mainly in our set category for us. Eventually looking to diversify outside of orthopedics to diversify outside of electric procedures and give us other forms of opportunity to grow the business again outside of orthopedics. And we would say most likely in the near term, we would look at smaller to midsized deals, and we would kind of quantify that to say about $1 billion in revenue or less would put us in that category. And we would probably stay a little closer to the vest in Orthopedics in the near term. So that's the way we're thinking about it right now. Anything else you want to add to that? And what's key about that, we were very disciplined about this. It's who we put phases into the organization transformation. We wanted to make sure that the base business was humming. That the organization was executing just like Ivan spoke to, we have. Our confidence level is very high. So not only do we have the balance sheet to move into that Phase 3 transformation. We now are ready to do it. We have the capability. We have the right team in place and we have the execution of the base business. So we're excited about Phase 3. Yeah. Probably no major change, to be honest. To your point, it will create some headroom and it gives us that optionality as referenced before to let it flow through, which, as you can tell by our guide, we're going to let some of this flow through, but also to invest, and we are highly focused on driving revenue growth. We've done a lot of research in the med tech space. And it's very clear that those companies that are consistently top quartile performers in TSR, grow faster than those companies that aren't. And the second leading thing behind that is EPS growth. So make no mistake, when we get this headroom, we're going to be focused, first and foremost, on investing in the business to continue to drive sustained revenue growth that ultimately as a result of that drives EPS growth as well. So it's going to be the balance that we've always had with maybe a little more optionality than we would have otherwise. Yeah. The other factor that's impacting it is you've got all these negative pressures that Ivan just referenced. And then, of course, our demand is going up pretty substantially. So the demand signal is coming in much higher than we expected in the face of that environment that's pretty challenging. And I just want to -- again, I know I said it in my prepared remarks, but I want to compliment the team. I've been with the commercial teams around the globe. And they're just doing an excellent job. These guys are really fighting 24 hours a day to make sure that we get product to the cases where they're needed. And trust me, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of effort. It's a lot of frustration I'm positive of that, but the team is doing a wonderful job indeed. Yeah. I think it's important to go back to the first quarter and just say, hey, that's not indicative of recon market. That is an easy comp for everybody, not just us, but across the board. So you have to look at that outsized performance and kind of haircut it by the comp. But even without that, it's a very hot market, to your point right now. And there are certain things about that, that you might think would be for just a period of time. Backlog recovery should be here for a while. But that will eventually go away. But there are some things associated with Recon that we think are sustainable. And we've talked about these in the past. I don't know that everybody connects with what we're saying. But here's what I see. If I think about market in total, there's a pretty significant technology shift that's occurring in Orthopedics at a very rapid pace. And by the way, we're just really getting started with that technology shift. That has a mixed benefit associated with it. So you don't need one new patient. You just need that technology to come in and that lifts the overall market growth and creates because of the innovation, better pricing stability. So the combination of those two things, in my view, is durable and sustainable to elevate the overall recon market growth, and we're certainly going to take advantage of that. The other benefit that we have in this area for us specifically is that we're investing very disciplined in areas in recon that are faster growth. So our weighted average market growth will be better than the overall market growth in Recon. That creates more sustainability for fast growth and above-market growth for the company. And then outside of that and specific to us, as Suky said, we're doing a much better job on pricing. And that's a big benefit. So if we can stay below our historical average in pricing that does also elevate our Recon business. And then finally, if I think about our innovation, we do believe it's differentiated. So we have an opportunity to also take market share through that innovation. So we really do believe Recon is attractive and sustainable. It's not going to be first quarter type of growth. That's abnormal because of the comp. But we do believe it could be elevated. We're also looking into some patient behavior potential changes that we're seeing through COVID. This is early days. We're kind of analyzing it right now, but the feedback is that there's really three things that may be changing the perspective of a patient on whether they do or don't get a procedure. Which would be positive for us because we think that we're going to make the decision to get the procedure. The first one is the technology advancements are giving people confidence that the outcome of the procedure is going to be good. A lot of people don't get the procedure because they're afraid the procedure is not going to do what they wanted to do. If that fear goes away, you may see more people enter the funnel. The second is that you're getting out of the hospital or the ASC faster. So that turnaround for the procedures 24 hours a lot of times used to be dates. So that also then is less inconvenient for the patient. And then the ASC setting by itself is attractive. I mean we don't want to go to a hospital to get a knee procedure where a bunch of sick people are. The ASC setting is less overwhelming, feel safer. And I think people are more attracted to it. And the final thing is you've got flexwork right now. That's pretty rampant out there. And so people feel more comfortable, more confident rehabbing and also staying in work. So we think those three things really have the opportunity to continue to elevate the recon market. And we're going to continue to look at it and take advantage of it."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 30, 2024. Following today's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to David DeMartino, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid DeMartino: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me on today's call are Ivan Tornos, our President and CEO; and CFO and EVP, Finance, Operations and Supply Chain, Suketu Upadhyay. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Some of which are forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of our basis for calculating these measures is included within our second quarter earnings release, which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ivan. Ivan?\nIvan Tornos: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Welcome, David, to your very first Zimmer Biomet earnings call. It's truly lucky to have you. We love what you bring to the team already. I'd like to start today the way that I always do by taking a moment to recognize and to show my gratitude to the over 18,000 Zimmer Biomet team members who each and every day across the globe move for business and our mission forward. Thank you for your commitment to the organization. Thank you for your tireless work. Thank you for your very strong performance and most importantly thank you for what you do for our customers and patients every single day. As I said in the past, and as I will continue to say as long as I'm here, the Zimmer Biomet workforce and the culture that we have truly is one of our key competitive advantages. During the call today, I'm going to cover four things. First, I'll give an update on the recent ERP implementation and the challenges associated with it. Secondly, I'll cover some general comments on the quarter and the broader market dynamics. I move to them talk about a brief innovation overview. And then four and last, I'll close with a usual update on our three strategic priorities. After this, Suky is going to cover our financials in more detail. I will make sure to leave plenty of time for questions at the end of the prepared remarks. To begin, I'm very excited to report that we made greatest strides in managing the ERP implementation challenges outlined in early September. Through the dedicated work of the Zimmer Biomet team and our external partners, we now expect the impact of this challenge in the second half of 2024 being lower than the 100 basis points of annual sales that we initially communicated and we also fully expect to be back to normal shipping levels by the end of the year 2024. Turning to results. In Q3, we grew sales at mid-single-digit level, including strong results in knees, in hips and in head. This quarter, the third quarter now marks the 11th consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit or better constant currency revenue growth for Zimmer Biomet. In addition to the strong revenue performance, adjusted EPS once again grew faster than revenue. Our combined knee and hip businesses, what we call our reconstructed platform, grew in the mid-single-digit range globally while head delivered upper single-digit growth, aided by strong performance across our key growth drivers. Suku is going to cover this later, but I'm very proud of these results and specifically I love the consistency of growth in the key categories. Beyond commercial execution, our performance was fueled by mid-single-digit growth in our end markets, which we anticipate continuing based on all the analytics that we have at hand. And aging and increasing active population, combined with technological advancements, driving procedures to out-patient savings like the ASC in the U.S., accelerating recovery times and best-in-class outcomes should continue to provide tailwinds to market growth in the coming years. So again, we see a mean healthy, and we don\u2019t foresee these markets slowing down. From an innovation standpoint, Zimmer Biomet has the most robust product cycle in recent memory with over 50 meaningful plan product launches over a long-range plan horizon. I am particularly excited about the momentum we are generating in our Hips platform as evidenced by the improved results in this business and particularly in the U.S., where we delivered almost 5% growth in the third quarter. With Z1 our new triple-taper hip system, for interior heap implant procedures and with our surgical impact of HAMMR, as well as comprehensive navigation, robotics and platforms in navigation aorta grid, we are going to continue to be on the offense when it comes to gaining sharing hips. So great innovation, and we expect consistency in execution over the next several quarters. In keens, our cementless Persona OsseoTi continues to gain rapid traction, while the recently launched Persona IQ study, the shortest TEM for Persona IQ, is driving continued uptake of this differentiated technology. Early in the launch, the feedback has been super. Within Extremities, ROSA Solar has the potential to change the treatment paradigm in shoulder implants. It\u2019s a platform that allows for reproducible, anatomic and reverse procedures. Finally, Zimmer Biomet is the only orthopedic company offering both a CT scanless robotic system in ROSA. And through our recent partnership with THINK Surgical we also offered a smaller footprint, handheld CT scan-based system in Tamini. So, when it comes to navigation and robotics, we got the most comprehensive suite of solutions. Beyond all of this, we\u2019re expecting to launch a catering of new robotic applications in the short to midterm with and without CT scan capabilities as well as other differentiated features. In the ROSA franchise alone, we expect to launch three new indications in the next 18 to 36 months. While the underlying business performance remains strong, the team continues to execute on the same three strategic priorities that I have outlined in the past. Those being people and culture, which is foundational to our thing that we do; operational excellence; innovation and diversification. As I said at the beginning of the call, people and culture are key competitive advantages for Zimmer Biomet. Recently, we appointed new leadership in our hips, knees, set, in our ASC and in our digital technology and solutions businesses. I\u2019m excited about these leadership changes, and I am confident that the growth under the leadership of this new individuals is going to accelerate. In addition, we have upgraded talent in critical areas like IT, information technology and operations. On the second imperative, operational excellence, we are maintaining expectations for the long-term financial commitments that we outlined at our Investor Day earlier in the year. With the terrific progress we made towards the resolution or the ERP issues, we feel even more confident in delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share growth of at least 1.5 times revenue and free cash flow growing at least 100 basis points faster than earnings throughout 2027. So again, the same commitments towards revenue, EPS and free cash flow remain. Finally, we continue to make progress in diversifying our business to increase the company\u2019s growth and profitability profile. This includes a highly disciplined approach towards M&A as well as internal capital allocation dynamics. To that extent, the value of Zimmer Biomet\u2019s pipeline of new products expected to be launched over our long-range plan is more than twice the value that it was just a short five years ago. And 80% of these new product launches are accretive to the Zimmer Biomet Vanguard of 4%. In conclusion, we are very proud of the progress in organization, and we look forward to continuing to execute above and beyond expectations. I love the fact that we\u2019re impacting the lives of millions of people, and I\u2019m deeply inspired every day in knowing that my teammates and I are leaving the Zimmer Biomet mission of alleviating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Suke. Thank you very much.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, we closed another solid quarter, showcasing the resilience and winning attitude across our nearly 18,000 team members. Despite ERP-related headwinds, we grew sales over 4%, while maintaining steady operating margins, generating $1.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $310 million in free cash flow. Given the challenges we have outlined related to our ERP implementation, we are now updating our 2024 full year guidance, which I'll touch on later. I would like to start by discussing the ERP implementation. As Ivan reviewed, we cut over to a new system in the third quarter for North America distribution, which resulted in slower shipping levels of products to our customers. We disclosed this disruption in early September and initially noted that the ERP-related headwinds could impact up to 1% of annual sales in the second half of the year. Through the excellent work of our team members, we now believe the impact will be 60 to 80 basis points of annual sales, split about evenly between the third and fourth quarter. We continue to expect to be back to normalized service levels exiting 2024. Moving on to results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the third quarter of 2024 and how it compares to the same period in 2023, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.824 billion, an increase of 4% on a reported basis and 4.1% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Consolidated pricing was 70 basis points positive in the third quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of positive pricing. Our U.S. business grew 2% and international grew 7.1%. Growth in the U.S. was driven by strong performance from hip and S.E.T., partially offset by other, which saw the largest impact from the ERP headwinds. Our international business continues to perform well with strength across knee and S.E.T. Global Knees grew 5.5% in the quarter, with U.S. growing 2.9% and international 9.2%. Our international business continues to benefit from our Persona portfolio in our ROSA Robotics platform. Global Hips grew 3.7%, with the U.S. growing 4.9% and international 2.4%. As Ivan mentioned, with the launch of Z1, accelerating rollout of HAMMR and closing of the OrthoGrid acquisition, we now have a complete product portfolio in hips and are on the offensive. Next, our S.E.T. segment grew 7.3%, led by CMFT, sports and upper extremities, which all grew between mid-single digits and high teens. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of at least mid-single-digit growth in S.E.T. and a trend we expect to continue. Finally, our other category declined 9.5%. The decline was driven by a combination of difficult comps from the prior year as well as our surgical business being disproportionately impacted by ERP-related challenges. Turning to our P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.23 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77 in the prior year. The increase in GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue, combined with a lower tax rate and share count. On an adjusted basis, we delivered diluted earnings per share of $1.74 compared to $1.65 in the prior year with earnings growing faster than revenue. Adjusted gross margin was 71% and adjusted operating margin was 26.3%. Despite the ERP-related headwinds in the quarter, gross margin and operating margin were largely in line with the prior year. Net interest and other adjusted nonoperating expenses were $51 million in the quarter, up slightly on higher net debt and interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.7% higher than 2023 due to the implementation of Pillar 2 and fully diluted shares outstanding were $203 million, down year-over-year due to share buybacks. Turning to cash and liquidity. We generated robust operating cash flow of $396 million, free cash flow of $310 million, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to $652 million, ended the quarter with $569 million of cash and cash equivalents. Aligned with our capital allocation strategies to return at least 65% of free cash flow to shareholders over the LRP, we repurchased approximately $600 million in shares during the third quarter. Through the end of October, we have repurchased over $850 million in shares in the open market, and we maintain flexibility to continue our share repurchase program. Regarding our outlook for the rest of the year, given the ERP-related headwinds, we are updating our full year financial guidance. We now expect 2024 constant currency revenue growth of 4.25% to 4.75%. With recent exchange rate fluctuations, we now anticipate about a 75 basis point headwind from currency in 2024, resulting in reported revenue growth expectations of 3.5% and to 4%. Also, we now expect full year pricing to be flat to 50 basis points positive. For margins, we anticipate full year gross margin to be down slightly from 2023, while operating margin is still projected to be up year-over-year, marking the fourth consecutive year of operating margin expansion. We are reiterating our expectations for net interest and other non-operating expenses at about $205 million and an effective tax rate of 18%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year are expected to be about $204 million, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $7.95 to $8.05. And we expect full year free cash flow to be about $1 billion. In summary, despite the challenges, this was another solid quarter for Zimmer Biomet. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to David.\nDavid DeMartino: Thank you, Suketu. Operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Operator, please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Travis Steed with Bank of America.\nTravis Steed: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to understand first, why are you cutting the guide by more than the ERP issue on an organic basis for 2024? And how to think about 2025 and the ERP? Is there a catch-up there? Should we think about 2025 kind of the low end of your 4% to 6% LRP? Thanks a lot.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you, Travis, Ivan here. Good morning. So just on the first part of your question on the guidance for 2024, look, listen, we\u2019re going to be somewhat conservative when it comes to the year and allow us to be conservative given the PTSD, if you will, or the recent ERP channels. In Q4, all kinds of things happen. We want to see where we end up with pricing. Pricing has been positive for the entire year. Let\u2019s see where we end up in Q4 with all the puts and takes that, that happened around rebates, et cetera, et cetera. I want to make sure that we see the commercial execution that we need to see around new product introductions. We\u2019ve got three very meaningful new product introductions as we speak. We\u2019re late to get some of the sets out given the challenges with ERP. So again, I want to get at least a solid more on than I had before I get to positive on Q4. And then look, there are some macro factors early in the quarter. We saw some disruption with the hurricane and whatnot and the IV bags. We believe those are going to come in within the quarter. As a matter of fact, we are seeing those cases coming back already in the quarter. So allow us to be somewhat conservative, and we\u2019ll see what we end up in Q4. Relative to 2025, we\u2019re very positive. The ERP constraint or challenge is well contained within the year. We\u2019ll update you in early 2025 when it comes to what 2025 is going to look like. But I would say today, we\u2019re feeling very positive, given new product introductions, the resolution of the ERP, et cetera, et cetera. Thank you.\nTravis Steed: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll take follow-on question.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nVik Chopra: Hey, good morning. This is Vik Chopra in for Larry. Ivan, can you provide us with your updated thoughts on M&A and areas of interest? Why haven\u2019t we seen more deals from you given that valuations have come down? Thank you.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you for your question. While \u2013 let me start with the latter part. So why have you not seen more deals? We have said all along that we don\u2019t need to do deals to remain a mid-single-digit revenue grower over the life of the long range plan. 11 quarters now, we've been growing mid-single-digit revenue or above, delivering mostly the time EPS faster than revenue and generating meaningful cash flow. Obviously, we're excited about M&A and the potential to diversify even more beyond the 4% WAMGR. The deals need to make strategic sense and financial sense, valuation are down. Yes, they are. But I will tell you, as we go through the filters that is not a single deal that is jump on as saying, we have to reallocate capital and do this deal immediately. We continue to evaluate deals. Deals in higher growth segments within Recon, opportunities within our set business and things that are in the ASC space. We've done deal that are exciting. OrthoGrid is the fastest navigation company today in the U.S. We've done some tacky in scenariosoffset. And when the right deal comes our way, we will jump on it. Thank you for your question.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from David Roman with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Roman: Thank you and good morning, everybody. I was hoping you could dive a little bit deeper into the reconstructive businesses and maybe starting with Knees, where I know you had called out some supply chain dynamics last quarter that negatively impacted your U.S. business. That looks to have turned around here. Have you fully recovered from that? And maybe you could take us through a little bit more what's going on outside the U.S. because it also looked to be an area of strength this quarter? And how should we think about the geographic performance across Recon on a go-forward basis here?\nIvan Tornos: Yes. Thank you, David. So let's start with Knees overall. So international grew almost 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., we grew 3% constant currency that is \u2013 the challenges that we highlighted in the Q2 call, there were pre-ERP related. It was revision shortage that we had that's been resolved. So I will tell you, as we see here when I exit in the year, there are no supply constraints when it comes to our knee performance. The one thing that did slow down or knee growth in the quarter relative to the U.S. is the ERP challenges. While the impact of ERP was primarily in other, we could have had more Persona, OsseoTi sets going into the market. We could have done a better job in pulling through the multiple ROSAs installed in the U.S. So that has been the challenge. As we enter Q4, we're excited about where we are with Knees, and we really look forward to 2025.\nDavid Roman: Great. Thank you so much.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Matt Miksic with Barclays. Sir, your line is now open. Matt, we\u2019re unable to hear you, you may be muted.\nIvan Tornos: Operator, we can go to the next question.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nAllen Gong: This is Allen on for Robbie. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the guidance question that we kind of opened a Q&A session with. Just because you \u2013 despite the ERP challenges that you had in the quarter, you ended up beating your \u2013 what kind of where I think expectations were for constant currency and organic guidance for the quarter. So could you just help us a little bit more to kind of quantify some of the headwinds that you're not being a little conservative on, whether that\u2019s destruction from the hurricane or the IV bags because you\u2019re seeing those cases coming back through. Just help us kind of bridge the gap between the beat that you had in this quarter, the fact that ERP challenges are now coming in better than expected, and the 100 basis points lower guide. Thank you.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you, Alan. I\u2019m not sure that I can offer any more color than what I offer. There is a level of conservatism given the multiple variables. Again, we just reactivated shipping volumes. We got through the ERP. We want to make sure that we like what we see. And again, it\u2019s no more complex than that. Don\u2019t read too much into it. We got one month behind in the quarter. We like what we see. And again, let\u2019s see what happens in November and December. But nothing else to add on the guidance question.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move to our next question from Matthew O\u2019Brien with Piper Sandler.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. We\u2019d love to talk a little bit about the SET performance in the quarter because that was strong. It was a two-year stack acceleration. And as I think about that category, the growth that we\u2019re seeing overall across the category plus the margin profile, I\u2019m just curious what that can do for Zimmer Biomet, as we head into 2025, can it really help drive us to that mid-single digit upper \u2013 even upper end of the range at 6% and then what it might do for the profitability profile of the business as well. Thanks.\nIvan Tornos: Sure. I\u2019ll go over the first part and I\u2019ll let Suketu elaborate on the margin opportunity here with SET. So this is the fourth quarter in a row where we have grown SET at mid-single digit revenue or above. Actually this quarter is low upper single digit. We typically don\u2019t talk about the geographic split, U.S., OUS for SET, but I\u2019m pleased with the U.S. SET performance where we grew 5% in the quarter. Once again, virtually all of the six drivers within SET grew above our expectations. The three growth drivers of SET, sports medicine, shoulder and CMFT continue to perform very strongly. As we\u2019ve been saying for a while, here is where we have invested a lot of innovation over the last three years. And what you see now is the early results of all those launches. And yeah, we do believe that the growth is sustainable as we get into 2025 and 2026, as we highlighted in the Investor \u2013 at the Investor Day these are category that has to be growing at this pace, if not above. And there is plenty of new products to get there. Suketu, you want to comment on the margin piece?\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. So I won\u2019t give too much detail on 2025, but overall it\u2019s a very attractive segment as Ivan said, from a growth profile perspective, but also from a margin perspective. Margins in those key three businesses that Ivan talked about are above our overall company average. And so that\u2019s a good thing. They are slightly under our recon business. But again from an overall growth and EBITDA perspective, we\u2019re very excited about how that business is performing and where it\u2019s going.\nIvan Tornos: One last comment I\u2019ll throw in there related to the financial performance. Typically this business, these segments require less instruments on working capital. So again, it\u2019s another enabler of free cash flow growth over the life of the plan. Thanks for the question.\nMatthew O\u2019Brien: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move to our next question from Chris Pasquale with Nephron.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks. You announced that you\u2019re going to be rolling out Z1 in a couple of weeks. Our data suggests that triple-taper stems have become a big portion of the U.S. hip mix for your competitors. So it\u2019d be great to hear how you\u2019re thinking about that opportunity as you plug that hole in your portfolio. And could you also talk about what your supply situation is going to look like with Z1 initially? And at what point you could have broad availability of that product in the U.S.?\nIvan Tornos: Thank you, Chris. So first things first, we have launched already Z1. We're going to embark in the full launch of the product next week in Dallas at the Hip and Knee Society Meeting. We have trained the sales force. We're going to continue to train physicians. We believe this category, to your point, is going to become the standard of care. It\u2019s one category in what we didn't play, but it's more than Z1. It's the combination of Z1, the triple taper, along with surgical impact of HAMMR, which is now also fully launched. That's why we delivered 5% growth in the U.S. in Q3. And then navigation, which is robotics as well as surgical guidance by OrthoGrid. So I think the combination of those three products and more to come is what's going to get us to get back to gaining market share. It will be the standard of care. We're going to be on the supply side, we're going to be where we need to be as we enter the year 2025. So we don't expect to have a shortage of supply. As a matter of fact, we won't have a shortage of supply to make sure that it's a full launch all the way from January 1, 2025. Thanks for the question, Chris.\nChris Pasquale: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer.\nSteve Lichtman: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Ivan, you talked about 50 meaningful product launches planned over the long-term plan. Near term, you've highlighted Persona IQ, ROSA Shoulder, hit new [ph] products. Are there pipeline products you'd highlight in the medium term that could be meaningful? You mentioned ROSA indication expansion. Anything else you can talk about on pipeline drivers would be great. Thanks.\nIvan Tornos: Yes, absolutely. And I'll try to keep it short because it can be a 45-minute discussion right here on innovation. My most favorite topic, I'm certainly \u2013 something we didn't have three years ago. So you know the usual suspects in the short term. As you think about mid to long-term, Oxford Partial cementless, which is mid-2025 product is going to be the only PMA-approved Partial cementless knee in the U.S. This is a product, Steve, with 60% market share in the European market. It has the longest data on joint survivors according to the UK registry \u2013 so in a world of ASC expansion within this product to be extremely meaningful. ROSA Shoulder picks up in 2025. We do believe in late 2025 and 2026 is going to be one of the major growth drivers of the company. Like where we are with the smart implants, it took a while to get there. But with the recent launch of the short stem, what we call Persona IQ [indiscernible], unfortunate name, by the way, we're going to see meaningful adoption in 2025 and 2026. To your point, there are three ROSA indications coming up. They're going to hit mid-2025, 2026 that keep the acceleration going. In hips that will be knees, in hips out of the launch of Z1 HAMMR and Navigation like OrthoGrid and ROSA posterior in Europe, which is going to get launch soon, will be first to market with coated implants, which addresses a meaningful problem when it comes to infection in hip surgery. So we expect to be ready to launch coated hip devices late 2025, early 2026. And again, that just is a category that for the most part has not been touched. And then instead, there will be all kinds of things. But beyond ROSA Shoulder, which already \u2013 I mentioned is going to be a meaningful growth driver. You've got the stemless shoulders; you've got next-generation identity and all kinds of other products. So again, I could spend an hour, but the cycle of innovation is not a one and done 25 opportunity. There are 50 new products over the next three years and a lot of them are very meaningful. Thanks for the question.\nSteve Lichtman: Great. Thanks, Ivan.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nSophia Knopp: Hi. This is Sophia Knopp on for Vijay. I have one quick one on 2025. I was wondering if you guys could talk about the assumptions around gross margins and operating margins. You had previously called out some gross margin headwinds for next year. Do you have any updated thoughts on those headwinds and if we should expect to see operating margin expansion next year? Thanks.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. Thanks, Sophia. So first of all, yes, we continue to expect to see operating margin expansion into 2025. And really just going back to our LRP that we unveiled at our Investor Day back in May. We expect to generate at least 30 basis points of operating margin expansion per year, if not better than that. Inside of gross margin, I think our comments are still consistent with our thinking into 2025. There are some FX headwinds that occur that are going to peel off into 2025. So that will be a headwind. But operationally, we continue to make really good progress in containing our costs. We\u2019re also seeing a better pricing environment. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to be positive into next year, but overall, it\u2019s been much better than what we had anticipated coming into the year. So there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes on to the gross margin line. We still expect it to be relatively stable opposite [ph] 2024. But in the backdrop of all that, we are still committed to and have a very clear pathway to expanding operating margin next year and beyond.\nSophia Knopp: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Newitter with Truist Securities.\nRichard Newitter: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could comment on TMINI and how that collaboration is progressing for you, particularly in the ASC setting even if anecdotal feedback. I know it\u2019s early in that relationship. But would love to hear what kind of momentum that might be able to generate for you going forward? And what kind of impact it\u2019s had so far? Thanks.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you, Richard, for the question. It\u2019s another exciting partnership that we have going on that gives the company optionality. So there is a segment of customers that are seeing the footprint is important in robotics, primarily in ASC. So TMINI does give us that optionality. There is a segment of customers that prefer CT scanning capabilities when they do robotic cases and TMINI give us that opportunity. To your point, early in the launch, we have already seen some conversions of customers that have come to Zimmer Biomet to use that type of robotic application with the world\u2019s number one implant in knees. The partnership is giving us that optionality. The data so far suggests that this is a meaningful opportunity. We\u2019re going to be doing additional training next week in Dallas. And again, we like the fact that we have the portfolio that we have, that gives optionality across the board. So good data so far, and we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated on it.\nRichard Newitter: Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move to our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Maybe a two-parter here, if I could. Just one clarifying just on the selling days. Can you just remind us 3Q, 4Q and for 2025 versus 2024, what\u2019s selling days look like? But more importantly, Ivan, maybe I think at your Analyst Day, you had just performed or surgeons at Mayo just performed maybe the first couple of cases using ROSA Shoulder. Any more anecdotal updates from what you\u2019re seeing on ROSA Shoulder from some of your surgeons? How many cases have been performed and what kind of early learnings are? Thank you.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Hey Jeff. Good morning. It's Suky on selling days. In the quarter, it was about a day of a tailwind for the full year. It's not meaningful. And for 2025, we'll provide that update when we give guidance in the first quarter, but we don't see it as being material.\nIvan Tornos: And then Jeff, on ROSA Shoulder, we've done now hundreds of cases continue to validate the value proposition of this product. We said all along that it was going to be a limited market release. Beyond Mayo [ph], we are now in more institutions. And the feedback in terms of the opportunity continues to be strong. This is a product that we believe can change the standard of care in Shoulder Arthroplasty. The robot has offered the optionality of doing anatomic or reversed shoulder cases. It is extremely accurate. You can do surgeries impacting the glenoid, remind [ph] glenoid, you can get into a complex human resections. It is efficient. Some of the early feedback is that you can cut your operating time meaningfully. So one of the claims will be faster surgeries with more accuracy that also equals faster recovery times and its part of the CV shoulder ecosystem. It leverages the data we collect before surgery and during surgery, which enables better post-surgery recovery. So again, first to the world technology, we knew we're going to take our time. But so far, we like what we see and we'll continue to keep you informed in terms of this launch. Thanks.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord.\nCaitlin Cronin: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Yes, I'd like to focus a bit on pricing. I think it was positive again this quarter. Could you provide some more color on what you're seeing in the U.S.? And also the change in the full-year expectations for pricing.\nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. Hey Caitlin, it's Suky. You know the third quarter marks the third consecutive quarter where we've actually had positive pricing at the consolidated level across the entire company. Inside of that, the U.S. was down modestly, but still well better than the historic average. Asia Pacific was up slightly, and we saw good continued strong performance in EMEA. There's really three factors there. First is around market. We just think structurally the market is in a better spot relative to pricing. One, the value of our products and solutions is being rewarded by the marketplace. And two, we're seeing, I think, relatively rational behavior across the larger Medtech segment. Secondly, structurally, we've made a lot of improvements inside the company around strategy, governance and execution and incentives around pricing. And so we're seeing better performance because of that. And then third, we're seeing some opportunistic price taking in certain areas where we see the opportunity and the advantage. So all of those combined have led us into a really good spot. We do think we'll be at least flat, probably positive for the full year, whether that's sustainable or not. We think a lot of those variables I talked through are sustainable. Others will just have to wait and see. Our planning assumption throughout the LRP is that we'll be at about 100 basis points of pricing erosion. So this year is a good starting point, and hopefully we can beat that long-term look.\nCaitlin Cronin: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mike Matson with Needham & Company.\nMike Matson: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just want to ask one on China. Some of your competitors talked about continued pressures over there from the volume-based purchasing. Are you \u2013 what sort of impact are you seeing there, I guess? Thanks.\nIvan Tornos: Thanks Mike. So starting with the data point, China is around 2% to 3% of global sales for Zimmer Biomet. We've been monitoring the situation in China for the last four years. We understand fully the impact of volume-based procurement. We have the right level of investment with the right level of returns. Right now, we've not seen anything that can change the way we think about revenue contribution from China in next, call it, three or five years. I'm actually going to be in China next week myself. So staying very close to the situation. We don't have a large capital footprint like some of the other metric companies have reported. So we don't depend on capital sales there. And again, the expectations that we have internally that we have conveyed externally are well met when it comes to China. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Shagun Singh with RBC Capital Markets.\nShagun Singh: Great. Thank you so much. I had two quick follow-ups. On M&A, you did note that you don't need to do large deals to maintain that mid-single-digit growth out outlook. And I was wondering how do you think about diversification and pushing that top line beyond the mid-single-digit growth longer term? And then just a follow-up on 2025. Is it possible for you to share anything on sales and margin cadence as we move through the year, first half, second half, could you be at the upper end of that mid-single-digit range, just given easier comps possibility to get some lost sales due to ERP implementation in 2025. And then you also called out ROSA Shoulder that it would be a meaningful contributor. So if you can just help us bridge that, that would be helpful. Thanks you taking the question.\nIvan Tornos: Thanks, Shagun and great to hear from you. Let me make the second question answer very succinct. We're not going to get into any of that. We'll get into it in early 2025. We'll talk about revenue. We'll talk about margins. We'll provide some color on pacing and whatnot. So today, the only thing I'd say \u2013 the only thing we'll say about 25% is that we're excited. We're excited about the innovation \u2013 we're excited about how we closed the ERP challenge in 2024. And again, we'll talk about; 2025 when you start to talk about 2025. On your first question on M&A, what I said is, we do not need to do it. But certainly, we like to do it. And we got the optionality from a balance sheet standpoint to do it. One of the goals that we highlighted in New York at the Investor Day is to move from the current Vanguard weighted average market growth rate of around 4% today for us to 5%. And clearly, the organic pipeline is going to get us there. Launching all these products instead that I mentioned, but we do need to do something inorganically. And we're going to continue to assess those opportunities when they do make sense strategically and financially, we'll act on those. Thanks, Shagun.\nShagun Singh: Thank you.\nIvan Tornos: I believe that is the last question. Do you have any more questions, operator?\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.\nIvan Tornos: So then I'd like to close the call anchoring my closing remarks on maybe four words, grateful, proud, relief and excited. So on the grateful front, I'll close the call the way I started by thanking the Zimmer Biomet team for their commitment, their passion, the resilience has been quite a quarter with the ERP challenge. So I'm really grateful to all of you. I'm proud of the work that we've done in the quarter to mitigate the impact of this ERP challenge. Frankly, that's the share war and relief that this has turned to be a short-term issue versus being something that could have impacted the company for the long term. And then my fourth and final word here, I'm really excited about this innovation cycle that we're going through. The pipeline is strong. I know we're going to remediate some of the commercial execution challenges we have had in the past and the combination of innovation and best-in-class commercial execution is going to enable Zimmer Biomet to deliver on the growth that we know that we can deliver. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Suketu Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, we closed another solid quarter, showcasing the resilience and winning attitude across our nearly 18,000 team members. Despite ERP-related headwinds, we grew sales over 4%, while maintaining steady operating margins, generating $1.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $310 million in free cash flow. Given the challenges we have outlined related to our ERP implementation, we are now updating our 2024 full year guidance, which I'll touch on later. I would like to start by discussing the ERP implementation. As Ivan reviewed, we cut over to a new system in the third quarter for North America distribution, which resulted in slower shipping levels of products to our customers. We disclosed this disruption in early September and initially noted that the ERP-related headwinds could impact up to 1% of annual sales in the second half of the year. Through the excellent work of our team members, we now believe the impact will be 60 to 80 basis points of annual sales, split about evenly between the third and fourth quarter. We continue to expect to be back to normalized service levels exiting 2024. Moving on to results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the third quarter of 2024 and how it compares to the same period in 2023, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.824 billion, an increase of 4% on a reported basis and 4.1% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Consolidated pricing was 70 basis points positive in the third quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of positive pricing. Our U.S. business grew 2% and international grew 7.1%. Growth in the U.S. was driven by strong performance from hip and S.E.T., partially offset by other, which saw the largest impact from the ERP headwinds. Our international business continues to perform well with strength across knee and S.E.T. Global Knees grew 5.5% in the quarter, with U.S. growing 2.9% and international 9.2%. Our international business continues to benefit from our Persona portfolio in our ROSA Robotics platform. Global Hips grew 3.7%, with the U.S. growing 4.9% and international 2.4%. As Ivan mentioned, with the launch of Z1, accelerating rollout of HAMMR and closing of the OrthoGrid acquisition, we now have a complete product portfolio in hips and are on the offensive. Next, our S.E.T. segment grew 7.3%, led by CMFT, sports and upper extremities, which all grew between mid-single digits and high teens. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of at least mid-single-digit growth in S.E.T. and a trend we expect to continue. Finally, our other category declined 9.5%. The decline was driven by a combination of difficult comps from the prior year as well as our surgical business being disproportionately impacted by ERP-related challenges. Turning to our P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.23 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77 in the prior year. The increase in GAAP earnings was driven by higher revenue, combined with a lower tax rate and share count. On an adjusted basis, we delivered diluted earnings per share of $1.74 compared to $1.65 in the prior year with earnings growing faster than revenue. Adjusted gross margin was 71% and adjusted operating margin was 26.3%. Despite the ERP-related headwinds in the quarter, gross margin and operating margin were largely in line with the prior year. Net interest and other adjusted nonoperating expenses were $51 million in the quarter, up slightly on higher net debt and interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate was 17.7% higher than 2023 due to the implementation of Pillar 2 and fully diluted shares outstanding were $203 million, down year-over-year due to share buybacks. Turning to cash and liquidity. We generated robust operating cash flow of $396 million, free cash flow of $310 million, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to $652 million, ended the quarter with $569 million of cash and cash equivalents. Aligned with our capital allocation strategies to return at least 65% of free cash flow to shareholders over the LRP, we repurchased approximately $600 million in shares during the third quarter. Through the end of October, we have repurchased over $850 million in shares in the open market, and we maintain flexibility to continue our share repurchase program. Regarding our outlook for the rest of the year, given the ERP-related headwinds, we are updating our full year financial guidance. We now expect 2024 constant currency revenue growth of 4.25% to 4.75%. With recent exchange rate fluctuations, we now anticipate about a 75 basis point headwind from currency in 2024, resulting in reported revenue growth expectations of 3.5% and to 4%. Also, we now expect full year pricing to be flat to 50 basis points positive. For margins, we anticipate full year gross margin to be down slightly from 2023, while operating margin is still projected to be up year-over-year, marking the fourth consecutive year of operating margin expansion. We are reiterating our expectations for net interest and other non-operating expenses at about $205 million and an effective tax rate of 18%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the year are expected to be about $204 million, resulting in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $7.95 to $8.05. And we expect full year free cash flow to be about $1 billion. In summary, despite the challenges, this was another solid quarter for Zimmer Biomet. With that, I'll turn the call back over to David. Yes. So I won't give too much detail on 2025, but overall it's a very attractive segment as Ivan said, from a growth profile perspective, but also from a margin perspective. Margins in those key three businesses that Ivan talked about are above our overall company average. And so that's a good thing. They are slightly under our recon business. But again from an overall growth and EBITDA perspective, we're very excited about how that business is performing and where it's going. Yes. Thanks, Sophia. So first of all, yes, we continue to expect to see operating margin expansion into 2025. And really just going back to our LRP that we unveiled at our Investor Day back in May. We expect to generate at least 30 basis points of operating margin expansion per year, if not better than that. Inside of gross margin, I think our comments are still consistent with our thinking into 2025. There are some FX headwinds that occur that are going to peel off into 2025. So that will be a headwind. But operationally, we continue to make really good progress in containing our costs. We're also seeing a better pricing environment. I'm not saying it's going to be positive into next year, but overall, it's been much better than what we had anticipated coming into the year. So there's a lot of puts and takes on to the gross margin line. We still expect it to be relatively stable opposite [ph] 2024. But in the backdrop of all that, we are still committed to and have a very clear pathway to expanding operating margin next year and beyond. Hey Jeff. Good morning. It's Suky on selling days. In the quarter, it was about a day of a tailwind for the full year. It's not meaningful. And for 2025, we'll provide that update when we give guidance in the first quarter, but we don't see it as being material. Yes. Hey Caitlin, it's Suky. You know the third quarter marks the third consecutive quarter where we've actually had positive pricing at the consolidated level across the entire company. Inside of that, the U.S. was down modestly, but still well better than the historic average. Asia Pacific was up slightly, and we saw good continued strong performance in EMEA. There's really three factors there. First is around market. We just think structurally the market is in a better spot relative to pricing. One, the value of our products and solutions is being rewarded by the marketplace. And two, we're seeing, I think, relatively rational behavior across the larger Medtech segment. Secondly, structurally, we've made a lot of improvements inside the company around strategy, governance and execution and incentives around pricing. And so we're seeing better performance because of that. And then third, we're seeing some opportunistic price taking in certain areas where we see the opportunity and the advantage. So all of those combined have led us into a really good spot. We do think we'll be at least flat, probably positive for the full year, whether that's sustainable or not. We think a lot of those variables I talked through are sustainable. Others will just have to wait and see. Our planning assumption throughout the LRP is that we'll be at about 100 basis points of pricing erosion. So this year is a good starting point, and hopefully we can beat that long-term look."

            "name": "Ivan Tornos",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Welcome, David, to your very first Zimmer Biomet earnings call. It's truly lucky to have you. We love what you bring to the team already. I'd like to start today the way that I always do by taking a moment to recognize and to show my gratitude to the over 18,000 Zimmer Biomet team members who each and every day across the globe move for business and our mission forward. Thank you for your commitment to the organization. Thank you for your tireless work. Thank you for your very strong performance and most importantly thank you for what you do for our customers and patients every single day. As I said in the past, and as I will continue to say as long as I'm here, the Zimmer Biomet workforce and the culture that we have truly is one of our key competitive advantages. During the call today, I'm going to cover four things. First, I'll give an update on the recent ERP implementation and the challenges associated with it. Secondly, I'll cover some general comments on the quarter and the broader market dynamics. I move to them talk about a brief innovation overview. And then four and last, I'll close with a usual update on our three strategic priorities. After this, Suky is going to cover our financials in more detail. I will make sure to leave plenty of time for questions at the end of the prepared remarks. To begin, I'm very excited to report that we made greatest strides in managing the ERP implementation challenges outlined in early September. Through the dedicated work of the Zimmer Biomet team and our external partners, we now expect the impact of this challenge in the second half of 2024 being lower than the 100 basis points of annual sales that we initially communicated and we also fully expect to be back to normal shipping levels by the end of the year 2024. Turning to results. In Q3, we grew sales at mid-single-digit level, including strong results in knees, in hips and in head. This quarter, the third quarter now marks the 11th consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit or better constant currency revenue growth for Zimmer Biomet. In addition to the strong revenue performance, adjusted EPS once again grew faster than revenue. Our combined knee and hip businesses, what we call our reconstructed platform, grew in the mid-single-digit range globally while head delivered upper single-digit growth, aided by strong performance across our key growth drivers. Suku is going to cover this later, but I'm very proud of these results and specifically I love the consistency of growth in the key categories. Beyond commercial execution, our performance was fueled by mid-single-digit growth in our end markets, which we anticipate continuing based on all the analytics that we have at hand. And aging and increasing active population, combined with technological advancements, driving procedures to out-patient savings like the ASC in the U.S., accelerating recovery times and best-in-class outcomes should continue to provide tailwinds to market growth in the coming years. So again, we see a mean healthy, and we don't foresee these markets slowing down. From an innovation standpoint, Zimmer Biomet has the most robust product cycle in recent memory with over 50 meaningful plan product launches over a long-range plan horizon. I am particularly excited about the momentum we are generating in our Hips platform as evidenced by the improved results in this business and particularly in the U.S., where we delivered almost 5% growth in the third quarter. With Z1 our new triple-taper hip system, for interior heap implant procedures and with our surgical impact of HAMMR, as well as comprehensive navigation, robotics and platforms in navigation aorta grid, we are going to continue to be on the offense when it comes to gaining sharing hips. So great innovation, and we expect consistency in execution over the next several quarters. In keens, our cementless Persona OsseoTi continues to gain rapid traction, while the recently launched Persona IQ study, the shortest TEM for Persona IQ, is driving continued uptake of this differentiated technology. Early in the launch, the feedback has been super. Within Extremities, ROSA Solar has the potential to change the treatment paradigm in shoulder implants. It's a platform that allows for reproducible, anatomic and reverse procedures. Finally, Zimmer Biomet is the only orthopedic company offering both a CT scanless robotic system in ROSA. And through our recent partnership with THINK Surgical we also offered a smaller footprint, handheld CT scan-based system in Tamini. So, when it comes to navigation and robotics, we got the most comprehensive suite of solutions. Beyond all of this, we're expecting to launch a catering of new robotic applications in the short to midterm with and without CT scan capabilities as well as other differentiated features. In the ROSA franchise alone, we expect to launch three new indications in the next 18 to 36 months. While the underlying business performance remains strong, the team continues to execute on the same three strategic priorities that I have outlined in the past. Those being people and culture, which is foundational to our thing that we do; operational excellence; innovation and diversification. As I said at the beginning of the call, people and culture are key competitive advantages for Zimmer Biomet. Recently, we appointed new leadership in our hips, knees, set, in our ASC and in our digital technology and solutions businesses. I'm excited about these leadership changes, and I am confident that the growth under the leadership of this new individuals is going to accelerate. In addition, we have upgraded talent in critical areas like IT, information technology and operations. On the second imperative, operational excellence, we are maintaining expectations for the long-term financial commitments that we outlined at our Investor Day earlier in the year. With the terrific progress we made towards the resolution or the ERP issues, we feel even more confident in delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share growth of at least 1.5 times revenue and free cash flow growing at least 100 basis points faster than earnings throughout 2027. So again, the same commitments towards revenue, EPS and free cash flow remain. Finally, we continue to make progress in diversifying our business to increase the company's growth and profitability profile. This includes a highly disciplined approach towards M&A as well as internal capital allocation dynamics. To that extent, the value of Zimmer Biomet's pipeline of new products expected to be launched over our long-range plan is more than twice the value that it was just a short five years ago. And 80% of these new product launches are accretive to the Zimmer Biomet Vanguard of 4%. In conclusion, we are very proud of the progress in organization, and we look forward to continuing to execute above and beyond expectations. I love the fact that we're impacting the lives of millions of people, and I'm deeply inspired every day in knowing that my teammates and I are leaving the Zimmer Biomet mission of alleviating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Suke. Thank you very much. Thank you, Travis, Ivan here. Good morning. So just on the first part of your question on the guidance for 2024, look, listen, we're going to be somewhat conservative when it comes to the year and allow us to be conservative given the PTSD, if you will, or the recent ERP channels. In Q4, all kinds of things happen. We want to see where we end up with pricing. Pricing has been positive for the entire year. Let's see where we end up in Q4 with all the puts and takes that, that happened around rebates, et cetera, et cetera. I want to make sure that we see the commercial execution that we need to see around new product introductions. We've got three very meaningful new product introductions as we speak. We're late to get some of the sets out given the challenges with ERP. So again, I want to get at least a solid more on than I had before I get to positive on Q4. And then look, there are some macro factors early in the quarter. We saw some disruption with the hurricane and whatnot and the IV bags. We believe those are going to come in within the quarter. As a matter of fact, we are seeing those cases coming back already in the quarter. So allow us to be somewhat conservative, and we'll see what we end up in Q4. Relative to 2025, we're very positive. The ERP constraint or challenge is well contained within the year. We'll update you in early 2025 when it comes to what 2025 is going to look like. But I would say today, we're feeling very positive, given new product introductions, the resolution of the ERP, et cetera, et cetera. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your question. While \u2013 let me start with the latter part. So why have you not seen more deals? We have said all along that we don't need to do deals to remain a mid-single-digit revenue grower over the life of the long range plan. 11 quarters now, we've been growing mid-single-digit revenue or above, delivering mostly the time EPS faster than revenue and generating meaningful cash flow. Obviously, we're excited about M&A and the potential to diversify even more beyond the 4% WAMGR. The deals need to make strategic sense and financial sense, valuation are down. Yes, they are. But I will tell you, as we go through the filters that is not a single deal that is jump on as saying, we have to reallocate capital and do this deal immediately. We continue to evaluate deals. Deals in higher growth segments within Recon, opportunities within our set business and things that are in the ASC space. We've done deal that are exciting. OrthoGrid is the fastest navigation company today in the U.S. We've done some tacky in scenariosoffset. And when the right deal comes our way, we will jump on it. Thank you for your question. Yes. Thank you, David. So let's start with Knees overall. So international grew almost 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., we grew 3% constant currency that is \u2013 the challenges that we highlighted in the Q2 call, there were pre-ERP related. It was revision shortage that we had that's been resolved. So I will tell you, as we see here when I exit in the year, there are no supply constraints when it comes to our knee performance. The one thing that did slow down or knee growth in the quarter relative to the U.S. is the ERP challenges. While the impact of ERP was primarily in other, we could have had more Persona, OsseoTi sets going into the market. We could have done a better job in pulling through the multiple ROSAs installed in the U.S. So that has been the challenge. As we enter Q4, we're excited about where we are with Knees, and we really look forward to 2025. Thank you. Operator, we can go to the next question. Thank you, Alan. I'm not sure that I can offer any more color than what I offer. There is a level of conservatism given the multiple variables. Again, we just reactivated shipping volumes. We got through the ERP. We want to make sure that we like what we see. And again, it's no more complex than that. Don't read too much into it. We got one month behind in the quarter. We like what we see. And again, let's see what happens in November and December. But nothing else to add on the guidance question. Sure. I'll go over the first part and I'll let Suketu elaborate on the margin opportunity here with SET. So this is the fourth quarter in a row where we have grown SET at mid-single digit revenue or above. Actually this quarter is low upper single digit. We typically don't talk about the geographic split, U.S., OUS for SET, but I'm pleased with the U.S. SET performance where we grew 5% in the quarter. Once again, virtually all of the six drivers within SET grew above our expectations. The three growth drivers of SET, sports medicine, shoulder and CMFT continue to perform very strongly. As we've been saying for a while, here is where we have invested a lot of innovation over the last three years. And what you see now is the early results of all those launches. And yeah, we do believe that the growth is sustainable as we get into 2025 and 2026, as we highlighted in the Investor \u2013 at the Investor Day these are category that has to be growing at this pace, if not above. And there is plenty of new products to get there. Suketu, you want to comment on the margin piece? One last comment I'll throw in there related to the financial performance. Typically this business, these segments require less instruments on working capital. So again, it's another enabler of free cash flow growth over the life of the plan. Thanks for the question. Thank you, Chris. So first things first, we have launched already Z1. We're going to embark in the full launch of the product next week in Dallas at the Hip and Knee Society Meeting. We have trained the sales force. We're going to continue to train physicians. We believe this category, to your point, is going to become the standard of care. It's one category in what we didn't play, but it's more than Z1. It's the combination of Z1, the triple taper, along with surgical impact of HAMMR, which is now also fully launched. That's why we delivered 5% growth in the U.S. in Q3. And then navigation, which is robotics as well as surgical guidance by OrthoGrid. So I think the combination of those three products and more to come is what's going to get us to get back to gaining market share. It will be the standard of care. We're going to be on the supply side, we're going to be where we need to be as we enter the year 2025. So we don't expect to have a shortage of supply. As a matter of fact, we won't have a shortage of supply to make sure that it's a full launch all the way from January 1, 2025. Thanks for the question, Chris. Yes, absolutely. And I'll try to keep it short because it can be a 45-minute discussion right here on innovation. My most favorite topic, I'm certainly \u2013 something we didn't have three years ago. So you know the usual suspects in the short term. As you think about mid to long-term, Oxford Partial cementless, which is mid-2025 product is going to be the only PMA-approved Partial cementless knee in the U.S. This is a product, Steve, with 60% market share in the European market. It has the longest data on joint survivors according to the UK registry \u2013 so in a world of ASC expansion within this product to be extremely meaningful. ROSA Shoulder picks up in 2025. We do believe in late 2025 and 2026 is going to be one of the major growth drivers of the company. Like where we are with the smart implants, it took a while to get there. But with the recent launch of the short stem, what we call Persona IQ [indiscernible], unfortunate name, by the way, we're going to see meaningful adoption in 2025 and 2026. To your point, there are three ROSA indications coming up. They're going to hit mid-2025, 2026 that keep the acceleration going. In hips that will be knees, in hips out of the launch of Z1 HAMMR and Navigation like OrthoGrid and ROSA posterior in Europe, which is going to get launch soon, will be first to market with coated implants, which addresses a meaningful problem when it comes to infection in hip surgery. So we expect to be ready to launch coated hip devices late 2025, early 2026. And again, that just is a category that for the most part has not been touched. And then instead, there will be all kinds of things. But beyond ROSA Shoulder, which already \u2013 I mentioned is going to be a meaningful growth driver. You've got the stemless shoulders; you've got next-generation identity and all kinds of other products. So again, I could spend an hour, but the cycle of innovation is not a one and done 25 opportunity. There are 50 new products over the next three years and a lot of them are very meaningful. Thanks for the question. Thank you, Richard, for the question. It's another exciting partnership that we have going on that gives the company optionality. So there is a segment of customers that are seeing the footprint is important in robotics, primarily in ASC. So TMINI does give us that optionality. There is a segment of customers that prefer CT scanning capabilities when they do robotic cases and TMINI give us that opportunity. To your point, early in the launch, we have already seen some conversions of customers that have come to Zimmer Biomet to use that type of robotic application with the world's number one implant in knees. The partnership is giving us that optionality. The data so far suggests that this is a meaningful opportunity. We're going to be doing additional training next week in Dallas. And again, we like the fact that we have the portfolio that we have, that gives optionality across the board. So good data so far, and we'll continue to keep you updated on it. And then Jeff, on ROSA Shoulder, we've done now hundreds of cases continue to validate the value proposition of this product. We said all along that it was going to be a limited market release. Beyond Mayo [ph], we are now in more institutions. And the feedback in terms of the opportunity continues to be strong. This is a product that we believe can change the standard of care in Shoulder Arthroplasty. The robot has offered the optionality of doing anatomic or reversed shoulder cases. It is extremely accurate. You can do surgeries impacting the glenoid, remind [ph] glenoid, you can get into a complex human resections. It is efficient. Some of the early feedback is that you can cut your operating time meaningfully. So one of the claims will be faster surgeries with more accuracy that also equals faster recovery times and its part of the CV shoulder ecosystem. It leverages the data we collect before surgery and during surgery, which enables better post-surgery recovery. So again, first to the world technology, we knew we're going to take our time. But so far, we like what we see and we'll continue to keep you informed in terms of this launch. Thanks. Thanks Mike. So starting with the data point, China is around 2% to 3% of global sales for Zimmer Biomet. We've been monitoring the situation in China for the last four years. We understand fully the impact of volume-based procurement. We have the right level of investment with the right level of returns. Right now, we've not seen anything that can change the way we think about revenue contribution from China in next, call it, three or five years. I'm actually going to be in China next week myself. So staying very close to the situation. We don't have a large capital footprint like some of the other metric companies have reported. So we don't depend on capital sales there. And again, the expectations that we have internally that we have conveyed externally are well met when it comes to China. Thanks for the question. Thanks, Shagun and great to hear from you. Let me make the second question answer very succinct. We're not going to get into any of that. We'll get into it in early 2025. We'll talk about revenue. We'll talk about margins. We'll provide some color on pacing and whatnot. So today, the only thing I'd say \u2013 the only thing we'll say about 25% is that we're excited. We're excited about the innovation \u2013 we're excited about how we closed the ERP challenge in 2024. And again, we'll talk about; 2025 when you start to talk about 2025. On your first question on M&A, what I said is, we do not need to do it. But certainly, we like to do it. And we got the optionality from a balance sheet standpoint to do it. One of the goals that we highlighted in New York at the Investor Day is to move from the current Vanguard weighted average market growth rate of around 4% today for us to 5%. And clearly, the organic pipeline is going to get us there. Launching all these products instead that I mentioned, but we do need to do something inorganically. And we're going to continue to assess those opportunities when they do make sense strategically and financially, we'll act on those. Thanks, Shagun. I believe that is the last question. Do you have any more questions, operator? So then I'd like to close the call anchoring my closing remarks on maybe four words, grateful, proud, relief and excited. So on the grateful front, I'll close the call the way I started by thanking the Zimmer Biomet team for their commitment, their passion, the resilience has been quite a quarter with the ERP challenge. So I'm really grateful to all of you. I'm proud of the work that we've done in the quarter to mitigate the impact of this ERP challenge. Frankly, that's the share war and relief that this has turned to be a short-term issue versus being something that could have impacted the company for the long term. And then my fourth and final word here, I'm really excited about this innovation cycle that we're going through. The pipeline is strong. I know we're going to remediate some of the commercial execution challenges we have had in the past and the combination of innovation and best-in-class commercial execution is going to enable Zimmer Biomet to deliver on the growth that we know that we can deliver. Thank you very much."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Ivan. Ivan?\nIvan Tornos: Thank you, Zach. Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. Good morning. I would like to start the way that I usually do, by taking a quick moment to show my sincere gratitude to the north of 18,000 Zimmer Biomet team members across the world, who each and every day go above and beyond in delivering on our mission, elevating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. That's what you and I get to do each and every day, and you're doing an unreal job in bringing this mission into action. Thank you for your commitment to Zimmer Biomet, thank you for your tireless work, and thank you for the very strong performance so far in this year 2024. We are now past the midpoint in the year and we're growing 5% after having delivered strong performances in 2023, 2022, and 2021. So the trend is real, the performance is there, and I'm deeply proud of the work that you're doing daily. As I've said countless times, the Zimmer Biomet workforce and our culture here is truly one of our key competitive advantages. In today's call, I'm going to give some opening remarks and then Suky will cover financials. And then, as always, we will leave ample time to answer your questions. The agenda for today, first, I'll cover some perspective on the quarter. Secondly, I'll discuss the drivers of our performance and why we are even more confident than ever in our updated full year guidance for 2024 and why, already looking into 2025 and beyond, we're also very confident that we'll continue to deliver on the long-range plan commitments that we outlined at the end of May at our first ever Zimmer Biomet Investor Day. Recall, those commitments were driving revenue growth at least at mid-single digit growth rates, driving EPS at 1.5 revenue growth, and driving free cash flow growth at least 100 basis points above our EPS commitments. The third thing in the agenda, we'll close with our strategic priorities, those being people and culture, operational excellence, and innovation and diversification. Starting with our Q2 results, we continue to be very encouraged by our global performance. In the second quarter of this year 2024, we grew 5.6% on a constant currency basis. And with that, we have now closed the first half of 2024, growing 5%. Worth noting that this 5% is versus very tough comps in the first half of 2023. The second quarter of 2024 now marks the 10th consecutive quarter in which Zimmer Biomet has grown mid-single digit or above. So, again, a trend in the making that is real, and we're very confident that this performance will continue, if not will accelerate as we continue to move our business forward. Against the backdrop, in the quarter, we did see some weakness early in the first half of the quarter in the U.S. It's worth noting that May and June here in the U.S. were better than April. And in July, the U.S. Recon business actually delivered mid-single digit growth. So, choppiness through the first half of the quarter and then an improvement through the second half, which has continued with very strong performance through the month of July. Our OUS international business, outside the U.S. business, has delivered above expectations. We saw a strong demand in the key markets across both Recon and the S.E.T. categories. So, overall, very diversified, solid performance coming out of these markets. I love the fact that in Q2, in our second quarter, we continued to deliver excellent performance in our other category. This category is primarily focused on enabling technologies, primarily ROSA. We saw a strong demand for ROSA, growing double digit in that business and we also saw strong demand in enabling technologies and navigation systems. As we have been saying for quite some time, we want to be more than just a leading reconstructive knees and hips company in key geographies, where we have a really high market share, as an example, the U.S. or key countries of Europe and Asia Pacific. One example of this diversification journey has been S.E.T. We've been committing to growing S.E.T. at least mid-single digit and Q2 of 2024 is now the third quarter in a row in where we are growing mid-single digit or above, a trend that we expect to continue towards the end of 2024 and moving into 2025 and 2026. So, nice growth in other, nice growth in international, and nice growth in S.E.T. One area that I'll tell you we've made significant strides is within our hips portfolio. We did lose some market share in hips in the U.S. and OUS markets over the last three years to five years. And as I said over and over, this was due to lacking three key product items, direct anterior stems -- what we call triple taper stems, elegant navigation, and surgical impactors. As we sit here today, we have remediated those gaps. We have 510(k) approval for Z1 or triple taper stem. We are regaining market share already with HAMMR, or surgical impactor. And today, we have the most comprehensive navigation in hip arthroplasty. Not only do we have ROSA Hip, we also have the only 510(K) FDA-cleared augmented/mixed reality hip navigation platform via a partnership with our colleagues at Hip Insights. And now, we have also signed and announced an agreement to acquire OrthoGrid that is going to give us a leading position in navigation using artificial intelligence devices. So we have the most comprehensive suite of solutions in navigation, in direct anterior stems, and in surgical impactors, not to mention having the best core implant technology with products like G7 and Avenir Complete. So the expectation is to grow again above market when it comes to hips and regain some of the market share that we lost over the last three years or five years. Moving from hips, we have developed and we are today the first and only robotic-assisted shoulder replacement platform in the world. The feedback on the cases we've done with ROSA Shoulder continues to be very compelling, and as we enter late Q3 and early Q4, we expect to see an acceleration of those cases. And in 2025, we expect ROSA Shoulder to be a very meaningful growth driver for Zimmer Biomet. We recently announced the partnership with THINK Surgical. This is going to provide our surgeon customers optionality across the robotic landscape. We have conducted extensive training, with one voice on customer, and the feedback on this partnership with THINK remains super. With this partnership, Zimmer Biomet is the only orthopedic company in the world that will offer both a handheld CT scan-based system in the TMINI, exclusive for Zimmer Biomet platform, as well as a simplified, CT scan-less robotic system in our current form factor of ROSA for total knee arthroplasty. We're excited about the optionality and we're also excited about the fact that we continue to innovate at a very fast pace when it comes to ROSA and we're expecting to launch at least three new ROSA modalities in the next three quarters to eight quarters. From an earnings standpoint, we generated $2.01 of adjusted earnings per share in the quarter or a growth of 10%. This is in line with our long-range plan targets I outlined at our Investor Day in May. Inside of the strong performance through the first half of the year, the team continues to execute on the three strategic priorities that I keep outlining in each and every earnings call and at every Zimmer Biomet meeting around the world. The three priorities of people and culture, foundational to everything that we do; operational excellence; and innovation and diversification. As I said in my opening, people and culture continues to be a key competitive advantage for Zimmer Biomet. I'm proud to share that Zimmer Biomet was recently named one of America's Best Midsize Companies to work for by TIME magazine. This reflects the strength in team member satisfaction and engagement, our revenue growth profile, and the turnaround of the organization now behind us. On the second imperative, operational excellence, we continue to expect to grow constant currency revenue at least at mid-single digit level, with adjusted earnings per share growing at least 1.5 times revenue, and free cash flow growing at least 100 basis points faster than earnings. It's a commitment that we're making not just for 2024, but also for the long-range plan 2025, 2026, and beyond. This is a mindset that continues to proliferate throughout the organization. We pay people on delivering towards such commitments. We have trained people to deliver on those commitments and the trend, as I've repeated a few times in my opening remarks, is in the making. In the past, when it comes to innovation and diversification, it's been very much portfolio-centric, moving from lower-growth markets to higher-growth markets, point in case, the super performance in S.E.T. But today, we're also thinking diversification from a geographic mix standpoint. We want to continue to invest in key markets outside of the U.S. where we see an opportunity to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth. We're encouraged by the sound performance that we've seen in our OUS business and we expect to continue to accelerate growth in these markets without compromising our margin performance. In conclusion, we are very proud of how far we have come as an organization in terms of the financial progress, the innovation progress, and the commercial execution. Our second quarter results are another proof point that we make commitments and deliver on those commitments, and we fully expect that the trend is going to continue for the balance of the year and beyond. We're confident in our guidance for the year and we love the fact that we're impacting the lives of millions of people, and I'm deeply inspired every day in knowing that my teammates and I are living the Zimmer Biomet mission of alleviating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Suky. Thank you.\nSuky Upadhyay: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, Q2 closed a solid first half of the year for Zimmer Biomet, with ex FX revenue growth of 5% in the first half and operating margins well ahead of the prior year. Our results through the quarter provide increased confidence in our 2024 full year guidance, which includes 5% to 6% constant currency revenue growth and $8.00 to $8.15 in adjusted earnings per share. I'll provide more color on guidance shortly. Moving to the second quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter of 2024 and how it compares to the same period in 2023, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.942 billion, an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 5.6% excluding the impact of foreign currency. As a reminder, we had a day rate tailwind that impacted all businesses and regions at about the same level. Pricing at a consolidated level was 80 basis points, driven by gains in international that were partially offset by modest declines in the U.S. Our U.S. business grew 3.5% and international grew 8.5%. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our S.E.T. and other categories. As a reminder, our other category includes our surgical business, as well as enabling technologies such as ROSA capital sales. Our international business continues to perform well, driven by knee and S.E.T., with continued strength in emerging markets. Global knees grew 5.5% in the quarter, with U.S. growing 0.8% and international growing 11.5%. U.S. growth was impacted by softer sales in the first part of the quarter, with improvement in utilization and growth as we move through the second half. We continue to see strong uptake of Persona OsseoTi and remain optimistic that the recent robust ROSA installs will continue to drive pull-through and share of wallet opportunities. International continues to benefit from ROSA Robotics, as well as our Persona family of implants. Global hips grew 2.8% in the quarter, with the U.S. growing 1.8% and international growing 3.7%. While our hip business has lagged the broader market due to key portfolio gaps, we have made significant progress with new product introductions and are excited to get back on the offensive in early 2025 when these products and technologies are fully in market. Next, the S.E.T. category grew 7.3%, led by our key focus areas of CMFT, upper extremities, and sports, growing on average high-single digits. All other categories grew mid-single digits on average, giving us confidence in our ability to drive mid-single digit growth or better from S.E.T. through the second half of the year. Finally, our other category grew 11.3% in the quarter and continues to be driven by strong demand for ROSA systems and other enabling technologies. Turning to our P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.18 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 in the prior year. Higher revenue combined with lower R&D, effective tax rate, and share count more than offset expenses associated with our restructuring program. On an adjusted basis, we delivered diluted earnings per share of $2.01 compared to $1.82 in the prior year, representing over 10% growth. The step-up was primarily driven by revenue growth, improved operating margins due to savings pull-through from our restructuring program, and a lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Adjusted gross margin was 71.6%, about 40 basis points lower than the prior year, driven by higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by better pricing and lower royalties. Adjusted operating margin was 28.5%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. The increase in operating margin was driven by higher revenue and lower OpEx as a percentage of sales as a result of our restructuring program. Net interest and other adjusted non-operating expenses were $45 million in the quarter, and our adjusted tax rate was 18.2%. Turning to cash and liquidity. We generated operating cash flows of $369 million, free cash flow of $251 million, and we ended the quarter with $420 million of cash and cash equivalents. Aligned with our capital allocation strategies, we repurchased $95 million of shares in the second quarter. Regarding our outlook for the rest of the year, we are reiterating our full year constant currency revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6%, but given further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are updating our reported revenue growth to 4% to 5% and now expect 100 basis points of currency headwind for the full year, which should impact Q3 more than Q4. We still expect to generate between $8.00 and $8.15 in adjusted earnings per share despite this greater FX pressure and $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Our tax and interest and non-operating expenses expectations remain unchanged. When thinking about the cadence through the second half of the year, due to normal seasonality, Q3 typically is the lowest revenue quarter from a dollar perspective, with Q4 being the highest. From a margin standpoint, we still expect gross margin to step down sequentially as the year progresses, while operating margins should expand by more than 50 basis points year-over-year. As usual, we expect operating margin to be higher in Q4 than Q3, driven by higher revenue. In summary, Q2 closed a positive first half of the year, giving us continued confidence in our ability to meet our full year outlook and another positive proof point through our LRP. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Zach.\nZach Weiner: Thanks, Suky. Before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one brief follow-up, so we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go first to David Roman with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Roman: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I wanted just to start with the U.S. knee business and appreciate the comments around the month-to-month fluctuations in growth. But maybe you could just take a step back and help us think through the impact of the conversion to cementless and cementless robotic? How is that tracking? And how should we think about the way that shows up in reported numbers?\nIvan Tornos: Thank you, David. Good morning. Maybe quickly here, 20 seconds big picture, and then I'll talk about the U.S. So, big picture. It was a good quarter. We here at Zimmer Biomet deliver 5.6% ex-FX. As I noted in my prepared remarks, this is the 10th quarter in a row growing mid-single digit or above. And we're pleased with the double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. S.E.T. performed above expectations, third quarter mid-single digit or above. I'm pleased to report that for the first time in a while, every single business within S.E.T. -- and there are six of them, actually grew, which is something we didn't see before. Enabling technologies, which is robotics primarily, grew double digit in Q2. It grew double digit in Q1. The U.S. grew -- robotics grew 16% in the quarter, so strong in that regard. And as we announced this morning, we did close the gaps in hips that we had, which frankly is one of the reasons why we lost market share. Just throwing the summary to highlight the fact that unlike five years ago, we're not just a U.S. knee-centric type of company. That said, relative to knees and the U.S. performance, look, David, not pleased with the quarter. It was softer than expected. And what I will tell you is that there are three main reasons why we did not do better in the U.S., and these are solvable reasons. The first one is, we had a large amount of high volume surgeons -- Zimmer Biomet high volume surgeons that were out of the territory for a variety of reasons. We hosted large medical education events and we did have a large group of surgeons that were not performing surgeries in the quarter. The second piece is that we had some challenges from a supply standpoint when it came to one of our knee platforms, what we call limb salvage, which is part of knee revision cases. These are high ASP cases. And candidly, this didn't help the quarter. And then the third reason on why knees in the U.S. was softer than expected is comps. We delivered knee growth of 10% -- almost 10%, 9.8% to be exact in Q2 of 2023, which was close to mid-single digit, and the U.S. grew 5%. So, comps didn't help. So, in the background of those surgeons being out, supply constraints, the comps didn't help out. What I will tell you is that these three elements have gotten resolved as we move out of the quarter and sitting here, July behind us, the U.S. Recon performance is very strong. On the second part of your question, David, cementless continues to track very nicely. Candidly, I hope we can get more sets out. The adoption rate is very high. We are converting accounts and we hope to have cementless not just in the U.S., but outside of the U.S. very soon. So that's the summary of what's happening here in the U.S.\nDavid Roman: That's -- thank you for all the detail. It's super helpful. Maybe, Suky, just a quick follow-up for you on the P&L. Can you help us think about the kind of interplay here between the benefits you're seeing from the restructuring? And I think you had talked about planning to reinvest some of the savings. Where are you in sort of the progress with respect to the restructuring benefit, and then at the same -- on the -- at the same token, kind of that level of reinvestment that you had contemplated when you introduced the restructuring back in February?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. First of all, good morning, David. Thanks for the question. Just to remind everyone, we talked about or announced our restructuring program at the early part of this year. We talked about $200 million of run rate savings as we exit 2025. I would say where we are right now is we're slightly ahead of that overall trend, at least from a timing perspective, still expect to generate $200 million on a run rate, but it's happening probably a little bit faster than we originally expected. That's definitely contributing to operating margin expansion. You see that in the second quarter, where we're up 100 basis points year-over-year. So, very nice progress there. And that's in the backdrop of continuing to invest in R&D, as well as in certain areas across commercial, whether that's building specialized sales forces across S.E.T., additional complement in our technology, components of Recon and other parts of commercial. So we are, as I would say, just summarizing, going a little bit faster than expected on the savings program, and we're in line and on track with that reinvestment plan.\nZach Weiner: Thanks, David. Can we go to the next question, please, Katie?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Matt Taylor with Jefferies.\nMatt Taylor: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I just wanted to ask you more about the hip progress that you're expecting, calling out the opportunity to move back into a share-taking position over the next couple of years and tying that back to the Analyst Day goal. So, I guess, I'll ask the question as to when you expect this to really start and how we should measure your progress against the share gain goals? And are there inflection points along the way that we should be looking out for in your hip business?\nIvan Tornos: Thank you, Matt. The short answer was we have already started. So again, July, so far so good when it comes to hip recovery. We launched our surgical impactor HAMMR midpoint into Q2 and the adoption has been great so far. As you heard from us, we will be launching our triple taper stem, that's Z1, which is going to enable share regaining in direct anterior. That's going to get launched late in Q3, early Q4. We have the quantity that we need. We got the commercial plans in place. So, that should be another driver. And the third leg was to have elegant navigation systems, and we got three of them. This morning, we announced the acquisition of OrthoGrid. That should close later in the year. It's one of the fastest growing navigation platforms in the U.S. So I would say the combination of triple taper stems, surgical impactors, and three different modalities of navigation put us in a position to regain market share in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we're going to be launching a second generation of robotics, hip posterior robotics, and that's another driver of share regaining. So we're very confident about where we are today and we will get the share back.\nMatt Taylor: Great. And just one clarification. So, the issues you mentioned in the U.S., you're basically saying those are temporary, related to the surgeons being out, the supply issue, not a change in the market or something else bigger happening?\nIvan Tornos: The market is very strong. By now, all of us have reported. So you see that the market growth rates remain above pre-pandemic levels. So, nothing relative to market. And again, I just want to emphasize that the two, three things that I talked about, the large volume surgeons being out of the territory, we saw in July a recovery. On the revision constraints, those are largely soft, and again, that's one portion of our platform. And again, so far so good. So yes, market is healthy.\nZach Weiner: Thanks, Matt. Katie, could we have the next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley.\nDrew Ranieri: Hi, Ivan and Suky. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe, Suky, for you to start. Just you've talked more -- you've talked about growth and margin improvement and increasingly so about free cash flow. But when we kind of look at your guide for the year, it still implies a significant step-up in the back half versus the first half. I guess, some of that would be growth in the leverage opportunity that you kind of talked about. But is the environment supportive enough to see kind of a meaningful working capital improvement and, especially, with all these new products coming and I have to imagine you're going to be spending on FX, but just -- or on CapEx. But just how do you kind of get to your free cash flow guide and your plans on using that cash this year?\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. First of all, good morning, Drew. Thanks for the question. There are really three building blocks to the growth in free cash flow from where we start here in the second quarter -- or third quarter, I should say. And by the way, the asymmetry between first half and second half of free cash flow is typical in our business. The three building blocks are, really, you have a lot of headwinds in the first half of the year related to rebates from the previous year fourth quarter that you have to pay in the first quarter, bonuses and different levels of incentive payments that happened in the first half. So there are certain headwinds that typically happen in the first half that don't repeat in the second half. In addition, in the second half, you're going to have improved EBITDA through growth as you pointed out. But secondly, a pretty meaningful improvement in working capital, specifically around inventory. We've already seen that inventory improve from second quarter versus first quarter, and we're going to continue to see that sequentially improve in the third quarter, fourth quarter as well. So that's a pretty big driver of the overall free cash flow generation and step-up into the second half of the year. Relative to where we're prioritizing, we continue to prioritize in making sure that we've got the right assets and the right level of investment on our organic business. As Ivan talked about, we're actually stepping up our instrument CapEx around OsseoTi. Demand, quite frankly, has outstripped our original expectations and -- which is a great thing, and we're now catching up on getting those sets out into market. And so, we feel really good about that and we're actually putting more dollars against that. But outside of that, I think what you're seeing also is that we bought some shares back in the second quarter, aligned to our overall capital allocation strategy, which we outlined on our Investor Day. So, overall, feel good about where we're headed for cash for the full year. You will see a second half step-up, typical in every year, and we're going to continue to prioritize our organic investments. And then from there, our capital allocation remains balanced between M&A and return of capital to shareholders.\nDrew Ranieri: Got it. Thanks, Suky. And Ivan, maybe just over to you quickly on the OrthoGrid acquisition. Can you just talk a little bit more about how this supports the overall large joint strategy and maybe how you think this platform could evolve over time across the portfolio or care settings and maybe eventually into the S.E.T. business? Thanks for taking the questions.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you, Drew. Very excited. So this one word is optionality. Now, Zimmer Biomet is the only company in the world with three different forms of navigation. With ROSA Hip, you got anterior today, robotic navigation, at some point soon posterior as well. With OrthoGrid, we have AI surgical guidance. It's a lighter, faster option for some of the surgeons that want to use a non-robotic option. And then the third vector here, as you know, we have a partnership with Hip Insights, which is the only FDA-approved mixed/reality navigation, and that pretty much gives the surgeon X-ray vision over the patient's anatomy, instruments, and implants. So, again, a different modality, which some customers seem to like. So we got three different ways to do navigation and that appeals to pretty much every customer in that regard. We -- the broader strategy, we want to be a company that delivers faster, better solutions, and navigation is an enabler of that. And again, in the big picture, this will enable Zimmer Biomet to regain some of those 200 basis points to 300 basis points of market share that we lost over the years.\nZach Weiner: Thanks, Drew. Can we have the next question, Katie?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Joanne Wuensch with Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. You mentioned somewhere in the script several new ROSA robots that you expect over the next three quarters to eight quarters. Could you remind us of how many is several and which those are and how we should think about those launching over essentially the next two years? And I'll throw one more in there for Suky. How do you think about the revenue contribution from those robots ramping? Thank you.\nSuky Upadhyay: Hi, Joanne, good to talk to you. Good morning. I think I said over the next four quarters to eight quarters, but if it is three, let's keep it to four. We're not going to get into a lot of details, given competitive reasons. But what we are committed to launch is a posterior application for some of the OUS markets, where posterior is more prevalent than interior. As you know, we're going to get into full launch mode for ROSA Shoulder later in the year. And again, so far, the voice of customer has been super. We want to get at some point a different version of ROSA. We're launching two different ROSAs for knees. One is going to be late this year, early 2025. We call it ROSA [B15], which has different levels of workflows, smart positioning, it's got a different auto-balance procedure, and it will be a platform that is going to deliver a kinematic aligned type of knee. In 2025, at some point, we will have a ROSA CT scan base for some of our ROSA users that like that type of device. So those are four or five examples of what's coming here again over the next four quarters to eight quarters. In addition to ROSA, we have the partnership with THINK Surgical. And we got, as I just mentioned, very comprehensive navigation systems. In terms of the revenue contribution, we don't really give details on that. What I will tell you is that we're growing today, end of Q2 double digit in the U.S., when it comes to enabling technologies, we grew double digit in Q1 and we don't expect that to slow down, and that's pull-through for implants.\nJoanne Wuensch: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nIvan Tornos: Thank you, Joanne.\nZach Weiner: Thanks, Joanne. Can we have the next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Ivan and one for Suky. I'll try to ask them both upfront. So, Ivan, I'd love to hear an update on the status of Persona IQ, the launch and the short -- have you launched the short stem extension and how that could help and the TPT, we saw you applied for that. Just confident you'll get it and what that could mean for adoption of? Just as my follow-up for Ivan on the gross margin here -- I mean, I'm sorry, for Suky. I -- the gross margin was a little lighter than expected in Q2. What's assumed for the full year? Did you say that gross margin steps down as the year progresses? So, Q3 lower than Q2 and Q4 lower than Q3, and is gross margin still expected to be in line with 2023? I think that was the prior guidance. So, I apologize, Suky, if I heard incorrectly your comments earlier. But thanks for taking the questions.\nIvan Tornos: Hi, thank you, Larry. First part of your question on Persona IQ, we remain excited. The adoption is speeding up. We should see some acceleration in the second half of 2024, part of the new product contribution for 2024 and in a more meaningful way in 2025. We've now crossed 3 billion data points around range of motion, mobility and what not. We launched what we call Recovery Curves, which enables the opportunity for us to cross-reference how certain patients are performing versus others. We're going to be having a data discussion with payers so that we can engage in some risk-sharing type of agreements. So, again, leveraging the data. On the stubby part of your question, we're going to be launching that at the -- full launch at the end of 2024. So we got the approval. The design is ready to go, the sets are ready to go. And again, that's part of the acceleration in the second half of 2024, more meaningfully in 2025. We've now signed agreements, partnerships with some of the major hospitals around the U.S. And then in terms of TPT, we did look at it. We engaged a third-party consultant. We pulled the TPT application, because it didn't make economic sense. It didn't make as much economic sense as we thought. And again, we believe there are different, better ways to monetize the technology. We still have NTAP, but TPT didn't make sense.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes. Good morning, Larry. On your questions on gross margin, I think, actually, you largely got it right, but let me just step back and go through it for you. Just year-over-year overall, we expect gross margins to be in line with '23, but potentially slightly down. That's the new element there and that's largely driven by the mix of our business. We're just seeing much stronger international sales, which have a lower gross margin than the U.S. So, it's really mix related. But again, in line to potentially slightly down. In the second quarter, you're right, it was a little bit lighter than our expectation, again, back to that mix component where the U.S. was just much stronger from a growth perspective than the U.S. for all the reasons that Ivan spoke about. Even in the backdrop of that, Larry, we still managed to expand operating margin by 100 basis points and grow earnings quite nicely. On the cadence, you got it right, and it's consistent with everything that we provided earlier this year, which is to say gross margin will step down sequentially in the second half versus the first half. And you should see that also Q2 to Q3, Q3 to Q4 sequentially down. The primary driver of that, again, going back to our earlier comments from this year, are really around the inflationary pressure we saw in third-party manufacturing costs in 2023. That got capitalized and are now feathering into the P&L throughout this year. So that's the driver of the cadence there. But again, I'll just revert you back to the backdrop of all that is we do still expect to see operating -- meaningful operating margin expansion for the full year and we do expect to see operating margin in the second half step up versus the first half, again, driven by the restructuring program despite the sequential lowering of gross margin. So I'm sorry for all the detail there, but I wanted to get it all out in sort of one compact commentary.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thank you.\nZach Weiner: Thanks, Larry. Katie, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG.\nRyan Zimmerman: Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I want to ask -- I'll ask both questions upfront. The first one I want to ask is around ROSA versus TMINI. And when you announced that transaction or you announced that partnership, I think there was some fear that TMINI could replace ROSA, at least in terms of how the stock reacted. And so, Ivan, if you could kind of talk about kind of how you think about adoption of those two options over time, where TMINI fits in terms of either setting of care or utilization? And does that kind of reflect the proportion of knees and hips that are done in an ASC versus hospital? And should we think of it that way? And then my second question is just a follow-up to Larry's question on margins for Suky. Price was positive this quarter. But you did call higher manufacturing costs. And so, when do you turn the corner on higher manufacturing costs? Is that sometime in 2025 that we see that improve? And how durable is your pricing benefits? Thanks for taking the questions.\nIvan Tornos: Hi, thank you, Ryan. Look, TMINI is not going to replace ROSA just like OrthoGrid is not going to replace ROSA. It's all about having breadth of portfolio. TMINI offers CT scanning, which some surgeons like and TMINI is the only handheld robotic platform in the world, which is something that, in an ASC environment, surgeons seem to like. What I will tell you is that we are deeply committed to ROSA, point in case, all these new platforms and indications we're going to be launching over the next four quarters to eight quarters, point in case, the commitments we made at the Investor Day of doubling our penetration from somewhere in the 20% of all U.S. knees done robotic with ROSA to 40% in the next three years. ROSA continues to be one of the fastest growing platforms here at Zimmer Biomet. We grew again in the U.S. or capital sales for ROSA 16% in Q2. Overall, it was double digit globally. ROSA today is already outside of the U.S., the leading robot platform, number one in Asia Pacific, fast growing in EMEA. And I think we're very pleased with where we are with ROSA, but we know we need to have optionality and we like our chances when it comes to that. In terms of the revenue contribution of robotics, is one of the most meaningful ones. And as we the double penetration, you should assume that our knee and hip number and shoulder later in the year is going to continue to grow.\nSuky Upadhyay: Hi, Ryan, Suky. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me start with price and then I'll go to your question on manufacturing costs. So price, as I noted in my earlier commentary, we were positive 80 basis points in the second quarter, and that marks overall a positive pricing first half for the company. I think it's probably the first since I've been here. The way that breaks down is, we saw really strong performance in EMEA, APAC was about flat to slightly up in the second quarter, and the U.S. -- the U.S. was down year-over-year on pricing. But overall, a very good quarter. That's a combination of a number of variables. One, a more favorable environment; two, we're getting greater discipline in analytics and governance around pricing and a better culture, I would say, around pricing; and the third is, we saw some onetime benefits, especially in EMEA, that helped drive that positive performance in price for the second quarter. Our outlook for the full year on price, originally, I started out the year saying that we thought we'd be about 100 basis points. I would say now we're going to be somewhere flat for the full year to potentially down 50 basis points. And the reason why that flip is in the second half is because some of those onetime benefits that we saw in EMEA in the second quarter, we don't expect to repeat at the same level or intensity in the second half. So that's a little bit about price. Definitely seeing much better improvement in performance this year. And we think a large part of that is going to run into 2025, because a large part of our business is contracted. So, again, we'll give more color on '25 when we get to that point, but really happy about the trend that we've got going here on pricing in 2024. Relative to manufacturing costs, yes, manufacturing costs are higher this year, again, because of the capitalization for 2023. I'm not going to give specific guidance into '25, but rather, I'll refer back to our LRP in our Investor Day, where we talked about operational stability in gross margin over the LRP. That, in fact, implies that we should start to see operational stability in manufacturing costs through that LRP. But again, as we continue to progress through '24 and into '25, we'll provide more color on that. All right. I feel good about the progress -\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you, both.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes, I feel good about the progress the team's making on manufacturing costs. And I will say, we're finally starting to see some stabilization in overall inflation, both on raw materials, as well as third-party manufacturing costs. So, glad to see that inflection.\nRyan Zimmerman: Thank you.\nZach Weiner: Thanks, Ryan. Katie, could we have the next question?\nOperator: We'll go next to Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two for me. First, the -- outside the U.S., hip and knee came in pretty strong today, even when factoring in the currency headwind versus consensus. So, maybe you could speak to the trends you're seeing there? Is it different Europe versus Asia Pac? And did you see the same headwinds that you saw in the U.S. with vacation days or supply constraints there?\nIvan Tornos: Yes, I'll take that, Robbie. Good talking to you here. So the volumes outside the U.S. remain very strong, in particular in Europe, and within Europe, in the U.K., where we know there is a prominent backlog. So, market dynamics are very healthy, more in EMEA than APAC, but very healthy overall. One of the biggest drivers of growth outside of the U.S. is robotics. I mentioned that earlier in my answer to Ryan, I believe. We continue to see fast adoption of ROSA in key markets outside of the U.S. We are the number one platform in Asia Pacific. We continue to drive adoption in key countries like Japan, as well as Australia and New Zealand. We have accelerated Persona growth, moving from NexGen to Persona in these key geographies. So, it's a combination of market dynamics and great commercial execution. That's the answer there.\nIvan Tornos: Great. Maybe on -\nZach Weiner: Thanks, Robbie. Katie, can we have the next question? Go ahead, Robbie. Sorry.\nRobbie Marcus: Do I get a follow-up?\nIvan Tornos: I'm sorry. Robbie, sorry. As I say, the U.S. dynamics that I mentioned are relative to the U.S. You mentioned surgeons being out of the territory. That is very, very focused in one month, in one quarter within the U.S. So, this is not a dynamic that we saw outside of the U.S. Wanted to answer your second question.\nRobbie Marcus: Great.\nZach Weiner: Go ahead with your follow-up.\nRobbie Marcus: Maybe on S.E.T., you talked about all of the segments grew. Maybe could you just give us a little color into each of the segments there, how they grew and sort of the trends you saw? Thanks a lot.\nSuky Upadhyay: Yes.\nIvan Tornos: Yes. Thanks, Robbie. I won't get into a lot of detail here. What I will tell you is that the growth drivers, those being CMFT, sports, and shoulder, are growing either upper-single digit or double digit. And the other three, foot and ankle, trauma, and restorative therapies, are growing at different levels, but all of them growing. So the challenge we've had with RT reimbursement-wise, that's behind. So, great to see all six businesses within S.E.T. performing.\nZach Weiner: Thanks, Robbie. Katie, could we have the next question?\nRobbie Marcus: Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Jayson Bedford with Raymond James.\nJayson Bedford: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first, I appreciate you don't guide by segment, but maybe within your 5% to 6% organic revenue growth guide, has your internal thinking changed with respect to growth in the different segments?\nIvan Tornos: Can you repeat the question?\nJayson Bedford: Yes. So I'm just wondering, relative to the beginning of the year, your 5% to 6% topline growth hasn't changed. But I'm just wondering, has the -- your view on segment growth changed at all? Meaning, is S.E.T. now a bigger contributor than you thought at the beginning of the year, et cetera.\nIvan Tornos: No, no. We continue to S.E.T. and Recon performing the way that we anticipated early in the year. So again, some timing in Q2 with U.S. Recon. But as we get into the second half, the expectation remains the same, is no one bigger than the other.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. Fair enough. And just as a quick follow-up, Ivan, international was strong. You talked earlier about -- you stressed geographic diversification. I was a little unclear, are you entering new markets? Are you allocating more resources to certain geographies? Just if you could expand on the stressing of geographic diversification?\nIvan Tornos: Yes, thank you. I would call it a more focused strategy. 15 countries today account for 93%, 95% of the overall market potential. In the past, we've been candidly all over the place. In the last two years, call it, we refocused the strategy to those key markets that matter the most. And I won't go through every one of those countries, but it is 15 countries. So OpEx and CapEx is being reallocated to those geographies. Our commercial infrastructure has been modified in those countries and the way that we focus in those countries is different. So that's what we're doing outside of the U.S.\nZach Weiner: Thanks, Jayson. Katie, can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go next to Josh Jennings with TD Cowen.\nJosh Jennings: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. A multi-part on the hip franchise and the recovery here. I may have missed some of this in your answers and prepared remarks, but just wanted to focus in on ROSA Hip. Just can you help us think through where robotic assistance penetration is for total hips? Do you think Zimmer's ROSA Hip platform is holding its own? Are you maintaining share in that channel? And then is this worth a good acquisition? Could you integrate that technology into the ROSA Hip application down the line?\nIvan Tornos: All right.\nJosh Jennings: Thanks for taking the questions.\nIvan Tornos: Sure. So I'll start with the question on whether ROSA Hip is performing. The penetration is double digit. It continues to meet the expectations that we had. We believe that we need to have a ROSA posterior application to gain market share outside the U.S., and that development is in motion. And we also believe that to a certain segment of customers here in the U.S. that want a less expensive, faster, lighter application, surgical AI by OrthoGrid is going to be a good modality. But so far, our expectations have been met with ROSA Hip and navigation in general.\nJosh Jennings: Thanks a lot.\nZach Weiner: Thanks, Josh. And thanks, everyone, for the questions this morning. I'll turn it over to Ivan for some closing remarks.\nIvan Tornos: Well, I'd like to close the way that I started with, gratitude. I'm very thankful to all the Zimmer Biomet team members for the progress. As I alluded to earlier in the call, this is the 10th quarter in a row where we're growing mid-single digit or above. We're pleased with the quarter, delivering close to 5-point - or actually 5.6% ex FX revenue, with double-digit EPS. We've proven that we can make commitments and deliver on those commitments. I like the fact that we have a diversified portfolio. We don't depend on one segment in one country. It's a well-diversified sustainable performance. And what we'll tell you is that we are more confident than ever that we will deliver in the guidance that we reaffirmed today. So, thanks to everyone for joining the call, and I look forward to the next update.\nOperator: Thank you again for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Suky Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, Q2 closed a solid first half of the year for Zimmer Biomet, with ex FX revenue growth of 5% in the first half and operating margins well ahead of the prior year. Our results through the quarter provide increased confidence in our 2024 full year guidance, which includes 5% to 6% constant currency revenue growth and $8.00 to $8.15 in adjusted earnings per share. I'll provide more color on guidance shortly. Moving to the second quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the second quarter of 2024 and how it compares to the same period in 2023, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.942 billion, an increase of 3.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 5.6% excluding the impact of foreign currency. As a reminder, we had a day rate tailwind that impacted all businesses and regions at about the same level. Pricing at a consolidated level was 80 basis points, driven by gains in international that were partially offset by modest declines in the U.S. Our U.S. business grew 3.5% and international grew 8.5%. Growth in the U.S. was driven by our S.E.T. and other categories. As a reminder, our other category includes our surgical business, as well as enabling technologies such as ROSA capital sales. Our international business continues to perform well, driven by knee and S.E.T., with continued strength in emerging markets. Global knees grew 5.5% in the quarter, with U.S. growing 0.8% and international growing 11.5%. U.S. growth was impacted by softer sales in the first part of the quarter, with improvement in utilization and growth as we move through the second half. We continue to see strong uptake of Persona OsseoTi and remain optimistic that the recent robust ROSA installs will continue to drive pull-through and share of wallet opportunities. International continues to benefit from ROSA Robotics, as well as our Persona family of implants. Global hips grew 2.8% in the quarter, with the U.S. growing 1.8% and international growing 3.7%. While our hip business has lagged the broader market due to key portfolio gaps, we have made significant progress with new product introductions and are excited to get back on the offensive in early 2025 when these products and technologies are fully in market. Next, the S.E.T. category grew 7.3%, led by our key focus areas of CMFT, upper extremities, and sports, growing on average high-single digits. All other categories grew mid-single digits on average, giving us confidence in our ability to drive mid-single digit growth or better from S.E.T. through the second half of the year. Finally, our other category grew 11.3% in the quarter and continues to be driven by strong demand for ROSA systems and other enabling technologies. Turning to our P&L. We reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.18 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 in the prior year. Higher revenue combined with lower R&D, effective tax rate, and share count more than offset expenses associated with our restructuring program. On an adjusted basis, we delivered diluted earnings per share of $2.01 compared to $1.82 in the prior year, representing over 10% growth. The step-up was primarily driven by revenue growth, improved operating margins due to savings pull-through from our restructuring program, and a lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate. Adjusted gross margin was 71.6%, about 40 basis points lower than the prior year, driven by higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by better pricing and lower royalties. Adjusted operating margin was 28.5%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. The increase in operating margin was driven by higher revenue and lower OpEx as a percentage of sales as a result of our restructuring program. Net interest and other adjusted non-operating expenses were $45 million in the quarter, and our adjusted tax rate was 18.2%. Turning to cash and liquidity. We generated operating cash flows of $369 million, free cash flow of $251 million, and we ended the quarter with $420 million of cash and cash equivalents. Aligned with our capital allocation strategies, we repurchased $95 million of shares in the second quarter. Regarding our outlook for the rest of the year, we are reiterating our full year constant currency revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6%, but given further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are updating our reported revenue growth to 4% to 5% and now expect 100 basis points of currency headwind for the full year, which should impact Q3 more than Q4. We still expect to generate between $8.00 and $8.15 in adjusted earnings per share despite this greater FX pressure and $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Our tax and interest and non-operating expenses expectations remain unchanged. When thinking about the cadence through the second half of the year, due to normal seasonality, Q3 typically is the lowest revenue quarter from a dollar perspective, with Q4 being the highest. From a margin standpoint, we still expect gross margin to step down sequentially as the year progresses, while operating margins should expand by more than 50 basis points year-over-year. As usual, we expect operating margin to be higher in Q4 than Q3, driven by higher revenue. In summary, Q2 closed a positive first half of the year, giving us continued confidence in our ability to meet our full year outlook and another positive proof point through our LRP. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Zach. Yes. First of all, good morning, David. Thanks for the question. Just to remind everyone, we talked about or announced our restructuring program at the early part of this year. We talked about $200 million of run rate savings as we exit 2025. I would say where we are right now is we're slightly ahead of that overall trend, at least from a timing perspective, still expect to generate $200 million on a run rate, but it's happening probably a little bit faster than we originally expected. That's definitely contributing to operating margin expansion. You see that in the second quarter, where we're up 100 basis points year-over-year. So, very nice progress there. And that's in the backdrop of continuing to invest in R&D, as well as in certain areas across commercial, whether that's building specialized sales forces across S.E.T., additional complement in our technology, components of Recon and other parts of commercial. So we are, as I would say, just summarizing, going a little bit faster than expected on the savings program, and we're in line and on track with that reinvestment plan. Yes. First of all, good morning, Drew. Thanks for the question. There are really three building blocks to the growth in free cash flow from where we start here in the second quarter -- or third quarter, I should say. And by the way, the asymmetry between first half and second half of free cash flow is typical in our business. The three building blocks are, really, you have a lot of headwinds in the first half of the year related to rebates from the previous year fourth quarter that you have to pay in the first quarter, bonuses and different levels of incentive payments that happened in the first half. So there are certain headwinds that typically happen in the first half that don't repeat in the second half. In addition, in the second half, you're going to have improved EBITDA through growth as you pointed out. But secondly, a pretty meaningful improvement in working capital, specifically around inventory. We've already seen that inventory improve from second quarter versus first quarter, and we're going to continue to see that sequentially improve in the third quarter, fourth quarter as well. So that's a pretty big driver of the overall free cash flow generation and step-up into the second half of the year. Relative to where we're prioritizing, we continue to prioritize in making sure that we've got the right assets and the right level of investment on our organic business. As Ivan talked about, we're actually stepping up our instrument CapEx around OsseoTi. Demand, quite frankly, has outstripped our original expectations and -- which is a great thing, and we're now catching up on getting those sets out into market. And so, we feel really good about that and we're actually putting more dollars against that. But outside of that, I think what you're seeing also is that we bought some shares back in the second quarter, aligned to our overall capital allocation strategy, which we outlined on our Investor Day. So, overall, feel good about where we're headed for cash for the full year. You will see a second half step-up, typical in every year, and we're going to continue to prioritize our organic investments. And then from there, our capital allocation remains balanced between M&A and return of capital to shareholders. Hi, Joanne, good to talk to you. Good morning. I think I said over the next four quarters to eight quarters, but if it is three, let's keep it to four. We're not going to get into a lot of details, given competitive reasons. But what we are committed to launch is a posterior application for some of the OUS markets, where posterior is more prevalent than interior. As you know, we're going to get into full launch mode for ROSA Shoulder later in the year. And again, so far, the voice of customer has been super. We want to get at some point a different version of ROSA. We're launching two different ROSAs for knees. One is going to be late this year, early 2025. We call it ROSA [B15], which has different levels of workflows, smart positioning, it's got a different auto-balance procedure, and it will be a platform that is going to deliver a kinematic aligned type of knee. In 2025, at some point, we will have a ROSA CT scan base for some of our ROSA users that like that type of device. So those are four or five examples of what's coming here again over the next four quarters to eight quarters. In addition to ROSA, we have the partnership with THINK Surgical. And we got, as I just mentioned, very comprehensive navigation systems. In terms of the revenue contribution, we don't really give details on that. What I will tell you is that we're growing today, end of Q2 double digit in the U.S., when it comes to enabling technologies, we grew double digit in Q1 and we don't expect that to slow down, and that's pull-through for implants. Yes. Good morning, Larry. On your questions on gross margin, I think, actually, you largely got it right, but let me just step back and go through it for you. Just year-over-year overall, we expect gross margins to be in line with '23, but potentially slightly down. That's the new element there and that's largely driven by the mix of our business. We're just seeing much stronger international sales, which have a lower gross margin than the U.S. So, it's really mix related. But again, in line to potentially slightly down. In the second quarter, you're right, it was a little bit lighter than our expectation, again, back to that mix component where the U.S. was just much stronger from a growth perspective than the U.S. for all the reasons that Ivan spoke about. Even in the backdrop of that, Larry, we still managed to expand operating margin by 100 basis points and grow earnings quite nicely. On the cadence, you got it right, and it's consistent with everything that we provided earlier this year, which is to say gross margin will step down sequentially in the second half versus the first half. And you should see that also Q2 to Q3, Q3 to Q4 sequentially down. The primary driver of that, again, going back to our earlier comments from this year, are really around the inflationary pressure we saw in third-party manufacturing costs in 2023. That got capitalized and are now feathering into the P&L throughout this year. So that's the driver of the cadence there. But again, I'll just revert you back to the backdrop of all that is we do still expect to see operating -- meaningful operating margin expansion for the full year and we do expect to see operating margin in the second half step up versus the first half, again, driven by the restructuring program despite the sequential lowering of gross margin. So I'm sorry for all the detail there, but I wanted to get it all out in sort of one compact commentary. Hi, Ryan, Suky. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me start with price and then I'll go to your question on manufacturing costs. So price, as I noted in my earlier commentary, we were positive 80 basis points in the second quarter, and that marks overall a positive pricing first half for the company. I think it's probably the first since I've been here. The way that breaks down is, we saw really strong performance in EMEA, APAC was about flat to slightly up in the second quarter, and the U.S. -- the U.S. was down year-over-year on pricing. But overall, a very good quarter. That's a combination of a number of variables. One, a more favorable environment; two, we're getting greater discipline in analytics and governance around pricing and a better culture, I would say, around pricing; and the third is, we saw some onetime benefits, especially in EMEA, that helped drive that positive performance in price for the second quarter. Our outlook for the full year on price, originally, I started out the year saying that we thought we'd be about 100 basis points. I would say now we're going to be somewhere flat for the full year to potentially down 50 basis points. And the reason why that flip is in the second half is because some of those onetime benefits that we saw in EMEA in the second quarter, we don't expect to repeat at the same level or intensity in the second half. So that's a little bit about price. Definitely seeing much better improvement in performance this year. And we think a large part of that is going to run into 2025, because a large part of our business is contracted. So, again, we'll give more color on '25 when we get to that point, but really happy about the trend that we've got going here on pricing in 2024. Relative to manufacturing costs, yes, manufacturing costs are higher this year, again, because of the capitalization for 2023. I'm not going to give specific guidance into '25, but rather, I'll refer back to our LRP in our Investor Day, where we talked about operational stability in gross margin over the LRP. That, in fact, implies that we should start to see operational stability in manufacturing costs through that LRP. But again, as we continue to progress through '24 and into '25, we'll provide more color on that. All right. I feel good about the progress - Yes, I feel good about the progress the team's making on manufacturing costs. And I will say, we're finally starting to see some stabilization in overall inflation, both on raw materials, as well as third-party manufacturing costs. So, glad to see that inflection. Yes."

            "name": "Ivan Tornos",
            "content": "Thank you, Zach. Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. Good morning. I would like to start the way that I usually do, by taking a quick moment to show my sincere gratitude to the north of 18,000 Zimmer Biomet team members across the world, who each and every day go above and beyond in delivering on our mission, elevating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. That's what you and I get to do each and every day, and you're doing an unreal job in bringing this mission into action. Thank you for your commitment to Zimmer Biomet, thank you for your tireless work, and thank you for the very strong performance so far in this year 2024. We are now past the midpoint in the year and we're growing 5% after having delivered strong performances in 2023, 2022, and 2021. So the trend is real, the performance is there, and I'm deeply proud of the work that you're doing daily. As I've said countless times, the Zimmer Biomet workforce and our culture here is truly one of our key competitive advantages. In today's call, I'm going to give some opening remarks and then Suky will cover financials. And then, as always, we will leave ample time to answer your questions. The agenda for today, first, I'll cover some perspective on the quarter. Secondly, I'll discuss the drivers of our performance and why we are even more confident than ever in our updated full year guidance for 2024 and why, already looking into 2025 and beyond, we're also very confident that we'll continue to deliver on the long-range plan commitments that we outlined at the end of May at our first ever Zimmer Biomet Investor Day. Recall, those commitments were driving revenue growth at least at mid-single digit growth rates, driving EPS at 1.5 revenue growth, and driving free cash flow growth at least 100 basis points above our EPS commitments. The third thing in the agenda, we'll close with our strategic priorities, those being people and culture, operational excellence, and innovation and diversification. Starting with our Q2 results, we continue to be very encouraged by our global performance. In the second quarter of this year 2024, we grew 5.6% on a constant currency basis. And with that, we have now closed the first half of 2024, growing 5%. Worth noting that this 5% is versus very tough comps in the first half of 2023. The second quarter of 2024 now marks the 10th consecutive quarter in which Zimmer Biomet has grown mid-single digit or above. So, again, a trend in the making that is real, and we're very confident that this performance will continue, if not will accelerate as we continue to move our business forward. Against the backdrop, in the quarter, we did see some weakness early in the first half of the quarter in the U.S. It's worth noting that May and June here in the U.S. were better than April. And in July, the U.S. Recon business actually delivered mid-single digit growth. So, choppiness through the first half of the quarter and then an improvement through the second half, which has continued with very strong performance through the month of July. Our OUS international business, outside the U.S. business, has delivered above expectations. We saw a strong demand in the key markets across both Recon and the S.E.T. categories. So, overall, very diversified, solid performance coming out of these markets. I love the fact that in Q2, in our second quarter, we continued to deliver excellent performance in our other category. This category is primarily focused on enabling technologies, primarily ROSA. We saw a strong demand for ROSA, growing double digit in that business and we also saw strong demand in enabling technologies and navigation systems. As we have been saying for quite some time, we want to be more than just a leading reconstructive knees and hips company in key geographies, where we have a really high market share, as an example, the U.S. or key countries of Europe and Asia Pacific. One example of this diversification journey has been S.E.T. We've been committing to growing S.E.T. at least mid-single digit and Q2 of 2024 is now the third quarter in a row in where we are growing mid-single digit or above, a trend that we expect to continue towards the end of 2024 and moving into 2025 and 2026. So, nice growth in other, nice growth in international, and nice growth in S.E.T. One area that I'll tell you we've made significant strides is within our hips portfolio. We did lose some market share in hips in the U.S. and OUS markets over the last three years to five years. And as I said over and over, this was due to lacking three key product items, direct anterior stems -- what we call triple taper stems, elegant navigation, and surgical impactors. As we sit here today, we have remediated those gaps. We have 510(k) approval for Z1 or triple taper stem. We are regaining market share already with HAMMR, or surgical impactor. And today, we have the most comprehensive navigation in hip arthroplasty. Not only do we have ROSA Hip, we also have the only 510(K) FDA-cleared augmented/mixed reality hip navigation platform via a partnership with our colleagues at Hip Insights. And now, we have also signed and announced an agreement to acquire OrthoGrid that is going to give us a leading position in navigation using artificial intelligence devices. So we have the most comprehensive suite of solutions in navigation, in direct anterior stems, and in surgical impactors, not to mention having the best core implant technology with products like G7 and Avenir Complete. So the expectation is to grow again above market when it comes to hips and regain some of the market share that we lost over the last three years or five years. Moving from hips, we have developed and we are today the first and only robotic-assisted shoulder replacement platform in the world. The feedback on the cases we've done with ROSA Shoulder continues to be very compelling, and as we enter late Q3 and early Q4, we expect to see an acceleration of those cases. And in 2025, we expect ROSA Shoulder to be a very meaningful growth driver for Zimmer Biomet. We recently announced the partnership with THINK Surgical. This is going to provide our surgeon customers optionality across the robotic landscape. We have conducted extensive training, with one voice on customer, and the feedback on this partnership with THINK remains super. With this partnership, Zimmer Biomet is the only orthopedic company in the world that will offer both a handheld CT scan-based system in the TMINI, exclusive for Zimmer Biomet platform, as well as a simplified, CT scan-less robotic system in our current form factor of ROSA for total knee arthroplasty. We're excited about the optionality and we're also excited about the fact that we continue to innovate at a very fast pace when it comes to ROSA and we're expecting to launch at least three new ROSA modalities in the next three quarters to eight quarters. From an earnings standpoint, we generated $2.01 of adjusted earnings per share in the quarter or a growth of 10%. This is in line with our long-range plan targets I outlined at our Investor Day in May. Inside of the strong performance through the first half of the year, the team continues to execute on the three strategic priorities that I keep outlining in each and every earnings call and at every Zimmer Biomet meeting around the world. The three priorities of people and culture, foundational to everything that we do; operational excellence; and innovation and diversification. As I said in my opening, people and culture continues to be a key competitive advantage for Zimmer Biomet. I'm proud to share that Zimmer Biomet was recently named one of America's Best Midsize Companies to work for by TIME magazine. This reflects the strength in team member satisfaction and engagement, our revenue growth profile, and the turnaround of the organization now behind us. On the second imperative, operational excellence, we continue to expect to grow constant currency revenue at least at mid-single digit level, with adjusted earnings per share growing at least 1.5 times revenue, and free cash flow growing at least 100 basis points faster than earnings. It's a commitment that we're making not just for 2024, but also for the long-range plan 2025, 2026, and beyond. This is a mindset that continues to proliferate throughout the organization. We pay people on delivering towards such commitments. We have trained people to deliver on those commitments and the trend, as I've repeated a few times in my opening remarks, is in the making. In the past, when it comes to innovation and diversification, it's been very much portfolio-centric, moving from lower-growth markets to higher-growth markets, point in case, the super performance in S.E.T. But today, we're also thinking diversification from a geographic mix standpoint. We want to continue to invest in key markets outside of the U.S. where we see an opportunity to deliver sustainable revenue and profit growth. We're encouraged by the sound performance that we've seen in our OUS business and we expect to continue to accelerate growth in these markets without compromising our margin performance. In conclusion, we are very proud of how far we have come as an organization in terms of the financial progress, the innovation progress, and the commercial execution. Our second quarter results are another proof point that we make commitments and deliver on those commitments, and we fully expect that the trend is going to continue for the balance of the year and beyond. We're confident in our guidance for the year and we love the fact that we're impacting the lives of millions of people, and I'm deeply inspired every day in knowing that my teammates and I are living the Zimmer Biomet mission of alleviating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. With that, I'll turn the call over to Suky. Thank you. Thank you, David. Good morning. Maybe quickly here, 20 seconds big picture, and then I'll talk about the U.S. So, big picture. It was a good quarter. We here at Zimmer Biomet deliver 5.6% ex-FX. As I noted in my prepared remarks, this is the 10th quarter in a row growing mid-single digit or above. And we're pleased with the double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. S.E.T. performed above expectations, third quarter mid-single digit or above. I'm pleased to report that for the first time in a while, every single business within S.E.T. -- and there are six of them, actually grew, which is something we didn't see before. Enabling technologies, which is robotics primarily, grew double digit in Q2. It grew double digit in Q1. The U.S. grew -- robotics grew 16% in the quarter, so strong in that regard. And as we announced this morning, we did close the gaps in hips that we had, which frankly is one of the reasons why we lost market share. Just throwing the summary to highlight the fact that unlike five years ago, we're not just a U.S. knee-centric type of company. That said, relative to knees and the U.S. performance, look, David, not pleased with the quarter. It was softer than expected. And what I will tell you is that there are three main reasons why we did not do better in the U.S., and these are solvable reasons. The first one is, we had a large amount of high volume surgeons -- Zimmer Biomet high volume surgeons that were out of the territory for a variety of reasons. We hosted large medical education events and we did have a large group of surgeons that were not performing surgeries in the quarter. The second piece is that we had some challenges from a supply standpoint when it came to one of our knee platforms, what we call limb salvage, which is part of knee revision cases. These are high ASP cases. And candidly, this didn't help the quarter. And then the third reason on why knees in the U.S. was softer than expected is comps. We delivered knee growth of 10% -- almost 10%, 9.8% to be exact in Q2 of 2023, which was close to mid-single digit, and the U.S. grew 5%. So, comps didn't help. So, in the background of those surgeons being out, supply constraints, the comps didn't help out. What I will tell you is that these three elements have gotten resolved as we move out of the quarter and sitting here, July behind us, the U.S. Recon performance is very strong. On the second part of your question, David, cementless continues to track very nicely. Candidly, I hope we can get more sets out. The adoption rate is very high. We are converting accounts and we hope to have cementless not just in the U.S., but outside of the U.S. very soon. So that's the summary of what's happening here in the U.S. Thank you, Matt. The short answer was we have already started. So again, July, so far so good when it comes to hip recovery. We launched our surgical impactor HAMMR midpoint into Q2 and the adoption has been great so far. As you heard from us, we will be launching our triple taper stem, that's Z1, which is going to enable share regaining in direct anterior. That's going to get launched late in Q3, early Q4. We have the quantity that we need. We got the commercial plans in place. So, that should be another driver. And the third leg was to have elegant navigation systems, and we got three of them. This morning, we announced the acquisition of OrthoGrid. That should close later in the year. It's one of the fastest growing navigation platforms in the U.S. So I would say the combination of triple taper stems, surgical impactors, and three different modalities of navigation put us in a position to regain market share in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we're going to be launching a second generation of robotics, hip posterior robotics, and that's another driver of share regaining. So we're very confident about where we are today and we will get the share back. The market is very strong. By now, all of us have reported. So you see that the market growth rates remain above pre-pandemic levels. So, nothing relative to market. And again, I just want to emphasize that the two, three things that I talked about, the large volume surgeons being out of the territory, we saw in July a recovery. On the revision constraints, those are largely soft, and again, that's one portion of our platform. And again, so far so good. So yes, market is healthy. Thank you, Drew. Very excited. So this one word is optionality. Now, Zimmer Biomet is the only company in the world with three different forms of navigation. With ROSA Hip, you got anterior today, robotic navigation, at some point soon posterior as well. With OrthoGrid, we have AI surgical guidance. It's a lighter, faster option for some of the surgeons that want to use a non-robotic option. And then the third vector here, as you know, we have a partnership with Hip Insights, which is the only FDA-approved mixed/reality navigation, and that pretty much gives the surgeon X-ray vision over the patient's anatomy, instruments, and implants. So, again, a different modality, which some customers seem to like. So we got three different ways to do navigation and that appeals to pretty much every customer in that regard. We -- the broader strategy, we want to be a company that delivers faster, better solutions, and navigation is an enabler of that. And again, in the big picture, this will enable Zimmer Biomet to regain some of those 200 basis points to 300 basis points of market share that we lost over the years. Thank you, Joanne. Hi, thank you, Larry. First part of your question on Persona IQ, we remain excited. The adoption is speeding up. We should see some acceleration in the second half of 2024, part of the new product contribution for 2024 and in a more meaningful way in 2025. We've now crossed 3 billion data points around range of motion, mobility and what not. We launched what we call Recovery Curves, which enables the opportunity for us to cross-reference how certain patients are performing versus others. We're going to be having a data discussion with payers so that we can engage in some risk-sharing type of agreements. So, again, leveraging the data. On the stubby part of your question, we're going to be launching that at the -- full launch at the end of 2024. So we got the approval. The design is ready to go, the sets are ready to go. And again, that's part of the acceleration in the second half of 2024, more meaningfully in 2025. We've now signed agreements, partnerships with some of the major hospitals around the U.S. And then in terms of TPT, we did look at it. We engaged a third-party consultant. We pulled the TPT application, because it didn't make economic sense. It didn't make as much economic sense as we thought. And again, we believe there are different, better ways to monetize the technology. We still have NTAP, but TPT didn't make sense. Hi, thank you, Ryan. Look, TMINI is not going to replace ROSA just like OrthoGrid is not going to replace ROSA. It's all about having breadth of portfolio. TMINI offers CT scanning, which some surgeons like and TMINI is the only handheld robotic platform in the world, which is something that, in an ASC environment, surgeons seem to like. What I will tell you is that we are deeply committed to ROSA, point in case, all these new platforms and indications we're going to be launching over the next four quarters to eight quarters, point in case, the commitments we made at the Investor Day of doubling our penetration from somewhere in the 20% of all U.S. knees done robotic with ROSA to 40% in the next three years. ROSA continues to be one of the fastest growing platforms here at Zimmer Biomet. We grew again in the U.S. or capital sales for ROSA 16% in Q2. Overall, it was double digit globally. ROSA today is already outside of the U.S., the leading robot platform, number one in Asia Pacific, fast growing in EMEA. And I think we're very pleased with where we are with ROSA, but we know we need to have optionality and we like our chances when it comes to that. In terms of the revenue contribution of robotics, is one of the most meaningful ones. And as we the double penetration, you should assume that our knee and hip number and shoulder later in the year is going to continue to grow. Yes, I'll take that, Robbie. Good talking to you here. So the volumes outside the U.S. remain very strong, in particular in Europe, and within Europe, in the U.K., where we know there is a prominent backlog. So, market dynamics are very healthy, more in EMEA than APAC, but very healthy overall. One of the biggest drivers of growth outside of the U.S. is robotics. I mentioned that earlier in my answer to Ryan, I believe. We continue to see fast adoption of ROSA in key markets outside of the U.S. We are the number one platform in Asia Pacific. We continue to drive adoption in key countries like Japan, as well as Australia and New Zealand. We have accelerated Persona growth, moving from NexGen to Persona in these key geographies. So, it's a combination of market dynamics and great commercial execution. That's the answer there. Great. Maybe on - I'm sorry. Robbie, sorry. As I say, the U.S. dynamics that I mentioned are relative to the U.S. You mentioned surgeons being out of the territory. That is very, very focused in one month, in one quarter within the U.S. So, this is not a dynamic that we saw outside of the U.S. Wanted to answer your second question. Yes. Thanks, Robbie. I won't get into a lot of detail here. What I will tell you is that the growth drivers, those being CMFT, sports, and shoulder, are growing either upper-single digit or double digit. And the other three, foot and ankle, trauma, and restorative therapies, are growing at different levels, but all of them growing. So the challenge we've had with RT reimbursement-wise, that's behind. So, great to see all six businesses within S.E.T. performing. Can you repeat the question? No, no. We continue to S.E.T. and Recon performing the way that we anticipated early in the year. So again, some timing in Q2 with U.S. Recon. But as we get into the second half, the expectation remains the same, is no one bigger than the other. Yes, thank you. I would call it a more focused strategy. 15 countries today account for 93%, 95% of the overall market potential. In the past, we've been candidly all over the place. In the last two years, call it, we refocused the strategy to those key markets that matter the most. And I won't go through every one of those countries, but it is 15 countries. So OpEx and CapEx is being reallocated to those geographies. Our commercial infrastructure has been modified in those countries and the way that we focus in those countries is different. So that's what we're doing outside of the U.S. All right. Sure. So I'll start with the question on whether ROSA Hip is performing. The penetration is double digit. It continues to meet the expectations that we had. We believe that we need to have a ROSA posterior application to gain market share outside the U.S., and that development is in motion. And we also believe that to a certain segment of customers here in the U.S. that want a less expensive, faster, lighter application, surgical AI by OrthoGrid is going to be a good modality. But so far, our expectations have been met with ROSA Hip and navigation in general. Well, I'd like to close the way that I started with, gratitude. I'm very thankful to all the Zimmer Biomet team members for the progress. As I alluded to earlier in the call, this is the 10th quarter in a row where we're growing mid-single digit or above. We're pleased with the quarter, delivering close to 5-point - or actually 5.6% ex FX revenue, with double-digit EPS. We've proven that we can make commitments and deliver on those commitments. I like the fact that we have a diversified portfolio. We don't depend on one segment in one country. It's a well-diversified sustainable performance. And what we'll tell you is that we are more confident than ever that we will deliver in the guidance that we reaffirmed today. So, thanks to everyone for joining the call, and I look forward to the next update."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, May 2, 2024. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Keri Mattox, Chief Communications and Administration Officer. Please go ahead. \nKeri Mattox: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Zimmer Biomet's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Ivan Tornos, our President and CEO; and CFO and EVP Finance, Operations and Supply Chain, Suky Upadhyay. \n Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our comments during this call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Please note, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements even if the actual results or future expectations change materially. Please refer to our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties in addition to the inherent limitations of such forward-looking statements. \n Additionally, the discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which are forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of our basis for calculating these measures is included within our Q1 earnings release which can be found on our website, zimmerbiomet.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ivan. Ivan? \nIvan Tornos: Thank you, Keri, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call here this morning. I'd like to start today the way that I typically do by taking a moment to recognize and to show my gratitude to the 18,000 Zimmer Biomet team members across the globe, who each and every day work relentlessly in driving our mission forward. Simply put them, I'm very proud of each and every one of you. Thank you for your dedication, for your commitment, resilience and for your strong performance to start off this year 2024. \n It is truly this great workforce and the culture that we have here in place at Zimmer Biomet that gives me -- gives us confidence behind the financial commitments that we're making. Given the fact that we have a very robust Investor Day coming up in just a few weeks, I will keep my opening remarks short with the goal of moving quickly into today's Q&A session. I'll touch on 3 key areas briefly. \n First, I'm going to provide some general comments on the results in the quarter versus our own expectations. Secondly, I'll cover the drivers of the performance, and we'll touch on why we believe that these drivers are sustainable. And then lastly, I'll close with a brief summary on our progress against our 3 strategic priorities, which have been discussing since day 1, those being people and culture, operational excellence and diversification innovation. \n Starting with the quarterly results. Overall, we are very encouraged with our Q1 performance which was ahead of our own expectations, driven by healthy end markets, combined with the strong execution across the organization globally. We ended the quarter continuing the momentum that we saw in 2023, delivering 4.4% constant currency revenue growth, while overstepping a sizable day rate headwind and facing rather difficult comps versus a year ago. \n In fact, it is reassuring to see that on a day rate adjusted basis, our growth for the quarter was greater than 6% with several areas of the business and geographies contributing to such solid results. In addition to the sound revenue performance, we drove adjusted margin expansion and grew adjusted earnings even while our effective tax rate increased over 200 basis points. These results to start 2024 and give us great confidence that Zimmer Biomet will deliver 5% to 6% constant currency revenue growth in the year while driving sizable adjusted operating margin expansion. So pleased to reaffirm our guidance for the year. \n This, in turn, will enable mid- to high single-digit adjusted earnings growth while realizing our commitment of seeing free cash flow growing faster than earnings. Suky is going to provide more color around these areas later, but a strong performance in the quarter. And again, reaffirming guidance for the year. Net-net, it's encouraging to see us exiting Q1 of 2024 with a revenue growth run rate in the mid-single-digit range, which is consistent with where we exited the second half of 2023. \n With new products -- new product introduction ramping later in the year, we like what we see in terms of sustainability in our growth trajectory which we have said all along will accelerate in the second half of 2024. Key drivers behind our Q1 results came from both a macro and micro standpoint, starting with macro factors or end markets, as we've been saying all along, remain very healthy, driven by high levels of patient demand due to demographic shifts. \n The continued shift today we see here in the U.S. is also a tailwind and across the board in the industry, we've seen better surgical outcomes and technological advancements, which are driving more pace in demand. On top of that, you've got to improve pricing dynamics. And to that end, pleased to report that pricing in the quarter was about flat as opposed to the 200 to 300 basis points of price erosion that this space, this industry has seen historically. \n From a macro standpoint, the main enablers of our Q1 results were the adoption of ROSA technology globally, with a correlated pull-through of Persona Knee. We also saw some execution of growth drivers within S.E.T., particularly in shoulders, within sports medicine and in our CMFT, craniomaxillofacial thoracic business in conjunction with rapid adoption of Persona OsseoTi, that is our cementless platform, which is quickly gaining share in the markets where we have launched the product. \n As we enter the second half of 2024, these new product introductions as well as other new product entries will become more meaningful from a revenue growth standpoint with Persona OsseoTi entering then a full launch status, seeing higher realization of HAMMR or surgical Impactor, which we recently launched and also gaining traction with ROSA Shoulder, which we started doing cases recently here in the U.S. \n On top of that, we're going to be entering the market with our triple-taper hip stem, that's Z1, which is going to allow us to better compete in the direct anterior hip category. So really excited about the completed portfolio in hips and the upcoming launch, FDA approved now for Z1 hip stem. \n In addition to driving successful 2024 annual results, we are committed to the 3 strategic priorities that I outlined in my first earnings call as the CEO in November 2023. This, no doubt, will enable long-term success for the organization. I continue to repeat these 3 priorities over and over at every Zimmer Biomet meeting around the world. And I can tell you that they are resonating with the audience as the absolute must do's for the long-term success of the organization. \n Once again, these 3 imperatives are people and culture, number one; operational excellence, number 2; and innovation and diversification number 3. I would like now to quickly provide you with an update in terms of key progress across these 3 areas. Further detail will come during our May 29 Investor Day in New York City. \n First, in the area of people and culture, we continue to operate Zimmer Biomet with best-in-class engagement metrics and low employee attrition. We have been recognized across different areas when it comes to people and culture. And recently, we've been showcased in various publications, including Newsweek, Great Places to Work and Forbes. In the area of people and culture, it's worth noting also that our restructuring program, which we announced a quarter ago, has now been implemented almost entirely with no major disruptions to report. \n We have realized substantial benefits post this initiative, including realizing cost savings earlier than initially expected as well as achieving increased operational agility and enhance accountability. \n In the second area of operational excellence, we've made robust progress in implementing our enhanced inventory management programs around the world. Working intensely with third-party firms, we develop a plan we're executing against the plan. We remain committed to a meaningful improvement in DOH in the year 2024 and in years to come. Again, more color in that regard during our Investor Day. \n In operational excellence, we have also established core initiatives around best-in-class product launches to ensure that these new product introductions gained traction sooner than expected and we launched these products in a better way than we have launched in the past. This is beyond critical for Zimmer Biomet as we continue to deliver a rapid cadence of product launches with plans to release more than 40 new products in the next 24 to 36 months. One final comment in operational excellence in the area of pricing, we've made structural changes to further enhance the pricing strategy that we put in place over the last several quarters. \n Moving on to the third and final strategic priority. In the area of innovation and diversification, we're making solid progress. We continue to see strong traction in key brands such as Persona OsseoTi. I mentioned already gaining share in the markets where we have launched. We've seen progress with ROSA. We continue to gain momentum with Signature ONE planning guides in the shoulder space, and we love what we're seeing with our Embody soft tissue franchise. CMFT continues to deliver new product introductions, gaining share in the markets where we partake. And I'm very excited about the new product introductions that we have seen and we'll continue to see in our ASC portfolio in the U.S. \n We've also made tremendous strides in new products with a more focused pipeline that today as of Q1 2024, has twice the dollar value that we had at the end of 2018. So the dollar value of the pipeline in innovation is twice what it was 4 or 5 years ago. Worth reminding everyone that north of 80% of these products in the pipeline, residing markets growing above 4%, and many of them are accretive from a gross margin standpoint. So we continue our commitment of innovating from a customer-centric standpoint, but also innovating to see incremental profitability and an increased WAMGR profile. \n In addition to driving results in core markets, we're also focused on diversifying our portfolio into more attractive, faster-growth end markets with the goal of increasing our WAMGR, Weighted Average Market Growth Rate. We have made significant progress over the past several years, balance it  through what it is today. And this fact in addition to the confidence around future free cash flow generation, give us the optionality and the firepower to execute on the right deals at the right time, the most importantly, meet our internal hurdles from both a financial and a strategic perspective. \n So again, lots going on inorganically potentially as well as organically with the size of the pipeline. While we have flexibility in the size of the deals to come, we continue to favor the smaller tuck-ins to midsize deals. That's up to $2 billion in acquisition price that become EPS neutral within 2 years and that from a ROIC standpoint, return on invested capital, will deliver upper single digit to low double digit within 5 years. \n As I mentioned earlier, we're very encouraged with our Q1 performance, a quarter in where we grew 4.4% in constant currency, north of 6% in day rate while overcoming a number of head winds and tough comps. It is this quarter results from the first quarter 2024 that give us a strong confidence that in the year 2024, we will realize our guidance of delivering 5% to 6% in revenue, growing 100 to 200 basis points above market while delivering earnings growing faster than revenue and delivering free cash flow above the earnings growth. \n This is the commitment that we're making for 2024, and it's a commitment that we're going to reiterate in our Investor Day for years to come. Before closing the call, I'd like to announce that Keri Mattox has made a decision to depart from Zimmer Biomet at the end of May. Keri has been a trusted partner and a very close collaborator and friend on this journey and has enabled great things for Zimmer Biomet in her 4-plus years here with ZB. She's going to be missed, and we wish her the best in her future endeavors. A search for a Head of IR position is in progress with a leading executive search firm, and we hope to announce Keri's replacement here very soon. Zach is going to continue to lead IR interactions for Zimmer Biomet. So a plan for continuity is in place. \n In conclusion, we're very proud of how far we have come as an organization and are even more excited about where we can go. Strong confidence on the year 2024. We continue to make commitments and deliver on those commitments as evidenced by these results and as evidenced by the new product introductions commitment that we made and we're realizing. I love the fact that we are impacting the lives of millions of patients around the globe, and I'm inspired by the fact that my team mates are living the Zimmer Biomet mission of alleviating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Suky. Suky? \nSuketu Upadhyay: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, we had another good quarter driven by healthy end markets and solid execution across the organization. Overall, we remain on track to deliver on our 2024 financial guidance with mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and over $1 billion of free cash flow. Assuming current market conditions, this is a financial profile that we believe is durable going forward.  \n Moving to Q1 results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the first quarter of 2024 and how it compares to the same period in 2023, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.889 billion, an increase of 3.2% on a reported basis and an increase of 4.4%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, we had a selling day headwind of about 200 basis points that impacted all regions and product categories at about the same level. \n Excluding the selling day impact, consolidated constant currency sales would have grown above 6%. U.S. growth was 3.7% and international grew 5.4%. Growth in the U.S. was driven by solid performance in RECON in our priority areas within S.E.T. as well as our other category. Outside of the U.S., EMEA saw stronger-than-expected growth on a regional basis. And from a portfolio perspective, OUS growth was primarily driven by our knee category. \n Global Knees grew 4.3% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 2.2% and international growing 7.3%. Growth in our knee business continues to be driven by our Persona product portfolio and ROSA Robotics platform. We remain excited about the growth coming from new and recent product launches across the knee segment. Global Hips grew 1.5% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 1% and international growing 2%. We remain focused on accelerating performance in the Hip segment with key product launches that Ivan mentioned earlier. \n Next, the S.E.T. category grew 5.3%, led by our key focus areas of CMFT, upper extremities and sports growing on average about low double digits. This strong growth was partially offset by the other subsegments within the category. Despite the choppiness within S.E.T., we remain confident this business will drive mid-single-digit or above growth for the full year. \n Finally, our other category grew 12.2%, driven by continued strong ROSA sales. We expect growth in the other category will moderate lower as we move through the rest of the year. In Q1, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.84 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.11 in the prior year. Higher revenue and a lower share count in Q1 2024 was offset by higher selling costs and expenses associated with our restructuring program. \n On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.94 compared to $1.89 in the prior year. The step-up is primarily driven by revenue growth, accelerated savings pull-through from the restructuring program and a lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expenses and taxes related to Pillar 2.\n Foreign currency was a headwind of about $0.04 in the quarter when compared to the prior year. Our adjusted gross margin was 72.9%, driven by higher manufacturing costs, which were offset by better pricing and lower royalties. Overall, gross margin was in line with expectations and with the prior year. \n Adjusted operating margin was 28.6%, slightly ahead of the prior year. The increase in operating margin was driven by higher sales and lower SG&A related to the restructuring program I referenced earlier. Net interest and other adjusted non-operating expenses were $49 million in the quarter, slightly higher than the prior year. And our adjusted tax rate was 18.5%, and we continue to project our full year rate at 18%. \n Turning to cash and liquidity. We generated operating cash flows of $228 million, free cash flow of $91 million, and we ended the quarter with $393 million of cash and cash equivalents. Regarding our outlook for the rest of the year, we are reiterating our full year guidance, including constant currency growth of 5% to 6% or 4.5% to 5.5% reported revenue growth with a 50 basis point currency headwind. Additionally, we continue to expect earnings to be between $8 to $8.15, and that we will generate between $1.50 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow. \n From a cadence perspective, we still expect constant currency revenue growth for the first half of the year to be at the lower end of mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year to be at the upper end of mid-single-digit growth. As a reminder, Q2 and Q3 will each have about 150 basis point tailwind due to selling days and the selling day impact for Q4 and for the full year is expected to be immaterial or less than 50 basis points. \n Regarding the P&L, we expect adjusted gross margin to be broadly in line with 2023 and slightly better than our original thinking due to less FX headwinds than originally assumed. Given the strength in dollar, FX hedge gains are not as big a stepdown in 2024 as originally expected. Looking at gross margin, we expect Q1 to be the high watermark, followed by a modest sequential step down throughout the year. Overall, first half gross margins will be about 100 basis points higher than the second half as we continue to feather in capitalized inflationary costs from the second half of 2023. \n Turning to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with the start to the year as our restructuring efforts are delivering slightly ahead of schedule. Overall, second half operating margins will be higher than the first half. And we expect for the full year that at the midpoint of our guidance, we will increase operating margins by about 80 basis points. \n In summary, Q1 was a good start to the year. We delivered results ahead of expectations and continue to feel confident in our 2024 outlook as evidenced by the reiteration of guidance. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. \nKeri Mattox: Thanks, Suky. And thanks, Ivan, for the kind words. It's been such a privilege to be part of the Zimmer Biomet team these 4.5 years, and I wish the team much continued success moving forward. \n Now before we start the Q&A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one brief follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call. With that, operator, may we have the first question, please? \nOperator: We'll go first to Travis Steed with Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: Keri, great working with you and good luck in your next endeavors. I guess, kind of high level, you guys have this kind of algorithm, 5% to 6% revenue growth potential for some margin expansion and possibly kind of low double-digit EPS growth. And just trying to think about how we should think about that algorithm over the long term. Is it more of a base case or kind of best case? There's just a lot of skepticism from the investor community on that algorithm. And trying to think about what's the Zimmer growth rate kind of on a sustainable basis in a normalized market? And then just the second question I'll go ahead and throw out too. Just any color on Q2 sequentially. It's usually down, Hips and Knees is usually down a little bit sequentially, but with some of the selling day stuff, I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any titration on Q2. \nIvan Tornos: Travis, Ivan here. Thanks for the question. I'll touch on both components of your question, and I'll make sure that Suky speaks up here as well. So starting with the algorithm on revenue, EPS and free cash flow. We're going to give more color in the Investor Day, but I will tell you today, as per the prepared remarks, this is a long-term commitment. So it's not a 2024 only deliver revenue above market, EPS above revenue and free cash flow above EPS growth. And unpacking the drivers here on revenue, it's all about new product introductions. We're going to gain share by delivering innovation that matters. 100 to 200 basis points, largely is going to come from new product introductions. And as we said all along, we got a pipeline that we didn't have before, 40 new product introductions over the next 24 to 36 months, more in the making. So that's the #1 driver on revenue in addition to obviously pricing dynamics and commercial execution. \n On EPS growth, we're doing things differently when it comes to margin, I already mentioned pricing, but other components, how we think about inventory in excess and obsolescence, how we think about allocation of OpEx, where we get the greatest return, et cetera, et cetera. And the free cash flow, the main driver is the fact that we have run this company in quite an inefficient way when it comes to inventory management. North of 400 days on hand when it comes to inventory, not really engaging on prioritization of geographies. Portfolio management is not what it needs to be. So those are the key drivers on the sustainability. \n I'll touch on #2, and then I'll give it to Suky. In terms of Q1 to Q2 to Q3 to Q4, what happens sequentially. Look, we're not going to get into the gymnastics on what happens quarter-over-quarter, all kinds of timing 1 quarter to the other. We call --  we're having similar conversations in Q4. Here is what I'd leave you with. Q1 was very strong. A 4.4% growth in constant currency, north of 6% in day rate. \n As we see here, looking at the year, we were confident at the very beginning of the year in the guidance of 5% to 6%, a quarter behind, we're extremely confident on the guidance. The growth drivers that get us there are working in the right direction. So very, very confident, very proud of Q1. And again, we'll talk more about the dynamics at Investor Day. Suky?(43:40) \nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. I think Ivan summarized it really well, so I'll just try to build some incremental points here. I think at that mid-single-digit growth top line profile that Ivan mentioned, we do have a durable path to operating margin expansion as well as improvements in overall free cash flow conversion. \n On the earnings outlook, this year, if you look at our guide, it's 6% to 8%, which, again, we reiterate and feel confident in. If you -- on an underlying basis, if you back out the step-up in tax rate that we saw at Pillar 2 as well as headwinds that I think everyone is facing on interest as well as FX, the underlying growth on the bottom line is much better than 6% to 8%, maybe 300 to 400 basis points better on an underlying basis, which puts us kind of in that high single digits, low double digits. And if you look at what we did in '23, I think we were also there. \n As we look forward, using your words Travis, base case, et cetera, we think there's a pathway to low double-digit earnings growth. I wouldn't say it's our base case or our commitment. And again, we're going to provide more color on our Analyst Day. But as we think about margin expansion with revenue growth, we just want to make sure we've got the right investment profile to the company to make sure that, that growth is durable. So is that our base case, I wouldn't necessarily go there. I'd say we have a pathway there. But we're going to provide a lot more color in just a few more weeks. \nKeri Mattox: Katie, can we have the next question in the queue? \nOperator: We'll go next to Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Company. \nSteven Lichtman: Congratulations on the quarter, guys. And Keri, it's been great working with you. I guess I'll first start on pricing commentary. I thought that was notable. Ivan, can you talk about where the positive surprise came from on that front? Are the benefits of your efforts coming sooner? Just some general comments on the pricing environment would be great. \nIvan Tornos: Yes. We're very -- Steve, thank you. We're very pleased, obviously, with pricing performance. Recall that in 2023, the second semester of '23, so the last half of '23, we're already flattish when it comes to price. So this is a business that in previous years was having 300 to 500 basis points of price erosion in the U.S., pretty significant OUS. That's not the change that we have going on. We put a structure in place. We put governance, new product introductions are helping from a category contracting. \n I wouldn't say there's any real surprises. Europe may be doing slightly better than anticipated. You've got all kinds of [ tender ] dynamics that come in and out. But net-net, we are at a point where it is pretty predictable. We like the strategy in place. We like the governance. We're not going to commit here to doing dramatically better, but no real surprises, only Q1 and a great outlook for the rest of the year. Suky, do you have any other comments? \nSuketu Upadhyay: I think overall we're in more favorable environment than we've been, let's call it, 3, 4 years ago. When you combine that with some of the structural changes we're making inside the company, that's -- I think those 2 things are really leading to better price performance. I'll tell you, I'm really impressed and optimistic about the cultural change, quite frankly, within Zimmer Biomet as I talked to distributors or field level reps and their desire to want to make sure that we're getting the value for the products that we bring to market. That's encouraging. And I think that makes it durable. \n In the quarter, we were roughly flat. I do expect us to be -- when I set out the year, I thought we'd be 100 to 150 basis points of erosion. I think we're now under 100 basis points of erosion especially given what we saw in the first quarter. I don't expect that flat profile to continue through the rest of the year because we've got a number of things that happened at the back end of last year, especially in Europe where we took some pretty large price increases in devalue sort of currencies and markets that will sunset later on this year. \n Also, we've got some new contracts that are coming up, which will create a little bit of pressure. So I don't expect that flat profile to continue through the rest of the year. But nonetheless, we're in a much better spot than we were a few years ago. And again, expect overall pricing to be somewhere under 100 basis points for the full year '24. \nSteven Lichtman: Great and then quickly follow-up -- just wanted to follow up real quickly on the ROSA shoulder. Just on the initial launch and your outlook for ramp this year? \nIvan Tornos: Yes. Thank you. Obviously, very excited in terms of this product launch. We did the first cases at the Mayo Clinic a couple of weeks ago. Feedback was very solid. It is a product that has a high degree of accuracy in the cuts in the visibility of anatomy. It is efficient from an instrumentation standpoint. It's fully interconnected with the rest of the CVH ecosystem. Case over case, the feedback was that you do achieve time efficiencies. So the learning curve is rather short. \n So very solid clinical feedback. In terms of the impact, we said all along that we're going to take it slowly in the first, call it, 90 to 120 days. And you will see the real impact as we get closer to the end of the year. But a very meaningful product launch for the company. I'm very excited about it. Thanks, Steve. \nOperator: Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. \nVikramjeet Chopra: This is Vik Chopra in for Larry Biegelsen. Keri, thanks for all your help and good luck. So 2 for me. I just wanted to get a sense as to kind of what we can expect at your upcoming Investor Day at the end of the month. With regard to financial goals, will you have specific LRP goals for revenue? Or will it be relative to the market, for example, growth of 100 to 200 basis points above market. And then I had a follow-up. \nIvan Tornos: Yes. No, we'll definitely cover the -- how we plan to achieve these 3 commitments we're making from a financial perspective in terms of what are the drivers of revenue, EPS and free cash flow. So we'll definitely provide those details. We'll cover the new product introductions, we've seen that. We'll talk about the capital allocation on the strategy moving forward. So it's going to be very robust. So that's the Analyst Day. \nVikramjeet Chopra: The second question I had was you beat consensus EPS by about $0.07, but you didn't really raise the guidance on EPS. Can you just provide some color on that? \nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. I think Ivan said it really well in his opening remarks. We had a good start to the year, and it was great to see the better-than-expected performance in revenue. We saw a very good flow through all the way to the bottom. So I love the discipline that we've got throughout the company. I would say that this just reinforces and gives us more conviction in the guidance range that we provided earlier this year. \nOperator: We'll go next to Rick Wise with Stifel. \nFrederick Wise: And we'll miss you, Keri. I'll ask my question and my follow-up at the same time. Ivan, obviously, on all these new introductions; OsseoTi HAMMR, the robotic shoulder, but -- and all of them sound like they'll be meaningful and I assume will help pricing, will help gain share, will help leverage your fixed cost, your operating costs.\n But I was hoping you'll focus in particular on the implications of the Z1 launch. You highlighted the product several times. Is this the lynchpin product that you've been missing to make your hip portfolio more credible and to bring your business up to sort of more industry norms?\n And my second -- my follow-up is sort of related to all that, relates to margins. Suky, I mean, I heard what you said about gross and operating margins. But again, when I think about all these introductions, I assume better pricing and margins and share and leveraging. Why should I believe you on everything you just said about the margin outlook? \nIvan Tornos: Thank you, Rick. I'll cover the Hip question, and then we'll proceed with the interrogation of Suky here when it comes to the margin. One product is not -- one product is not what's going to win the battle here, right? It is a category of products. We've been very transparent. We've not done great when it comes to hips over the last 3 or 5 years and essentially driven by 3 product categories.\n The first one is a direct anterior stem what is not in the market as a triple taper stem and it was a deficiency that we had. Z1 solves that and it does in a differentiated way. So now with this 510(k) approval, we compete with the 2 other large orthopedic companies in direct anterior.\n The second category was a surgical impactor. It drives efficiency, it drives accuracy in how you treat the cases. It integrates with the rest of the procedure. You need certain levels of power as you do in that hip surgery. So there is a surgical impactor and we have that with HAMMR, fully launched, we're going to run that up. And the first thing that we needed was to have navigation.\n We got true modalities navigation. Obviously, we've got ROSA Hip. We are the only company with a 510(k) FDA approved Mixed Reality Technology in our partnership with HipInsight. So again, it's not just Z1, it's the full portfolio. Direct anterior stems, surgical impactors and some sort of navigation. So I do believe and we do believe with a high degree of confidence that we're going to regain our old position in hips. We still remain the #1 hip company in the world, and I think that this portfolio accelerates our growth journey moving forward. \nSuketu Upadhyay: And Rick, it's Suky. Always good to hear from you. On the margin front, I know the past isn't always indicative of the future, but I'll just -- it is a good validation and proof point, I think, in our situation. Both '22 and '23, we're able to expand operating margins quite significantly, I would say, even in the backdrop of a pretty hostile inflationary environment. And so again, kudos to the entire [ CE ] team.\n In '24, we expect to do it again. And here's what I would say. We're doing it across the entirety of the P&L. First, through revenue growth and leverage our fixed costs. Secondly, we're making improvements in cost at a rate that we've not done before through inventory reduction, site optimization, reductions in E&O. We're even getting more efficient inside of R&D and looking at, hey, do we really need all this sustaining and how can we rationalize some of our portfolio, migrate our customers to better products, get rid of some of these products, which then reduces the amount of sustaining engineering, which we can then mix shift into NPI.\n We're getting it through SG&A. We're getting it through better allocation of capital and reducing our cost of debt. The beauty of that is when you have multiple shots on goal to improve operating margins, even if things go unexpectedly from a macro perspective or a micro perspective, we have other levers to continue to help us pull margins as we move forward. And so the thing I'll leave you with is it's not just in one area of the company, it's throughout the entirety of the P&L, and we feel confident about where we're going.\n And quite frankly, and I love what Ivan's bringing. He's bringing his owner-operator mindset to the company. He's got the company thinking not just about top line, but all the way through cash, cash being king, and I think that's really driving a culture change within our company as well. So I'm optimistic on where we're going, Rick. \nOperator: We'll go next to Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. \nImron Zafar: This is actually Imron Zafar in for Pito. First question is on ROSA, obviously, a strong first quarter there. Can you talk about placement trends in the quarter by site of care, hospital versus ASC? And then also competitive dynamics for [ ROSA ]  Joint orthopedic robots? \nIvan Tornos: Absolutely. Thanks for the question. So let's start with the global picture, if you will, very excited in terms of where we are overall with ROSA. So globally, ROSA is becoming the preferred robotic option in many markets outside of the U.S. Here in the U.S., we're approaching around 20% penetration of ROSA in cases.\n As you saw in the quarter, we had a large amount of ROSA sales, which is encouraging because that means in the other category, that's encouraging because that's a future stream of net pull-through. About 1/3 of all the installs that we do in the U.S. go to an ASC environment, which, again, is not a surprise given the fact that ROSA does drive easier preplanning. You don't need to do a CT scan. It is very surgeon center, so it's very controllable. And we continue to see that there is a high degree of preference for ROSA in those higher volume accounts.\n So net-net, everything in the right direction in terms of penetration, where we are gaining traction in key markets around the world and a lot of the dynamic that we're seeing here in the U.S. ambulatory surgical center environment. \nImron Zafar: Just as a quick follow-up. Can you remind us what the site of care mix is for shorter Recon hospital versus ASC? \nIvan Tornos: So we're starting to see a dynamic in where cases are moving to the ASC for shoulders, getting the CMS change. I would say today, probably around 60% to 65% of the cases of shoulder are now done in ASC, but that's moving pretty rapidly, given the change of reimbursement. And we've got a strong position both in the inpatient, outpatient as well as the ASC. But I would say net-net, is around 60%, 65% to 35% in terms of that mix. \nOperator: We'll go next to Caitlin Cronin with Canaccord Genuity. \nCaitlin Cronin: Just touching a little bit further on ROSA and the strength in the other line, Suky, did you say that you expect lower growth in this segment through the year? \nSuketu Upadhyay: It was a little bit choppy there, Caitlin, Sorry, did you ask if -- you asked something about other? Could you repeat the question? \nCaitlin Cronin: Yes, apologies. Did you say that you expect lower growth in the segment throughout the year? \nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. Yes. So we had a pretty strong quarter in our other category, primarily driven by ROSA Capital. So we saw good installs. And we saw a higher mix of sales versus placements which drove a higher level of dollar revenue in that quarter. The good news is we saw a lot of new placements and new ASCs, which is exactly where we want to see ROSA's position and the capital sales were very good.\n We also love placements because that comes with a longer-term commitment. Our expectation is that we'll step down from what you saw in the first quarter as we move throughout the year, and that's been assumed in our guidance reiteration. \nCaitlin Cronin: Okay. And then any updates on Persona? \nKeri Mattox: Go ahead with a follow-up. Line is kind of choppy. Go ahead. \nCaitlin Cronin: Okay. Apologies. And any updates on the Persona IQ rollout? \nIvan Tornos: Yes. Thank you, Caitlin. It's moving in the right direction. I will say, as of late, things are accelerating, both from an innovation and a commercial execution standpoint. So on innovation, we did receive recently the 510(k) approval for -- didn't make it to the press release for the study. So as the shorter stem version of Persona IQ, which has been a gating factor for some surgeons that don't use the longer stem. So that's an innovation and they are right there.\n The other piece that is gaining traction is the launch of what we call recovery curves. This is a platform that only Persona IQ has. Interconnects the data of the TAM with a dashboard that in a very objective way, can quantify how patients are doing in comparison to other patients with similar dynamics. So those are 2 innovation updates that are more in the right direction.\n In terms of the execution and commercial journey, we got what we need. We got the right designs. We've been talking about value proposition. It's been resonating. We are in some of the largest teaching institutions, and we continue to be committed to the journey. So very excited about Persona IQ. Thank you for the question. \nOperator: We'll go next to Mike Matson with Needham & Company. \nMichael Matson: Yes. So I just want to ask one about kind of what the guidance implies for second quarter revenue. you're saying you expect to be at the low end of the mid-single digits to sort of like 4% in the first half. Based on what you did in the first quarter, that implies kind of like 3.5% constant currency growth, but you have the 1.5% selling day benefit. So that applies like 2% kind of underlying growth. Is that -- is my math right there? And I guess why do you only expect 2% growth in the second quarter? \nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. Mike, directionally, the way you think about it, right, I wouldn't quite go as low as that. But look, quarter-to-quarter, there's going to be choppiness. There's going to be noise based on timing, contracts, et cetera. We had a great start to the year. We continue to believe and reinforce our guidance and still believe that the first half is going to land as we expected to when we initially gave guidance. So nothing in particular about the quarter of note, but just the overall cadence, that's how we expect first half versus second half to play out this year. \nMichael Matson: Okay. And then just a follow-up on OsseoTi. So you mentioned it's gaining share. Does that mean that it's actually converting competitive surgeons? Or does that just mean it's cannibalizing the cemented Persona? \nIvan Tornos: No. We definitely are upgraded, if you will, some or for cementless -- legacy cementless platform over to Persona OsseoTi but at the same time, a sizable amount of the business coming from converting accounts. So you've seen that the U.S. knee number in the quarter was strong and a large component of that was the fact with pretty heavy comps, by the way, comes from the introduction of Persona OsseoTi and the expectation is that as we continue to move into the acceleration of the product launch, we're going to continue to gain share. So it's both existing accounts and new accounts. \nOperator: We'll go next to Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Sofia on for Vijay. One quick one on gross margins and operating margins. Were there any one-offs in the first quarter on gross margins. You guys raised the guide for margin but EPS was maintained. So is operating margin slightly down? And how do we think about margins for the rest of the year? \nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. No real -- in any given quarter, there's going to be puts and calls, both in gross margin and operating margin, but nothing material or out of the ordinary. We did a little bit better on gross margin than we expected to. We saw that flow through in the operating margins. So we feel really good about the start of the year.\n As we progress through the year, we do expect operating margins to step up in line with normal seasonality as revenue continues to step up and other savings programs pull through. So again, very confident in where we're headed from an earnings perspective in our guide. And if you recall, I think we said on the last quarterly call that at the midpoint, that implies about an 80 basis point lift in operating margin, and we're still confident in that. \nUnknown Analyst: Okay. follow-up question -- just one quick one on M&A. I know you guys have made some comments about tuck-ins and kind of what that profile will look like. But anything in the pipeline that are particularly interesting right now that will fit now in the portfolio? \nIvan Tornos: Yes. We always have a robust pipeline. And we'll talk about the pipeline and the optionality of M&A in more depth once we meet in later in the month. But the same 3 key areas apply. We're looking for assets that are mission-centric from a strategic standpoint, fit in the higher-growth segments of Recon, certainly the high growth segments of S.E.T. as a category and then in the ASC space, which is a mixture of both 1 and 2. So we later focus on those 3 key areas while also keeping an eye on broader diversification.\n Financially, nothing has changed. We have flexibility to do larger deals, but we like deals where the acquisition price is under $2 billion. We definitely want to be neutral from an EPS standpoint within 2 years and then high single-digit ROIC to double-digit ROIC in the 5-year time horizon. So very clear on strategic and financial filters and the optionality is there and the pipeline is there. So more to come once we meet in New York. \nOperator: We'll go next to Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe just one for me. You kind of talked about second quarter and the expectation on the top line, and you just answered kind of margin cadence through the year. But I want to put a finer point on it and try and avoid some of the cadence issues that we had last year. So you talked about operating margin expanding.\n I wanted to make sure, I think the prior commentary was second quarter would be the highest operating margin and fourth quarter would be the highest for the year with a sequential down in third quarter with normal seasonality. So maybe to kind of say it all a different way. Are you comfortable with where the Street is on EPS or EPS for a second, third, fourth quarter, are there any cadence changes you think we should be looking at moving from 1 quarter to another? \nSuketu Upadhyay: Yes. So Robbie, just a little bit of a correction. I'm not sure if I caught everything you said or understood, I should say everything you said. Fourth quarter will be our high watermark relative to operating margin in line with that being our high watermark from a revenue perspective. And so our margin does, in many ways, correlate heavily to our revenue outlook.\n Relative to the cadence, I'm not going to -- in consensus I'm not going to sort of benchmark relative to that. I think we've actually given pretty good color already around the first half, second half revenue cadence. I've talked about gross margins crossed a 100 in the first half, second in the back half and then operating margins improving in the back half of the year due to restructuring overall. So I think there's actually pretty good color out there in line with how we've traditionally been transparent. So hopefully, that gives you enough to go from. \nOperator: We'll go next to Chris Pasquale with Nephron. \nChristopher Pasquale: Ivan, you talked about 4 points of your revenue growth this year coming from market gains and then 100 to 200 basis points with outperformance. It gets you to your 5% to 6% goal. When we look at the first quarter, Recon growth was actually a little bit better than that, and that's really hard comp, [ parts ] comp of the year. So that 4% feels pretty conservative at this point. \n Your own performance across hips and knees was a little below market. So while I appreciate you're excited about the pipeline and what it can mean for share gains in the out years, are you still thinking about the recipe to get you to your 2024 target the same way? \nIvan Tornos: Yes. Thank you, Chris. First of all, I wouldn't categorize our performance being below market. And we're going to have a healthy debate on whether it's above or below. But what I will tell you is that when we stay here right now, it is not below market. Certainly not from a training standpoint over a period of time and now that everyone is reported in Q1, we're not below market. So I'll start with that.\n In terms of how we get to the 5% to 6%, I think the formula continues to be product introductions, which will ramp up later in the year and even more product introductions as we get into 2025. We've never had 5.5, almost 6 years here with the company, I've never seen a poor portfolio. I mentioned earlier that we don't have any gaps in hips with the introductions that we have done in Knees, there's 0 gaps.\n I'm excited about the upcoming product launches in Europe. Let's not forget, we don't have Persona revision in EMEA. That's an almost $2 billion product here in the U.S., $2 billion over the last 4 -- 3, 4 years in gross sales. And let's not forget, we also bring in Oxford Partial Cementless from Europe here to the U.S. So strength in the knee portfolio, strengths in the hip portfolio.\n You've seen that S.E.T. we made a commitment that S.E.T as a category will grow mid-single digit or above. It's the third consecutive quarter where we're seeing that. And that's going to stay around. So I would say, strength in innovation, the strength in commercial execution and the 5% to 6% to us is an admissible commitment. \nChristopher Pasquale: Okay. And then following up on OsseoTi. Can you remind us where your cementless mix stands today in the U.S.? And over what time frame you think you could close the gap between your current penetration and where Stryker is at the moment? \nIvan Tornos: Absolutely. So closing the Q1 quarter approaching 20%. So it's fairly similar to robotics. So cementless is approaching 20%. We'll break down some of these commitments, we keep repeating the same answer at the Investor Day. But our expectation, our ambition is to be where our competitors are, 60% 6-0. We'll provide time lines in that regard, but the north star is to have robotic penetration in the 60% range and cementless penetration in the 60%. So the fact that today we're at 20%, that tells you that there is pretty significant upside, and we're excited about the journey. \nKeri Mattox: Chris, thanks for the question. Katie, I think we have time for maybe one more question in the queue. \nOperator: I'll go next to Shagun Singh with RBC. \nShagun Singh Chadha: So it seems like orthopedic robotics uptake stepped up for the market in Q1 or at least it was better than expected. Has anything changed from a capital appetite standpoint -- any reason you are seeing more upfront sales versus operating leases? And then just a follow-up on M&A. Ivan, you had indicated that you want to be -- you want to go bigger and bolder and we haven't seen a whole lot of that yet. I appreciate all the commentary on deal capacity of up to $2 billion and favoring tuck-ins. But very specifically, how do you plan to raise your weighted average market growth from 4% today mostly with tuck-ins? \nIvan Tornos: So starting with robots and capital dynamics. Look, I will tell you one thing that is pretty prevalent is that here in the U.S., we've seen the cases move today, I see not a week goes by that is not a new ASC opening. And those ASCs do want to acquire robotics and you either install or you purchase it. And we saw a dynamic in Q1 where we saw more purchases.\n We do believe this is driven by ASC dynamics. Capital continues to be strong across key markets. So definitely not a gating factor. And again, as I mentioned early, excited about the continuity here. In terms of your second question on M&A, look, we want to be bigger and bolder, at the same time, we don't want to be reckless. And I will say that all along. So we're going to stick to the strategic and financial thresholds. We got the pipeline, we got the money. And when it is time to act, we'll act on it. And we're not going to take the past as an indicator of how we're going to do things in the present and future.\n The breakdown on the WAMGR, we'll cover that as well once we get into the Investor Day. And it is a combination of organic and inorganic means. So we'll talk about the pipeline. I already mentioned -- we already mentioned that 80%, if not 90% of the new products in the pipeline are in markets that are growing above 4%, in some cases above 5%. So that's definitely a driver and then the combination of tuck-in deals and maybe some bolder moves will get us to the WAMGR that we deserve. So more to come in that regard. Thanks for the question.\n I think we come in to the end of the call. So I'm just going to briefly close with closing comments. I will start by saying that it's great to be here at home in Warsaw, Indiana today to celebrate our Founder's Day. So May 2, 1927, we started the company with a very clear purpose to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life for people around the world. So 97 years later, I just can say that we're just getting started. So excited to see where we are as a company.\n It's an exciting time to be at Zimmer Biomet. The portfolio is where it needs to be. We have strong commercial execution. We are very, very confident on our guidance for the year 2024. We are excited about what is to come in '25 and '26 once we are able to discuss the long-range plan. So that is seen by confidence and excitement.\n And before closing, I want to thank Keri for 4.5 great years with us. You've been a trusted partner, a great friend. You're going to be missed, although I'm going to continue to call you and seek your advice in many, many years to come. So thank you, Keri, and thanks, everybody. \nKeri Mattox: Thanks, everyone, for joining. We'll be talking to all of you today. If you have questions, of course, please don't hesitate to reach out to the IR team. Thank you again for joining the call this morning. \nOperator: That will conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Suketu Upadhyay",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Ivan mentioned, we had another good quarter driven by healthy end markets and solid execution across the organization. Overall, we remain on track to deliver on our 2024 financial guidance with mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion and over $1 billion of free cash flow. Assuming current market conditions, this is a financial profile that we believe is durable going forward.  \n Moving to Q1 results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the first quarter of 2024 and how it compares to the same period in 2023, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted operating basis. Net sales were $1.889 billion, an increase of 3.2% on a reported basis and an increase of 4.4%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, we had a selling day headwind of about 200 basis points that impacted all regions and product categories at about the same level. \n Excluding the selling day impact, consolidated constant currency sales would have grown above 6%. U.S. growth was 3.7% and international grew 5.4%. Growth in the U.S. was driven by solid performance in RECON in our priority areas within S.E.T. as well as our other category. Outside of the U.S., EMEA saw stronger-than-expected growth on a regional basis. And from a portfolio perspective, OUS growth was primarily driven by our knee category. \n Global Knees grew 4.3% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 2.2% and international growing 7.3%. Growth in our knee business continues to be driven by our Persona product portfolio and ROSA Robotics platform. We remain excited about the growth coming from new and recent product launches across the knee segment. Global Hips grew 1.5% in the quarter with the U.S. growing 1% and international growing 2%. We remain focused on accelerating performance in the Hip segment with key product launches that Ivan mentioned earlier. \n Next, the S.E.T. category grew 5.3%, led by our key focus areas of CMFT, upper extremities and sports growing on average about low double digits. This strong growth was partially offset by the other subsegments within the category. Despite the choppiness within S.E.T., we remain confident this business will drive mid-single-digit or above growth for the full year. \n Finally, our other category grew 12.2%, driven by continued strong ROSA sales. We expect growth in the other category will moderate lower as we move through the rest of the year. In Q1, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.84 compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.11 in the prior year. Higher revenue and a lower share count in Q1 2024 was offset by higher selling costs and expenses associated with our restructuring program. \n On an adjusted basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.94 compared to $1.89 in the prior year. The step-up is primarily driven by revenue growth, accelerated savings pull-through from the restructuring program and a lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expenses and taxes related to Pillar 2.\n Foreign currency was a headwind of about $0.04 in the quarter when compared to the prior year. Our adjusted gross margin was 72.9%, driven by higher manufacturing costs, which were offset by better pricing and lower royalties. Overall, gross margin was in line with expectations and with the prior year. \n Adjusted operating margin was 28.6%, slightly ahead of the prior year. The increase in operating margin was driven by higher sales and lower SG&A related to the restructuring program I referenced earlier. Net interest and other adjusted non-operating expenses were $49 million in the quarter, slightly higher than the prior year. And our adjusted tax rate was 18.5%, and we continue to project our full year rate at 18%. \n Turning to cash and liquidity. We generated operating cash flows of $228 million, free cash flow of $91 million, and we ended the quarter with $393 million of cash and cash equivalents. Regarding our outlook for the rest of the year, we are reiterating our full year guidance, including constant currency growth of 5% to 6% or 4.5% to 5.5% reported revenue growth with a 50 basis point currency headwind. Additionally, we continue to expect earnings to be between $8 to $8.15, and that we will generate between $1.50 billion to $1.1 billion of free cash flow. \n From a cadence perspective, we still expect constant currency revenue growth for the first half of the year to be at the lower end of mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year to be at the upper end of mid-single-digit growth. As a reminder, Q2 and Q3 will each have about 150 basis point tailwind due to selling days and the selling day impact for Q4 and for the full year is expected to be immaterial or less than 50 basis points. \n Regarding the P&L, we expect adjusted gross margin to be broadly in line with 2023 and slightly better than our original thinking due to less FX headwinds than originally assumed. Given the strength in dollar, FX hedge gains are not as big a stepdown in 2024 as originally expected. Looking at gross margin, we expect Q1 to be the high watermark, followed by a modest sequential step down throughout the year. Overall, first half gross margins will be about 100 basis points higher than the second half as we continue to feather in capitalized inflationary costs from the second half of 2023. \n Turning to adjusted operating margin. We are pleased with the start to the year as our restructuring efforts are delivering slightly ahead of schedule. Overall, second half operating margins will be higher than the first half. And we expect for the full year that at the midpoint of our guidance, we will increase operating margins by about 80 basis points. \n In summary, Q1 was a good start to the year. We delivered results ahead of expectations and continue to feel confident in our 2024 outlook as evidenced by the reiteration of guidance. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri. Yes. I think Ivan summarized it really well, so I'll just try to build some incremental points here. I think at that mid-single-digit growth top line profile that Ivan mentioned, we do have a durable path to operating margin expansion as well as improvements in overall free cash flow conversion. \n On the earnings outlook, this year, if you look at our guide, it's 6% to 8%, which, again, we reiterate and feel confident in. If you -- on an underlying basis, if you back out the step-up in tax rate that we saw at Pillar 2 as well as headwinds that I think everyone is facing on interest as well as FX, the underlying growth on the bottom line is much better than 6% to 8%, maybe 300 to 400 basis points better on an underlying basis, which puts us kind of in that high single digits, low double digits. And if you look at what we did in '23, I think we were also there. \n As we look forward, using your words Travis, base case, et cetera, we think there's a pathway to low double-digit earnings growth. I wouldn't say it's our base case or our commitment. And again, we're going to provide more color on our Analyst Day. But as we think about margin expansion with revenue growth, we just want to make sure we've got the right investment profile to the company to make sure that, that growth is durable. So is that our base case, I wouldn't necessarily go there. I'd say we have a pathway there. But we're going to provide a lot more color in just a few more weeks. I think overall we're in more favorable environment than we've been, let's call it, 3, 4 years ago. When you combine that with some of the structural changes we're making inside the company, that's -- I think those 2 things are really leading to better price performance. I'll tell you, I'm really impressed and optimistic about the cultural change, quite frankly, within Zimmer Biomet as I talked to distributors or field level reps and their desire to want to make sure that we're getting the value for the products that we bring to market. That's encouraging. And I think that makes it durable. \n In the quarter, we were roughly flat. I do expect us to be -- when I set out the year, I thought we'd be 100 to 150 basis points of erosion. I think we're now under 100 basis points of erosion especially given what we saw in the first quarter. I don't expect that flat profile to continue through the rest of the year because we've got a number of things that happened at the back end of last year, especially in Europe where we took some pretty large price increases in devalue sort of currencies and markets that will sunset later on this year. \n Also, we've got some new contracts that are coming up, which will create a little bit of pressure. So I don't expect that flat profile to continue through the rest of the year. But nonetheless, we're in a much better spot than we were a few years ago. And again, expect overall pricing to be somewhere under 100 basis points for the full year '24. Yes. I think Ivan said it really well in his opening remarks. We had a good start to the year, and it was great to see the better-than-expected performance in revenue. We saw a very good flow through all the way to the bottom. So I love the discipline that we've got throughout the company. I would say that this just reinforces and gives us more conviction in the guidance range that we provided earlier this year. And Rick, it's Suky. Always good to hear from you. On the margin front, I know the past isn't always indicative of the future, but I'll just -- it is a good validation and proof point, I think, in our situation. Both '22 and '23, we're able to expand operating margins quite significantly, I would say, even in the backdrop of a pretty hostile inflationary environment. And so again, kudos to the entire [ CE ] team.\n In '24, we expect to do it again. And here's what I would say. We're doing it across the entirety of the P&L. First, through revenue growth and leverage our fixed costs. Secondly, we're making improvements in cost at a rate that we've not done before through inventory reduction, site optimization, reductions in E&O. We're even getting more efficient inside of R&D and looking at, hey, do we really need all this sustaining and how can we rationalize some of our portfolio, migrate our customers to better products, get rid of some of these products, which then reduces the amount of sustaining engineering, which we can then mix shift into NPI.\n We're getting it through SG&A. We're getting it through better allocation of capital and reducing our cost of debt. The beauty of that is when you have multiple shots on goal to improve operating margins, even if things go unexpectedly from a macro perspective or a micro perspective, we have other levers to continue to help us pull margins as we move forward. And so the thing I'll leave you with is it's not just in one area of the company, it's throughout the entirety of the P&L, and we feel confident about where we're going.\n And quite frankly, and I love what Ivan's bringing. He's bringing his owner-operator mindset to the company. He's got the company thinking not just about top line, but all the way through cash, cash being king, and I think that's really driving a culture change within our company as well. So I'm optimistic on where we're going, Rick. It was a little bit choppy there, Caitlin, Sorry, did you ask if -- you asked something about other? Could you repeat the question? Yes. Yes. So we had a pretty strong quarter in our other category, primarily driven by ROSA Capital. So we saw good installs. And we saw a higher mix of sales versus placements which drove a higher level of dollar revenue in that quarter. The good news is we saw a lot of new placements and new ASCs, which is exactly where we want to see ROSA's position and the capital sales were very good.\n We also love placements because that comes with a longer-term commitment. Our expectation is that we'll step down from what you saw in the first quarter as we move throughout the year, and that's been assumed in our guidance reiteration. Yes. Mike, directionally, the way you think about it, right, I wouldn't quite go as low as that. But look, quarter-to-quarter, there's going to be choppiness. There's going to be noise based on timing, contracts, et cetera. We had a great start to the year. We continue to believe and reinforce our guidance and still believe that the first half is going to land as we expected to when we initially gave guidance. So nothing in particular about the quarter of note, but just the overall cadence, that's how we expect first half versus second half to play out this year. Yes. No real -- in any given quarter, there's going to be puts and calls, both in gross margin and operating margin, but nothing material or out of the ordinary. We did a little bit better on gross margin than we expected to. We saw that flow through in the operating margins. So we feel really good about the start of the year.\n As we progress through the year, we do expect operating margins to step up in line with normal seasonality as revenue continues to step up and other savings programs pull through. So again, very confident in where we're headed from an earnings perspective in our guide. And if you recall, I think we said on the last quarterly call that at the midpoint, that implies about an 80 basis point lift in operating margin, and we're still confident in that. Yes. So Robbie, just a little bit of a correction. I'm not sure if I caught everything you said or understood, I should say everything you said. Fourth quarter will be our high watermark relative to operating margin in line with that being our high watermark from a revenue perspective. And so our margin does, in many ways, correlate heavily to our revenue outlook.\n Relative to the cadence, I'm not going to -- in consensus I'm not going to sort of benchmark relative to that. I think we've actually given pretty good color already around the first half, second half revenue cadence. I've talked about gross margins crossed a 100 in the first half, second in the back half and then operating margins improving in the back half of the year due to restructuring overall. So I think there's actually pretty good color out there in line with how we've traditionally been transparent. So hopefully, that gives you enough to go from."

            "name": "Ivan Tornos",
            "content": "Thank you, Keri, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call here this morning. I'd like to start today the way that I typically do by taking a moment to recognize and to show my gratitude to the 18,000 Zimmer Biomet team members across the globe, who each and every day work relentlessly in driving our mission forward. Simply put them, I'm very proud of each and every one of you. Thank you for your dedication, for your commitment, resilience and for your strong performance to start off this year 2024. \n It is truly this great workforce and the culture that we have here in place at Zimmer Biomet that gives me -- gives us confidence behind the financial commitments that we're making. Given the fact that we have a very robust Investor Day coming up in just a few weeks, I will keep my opening remarks short with the goal of moving quickly into today's Q&A session. I'll touch on 3 key areas briefly. \n First, I'm going to provide some general comments on the results in the quarter versus our own expectations. Secondly, I'll cover the drivers of the performance, and we'll touch on why we believe that these drivers are sustainable. And then lastly, I'll close with a brief summary on our progress against our 3 strategic priorities, which have been discussing since day 1, those being people and culture, operational excellence and diversification innovation. \n Starting with the quarterly results. Overall, we are very encouraged with our Q1 performance which was ahead of our own expectations, driven by healthy end markets, combined with the strong execution across the organization globally. We ended the quarter continuing the momentum that we saw in 2023, delivering 4.4% constant currency revenue growth, while overstepping a sizable day rate headwind and facing rather difficult comps versus a year ago. \n In fact, it is reassuring to see that on a day rate adjusted basis, our growth for the quarter was greater than 6% with several areas of the business and geographies contributing to such solid results. In addition to the sound revenue performance, we drove adjusted margin expansion and grew adjusted earnings even while our effective tax rate increased over 200 basis points. These results to start 2024 and give us great confidence that Zimmer Biomet will deliver 5% to 6% constant currency revenue growth in the year while driving sizable adjusted operating margin expansion. So pleased to reaffirm our guidance for the year. \n This, in turn, will enable mid- to high single-digit adjusted earnings growth while realizing our commitment of seeing free cash flow growing faster than earnings. Suky is going to provide more color around these areas later, but a strong performance in the quarter. And again, reaffirming guidance for the year. Net-net, it's encouraging to see us exiting Q1 of 2024 with a revenue growth run rate in the mid-single-digit range, which is consistent with where we exited the second half of 2023. \n With new products -- new product introduction ramping later in the year, we like what we see in terms of sustainability in our growth trajectory which we have said all along will accelerate in the second half of 2024. Key drivers behind our Q1 results came from both a macro and micro standpoint, starting with macro factors or end markets, as we've been saying all along, remain very healthy, driven by high levels of patient demand due to demographic shifts. \n The continued shift today we see here in the U.S. is also a tailwind and across the board in the industry, we've seen better surgical outcomes and technological advancements, which are driving more pace in demand. On top of that, you've got to improve pricing dynamics. And to that end, pleased to report that pricing in the quarter was about flat as opposed to the 200 to 300 basis points of price erosion that this space, this industry has seen historically. \n From a macro standpoint, the main enablers of our Q1 results were the adoption of ROSA technology globally, with a correlated pull-through of Persona Knee. We also saw some execution of growth drivers within S.E.T., particularly in shoulders, within sports medicine and in our CMFT, craniomaxillofacial thoracic business in conjunction with rapid adoption of Persona OsseoTi, that is our cementless platform, which is quickly gaining share in the markets where we have launched the product. \n As we enter the second half of 2024, these new product introductions as well as other new product entries will become more meaningful from a revenue growth standpoint with Persona OsseoTi entering then a full launch status, seeing higher realization of HAMMR or surgical Impactor, which we recently launched and also gaining traction with ROSA Shoulder, which we started doing cases recently here in the U.S. \n On top of that, we're going to be entering the market with our triple-taper hip stem, that's Z1, which is going to allow us to better compete in the direct anterior hip category. So really excited about the completed portfolio in hips and the upcoming launch, FDA approved now for Z1 hip stem. \n In addition to driving successful 2024 annual results, we are committed to the 3 strategic priorities that I outlined in my first earnings call as the CEO in November 2023. This, no doubt, will enable long-term success for the organization. I continue to repeat these 3 priorities over and over at every Zimmer Biomet meeting around the world. And I can tell you that they are resonating with the audience as the absolute must do's for the long-term success of the organization. \n Once again, these 3 imperatives are people and culture, number one; operational excellence, number 2; and innovation and diversification number 3. I would like now to quickly provide you with an update in terms of key progress across these 3 areas. Further detail will come during our May 29 Investor Day in New York City. \n First, in the area of people and culture, we continue to operate Zimmer Biomet with best-in-class engagement metrics and low employee attrition. We have been recognized across different areas when it comes to people and culture. And recently, we've been showcased in various publications, including Newsweek, Great Places to Work and Forbes. In the area of people and culture, it's worth noting also that our restructuring program, which we announced a quarter ago, has now been implemented almost entirely with no major disruptions to report. \n We have realized substantial benefits post this initiative, including realizing cost savings earlier than initially expected as well as achieving increased operational agility and enhance accountability. \n In the second area of operational excellence, we've made robust progress in implementing our enhanced inventory management programs around the world. Working intensely with third-party firms, we develop a plan we're executing against the plan. We remain committed to a meaningful improvement in DOH in the year 2024 and in years to come. Again, more color in that regard during our Investor Day. \n In operational excellence, we have also established core initiatives around best-in-class product launches to ensure that these new product introductions gained traction sooner than expected and we launched these products in a better way than we have launched in the past. This is beyond critical for Zimmer Biomet as we continue to deliver a rapid cadence of product launches with plans to release more than 40 new products in the next 24 to 36 months. One final comment in operational excellence in the area of pricing, we've made structural changes to further enhance the pricing strategy that we put in place over the last several quarters. \n Moving on to the third and final strategic priority. In the area of innovation and diversification, we're making solid progress. We continue to see strong traction in key brands such as Persona OsseoTi. I mentioned already gaining share in the markets where we have launched. We've seen progress with ROSA. We continue to gain momentum with Signature ONE planning guides in the shoulder space, and we love what we're seeing with our Embody soft tissue franchise. CMFT continues to deliver new product introductions, gaining share in the markets where we partake. And I'm very excited about the new product introductions that we have seen and we'll continue to see in our ASC portfolio in the U.S. \n We've also made tremendous strides in new products with a more focused pipeline that today as of Q1 2024, has twice the dollar value that we had at the end of 2018. So the dollar value of the pipeline in innovation is twice what it was 4 or 5 years ago. Worth reminding everyone that north of 80% of these products in the pipeline, residing markets growing above 4%, and many of them are accretive from a gross margin standpoint. So we continue our commitment of innovating from a customer-centric standpoint, but also innovating to see incremental profitability and an increased WAMGR profile. \n In addition to driving results in core markets, we're also focused on diversifying our portfolio into more attractive, faster-growth end markets with the goal of increasing our WAMGR, Weighted Average Market Growth Rate. We have made significant progress over the past several years, balance it  through what it is today. And this fact in addition to the confidence around future free cash flow generation, give us the optionality and the firepower to execute on the right deals at the right time, the most importantly, meet our internal hurdles from both a financial and a strategic perspective. \n So again, lots going on inorganically potentially as well as organically with the size of the pipeline. While we have flexibility in the size of the deals to come, we continue to favor the smaller tuck-ins to midsize deals. That's up to $2 billion in acquisition price that become EPS neutral within 2 years and that from a ROIC standpoint, return on invested capital, will deliver upper single digit to low double digit within 5 years. \n As I mentioned earlier, we're very encouraged with our Q1 performance, a quarter in where we grew 4.4% in constant currency, north of 6% in day rate while overcoming a number of head winds and tough comps. It is this quarter results from the first quarter 2024 that give us a strong confidence that in the year 2024, we will realize our guidance of delivering 5% to 6% in revenue, growing 100 to 200 basis points above market while delivering earnings growing faster than revenue and delivering free cash flow above the earnings growth. \n This is the commitment that we're making for 2024, and it's a commitment that we're going to reiterate in our Investor Day for years to come. Before closing the call, I'd like to announce that Keri Mattox has made a decision to depart from Zimmer Biomet at the end of May. Keri has been a trusted partner and a very close collaborator and friend on this journey and has enabled great things for Zimmer Biomet in her 4-plus years here with ZB. She's going to be missed, and we wish her the best in her future endeavors. A search for a Head of IR position is in progress with a leading executive search firm, and we hope to announce Keri's replacement here very soon. Zach is going to continue to lead IR interactions for Zimmer Biomet. So a plan for continuity is in place. \n In conclusion, we're very proud of how far we have come as an organization and are even more excited about where we can go. Strong confidence on the year 2024. We continue to make commitments and deliver on those commitments as evidenced by these results and as evidenced by the new product introductions commitment that we made and we're realizing. I love the fact that we are impacting the lives of millions of patients around the globe, and I'm inspired by the fact that my team mates are living the Zimmer Biomet mission of alleviating pain and improving the quality of life for people around the world. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Suky. Suky? Travis, Ivan here. Thanks for the question. I'll touch on both components of your question, and I'll make sure that Suky speaks up here as well. So starting with the algorithm on revenue, EPS and free cash flow. We're going to give more color in the Investor Day, but I will tell you today, as per the prepared remarks, this is a long-term commitment. So it's not a 2024 only deliver revenue above market, EPS above revenue and free cash flow above EPS growth. And unpacking the drivers here on revenue, it's all about new product introductions. We're going to gain share by delivering innovation that matters. 100 to 200 basis points, largely is going to come from new product introductions. And as we said all along, we got a pipeline that we didn't have before, 40 new product introductions over the next 24 to 36 months, more in the making. So that's the #1 driver on revenue in addition to obviously pricing dynamics and commercial execution. \n On EPS growth, we're doing things differently when it comes to margin, I already mentioned pricing, but other components, how we think about inventory in excess and obsolescence, how we think about allocation of OpEx, where we get the greatest return, et cetera, et cetera. And the free cash flow, the main driver is the fact that we have run this company in quite an inefficient way when it comes to inventory management. North of 400 days on hand when it comes to inventory, not really engaging on prioritization of geographies. Portfolio management is not what it needs to be. So those are the key drivers on the sustainability. \n I'll touch on #2, and then I'll give it to Suky. In terms of Q1 to Q2 to Q3 to Q4, what happens sequentially. Look, we're not going to get into the gymnastics on what happens quarter-over-quarter, all kinds of timing 1 quarter to the other. We call --  we're having similar conversations in Q4. Here is what I'd leave you with. Q1 was very strong. A 4.4% growth in constant currency, north of 6% in day rate. \n As we see here, looking at the year, we were confident at the very beginning of the year in the guidance of 5% to 6%, a quarter behind, we're extremely confident on the guidance. The growth drivers that get us there are working in the right direction. So very, very confident, very proud of Q1. And again, we'll talk more about the dynamics at Investor Day. Suky?(43:40) Yes. We're very -- Steve, thank you. We're very pleased, obviously, with pricing performance. Recall that in 2023, the second semester of '23, so the last half of '23, we're already flattish when it comes to price. So this is a business that in previous years was having 300 to 500 basis points of price erosion in the U.S., pretty significant OUS. That's not the change that we have going on. We put a structure in place. We put governance, new product introductions are helping from a category contracting. \n I wouldn't say there's any real surprises. Europe may be doing slightly better than anticipated. You've got all kinds of [ tender ] dynamics that come in and out. But net-net, we are at a point where it is pretty predictable. We like the strategy in place. We like the governance. We're not going to commit here to doing dramatically better, but no real surprises, only Q1 and a great outlook for the rest of the year. Suky, do you have any other comments? Yes. Thank you. Obviously, very excited in terms of this product launch. We did the first cases at the Mayo Clinic a couple of weeks ago. Feedback was very solid. It is a product that has a high degree of accuracy in the cuts in the visibility of anatomy. It is efficient from an instrumentation standpoint. It's fully interconnected with the rest of the CVH ecosystem. Case over case, the feedback was that you do achieve time efficiencies. So the learning curve is rather short. \n So very solid clinical feedback. In terms of the impact, we said all along that we're going to take it slowly in the first, call it, 90 to 120 days. And you will see the real impact as we get closer to the end of the year. But a very meaningful product launch for the company. I'm very excited about it. Thanks, Steve. Yes. No, we'll definitely cover the -- how we plan to achieve these 3 commitments we're making from a financial perspective in terms of what are the drivers of revenue, EPS and free cash flow. So we'll definitely provide those details. We'll cover the new product introductions, we've seen that. We'll talk about the capital allocation on the strategy moving forward. So it's going to be very robust. So that's the Analyst Day. Thank you, Rick. I'll cover the Hip question, and then we'll proceed with the interrogation of Suky here when it comes to the margin. One product is not -- one product is not what's going to win the battle here, right? It is a category of products. We've been very transparent. We've not done great when it comes to hips over the last 3 or 5 years and essentially driven by 3 product categories.\n The first one is a direct anterior stem what is not in the market as a triple taper stem and it was a deficiency that we had. Z1 solves that and it does in a differentiated way. So now with this 510(k) approval, we compete with the 2 other large orthopedic companies in direct anterior.\n The second category was a surgical impactor. It drives efficiency, it drives accuracy in how you treat the cases. It integrates with the rest of the procedure. You need certain levels of power as you do in that hip surgery. So there is a surgical impactor and we have that with HAMMR, fully launched, we're going to run that up. And the first thing that we needed was to have navigation.\n We got true modalities navigation. Obviously, we've got ROSA Hip. We are the only company with a 510(k) FDA approved Mixed Reality Technology in our partnership with HipInsight. So again, it's not just Z1, it's the full portfolio. Direct anterior stems, surgical impactors and some sort of navigation. So I do believe and we do believe with a high degree of confidence that we're going to regain our old position in hips. We still remain the #1 hip company in the world, and I think that this portfolio accelerates our growth journey moving forward. Absolutely. Thanks for the question. So let's start with the global picture, if you will, very excited in terms of where we are overall with ROSA. So globally, ROSA is becoming the preferred robotic option in many markets outside of the U.S. Here in the U.S., we're approaching around 20% penetration of ROSA in cases.\n As you saw in the quarter, we had a large amount of ROSA sales, which is encouraging because that means in the other category, that's encouraging because that's a future stream of net pull-through. About 1/3 of all the installs that we do in the U.S. go to an ASC environment, which, again, is not a surprise given the fact that ROSA does drive easier preplanning. You don't need to do a CT scan. It is very surgeon center, so it's very controllable. And we continue to see that there is a high degree of preference for ROSA in those higher volume accounts.\n So net-net, everything in the right direction in terms of penetration, where we are gaining traction in key markets around the world and a lot of the dynamic that we're seeing here in the U.S. ambulatory surgical center environment. So we're starting to see a dynamic in where cases are moving to the ASC for shoulders, getting the CMS change. I would say today, probably around 60% to 65% of the cases of shoulder are now done in ASC, but that's moving pretty rapidly, given the change of reimbursement. And we've got a strong position both in the inpatient, outpatient as well as the ASC. But I would say net-net, is around 60%, 65% to 35% in terms of that mix. Yes. Thank you, Caitlin. It's moving in the right direction. I will say, as of late, things are accelerating, both from an innovation and a commercial execution standpoint. So on innovation, we did receive recently the 510(k) approval for -- didn't make it to the press release for the study. So as the shorter stem version of Persona IQ, which has been a gating factor for some surgeons that don't use the longer stem. So that's an innovation and they are right there.\n The other piece that is gaining traction is the launch of what we call recovery curves. This is a platform that only Persona IQ has. Interconnects the data of the TAM with a dashboard that in a very objective way, can quantify how patients are doing in comparison to other patients with similar dynamics. So those are 2 innovation updates that are more in the right direction.\n In terms of the execution and commercial journey, we got what we need. We got the right designs. We've been talking about value proposition. It's been resonating. We are in some of the largest teaching institutions, and we continue to be committed to the journey. So very excited about Persona IQ. Thank you for the question. No. We definitely are upgraded, if you will, some or for cementless -- legacy cementless platform over to Persona OsseoTi but at the same time, a sizable amount of the business coming from converting accounts. So you've seen that the U.S. knee number in the quarter was strong and a large component of that was the fact with pretty heavy comps, by the way, comes from the introduction of Persona OsseoTi and the expectation is that as we continue to move into the acceleration of the product launch, we're going to continue to gain share. So it's both existing accounts and new accounts. Yes. We always have a robust pipeline. And we'll talk about the pipeline and the optionality of M&A in more depth once we meet in later in the month. But the same 3 key areas apply. We're looking for assets that are mission-centric from a strategic standpoint, fit in the higher-growth segments of Recon, certainly the high growth segments of S.E.T. as a category and then in the ASC space, which is a mixture of both 1 and 2. So we later focus on those 3 key areas while also keeping an eye on broader diversification.\n Financially, nothing has changed. We have flexibility to do larger deals, but we like deals where the acquisition price is under $2 billion. We definitely want to be neutral from an EPS standpoint within 2 years and then high single-digit ROIC to double-digit ROIC in the 5-year time horizon. So very clear on strategic and financial filters and the optionality is there and the pipeline is there. So more to come once we meet in New York. Yes. Thank you, Chris. First of all, I wouldn't categorize our performance being below market. And we're going to have a healthy debate on whether it's above or below. But what I will tell you is that when we stay here right now, it is not below market. Certainly not from a training standpoint over a period of time and now that everyone is reported in Q1, we're not below market. So I'll start with that.\n In terms of how we get to the 5% to 6%, I think the formula continues to be product introductions, which will ramp up later in the year and even more product introductions as we get into 2025. We've never had 5.5, almost 6 years here with the company, I've never seen a poor portfolio. I mentioned earlier that we don't have any gaps in hips with the introductions that we have done in Knees, there's 0 gaps.\n I'm excited about the upcoming product launches in Europe. Let's not forget, we don't have Persona revision in EMEA. That's an almost $2 billion product here in the U.S., $2 billion over the last 4 -- 3, 4 years in gross sales. And let's not forget, we also bring in Oxford Partial Cementless from Europe here to the U.S. So strength in the knee portfolio, strengths in the hip portfolio.\n You've seen that S.E.T. we made a commitment that S.E.T as a category will grow mid-single digit or above. It's the third consecutive quarter where we're seeing that. And that's going to stay around. So I would say, strength in innovation, the strength in commercial execution and the 5% to 6% to us is an admissible commitment. Absolutely. So closing the Q1 quarter approaching 20%. So it's fairly similar to robotics. So cementless is approaching 20%. We'll break down some of these commitments, we keep repeating the same answer at the Investor Day. But our expectation, our ambition is to be where our competitors are, 60% 6-0. We'll provide time lines in that regard, but the north star is to have robotic penetration in the 60% range and cementless penetration in the 60%. So the fact that today we're at 20%, that tells you that there is pretty significant upside, and we're excited about the journey. So starting with robots and capital dynamics. Look, I will tell you one thing that is pretty prevalent is that here in the U.S., we've seen the cases move today, I see not a week goes by that is not a new ASC opening. And those ASCs do want to acquire robotics and you either install or you purchase it. And we saw a dynamic in Q1 where we saw more purchases.\n We do believe this is driven by ASC dynamics. Capital continues to be strong across key markets. So definitely not a gating factor. And again, as I mentioned early, excited about the continuity here. In terms of your second question on M&A, look, we want to be bigger and bolder, at the same time, we don't want to be reckless. And I will say that all along. So we're going to stick to the strategic and financial thresholds. We got the pipeline, we got the money. And when it is time to act, we'll act on it. And we're not going to take the past as an indicator of how we're going to do things in the present and future.\n The breakdown on the WAMGR, we'll cover that as well once we get into the Investor Day. And it is a combination of organic and inorganic means. So we'll talk about the pipeline. I already mentioned -- we already mentioned that 80%, if not 90% of the new products in the pipeline are in markets that are growing above 4%, in some cases above 5%. So that's definitely a driver and then the combination of tuck-in deals and maybe some bolder moves will get us to the WAMGR that we deserve. So more to come in that regard. Thanks for the question.\n I think we come in to the end of the call. So I'm just going to briefly close with closing comments. I will start by saying that it's great to be here at home in Warsaw, Indiana today to celebrate our Founder's Day. So May 2, 1927, we started the company with a very clear purpose to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life for people around the world. So 97 years later, I just can say that we're just getting started. So excited to see where we are as a company.\n It's an exciting time to be at Zimmer Biomet. The portfolio is where it needs to be. We have strong commercial execution. We are very, very confident on our guidance for the year 2024. We are excited about what is to come in '25 and '26 once we are able to discuss the long-range plan. So that is seen by confidence and excitement.\n And before closing, I want to thank Keri for 4.5 great years with us. You've been a trusted partner, a great friend. You're going to be missed, although I'm going to continue to call you and seek your advice in many, many years to come. So thank you, Keri, and thanks, everybody."
